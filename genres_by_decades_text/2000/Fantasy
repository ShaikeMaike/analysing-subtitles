Aah!
Wee-be-be-bee.
Will you take a look at that?
Pretty pathetic, huh?
Well, you'll never believe this, but that llama you're looking at was once a human being
And not just any human being
That guy was an emperor
A rich, powerful ball of charisma
Oh, yeah!
This is his story
Well, actually my story
That's right--
I'm that llama
The name is Kuzco
Emperor Kuzco
I was the world's nicest guy, and they ruined my life for no reason
Oh, is that hard to believe?
Look, I tell you what
You go back away-- you know, before
I was a llama, and this will all make sense
All right, now see, that's a little too far back
Oh, ho! Look at me!
That's me as a baby
Waah!
Ahem! All right, let' smove ahead
Oh, yeah.
Theme song guy: There are despots and dictators
Political manipulators
There are blue bloods with the intellects of fleas
There are kings and catty tyrants
Who are so lacking in refinements
They'd be better suited swinging from the trees
He was born and raised to rule
No one has ever been as cool
In a thousand years of aristocracy
An enigma and a mystery
In Mesoamerican history
The quintessence of perfection that is he
Ok, this is the real me
Not this
- This
- Not this.
- Winner!
- Loser.
Ok, see this palace?
Everyone in it is at my command
Check this out
Butler.
Chef.
Theme song guy.
Oh, yeah!
He's the sovereign lord of the nation
He's the hippest cat in creation
He's the alpha, the omega, A to Z
And this perfect world will spin
Around his every little whim
'Cause this perfect world begins and ends with
Me.
What's his name?
Kuzco
That's his name
Kuzco
He's the king of the world
Kuzco
Is he hip or what?
Kuzco
Yeah
Gow!
You threw off my groove!
I'm sorry, but you've thrown off the emperor's groove.
Sorry!
You were saying?
What's his name?
Kuzco
Kuzco
That's his name
Is he hip or what?
Don't you know he's the king of the world?
Whoa, yeah
Oww!
Ha!
Boom, baby!
Aah! Your Highness, it is time for you to choose your bride.
Allrighty
Trot out the ladies
Let's take a look-see.
Hate your hair.
Not likely.
Yikes, yikes, yikes, and let me guess.
You have a great personality.
Is this really the best you could do?
Oh, yes. Oh, no.
I mean, perhaps--
What is he babbling about?
He's like the thing that wouldn't shut up
Anyway, still wondering about that llama in the opening?
Well, let me show you the people responsible for ruining my life
First, there's Pacha
Uh, excuse me.
I'm here to see
Emperor Kuzco.
You see,
I got this summons--
Inside, up the stairs, and to the left
Just follow the signs
Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.
Uh, and don't be fooled by the folksy peasant look
Oh!
Pardon me
That's mine
Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Aah! Oh, hey.
Are you all right?
Here. Let me, uh--
Oh, you're so very kind.
What happened?
Well, I...
I threw off the emperor's groove.
- What?
- His groove!
The rhythm in which he lives his life, his pattern of behavior.
I threw it off, and the emperor had me thrown out the window.
Oh, really?
I'm supposed to see him today.
Don't throw off his groove!
Oh, ok.
Beware the groove.
Hey, are you gonna be all right?
Groove.
Kuzco: You see what I mean?
This guy's trouble, but as bad as he is, he is nothing compared to what's coming up next
And why have you come here today?
Well
Your Highness--
I mean, Your Grace.
Ok, gang
Check out this piece of work
This is Yzma, the emperor's advisor-- living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth
And let's not forget
Yzma's right-hand man
Every decade or so she gets a new one
This year's model is called Kronk
Yeah, I got that there, Yzma.
Unh!
Yep, that's Kronk
Now lately, Yzma's gotten into this bad habit of trying to run the country behind my back, and I’m thinkin' that's got to stop
It is no concern of mine whether your family has...
What was it again?
Um, food.
Ha! You really should have thought of that before you became peasants.
We're through here.
Take him away. Next!
But l--
Oh, ok.
Ugh.
The nerve of some of those peasants, huh?
Tell me about it.
Aah!
Hi there.
Ooh, Your Highness.
Ahem.
Oh, oh, oh, ha ha ha. Um...
Uh, you were doing it again.
Doing? Doing...
Doing what?
Doing my job.
I'm the emperor, and you're the emperor's advisor.
Remember that?
But, Your Highness,
I was only dealing with meaningless peasant matters.
Whoa
Look at these wrinkles
What is holding this woman together?
What the--
How long has that been there?
Good thinkin', Yzma
What do you say,
Kuzco?
Whoa! No touchy!
No touchy.
No touch.
Excuse me,
Your Highness
The village leader is here to see you.
Oh, great.
Send him in.
Oh, and by the way, you're fired.
Fired?
W-W-What do you mean, fired?
Um, how else can I say it?
You're being let go, your department's being downsized, you're part of an outplacement, we're going in a different direction, we're not picking up your option...
Take your pick.
I got more.
But l-- You--uh--
Uhh.
But--
But, Your Highness,
I have been nothing if not loyal to the empire for--for--for many, many years.
Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride.
You just hit yours
50 years ago.
So...who's in my chair?
Oh, oh! I know!
Yzma.
Yzma's in your chair, right?
Very good, Kronk.
Here. Get the snack.
Got it!
Unh! Oof!.
Ok, you heard the man.
Up, up, up.
I’m ok
I'm fine
Ah. ok. Show him in.
Ahem.
Uh, afternoon,
Your Highness.
I'm here because
I received a summons--
Hey, there he is!
My main village man.
Um, Pacha.
Anyway, I got this summons--
Pacha.
That's right.
You are just the man
I wanted to see.
I am?
Word on the street is you can fix my problem.
You can fix my problem, can't you?
Sure.
I'll do what I can.
Good, good. That's just what I wanted to hear.
Are you aware of just how important your village is to the empire?
Well, I know we grow the crops that you use here at the palace.
We also herd the llamas that you--
My village?
Oh, yeah.
You got a pretty sweet little setup there on top of that hill, don't you? Ha ha ha!
Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop for the last
6 generations.
Uh-huh.
So tell me, where do you find you get the most sun?
Oh, I'd say just on the other side of those trees.
When the sun hits that ridge just right, these hills sing.
Well, that settles it.
Really?
Yep. Problem solved.
Thanks for coming.
That's it?
That's all you wanted me for?
I just needed an insider's opinion before I ok'd this spot for my pool.
Uh...your pool?
Boo-yah!
Welcome to
Kuzcotopia, my ultimate summer getaway complete with water slide.
What?
Isn't it great?
It's my birthday gift to me. Ha!
I'm so happy.
Uh...uh... um...l don't understand how this could happen.
Well, let me clear it up for you.
At my birthday celebration tomorrow,
I give the word, and your town will be destroyed to make way for this...
So, if I were you,
I'd pick up some change-of-address forms on the way home.
But, um, where will we live?
Hmm...
Don't know, don't care.
How's that?
Oh, but wait.
You can't--
When I give the word, your little town thingy will be bye-bye.
Bye-bye!
Oh, w--wait. No--
Heh heh. Boohoo.
Oh, yeah
Everything was goin' my way
Or so I thought
He can't get rid of me that easily.
Who does that ungrateful little worm think he is?
Does he...
A little to the left.
...have any idea of who he's dealing with?
How could he do this to me?
Why, I practically raised him.
Yeah, you think he would've turned out better.
Yeah, go figure.
Well, it's better you're takin' out your anger on these things instead of the real Kuzco, huh?
That's it, Kronk!
- That's it!
I'll get rid of Kuzco.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
The real Kuzco?
Of course the real Kuzco.
Don't you see?
It's perfect.
With him out of the way and no heir to the throne,
I'll take over and rule the empire.
Brilliant!
So how does that work with you bein' fired and all?
The only ones who know about that are the three of us, soon to be the two of us.
And I'm one of those two, right?
To the secret lab!
Pull the lever, Kronk.
Wrong lever!
Huh?
Why do we even have that lever?
Get out of my way!
Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times
Whee!
Faster, faster!
Yzma, put your hands in the air!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Ah, how shall I do it?
Oh, I know.
I'll turn him into a flea, a harmless little flea, and then I'll put that flea in a box, and then I'll put that box inside of another box, and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives,
Ah ha ha ha!
I'll smash it with a hammer!
It's brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, I tell you!
Genius, I say!
Or, to save on postage,
I'll just poison him with this.
Take it, Kronk.
Oh ho ho ho.
Feel the power.
Oh...
I can feel it.
Our moment of triumph approaches.
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!
It's dinner time.
So...is everything ready for tonight?
Oh, yeah. I thought we'd start off with soup and a light salad and then see how we feel after that.
Not the dinner...
The you know.
Oh, right.
The poison--
The poison for Kuzco, the poison chosen specially to kill Kuzco,
Kuzco's poison.
That poison?
Yes! That poison.
Got you covered.
Excellent.
A few drops in his drink, then I'll propose a toast, and he will be dead before dessert.
Which is a real shame, because it's gonna be delicious.
Boom, bam, baby!
Let's get to the grub
I am one hungry king of the world.
So...no hard feelings about being let go?
None whatsoever.
Kronk, get the emperor a drink.
Drink. Right.
Your Highness.
Is something burning?
My spinach puffs!
Ahem.
So... he seems... nice.
Heh. He is.
He's what, in his late twenties?
Heh heh. I'm not sure.
Saved 'em!
- That's great.
- Yzma: Great!
- Good job.
- Very good job.
Watch it.
They're still hot.
Ahem.
Ahem!
Heh heh heh.
Kronk.
The emperor needs his... drink.
Right. Oh. Right.
Hey, Kronky, everything ok back there?
Well, heh.
Oh, uh...
Ooh. The drinks were a bit on the... hmm... oh...ugh...warm side.
Heh heh.
Hey, did you see that sky today?
Talk about blue.
Ha ha ha.
Yes, Kronk.
Riveting.
A toast to the emperor!
Long live Kuzco!
Don't drink the wine.
Poison.
Ah! Tasty.
Finally!
Ha ha ha!
Good work,
Kronk.
Oh, they're so easy to make.
I'll get you the recipe.
Now to get rid of the body.
Ok! What were we saying?
Uh...we were just making a toast
Yzma: to your long and healthy rule
Right. So what are you gonna do?
I mean, you've been around here a long time, and I really mean a long time. Um...
Ahem.
It might be difficult for someone of your age adjusting to life in the private sector.
Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal?
Be a friend? Heh heh.
Now, about you finding new work
Hit him on the head. that's--that's gonna be tough
More broccoli?
Because you're you know
Let's face it
You're no spring chicken, and I mean that in the best possible way.
What? A llama?
He's supposed to be dead!
Yeah, weird.
Let me see that vial.
This isn't poison.
This is extract of llama. Ugh!
You know, in my defense, your poisons all look alike.
You might think about re labeling some of them.
Take him out of town and finish the job now!
What about dinner?
Kronk, this is kind of important.
How about dessert?
Well, I suppose there's time for dessert.
And coffee?
All right.
A quick cup of coffee.
Then take him out of town and finish the job!
Cha cha cha cha
Guess where I am right now
Uh-huh. In the bag
Still think I'm not the victim here?
Watch. It gets better.
Hey! Ba-da ba-da ba-da-da
Ugh, he's doing his own theme music?
Ba-da ba-da ba-da ba
Ba-da-ba
Gig, dumb, and tone deaf
I am so glad I was unconscious for all of this
Huhh!
Mission accomplished.
You're not just gonna let him die like that, are you?
My shoulder angel.
Don't listen to that guy
He's trying to lead you down the path of righteousness.
I'm gonna lead you down the path that rocks.
Oh, come off it.
You come off it!
- You.
- You.
- You.
- You infinity.
Uhh!
Listen up, big guy.
I got 3 good reasons why you should just walk away.
" Number one..."
Look at that guy!
He's got that sissy stringy music thing.
We've been through this.
It's a harp, and you know it.
Oh, right.
That's a harp... and that's a dress.
Robe!
Reason number 2.
Look what
I can do.
Ha ha ha!
But... what does that have to do with anything?
No, no.
He's got a point.
Listen, you guys.
You're sort of confusing me, so be gone!
Uh, or, uh, you know.
However I get rid of you guys.
That'll work.
Um, what's with the chimp and the bug?
Can we get back tome?
Oh, boy.
Think, think, think.
What to do, what to do?
What do we do with the body?
What am I gonna tell the village?
Come on, Kronky.
Come on, Kronky. ok.
What do I do? What do I do?
- Aah!
Back!
Elbow! Shoulder!
- Unh!
Oh. Hey! Hey, you!
Hey!
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Stop! Pardon me. Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
Comin' through.
Hey, you with the cart!
Uh-oh
This is not good.
Uhh. Hope that doesn't come back to haunt me.
Mom, Mom!
I think I'm still growing!
Measure me again!
Ha!
All right, Tipo.
Stand still and let's see.
Mom, you and I both know that it's impossible for him to have grown in the last 5 minutes.
Mmm! Mmm!
Isn't it?
Look how much you've grown!
What? Tipo, get out of the way.
It's my turn again.
Measure me.
Dad's home!
Hey, ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Come here
Ha ha ha!
Dad! I ate a bug today!
Oh! Was Mom baking again?
Heh. Don't tell her
I said that.
I heard that.
Ok, everybody, move aside
Lady with a baby comin' through.
Dad, Dad, Dad!
Look at how big I am!
We were all measured today.
Oh.
I'm going through a growth spurt.
I'm as big as you were when you were me.
Mm-hmm. Sure are.
That's not as impressive as my loose tooth. See?
Ok, ok, you two.
Our deal was that you could stay awake until Daddy came home.
Now say good night.
Dad, do we have to?
No, you two can stay up.
We're just gonna be sittin' here tellin' each other how much we love each other.
Right, honey?
- Ew!
- Blecch!
Good night.
So what did the emperor want?
Ahem.
You know what?
He couldn't see me.
Couldn't see you?
- Why not?
- I don't know.
Well, that's just rude.
Well, he is the emperor.
I'm sure he's busy.
No, no, no, no. No.
Emperor or no emperor, it's called common courtesy.
Honey...
If that were me,
I'd march right back there and demand to see him, and you know I would.
Sweetie, sweetie, think of the baby.
Pacha, I'm fine.
This baby's not coming for a while, but even if it was,
I'd give that guy a piece of my mind.
That kind of behavior just--just--
Uhh!
I gotta go wash something.
Pacha?
You ok?
Hmm?
Oh, yeah. I'm just a little tired from the trip.
Um...I’m gonna go put Misty away.
Uh, heh heh. Hi.
Excuse me.
2 seconds here.
Um, I'm the one in the cart. Remember?
This story's about me, not him. ok. You got it?
All right.
We're gonna move ahead.
Sorry to slow you down.
Heh heh heh.
Huh?
Whoa.
Uhh. Oh.
Where'd you come from, little guy?
No touchy.
Aah! Demon llama!
Demon llama? Where?
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Ooh hoo hoo!
Ow! Ow, my head.
Ok, demon llama.
Just take it easy.
I mean you no harm.
What are you talking about--
Oh, wait. I know you.
You're that whiny peasant.
Emperor Kuzco?
Yeah. Who do you think you were talkin' to?
Uh...how did--
Um... you don't... look like the emperor.
What do you mean I don't look like the emperor?
Uh...oh... do this...
What is this, some kind of little game you country folk like to--
Aah! It can't be! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
My face! Aah! My beautiful, beautiful face!
Ok, ok, ok.
I'm an ugly, stinky llama!
Wait, ok,
Your Majesty.
- Llama face!
- Shh!
What happened?
I'm tryin' to figure that out, ok?
Ohh-ho!
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.
Wait a minute.
I remember you.
I remember telling you that I was building my pool where your house was, and then you got mad at me.
Ohh!
And you turned me into a llama!
What? No, I did not.
Yes, and then you kidnapped me.
Why would I kidnap a llama?
I have no idea.
You're the criminal mastermind, not me.
What?
Hmm. You're right.
That's giving you way too much credit. ok. I have to get back to the palace.
Yzma's got that "secret lab."
I'll just snap my fingers and order her to change me back.
Hey, you.
No time to waste.
Let's go.
Hey, tiny, I want to get out of this body.
Wouldn't you?
Now let's go.
Build your summerhouse somewhere else.
You want to run that by me again?
I can't let you go back unless you change your mind and build your summer home somewhere else.
Hmm. I got a little secret for you.
Come here.
No, closer.
I don't make deals with peasants!
Then I guess I can't take you back.
Fine.
I don't need you.
I can find my own way back.
I wouldn't recommend it.
It's a little dangerous if you don't know the way.
Nice try, pal.
No, really.
I'm telling you,
There are jaguars and snakes and quicksand
I'm not listening.
I'm not kidding.
Listen, you cannot go in there.
La la la la
Oh. Heh heh.
Still not listening.
Aw, you...
Fine. Fine.
Go ahead!
If there's no Kuzco, there's no Kuzcotopia.
Takes care of my problem.
Hmm.
Scary jungle.
Right.
Ooh, a leaf.
Ooh, it might attack me.
Oh, it's a scary tree.
I'm afraid. Ha ha.
Please. Never find my way?
I'm the emperor, and as such,
I'm born with an innate sense of direction.
Ok, where am I?
Wha--
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Uhh.
Too late.
Ok, that was the freakiest thing I've ever seen.
Aah!
Hmm.
What do you want?
Oh, for me?
Why, I don't know what to say.
Ow!
Hit the road, bucky.
Aah! Ow!
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Uh-oh.
No, no.
No, no, no, no.
No, no.
No, don't.
Ha!
Aah!
No!
Aah!
Aah!
You killer jaguars...
Whoa!
Aah-eee!
Aah!
Aah!
Yee-aah!
Aah!
Don't worry,
Your Highness. I gotcha.
You're safe now.
Maybe I'm just new to this whole rescuing thing, but this, to me, might be considered kind of a step backwards, wouldn't you say?
No, no, no.
It's--It's ok.
This--This is all right.
We can figure this out.
I hate you.
- No!
- Yaah!
Aah! Ow!
Whoo hoo hoo!
Aah!
Ow!
Ow!
Uhh!
I don't know about you, but I'm getting all funned out.
Uh-oh.
Don't tell me.
We're about to go over a huge waterfall.
- Yep.
- Sharp rocks at the bottom?
Most likely.
Bring it on.
Boo-yah!
Whoo!
Your Highness.
Your Highness, can you hear me?
Oh, boy.
Come on, breathe.
Breathe!
Ohh. Why me?
Ooh!
All right.
- Ohh!
- Aah!
- Ohh!
- Ohh!
For the last time, it was not a kiss.
Well, whatever you call it... it was disgusting.
And if you would've done what I ordered you to do in the first place, we all could've been spared your little kiss of life.
Aw!
But now that you're here, you will take me back to the palace.
I'll have Yzma change me back, and then I'll start construction on Kuzcotopia.
Oh, yeah.
Ok, now, look,
I think we got off on the wrong foot here.
Mm-hmm.
I just think if you really thought about it, you'd decide to build your home on a different hilltop.
And why would I do that?
Because... deep down,
I think you'll realize that you're forcing an entire village out of their homes just for you.
And that's... bad?
Well, yeah.
Nobody's that heartless.
Mmm.
Now take me back.
What?
Wait, wait.
How can you be this way?
All you care about is building your summer home and filling it with stuff for you.
Uh, yeah. Doh.
Me.
Everyone else in the kingdom gets it.
You're the only one that doesn't seem to be with the program, eh, Pacha?
You know what?
Someday, you're going to wind up all alone, and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.
Thanks for that.
I'll log that away.
Now, for the final time,
I order you to take me back to the palace.
Looks to me like you're stuck out here, because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.
Because unless you change your mind,
I'm not taking you back.
Me, me, me.
Moo, moo, moo.
Huh? What?
I didn't do anything.
I didn't--
Somebody's throwing stuff.
You going to build a fire or what? What's going on?
He's never going to change his mind.
Ohh. How am I ever going to get out of here?
And so, it is with great sadness that we mourn the sudden departure of our beloved prince... taken from us so tragically on the very eve of his 18th birthday.
Poor little guy.
His legacy will live on in our hearts...
He never had a chance. for all eternity.
Well, he ain't gettin' any deader.
Back to work.
Kronk, darlin',
I must admit you had me worried when you mixed up those poisons, but now that
Kuzco is dead, all is forgiven.
Ah. Oh, yeah, yeah.
He's...
Heh. He's dead, all right. Heh heh.
I mean, you can't get much deader than he-- than he is right now.
Unless, of course, we killed him again.
I suppose.
Hey, look, the royal dresser's here.
Kronk...
I should tell you right now
I'm kind of hard to fit.
Kronk...
I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.
Kuzco is dead, right?
Tell me Kuzco's dead.
I need to hear these words.
Do you need to hear all those words exactly?
He's still alive?
Well, he's not as dead as we would've hoped.
Kronk...
I just thought
I'd give you the heads-up in case Kuzco ever came back.
He can't come back!
Yeah. That would be kind of awkward-- especially after that lovely eulogy.
You think?
You and I are going out to find him.
If he talks, we are through!
Now let's move!
Dad, look out!
Tipo, what is it?
I had a dream that
Dad was tied to a log and was careening out of control down a raging river of death!
All right, all right, it's ok.
- It was awful!
- Shh!
It's ok, it's ok.
Tipo, calm down.
It was just a dream.
Your dad's fine.
He just went back to see the emperor.
Oh. Like you told him to,
'cause you're always right.
That's right.
Well, in my dream,
Dad had to kiss a llama.
Yeah, like that would ever happen.
- It could.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh.
Yeah-huh.
Good night, you two.
- Night, Mom!
- Night, Mom!
- Yeah-huh. Yeah-huh.
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.
Ooh!
B-B-Brr!
Uh, hey
Thanks.
Oh.
No problem.
Feels like wool.
Yeah.
Alpaca?
Oh, yeah, it is.
Oh, yeah,
I thought so.
It's nice.
My wife made it.
Oh, she knits?
Crochets.
Crochets?
Nice.
Thanks.
So...
So, I was thinking that when I got back to the city, we'd, uh...
I mean, there's lots of hilltops, and maybe I might, you know...
I--I might...
Are you saying... you've changed your mind?
Oh, well, l--I...
Because you know that means you're doing something nice for someone else.
No, I know that.
I know.
And you're all right with that?
Yes.
What?
Don't shake unless you mean it.
All right.
Let's get you back to the palace.
Oh, by the way, thanks.
No... thank you ok.
Once we cross this bridge, it's only an hour to the palace.
Good, because believe it or not,
I think I need a bath.
I believe it.
- What was that?
- Nothing.
Ohh!
Whoa!
Kuzco!
Kuzco!
- Yeah?
- Quick, help me up!
No. I don't think
I will.
You're going to leave me here?
Well, I was going to have you imprisoned for life, but I kind of like this better.
I thought you were a changed man.
Oh, come on.
I had to say something to get you to take me back to the city.
So all of it was a lie?
Well, yeah.
No, wait.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
It all was a lie.
Toodles.
We shook hands on it!
You know, the funny thing about shaking hands is... you need hands.
Ha! ok.
Buh-bye.
Aah!
Are you ok?
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah. I think
I'm all right.
Good!
That's for going back on your promise!
Yii!
Yeah. That's for kidnapping me and taking me to your village... which I'm still gonna destroy, by the way.
Ah ha ha ha!
No touchy.
Ooh!
Why did I risk my life for a selfish brat like you?
I was always taught that there was some good in everyone, but, ooh, you proved me wrong.
Oh, boohoo.
Now I feel really bad.
Bad llama.
I could've let you die out there in that jungle, and then all my problems would be over.
Well, that makes you ugly and stupid.
Let's end this.
Ladies first.
- Aah! - Yaah!
Ohh!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Ow! Ow!
- Ow! Ow!
- Whoa!
- Ohh!
What are we gonna do?
Aah!
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
That's it for me!
No, we're not
Calm down.
I have an idea.
Give me your arm.
Ok, now the other one.
When I say go, push against my back, and we'll walk up the hill.
Ready?
Go.
Ow!
You did that on purpose.
- Aah!
- No, I didn't!
Now, we're gonna have to work together to get out of this, so follow my lead.
Ready?
- Right foot.
- Whose right?
Your right or mine?
I don't care.
Mine.
Well, why yours?
Ok, your right!
Ready?
Ok, got it.
Ok, right.
Left. Right.
Ha ha!
Look, we're moving!
Aah!
Don't look down!
Now, stay with me.
Stay with me.
Right. Left.
Right. Left.
Right. Left.
Right!
Now what, genius?
Working on it.
Ok, here's the deal.
Stretch out your neck, and I'll grab the rope.
How do I know you won't let me fall after you grab the rope?
You're just gonna have to trust me!
You know, it's a good thing you're not a big, fat guy, or this would be really difficult.
Aah! Aah!
Almost.
Got it!
It's stuck.
Take your time.
No hurry here.
Scorpions!
Aah ha ha!
Kuzco!
Aah!
Oh, no!
Uhh!
Aah!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Huh?
Aah!
Aah!
Whoa!
- Huh?
Look out!
Ohh!
Pacha: Ohh
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Ooh, look at me and my bad self.
I snatched you right out of the air.
"Ooh, I'm a crumbly canyon wall, and I'm taking you with me."
Well, not today, pal.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Uh-huh
You just saved my life.
Huh?
So?
- I knew it.
- Knew what?
That there is some good in you after all.
Oh, no
- Admit it.
- Wrong.
- Yes, there is.
- Nuh-uh.
- I think there is.
- Hey, you could've let me fall.
- Nuh-uh!
Come on, what's the big deal?
Nobody's that heartless.
Don't read too much into it.
It was a one-time thing.
Right. Sure.
Well, we better get going.
With that bridge out, it's a 4-daywalk to the palace.
What?
You mean you're still taking me back?
I shook on it, didn't I?
Well, yeah, but I hope you realize that doesn't change a thing.
I'm still building
Kuzcotopia when I get back.
Well, 4 days is a long time.
Who knows? Maybe you'll change your mind.
Uh-huh.
4 days.
What are the chances of you carrying me?
Not good.
No, no, no!
We've searched every village surrounding the palace and still no sign of Kuzco.
Where is he?
Kronk!
Kronk here.
I'm getting tired.
Pull over.
Sure thing.
Kronk out.
Ooh! Aah!
Aah! Ohh!
Perfect.
These are my best shoes.
I hate this jungle.
Oh, look.
A golden-throated small-winged warbler.
Just one more for exotic bird bingo.
Aah!
I am loving this.
Get away from me!
Uhh
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
No, no, it's not you.
She's not the easiest person to get close to.
There's a wall there.
Trust me.
Are you talking to that squirrel?
I was a junior chipmunk.
I had to be versed in all the woodland creatures.
Please continue.
Aah!
Why me?
Why me?
Hey, it doesn't always have to be about you.
This poor little guy has had it rough.
Seems a talking llama
Kronk: gave him a hard time the other day
Oh, a talking llama?
Ha ha ha ha!
Do tell.
Heh heh heh heh!
Uh, he doesn't really want to talk to you.
Well, then you ask him.
I hate being in the middle.
Squeaky, uh... squeak, squeaker, squeakin'.
Aah!
Jaguars? No kidding?
Brutal.
Uh, could you give us a little room here?
Uh, sorry.
Uh-uh.
A little bit more, please.
How is this?
- Yeah, that's good.
Now ask him which way the talking llama went!
Uh, squeakity-squeak, squeakin'.
Low blood sugar, huh?
Yeah.
It's a curse. Ha.
Well, as soon as we get something to eat, you're walking the rest of the way.
Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut, home of the mug...
...of meat.
What'll it be?
Ahem. We'll have
2 specials.
Is that all right, dear?
Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin.
You know what I like.
Hee hee hee. We're on our honeymoon.
Bless you for coming out in public.
So that's 2 specials.
And an onion log.
To split.
Ordering!
I need 2 heartburns and a deep-fried doorstop on table 1 2!
Ok, so I'll admit this was a good idea.
When will you learn that all my ideas are good ones?
That's funny, because I thought you going into the jungle by yourself, being chased by jaguars, lying to me to take you back to the palace were all really bad ideas.
Anything sounds bad when you say it with that attitude.
Hot and crispy pill bug for the happy couple.
Mazeltov
Oh, boy.
Ooh. Ugh. Bluh.
Urp!
Oh, here
Let me get that for you
Bleaggh! Uck!
Where are you going?
I'm just going to slip into the kitchen and have a word with the chef.
You're gonna get us thrown out.
Please.
With this disguise,
I'm invisible.
Heh heh!
We've been walking around in circles for who knows how long.
That is the last time we take directions from a squirrel.
I should have done away with Kuzco myself when I had the chance.
Oh, you really gotta stop beating yourself up about that.
Uh-oh I'll get you another one there, Yzma
You using that fork there, pal?
Hey, don't I know you?
I don't think so.
Wrestled you in high school?
Don't remember that.
Metal shop? I got it!
Miss Narca's interpretive dance--2 semesters.
I was usually in the back because of my weak ankles.
Come on, pal.
You gotta help me out here.
I don't think we've ever met, but I gotta go.
Don't worry.
I'll think of it.
Look, all I know is the food looked iffy.
I'm not the only one that thinks that, I'm sure.
Psst! Hey!
So I'm just checking to make sure you're going to take the main course up a notch.
Is there anything on this menu that is not swimming in gravy?
Hang on.
I'll go ask the chef.
It's a simple question.
Is there or is there not anything edible...
- on this menu?
- Gah!
Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!
Hey, pal, what's your policy on making special orders?
All right, buster, that's it!
You want a special order, then you make it!
I quit!
Yeah, but l--
I try and I try, but there's no respect for anyone with vision.
That's it!
There's just nothing
I can do about it!
Please don't go.
3 pork combos, extra bacon on the side,
2 chili cheese samplers, a basket of liver and onion rings, a catch of the day, and a steak cut in the shape of a trout.
You got all that, honey?
3 oinkers wearing pants, plate of hot air, basket of grandma's breakfast, and change the bull to a gill, got it.
What's going on?
No time to explain.
We gotta get out of here.
What is he doing in there?
Unh! Come on!
In a minute.
I'm still hungry.
No, Kuzco!
Ok, I'll make it simple for you.
I'll have a spinach omelet with wheat toast.
- You got it?
- Can do.
What's taking so long?
Pickup!
Kronk!
What are you doing?
Kinda busy here.
Why am I not surprised?
Your order's up!
Ohh!
Oh, well, while you're at it, make me the special.
And hold the gravy!
Check. Pickup!
You know what?
On second thought, make my omelet a meat pie.
Meat pie Check
Kronk!
Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?
I'll have to charge you full price.
Ooh!
Hey, how about a side of potatoes, my buddy?
You got it. Want cheese on those potatoes?
Thank you, Kronk.
Cheddar will be fine.
Cheddar spuds coming up.
Spuds yes, cheese no.
Hold the cheese.
No, I want the cheese
Cheese me no like.
- Cheese out.
- Cheese in!
Come on, make up your mind!
Ok, ok, on second thought...
Make my potatoes a salad.
Excuse me. You see that woman over there?
No problem, hon.
We do that all the time.
Waiters: 1, 2, 3, 4
Happy, happy birthday
From all of us to you
We wish it was our birthday
So we could party, too
Happy, happy birthday
May all your dreams come true
Ha ha ha!
It's your birthday?
What are you doing?
Look, there's 2 people in there looking for you.
What?
A big guy and a skinny old woman.
Wait. Was this woman scary beyond all reason?
Oh, yeah.
That's Yzma and Kronk!
I'm saved!
Trust me, they're not here to save you.
They'll take me back to the palace.
Thanks for your help.
You've been great.
I can take it from here.
You don't understand.
They're trying to kill you.
Kill me? Their whole world revolves around me.
No. I can't let you!
What? Wha--
Oh, I get it!
What?
You don't want to take me back to the palace.
You want to keep me stranded out here forever.
No!
This has all been an act, and I almost fell for it.
Will you just listen to me--
No, no, you listen to me.
All you care about is your stupid hilltop!
What?
You don't care about me.
Now, just get out of here.
- Go!
- But--
Go on! Get outta here!
Fine! Hmph!
Oh, this entire mess is all your fault.
What'd I do?
If you hadn't mixed up those poisons,
Kuzco would be dead now!
There'll be no more diversions until we track that llama down and kill him!
Said I was sorry.
Can't just let it go.
Not even on your birthday.
Kuzco must be eliminated
The empire will finally be rid of that useless slug
You got a point
Nobody really seems to care that he's gone, do they?
Pacha!
Pacha?
So this is where you came in
See, just like I said,
I'm the victim here
I didn't do anything, and they ruined my life and took everything I had
Hey, give it a rest up there, will you?
What? I’m just telling them what happened
Who you kidding, pal?
They saw the whole thing, they know what happened.
Well, yeah, but
Just leave me alone.
The peasant at the diner!
He didn't pay his check.
He's the peasant who I saw leaving the city who disappeared into the crowd with Kuzco on the back of his cart.
He must have taken him back to his village, so if we find the village, we find him, and if we find him, we find Kuzco.
Oh, yeah, it's all comin' together.
Yzma!
What?!
Aah!
This had better be good!
Yeech.
So, there we were standing on the cliff, and the ground started to rumble
And just as it started to go, he grabbed me before I fell
Do you believe that?
You know, call me crazy for following this guy all the way out here, but as much as he tries to deny it,
I know there's some good in him
Besides, I couldn't just leave him out here all alone.
He's a lousy llama.
I mean, a really lousy llama.
Hey, listen, Pacha, you know, what I said to you back at the diner, that--that--
I--I didn't really...
So...you tired of being a llama?
Ye-ee-ee-es!
Ok, we're just gonna stop at the house and get some supplies.
- Then we'll be on our way, right?
- Right.
Hey there, Pacha.
You just missed your relatives.
My relatives?
We just sent them up to your house.
What did they look like?
See, there was this big guy and this older woman who was...
How would you describe her?
Scary beyond all reason.
Yeah, that's it.
So, remind me again how you're related to Pacha?
Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's wife's step-niece's great-aunt. Heh heh.
Twice removed.
Uh-huh.
Isn't that right, Kronk?
99 monkeys jumpin' on the bed
One fell off and bumped his head
You know, I am so sorry that you had to come all this way, but as I said to you before, you may recall,
Pacha is not here.
I'll be sure and tell him you came by.
Oh, would you, please?
That would be just great.
Oops. Silly me.
No, no. Allow me.
She's hiding something.
When I give the word, we search the house.
Ok, but I still have
94 monkeys to go.
Grr!
So, while we're waiting for Paca--
Pacha.
Oh, yes.
Perhaps we can have a tour of your lovely home.
You know, why don't you just come back when Pacha gets home?
I'm sure he'd love to show you the...
Excuse me, won't you?
I think I left something in the oven.
This is my variation of double-dutch.
On the signal, we switch places.
Kronk, it's time! ok!
Ohh!
So, we have to get back to the palace, find the lab, and change him back.
Hi there!
Aah!
- That was him.
- Whoops.
You know what?
I don't believe you're really my great-aunt.
You're more like my great-great-great...
Go. I'll stall them long enough for you two to get a head start.
Thanks, honey.
You have a lovely wife.
They're both very pretty.
Great-great- great...
Grr! All right!
Are you through?
...great-great-aunt.
So, where were we?
Listen, sister, we're not leaving until--
I show you the house.
Of course.
Was it a good idea to leave your family with those two?
Oh, don't worry.
They can handle themselves.
What do you mean, the door is stuck?
Try jiggling the handle.
There is no handle in here.
There's not?
Are you sure?
All right, I've had enough of this.
Tell us where the talking llama is and we'll burn your house to the ground.
Uh, don't you mean "or"?
Tell us where the talking llama is or we'll burn your house to the ground.
Well, which is it?
That seems like a pretty crucial conjunction.
That's it!
Kronk, break the door down!
Break it down?
Are you kidding me?
This is hand-carved mahogany.
I don't care, you fool.
Get out of my way.
I'll break it down myself.
A-one
Ok, kids, you know what to do.
Right, Mom!
Aah!
Ok, children, on your mark, get set, go!
Ow! Ow! Stop it, you little brats! Huh?
Ow!
Oh, there they go, Kronk!
They're getting away!
Ha ha ha! Well,
I had a great time.
Let's not wait until the next family reunion to get together.
Kronk!
I, uh, I gotta run.
Ok, why does she even have that lever?
Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times
Aah!
Huh?
What does it look like?
I don't know.
Just keep looking.
Over here!
It has to be one of these.
Lions, tigers, bears...
Oh, my
Looking for this?
No! It can't be!
How did you get back here before us?
Uh...how did we, Kronk?
Well, you got me.
By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.
Oh, well, back to business.
Ok, I admit it.
Maybe I wasn't as nice as I should have been, but, Yzma, do you really want to kill me?
Just think of it as you're being let go, that your life's going in a different direction, that your body's part of a permanent outplacement.
Hey, that's kind of like what he said to you when you got fired.
I know. It's called a cruel irony-- like my dependence on you.
I can't believe this is happening!
Then I bet you weren't expecting this
- No!
- Aah!
Aha!
Oh, ok.
Ha ha!
Finish them off.
Hey, you're not backing down now, are you, big guy?
Uh, where's the other guy?
Yo!
Sorry I'm late.
So, what'd I miss?
Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife and asked me to, you know, take them out.
Then this guy popped up and we waited for you, and quite honestly--
Kronk! Why did I think you could do this?
This one simple thing.
It's like I'm talking to a monkey.
Whoa now.
A really, really big stupid monkey named Kronk!
Ouch.
And do you want to know something else?
I've never liked your spinach puffs.
Never!
That's it.
She's going down.
Now, now, remember, guys.
From above, the wicked shall receive their just reward.
That'll work.
Strange.
That usually works.
And so does this!
Ah. Should have seen that coming.
Whoa!
Aah!
Give me that vial!
Oof!.
Ah! Ha ha!
Aah!
Oops. Clumsy me.
Which one? Which one?
Better hurry
I'm expecting company
Kill them!
They murdered the emperor!
No, wait! I'm the emperor!
It's me--Kuzco!
They're not listening to me!
Just take 'em all!
- Yaah!
- Yaah!
Get them!
Hey, I've been turned into a cow.
Can I go home?
You're excused.
Anyone else?
All: No, we're good.
Get them!
We've gotta change you back.
Try this one.
Uh, Pacha?
A little help!
Come on!
Come on!
Aah!
Oh, please be something with wings.
Yeah! We're flyin'!
Uh-oh!
We're not getting anywhere with you picking the vials.
I'm picking the next one!
Fine by me!
Give me that one!
Don't you say a word.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Quick!
Drain the canals!
Pacha: Open up!
Yay! I'm a llama again!
Wait...
- Aah!
- Aah!
There they go!
After them!
Come on, men!
Nobody lives forever! Charge!
Aah!
Grr!
Aah!
Ok, only 2 left. It's gotta be one of these.
No!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ah ha ha ha ha!
Meow.
I'll take that.
This is the one. This'll change you back to a human.
Ow! Hey, get her off!.
Whoa!
Get her off me!
Aah! Ow!
Drink the potion!
Ok, ok! Aah!
Where did it go?
Where is it?
Looking for this?
Is that my voice?
Is that my voice?
Oh, well.
No! Don't drop it!
I'm not going to drop it, you fool!
I'm going to drink it!
And once I turn back into my beautiful self,
I'm going to kill you!
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Aah! Uh-oh.
Yzma: Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Uhh! Whoa!
Uhh! Oh-oh-oh!
Kuzco!
Be right there!
Give me a minute!
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!
Kuzco! Whoa!
Kuzco!
Aah!
Oh.
The vial!
Aah!
For the last time, we did not order a giant trampoline.
You know, pal, you could have told me that before I set it up.
Aah!
Aah! Uhh--
Huh? Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hoo hoo hee hee ha ha ha--
The vial!
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?
Ah ha ha ha ha!
I win.
Whoa.
Got it!
What are the odds of that trapdoor leading me out here?
Yeah!
Uhh.
Here, uh, let me get this for you.
Well, see ya on the other side.
Old man: Oh, now, you--you you stop being so hard on yourself.
All is forgiven.
You're sure?
Oh, it's not the first time
I was tossed out a window, and it won't be the last.
What can I say?
I'm a rebel.
Whoa-ho-ho, tiger.
Oh! Hey, I got to use that arm later.
Ok, buddy, take care.
Ha ha.
Ah, he's a sweet guy.
So, you lied to me
I did?
Yeah. You said when the sun hits this ridge just right, these hills sing.
Well, pal, I was dragged all over those hills, and I did not hear any singing.
So
I'll be building my summer home on a more magical hill.
Thank you.
Hmm. Couldn't pull the wool over your eyes, huh?
No, no, I'm sharp,
I'm on it.
Looks like you and your family are stuck on that tuneless hill top forever, pal.
You know, I'm pretty sure
I heard some singing on the hill next to us.
In case you're interested.
Ha! Boom, baby!
Ha! Boom, baby!
You'd be the coolest dude
In the nation
Or the hippest cat in creation
But if you ain't got friends, then nothing's worth the fuss
A perfect world will come to be
When everybody here can see
That a perfect world begins and ends
A perfect world begins and ends
A perfect world begins and ends with us
" My acorn is missing."
Squeak squeakin' squeak squeakity.
" Did you eat the acorn?"
Squeaker squeak squeak squeakin'?
"You owe me a new acorn."
Squeak squeak squeak squeak squeaker--
Squeakin'.
I'm so proud of you guys.

Cleaned by Xylo
Time.
Time, it has been proposed is the fourth dimension.
And yet, for mortal man, time has no dimension at all.
We are like horses with blinders seeing only what lies before us.
Forever guessing the future and fabricating the past.
Brilliant.
Quite right, Your Grace.
How, you ask, can we lift these shackles and live- not in the moment but in the glorious expanse of time's continuum?
Listen, and I shall tell you.
The secret lies in the enduring power of our achievements our creations!
As the pyramids testify to the Egyptians so my glorious erection shall represent our culture in perpetuity.
Behold, rising before you the greatest erection on the continent.
The greatest erection of the age!
The greatest erection on the planet!
Hold this.
Of course.
For the Herald, Your Grace.
I understand you'll be making an important announcement tonight.
Good afternoon, ladies.
Please, excuse me, please.
Good afternoon.
And the Perrier-Jouet should be chilled.
- You understand? Chilled.
- Yes, sir.
Leopold!
Leopold, where have you been?
Leopold!
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past 5:00!
He's not even dressed!
He'll be ready, my lord.
I assure you.
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!
Ah, Miss Blaine.
You dance like a... like a herd of cattle.
You are a rare woman who lights up a room simply by leaving it.
Might you be rich,
Miss Blaine?
You see, whilst I am the third Duke the little secret of those of us in the Royal Court- apart from our general uselessness- is our massive indebtedness.
It's always been your misfortune, Leopold that you so thoroughly amuse yourself with the sound of your own voice.
In a life as stagnant as mine that I can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary marvel.
Please don't touch that.
The device you were jabbering about.
To take priests to the bell tower.
To take anyone, Uncle, to the floor they so desire.
Buildings continue to climb.
Soon they will outstrip the stamina of our legs.
You speak of progress and invention.
Yet what I offer you downstairs is reality.
Take a wife. Marry.
Marriage... marriage is the promise of eternal love.
As a man of honor, I can not promise eternally what I have never felt momentarily.
Born into privilege, yet perversely ashamed of it.
That is your tragedy.
My God! If my brother could only see you, he'd be heartbroken.
You are no duke!
Of course I'm not.
The monarchy is dead, Uncle.
We are relics.
That is reality.
The new Royals are men of accomplishment.
Men like Roebling, with his bridge
Edison, with his lamp
Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...
Those men made themselves from nothing!
You, on the other hand, were born with everything and from it, fashioned nothing.
As of tonight,
I wash my hands of you.
Take a good look at your dance card, Leopold.
A wealthy bride is your only surety.
Your Grace, may I present Miss Tree of the Trees of Schenectady, sir.
Miss Tree?
It's an honor to be making your royal acquaintance,
Your Highness.
Shall we?
Many dreams, all useless.
Who are you?
No, no, no.
Okay, rela...
Please, wait, no.
I don't want to harm you.
Stop! Please!
Sir, wait!
Pardon me. Pardon me.
Go! Go!
Ya!-
Ya!
Stop, sir! Please!
Oh, my God.
No!
Oh!
Let go!
Just let go. It's okay!
You don't understand!
Let go!
Oh!
I don't want to hurt you!
Let go!
Goddamn it!
Bart!
Wait!
Shit!
Oh, my God.
We must remember, Bart that sometimes it is okay to color outside the lines.
Hello?
My Palm Pilot.
You still have it.
Kate, it's 1:00 in the morning.
And clearly you're awake, so what is the infraction?
Look, Kate, I don't know where your Palm Pilot is.
And I can't do this right now.
Not now. I'm expecting a call.
Oh, Bart.
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.
She is not a happy person.
Goddamn it!
You know what, Stuart?
You know what? I'm...
Kate...
Please. I've got somebody here, okay?
I know. I saw her.
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did!
It's a him, if that's any kind of consolation to you.
So, look, now that you know
I'm not getting laid, just go to bed, okay?
Nuh-uh, don't. Do not hang up on me, Stuart.
Don't do that.
Kate, please.
I beg of you.
Something big is happening.
Something that validates my entire life...
What could that possibly be?
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes.
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.
- Ye...
Okay.
I found it.
What did you find?
The portal.
A crack in the fabric of time.
It was over the East River, Kate
- just where I said it would be.
- You found the portal?
A portal into April 28th, 1876.
I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge and took a walk in 1876 today.
I followed the Duke of Albany around old New York.
- Are you listening?
- Avidly.
This here's the twist, Kate.
Here's the kicker.
What's the kicker?
He followed me home.
The Duke of Buffalo...
No, the Duke of Albany.
...Albany followed you home through a crack in time.
He's a brilliant engineer.
He patented the counterweight pulley.
He invented the elevator, for Christ's sake.
You know what, Stuart?
You know what?
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.
I haven't been for a whole month now.
You can tell me the truth.
I am telling you the truth, Kate.
You can tell me you went and picked up a transvestite in Times Square.
I don't care.
You know what, Kate?
This is it, right here.
This is it, in a nutshell.
Our downfall.
You never- not once- believed in me.
Oh, I did, Stuart.
I did, for four years.
And I got burnt.
Okay, you want to know who he is?
I'll tell you who he is.
He is a hacker.
High end. English.
I know him from Columbia.
He's in town for the Mac Expo at the Javits.
We went out, got a little sloppy on Guinness and he passed out on my couch.
And that's the truth?
Mm-hmm. That's the truth.
Okay? Are you happy now?
Is that plausible enough for you and your little focus group?
You know what, Stuart?
I blew my best years on you.
Those were your best?
Look...
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
You'll get your Pilot in the morning.
Orange alert.
Otis!-
Otis!
Bart, stop!
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- Where am I?
Well, um, there's not an easy explanation for that.
If it's a ransom you seek, my uncle won't pay a cent.
Except, perhaps, for my demise.
No. no. You're not being kidnapped.
Bart, quiet!
I can scarcely see, thanks to your spray.
My eyes feel like Steak au Poivre.
So I ask you again, where the hell am I?
As far as I'm concerned, you might be Jack the Ripper!
And you would have me believe that I'm being detained at present in the hereafter?
- The time to come?
- Yes.
Bart, quiet!
He needs a walk.
Oh, and you would have me believe that you have found a crack in time.
You, of all people, should understand.
I mean, you're a scientist.
You invented the elevator.
What is an elevator?
What the hell are you talk...
Where the hell am I?
I told you- you haven't actually gone anywhere.
You're still in New York.
That, sir, is not New York!
I'm afraid it is.
- No, Kate.
- Hello. Hello there.
What's your name?
- Leopold.
- Tell me something.
I'm having trouble with my G-5.
How much RAM do I need to properly run OS 9.6?
Clearly, the Mac Expo is out.
So you must be... a man out of time?
Or Sergeant Pepper?
You know what?
Actually, we could use a little privacy.
Stuart, I want my Palm Pilot.
- I'm not... I'm serious.
- Maybe later on, Kate.
I just want my Palm Pilot, Stuart!
- No. No.
- Hey, give me my Palm Pilot!
Give it to me.
This is madness.
This is madness.
Who was that?
I-I feel as if I've seen her...
Women have changed since your time, Leo.
They've become dangerous.
It's on the landing!
You say this is no kidnapping.
You say you mean no harm.
Then why is it, sir, you will not unlock the door?
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry about her. I'm...
Look, with all due respect
I can't let you just go running around free out there, okay?
This is New York City.
It's not such a safe place anymore.
Look at you.
You look like some sort of psychotic escapee from a Renaissance fair.
I understand you have some anxiety but you have to trust me.
I'm going to get you home, okay?
I promise.
Bart!
The portal opens up again next week. Monday.
I know that, because it was my back-up in case I didn't make it last night.
It's on a cycle, you know?
Kind of like, uh... total eclipse.
Once every 20 years.
You understand?
Generally,
I understand everything.
Since I've met you, nothing.
I can only assume
I'm in a nightmare brought on by agita, or else I am dead.
You're not dead.
Come here. Sit down.
Here.
Want some milk in yours?
Bart, can I just have...
Sorry. He's really got to go out.
I'd be honored if you took a look at those.
I'll explain everything when I get back.
He's got to go out or he'll drop a bomb in there.
Come on. Let's go.
Back in five.
One quick trip to Spectra, Bart and you and I will be Nobel...
Laureates.
Come on, Bart.
Hey, let's go.
Come on. Let's go!
Oh, Jesus!
Good boy, Bart!
Stay!
Stay, Bart. Stay!
Oh, Bart, please stay!
Stuart, you forgot the pointy thing!
Stuart...
Look, this is not complex.
He gave me the Palm Pilot but he forgot the pointy thing.
- I've been warned about you.
- Oh. Really?
And what, pray tell did the great disappointment say?
That you were dangerous, though you hardly look it.
- Oh, really?
- A lady in trousers isn't dangerous, merely plain.
- I take it you're a career woman.
- Yeah, market research.
Fine avocation for women, research.
Perfect for the feminine mind.
You're a trip, Lionel.
I myself once courted a librarian in Sussex.
Oh.
Good for you.
I must confess, I feel as though we've met on a previous occasion.
Well, Lionel, seeing as I've never met a single friend of Stuart's-
I'm not even sure he's ever had any-
I really don't see how that's possible.
Oh, man! Bart!
He just made Lake Erie out there.
You just can't toss a dog out into the hall like that.
- You can't do that.
- I assure you, I did not.
Let's go.
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on. Let's go!
Look, pal, I don't care how many elevators you've got.
This one's in my building.
Hang on a second.
Sorry about the elevator, Miss Kate.
I've got them on the phone right now.
Hey, Gracy. This is Lionel,
Stuart's friend.
How do you do?
Ten minutes?
I need someone here right now.
- Watch it, man.
- I beg your pardon.
Hey, what are you doing?
You need to be going that way.
There's an electron... Hello?
- There's an electronics store.
- I'm sorry, miss.
There's a patch of grass across the street.
Take him there.
He'll do his business.
Can you give this to Stuart, please?
It's his cable bill.
They haul our furniture and cradle our children but this morning, from the Battery to the Bronx elevators have mysteriously...
So sorry.
- Stupid!
- I do beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.
Are you going to remove that?
I beg your pardon?
Pick it up and put it in the trash.
Absolutely not.
Maybe you don't understand.
It's against the law to leave it there.
Are you suggesting, madam, there exists a law compelling gentlemen to lay hold of canine bowel movements?
I'm suggesting you pick the poop up and throw it away now.
I refuse. Respectfully.
All right.
What's your name, fancy pants?
Leopold...
Alexis Elija...
Walker Thomas Garrett
Mountbatten.
All right, Stuart.
Have a nice day.
I appreciate you putting in a good word for me but J.J.'s not back from London.
Right. Bye.
- What's with the elevators?
- It's happening everywhere.
Darci.
Last page.
I'm sorry.
Did everyone live happily ever after?
He lost his leg to gangrene waiting for her on the island.
But they're together now.
Wonderful.
- Oh, look, you got your Palm Pilot back.
- A nightmare.
Okay, so who do I owe?
Okay, Bobby at Hasbro,
Reeves at Crunch.
And the finals came in for "Love for Sale."
The call with the studio is at 4:00.
The margarine thing's in 15 in the conference room.
And J.J. wants to talk to you before that.
Oh, and one more thing.
I remember that you told me to start thinking ahead so I know your brother's getting back from his retreat tomorrow and if you want something in the fridge...
- Darci...
- Mm-hmm?
Can you tell me why I'm upset right now?
Because, uh...
J.J. called this morning.
That is why I have a cell phone.
- So you can call me...
- Kate, Kate, he didn't call.
He just popped his head in here and spoke two sentences.
So he's back?
Margo says he's going to make a big announcement about the merger next week.
Margo? What does she know?
How does she know anything about anything?
Oh. All right. So he popped his head in here.
All right, so you have to tell me exactly what he said, Darci.
You have to start at the beginning and tell me...
He said, "Tell Kate I'm going to sit in on Farmer's Bounty."
J.J.
Good morning, Kate.
Good morning.
I'll see you in there.
Good Lord, it still stands.
The world has changed all around it but Roebling's erection still stands!
That, my friend, is a miracle.
- What?
- It's a miracle, man!
It's a bridge.
Tell me... when did they adapt it for steam engines?
The fire brigade.
I don't know how it happened.
I found him in a shaft.
Stuart!
Leopold, what are you doing out here?
Get back inside!
They're taking him to Goodman Memorial.
"Fresh creamery butter."
"Is there anything more comforting?"
"There is, and I know you will agree"
"when you try Farmer's Bounty"
"with the essence of real butter in every bite."
Your first choice.
However, 45% of our demo circled "shifty" as his key descriptor.
Not good.
"This is what I say."
"Everybody should be trying
Farmer's Bounty"
"with the real, rich, creamy taste of real butter."
"Try it, and you will be losing pounds. Poof! Boom! Voila!"
Your second choice.
Unfortunately, the group found him obnoxious, abrasive and a whopping 72% found him just plain creepy.
The spot rolls out in four days.
We have to shoot...
The product is shipping, what the hell am I supposed to do?
We have to do another session, tomorrow.
I had my assistant book the response room at National so we can decide then and there.
Kate, are you all right?
- You okay?
- I'm fine.
Geez, Kate, I'd ask for a decaf.
Monica, I need you to call Barney's.
I need a white blouse, size small in Kate's office by lunch.
Oh, dear.
"Hi, you've reached Stuart."
"Please leave a message."
Leopold? Leopold, look, don't be frightened.
This is Stuart, okay?
I see it is Bell's talking telegraph.
I saw a prototype at last year's fair.
I need you to pick up the handset, Leo.
You pick up the green handset, because I need to talk to you...
Are-are you there?
- Hello?
- Leopold, thank God.
Listen, they're taking me to X-Rays.
Everything's going to be fine but you have to stay in the apartment.
Do you understand me?
Oh, Stuart,
I saw Roebling's bridge today.
I saw it... complete.
Yes, yes, but listen to me.
You can't go out again.
You have to stay in the apartment.
Stay in the apartment?
For how long?
Leo, I'll be back tonight.
I promise- no more field trips.
Would you...
Hel... hello?
Stuart? Hello?
Blast!
Hello.
Hello. Who are you?
Hector. My mom works late on Wednesdays so I watch TV with Stuart.
Want some Pirate's Booty?
Hang on.
Excuse me, J.J., I wanted to thank you for the shirt.
That was very nice.
Come in, come in.
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
Oh, good, good.
Yeah, she's here right now.
I'll tell her.
Okay... okay.
Bye.
Sit down.
That was Barry.
He was thrilled with your work at the screening last night.
Oh, good. Good.
You're a rarity among women, Kate.
I'm sorry?
You don't cling to illusion.
You don't get caught up in emotion.
You don't do pretty.
I don't?
You skew male.
You're like a man.
A man who understands women- their desires, their needs.
You understand them but you're not really one of them.
- You don't mind my being frank, do you?
- No. I don't. No.
Endamame?
Kate?
One day, he lowered the Jolly Roger
- Stu?
- and set sail in search of another kind of treasure.
Not money, not jewels, not gold... but a bride.
Despite his being a ruffian of the brine fearless in his plunder and merciless with the sword the Pirate King was also lonely.
You see, he had never met a lady.
He never met a girl?
No. Not a girl, not a lady, not even his own mother.
- So what happened?
- As with all comedies the most ridiculous thing imaginable- the Pirate King fell in love with the major general's daughter.
I had the good fortune to see the premiere last month at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.
Since when is
Penzance at the Fifth?
Is it your habit, sir to simply enter a conversation without introduction?
Whoa, you are deep in it.
It's cool. I'm an actor, too.
I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.
Kate McKay, senior vice president.
Darci, it hasn't happened.
All he did was dangle a carrot.
Until he makes a decision the pressure's doubled.
When's he going to make a decision?
We're having dinner tomorrow to discuss it further at Commune.
- Kate?
- Yeah.
- I have Stuart on the line.
- No!
- He says he's in the hospital.
- No!
Leopold is just sitting alone in my apartment right now.
God knows what could happen to him.
Do you know he got outside today?
Of course he did-
I made him walk your dog.
What? No, Kate, you can't do that!
He can't go outside!
Jesus Christ, Kate.
He's from 1876, Kate.
He doesn't know our customs.
If something were to happen to him
- it could be catastrophic.
- Shh!
If he doesn't go back to April 28, 1876, he doesn't get married he doesn't have children, and you want to know what?
What happened with the elevators today, well that's going to seem like a walk in the park.
Stuart! This is embarrassing.
It's embarrassing now, all right?
Someone has to keep an eye on him.
Stuart, he's a grown man.
He's a grown man. He's fine.
He can take care of himself.
- No. Wait. Aah!
- I'm going.
Kate, please.
Just take this to Spectra, okay?
Get it developed.
You'll see I'm telling the truth.
Tell Manny it's important.
You want double prints?
That's not funny, Kate.
This is not a joke.
You need help, Stuart.
You need help.
Charlie?
Hey, Kate!
Can I see you downstairs for a minute?
I invited someone to dinner.
He's up there all alone.
Stuart's in the hospital.
I didn't think you'd have such a problem...
No, you didn't think, Charlie.
You didn't think.
You came home early, one day early from actor camp.
Okay, it's not actor camp and yeah, I came home a day early, all right?
There was this tai chi broad who kept trying
- stick her fingers...
- No, this is the point.
You immediately march upstairs to my ex-boyfriend's apartment and you invite his freakish friend...
See, that's what it's about.
It's not that
I went up there.
It's that it was your ex-boyfriend...
No, it's not about Stuart.
- Greetings, Kate, Charles.
- Hey, Leo.
Be nice.
So, when's Stuart getting back?
Couple of days, maybe a week.
He promised me that he would return late this evening.
Well, maybe he will, Leopold.
He's so big on keeping his promises.
May I have the next course?
There is no next course.
Where I come from, the meal... is the result of reflection and study.
Menus are prepared in advance timed to perfection.
It is said, without the culinary arts the crudeness of reality would be unbearable.
We had a saying in the McKay house:
"You shake and shake the ketchup bottle.
None will come, and then a lot'll."
What is that?
- I beg your pardon?
- Why are you standing?
I'm accustomed to stand when a lady leaves the table.
Tell me, Charles when Stuart and your sister were engaged did you happen to read his papers on the temporal universe?
I spent the morning perusing them, and must confess...
Stuart and I were never engaged.
Not even close.
But I did read...
Thank you.
But I did read his papers, however, to show support.
Is Stuart still trying to make a time machine?
That's the beauty of it he discovered no machine was necessary.
All one had to do was to develop formulae to forecast portals- natural windows in the fabric of time.
Apparently, Stuart located one utilizing modern...
Utilizing modern theories of weather prediction.
What's a portal?
An opening which exists for but a moment.
This explains why one must jump through it from a height- in order to achieve the required velocity.
The speed of gravity, to be exact.
It's quite brilliant.
You are so method.
You don't even break for a second, do you?
It's unbelievable!
Oh, stop it, please!
No more! Stop, please?
I beg you. I'm tired.
Can you go away?
Can you just go away?
Can you go away?
She's drunk, Leo.
Oh, shut up, Charlie!
And you, can you go upstairs?
Can you go away?
I am truly sorry if I have offended you in any way.
Goodnight, Charles.
Goodnight, Leo.
What the hell was that?
He thinks he's from the 19th century, Charlie.
He thinks he's a duke.
- I know. Isn't that cool?
Kate, he's in character.
He is an actor.
Oh, really? For what show?
You know that just because someone doesn't have a paying gig it doesn't mean they're not working on their craft.
What's going on here?
I think there's something wrong with his, uh... thing.
Give me that telephone.
No.
- Give it to me.
- No, I need to...
What do you expect me to do?
You took away my cell phone.
They're not allowed on hospital property.
I have to make a phone call!
You're not going to make one now.
No, no, you don't understand.
This is a very important phone call.
I have to leave this hospital now.
I can't be here anymore.
Mr. Besser,
I'm tired of telling you this.
You are not going nowhere until Dr. Feinstein signs your release!
Did you ever take any earth science, Esther, hmm?
You look like a smart woman.
Ever hear of the time-space continuum?
Sounds important, doesn't it?
Well, it is.
And you want to know something, Esther?
It's broken! Okay?
And I'm the only guy who can fix it.
So why don't you go down the hall there and get on your little telephone and call Dr. Feinstein...
Goodnight, Mr. Besser.
You tell him that...
You tell him that I...
Point the toes, pull your shoulders back.
Take a deep breath in and then exhale into downward-facing dog.
Oh, be quiet!
Be quiet... oh!
Bart, shut up!
That thing is a damned hazard!
It's just a toaster!
Well, insertion of bread into that so-called toaster produces no toast at all- merely warm bread!
Inserting the bread twice produces charcoal.
So, clearly, to make proper toast it requires 1 1/2 insertions which is something for which the apparatus doesn't begin to allow!
One assumes that when the General of Electric built it he might have tried using it.
One assumes the General might take pride in his creations instead of just foisting them on an unsuspecting public.
You know something?
Nobody gives a rat's ass that you have to push the toast down twice.
You know why?
Because everybody pushes their toast down twice!
Not where I come from.
Oh, because where you come from toast is the result of reflection and study.
Yes, you mock me.
But perhaps one day, when you've awoken from a pleasant slumber to the scent of a warm brioche smothered in marmalade and fresh creamery butter you'll understand that life is not solely comprised of tasks, but tastes.
Say that again.
Pardon me?
- Did they start yet?
- Yes.
Session list.
Leopold, Darci.
Darci, Leopold.
I'd like him to read.
Can you tack him on at the end?
And, Leopold, go with Darci.
She'll take you to the greenroom and explain everything.
I need to work out.
I need a place I can work out.
If I could get Mr. Duke?
Is he ready? Where is he?
Oh, my God, look at this.
Let's skip this one.
Mr. Duke.
Right here on the floor.
Excuse me, that's your marker, right there.
Just stand on that tape line.
Look, forget this guy.
I can't waste any more time, J.J.
We need to make a decision now.
All right, we've got plenty of good choices.
Let's cut it off, Kate.
That would be a mistake, J.J.
Kate, the client wants to move on.
We should see this last guy.
It'll... Two minutes!
I think he looks like the Quaker Oats guy.
Well, Phil, it's really not about what you think.
It's about what they think.
They've been in a coma all day and now look at them.
To them, this guy is a dream.
He's handsome, honest, courteous.
Stands when you walk in a room.
Brings you brioche in bed.
If you eat his margarine maybe your hips will shrink and he'll come to your door.
I take it this is to be delivered in direct address as on Geronimo.
Geronimo?
He means Geraldo.
Exactly.
Okay, everyone- quiet please.
And action.
Start talking, bud.
Fresh creamery butter.
Is there anything more comforting?
I say there is.
And perhaps you'll agree when you sample fat-free Farmer's Bounty with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite.
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty you shall receive butter's luxurious comfort in your mouth without adding to the luxury of your waistline.
Not bad, Kate.
Where'd you find him?
He lives in my building.
- Where do I sign?
- Right here, and here.
Oh! Hi.
That was spectacular, Kate.
- Thanks, J.J.
- A lot to talk about tonight at dinner.
- Nice work, Mr. Margarine.
- Thank you.
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
You seem pleased.
Oh, you did so great in there!
Man!
You are going to be on a national television spot!
I take it you're dining with that man tonight.
Huh? Oh, yeah, J.J.
He's my boss.
You require a chaperone.
His intentions are obvious.
Oh, I'm alone with you.
Do I need a chaperone?
We're not courting, Kate.
If we were, as a man of honor
I would have informed you of my intentions in writing.
Good day.
- Hey!
- Kate, why don't we take one of these.
They're for tourists.
Sorry, she doesn't seem interested.
Oh, hey, hello. Hello.
Hey! Hey, you...
Kate!
Hey, you asshole!
I'm gonna get you!
Asshole!
Goddamn it.
Give me your hand.
What?
Your hand, woman!
Yah! Yah!
What do you think you're doing?
Whoa, hey!
Yah!
I warn you, scoundrel
I was trained to ride at King's Academy and schooled in weaponry by the palace guard. You stand no chance.
Where you run, I shall ride and when you stop, the steel of this strap will be lodged in your brain.
Your boyfriend's a very good rider.
Yeah.
Are you for real?
Pardon me?
Are you for real?
I believe so.
You're a duke.
I was born a duke.
I've never felt like one.
Stay. Sit.
On your feet. Stay.
Stay. Good boy.
I'm off to dinner.
What are you two doing?
I don't know. Maybe we'll... watch the rest of the game or go out or something.
Oh, thank you.
Kate, may I repeat my offer to serve as a chaperone?
No, thank you, Leopold.
Charles, don't you find this inappropriate?
- As her brother, I would think...
- As her brother, I would think that my sister would invite me to an audition.
Could be just me, though.
Seems kind, but...
- Charlie.
- Hmm?
You're not exactly a margarine spokesperson.
- I can't sell butter, Kate?
- I don't mean to be insulting...
It's insulting. I'm an actor.
You don't have faith in me to sell butter?
- No. No. I'm sorry.
- I can do British, Kate.
- I'm an actor. I can be anybody!
- You're a very, very good actor.
- I am a good actor.
- You are.
Okay, fine, all right.
A Victorian dude who's never seen a Mets game watching TV.
Scene: I say, are those little people in that box of phosphorous?
Why, crikey! I believe it is!
This game's more beguiling than cricket!
Indian: Good golly, oh, Jesus!
It looks like Mike Piazza just hit a game!
How about Canadian?
Oh, right on.
Right on, you like butter, huh?
Yeah, what's that about?
Good night
Good night.
...all those people up in that stadium.
Know what they probably could go for?
Some margarine!
When your friend walked in in that outfit
I was getting a little nervous for you there.
"If you eat his margarine, maybe your hips will shrink."
It's brilliant. You saved Phil from his own ambivalence.
I knew it was the way to go- in my gut.
I'm counting on that gut.
Can I get a bottle of your '95 Lynch-Bages and a bottle of Evian?
I'll tell you one thing: your friend is going to be bigger than Mr. Whipple.
Thanks.
You're not sleeping with him, are you?
No
No.
Leo. Leo, come on. Come here.
How's it going, man?
See the girl with the long brown hair?
That's Patrice.
She's lovely.
She's mine.
Congratulations.
Hey, everybody, this is Leo!
Leo, this is everybody.
What's up? Dennis.
Shelby, Allison, Monica.
And this, this is the insatiable Patrice.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- How do you do?
- Patrice, let me assist you.
- Thanks.
You got it?
I was going to get it.
Let me get that for you.
There you go.
You look nice tonight. Very...
Like a Judy Blume book.
That's good, because I thought for a moment that body of water here was a moat.
No, that's a pond.
The gardens are devastating.
They are. They're very, very beautiful.
You'll have to come and see them firsthand.
Right, right.
After the merger I'm going to be stuck over there, setting things up.
I'll be craving a little face time from my new top honcho in New York.
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you should come visit.
- I'll fly you over for the weekend.
- Oh, yeah, I heard that, but the... the other part, the part before that.
The part about the top honcho.
I didn't understand that, that part.
How about catching an opera
Saturday?
La Boheme's at the Met.
Okay, so she comes back- the audience is about to leave- she comes back on stage and she starts squirting the audience with this turkey baster filled with this pine mist.
And she's screaming
"Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"
But no tears.
Just raw human passion.
Isn't... Willem Dafoe part of that group?
Yeah, and he did this monologue about how all the best things in life are hidden in people's basements.
Like the Louvre.
I'm sorry.
You were saying, Charles?
- Just...
- No, what about the Louvre?
Tell us what you were going to say.
Well, only a fraction of the Louvre is on the walls.
- The rest is in the basement.
- You've been in the basement of the Louvre?
Oh, yes.
I was an art history major at Vassar.
And so, what's down there?
Well, that's where the real show begins.
Unspoiled by dilettante.
Da Vinci, Michelangelo,
David, Chardin.
"Allow me to assist you, Patrice."
"Oh, let me light that for you, Monica."
"What, this?"
"This is my family crest."
"Been in the family for..."
"Oh, in the basement?"
"What do they have in the basement?
Why, the works of da Vinci"
"Michelangelo, Chardin, David"
"all surrounded by great coral sponges to absorb the moisture."
Just for the record, I was working it.
I was in the zone and I would have gotten her number if you hadn't turned the evening into a guided tour of the Louvre.
My apologies.
Let's get one thing straight.
Patrice, she thought you were cute - probably gay and cute.
And cute, Leo, that's the kiss of death.
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps? Certainly.
I believe this is her number.
As I see it, Patrice has not an inkling of your affections.
And it's no wonder.
You, Charles, are a merry-andrew.
A what?
Everything plays a farce to you.
Women respond to sincerity.
This requires pulling one's tongue from one's cheek.
No one wants to be romanced by a buffoon.
Now, that number rings her.
- Yes?
- So ring her tomorrow.
I can't. She gave the number to you.
Only because I told her of your affections.
Wha-What did you say?
Merely that you admired her but you were hesitant to make an overture since you'd been told she was courting another.
Shit. That's good!
Wha-What did she say?
She handed me the napkin.
Charles, it's quite late.
No, no, no, she won't be home yet.
I get her machine,
I leave a message.
Ball's in her court.
You're ladling calculation upon comedy.
The point is, to keep the ball in your court.
You're right. You're right.
Okay.
Nothing need be done till tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
Then I make my move.
An overture, Charles.
Make your intentions known.
Think of pleasing her, not vexing her.
No vexing.
You're intoxicated.
We should retire.
I'm sure Kate will be home.
I doubt it.
But it's nearly midnight.
You like her, don't you?
- Who?
- Kate.
- You do!
- Oh, Charles, stop.
You like my sister!
Well, you made your intentions known, right?
- Right?
- You've been drinking.
Leo, Commune is right around the corner.
We could stop in, you could give me a couple of pointers pull out a chair or two, you could throw out a gesture here or there.
Yeah, see, it's one thing with Patrice.
You don't give a shit.
It's a whole other ball of wax when it's a girl you like, huh?
Yeah, who's the merry-andrew now?
You want to vex my sister!
I have to confess that
I'm a little bit confused...
No. Thank you.
When you asked me to dinner tonight
I was under the impression that...
- we were here to discuss...
- The merger.
Yes. Right. Yes.
And a possible promotion.
Yes.
Yes, that, too.
And, well, dinner is winding down and we haven't really discussed anything even remotely relevant to what I thought we came here to...
I don't believe I've ever seen you this flustered, Kate.
You haven't even kissed me yet.
Yeah.
Right. Well...
I like you, J.J., I do.
I like you quite a bit.
As a matter of fact...
I think you would agree that a working... a successful working relationship requires a great deal of...
- What exactly is our working relationship?
- Kate...
Hi, Kate!
Hi, Charlie.
Wha... what are you doing here?
- We just thought we'd come by to say hi.
- Kate?
- J.J., right?
- Right.
Might I have a word with you?
- Now?
- In private.
No! No.
Mr. Margarine.
Please... please join us.
And where did you say it is?
- In Sussex.
- Near Balmore.
- Yes.
- Built in the 18th century.
Early 18th century.
Early? Are you quite sure?
Yes.
He's got pictures, Leopold.
Perhaps you were swindled, because I can assure you as of the late 19th century there's nothing but farmland near Balmore.
- You're mistaken.
- That's not possible.
Well, it's quite possible,
Leopold, that you are mistaken.
No, it is not possible...
Balmore is the only manor house in the county.
- I know because I grew up there.
- Leopold, it wasn't...
Leo, do you enjoy opera?
- I do. And do you?
- Oh, yes.
It keeps... keeps me alive.
Do you have a favorite?
Bohème. La Bohème.
- La Bohème?
- I've seen it 12 times.
That's... that's how
I learned to speak French.
- You speak French?
- Fluently.
Que ton visage est doux entouré par la lumière de la lune.
What did he say?
"How sweet your face looks gently encircled by the soft moonlight."
Oh, I like that.
From the opening scene of Bohème.
A stunning duet.
- Andre sings it to Mimi.
- Andre...
I invited Kate to the Met next week.
She's never been.
Patrone is singing Andre, and she turned me down.
Can you explain that, Leopold?
Well...
Bohème is one of man's great achievements and should not be missed.
But perhaps Kate resists on moral grounds.
- How so?
- Should we get the check?
Well, some feel that to court a woman in one's employ is nothing more than a serpentine effort to transform a lady to a whore.
J.J.
This guy's charming, Kate.
The Duke of Margarine thinks me a serpent.
- No, he doesn't.
- No, not a serpent.
That's too grand a word.
Simply a braggart and a cad who knows less French than I, if that's possible.
And by the way there's no Andre in
Bohème- it's Rudolfo.
And though it takes place in France it's rarely played in French, as it is written in Italian.
Good night.
Sorry.
Kate, might I have a word?
- Morning.
- Hi.
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- You want to read your paper?
- No, thank you, Charlie.
I want to go to work and try and clean up this mess you made.
You sure you don't...
Kate...
Uh, Kate!
What?
I just thought maybe you'd want a... kiwi for... the subway.
That's a papaya, Charlie.
Oh? You're right. Okay.
But while using the product 80% found the product too soft to be... effective.
This, of course, presents a conundrum for us marketeers.
How do we maintain a soft feel on the exterior of a plastic wrap or pack while retaining the useful tensile strength in the sheets?
Now, I'm going to suggest to the Summer Soft people to scale back to a limited release of the product...
Dearest Katherine...
I behaved as an imbecile last night
animated in part by drink,
in part by your beauty
and in part by my own foolish pride.
And for that
I am profoundly sorry.
Please accept as a gesture of apology
a private dinner on the rooftop tonight at 8 o'clock.
Okay, where are we on Farmer's Bounty?
Kate?
Care to share with us?
Farmer's Bounty?
Where we are?
Where we are is good.
Um, as you know, we found our spokesperson.
The response room final showed a 96 in the top two boxes.
His key female descriptors... were "handsome", "romantic" with several write-ins of...
"What a hunk."
Great.
Would you hold this?
J.J.?
J.J., hi.
Um, listen, I just want to apologize again for what happened last night.
There was no need for things to get that way.
I appreciate that.
So... everything's okay?
Yes, Kate.
I didn't jump; I fell.
There's a difference- a subtle difference, but nonetheless a difference.
Why did you fall, then?
Because there was no elevator.
And you feel that was your fault?
You know what, I'm sorry.
I got to concede that you are a very busy man and I'm sure there are plenty of people clamoring for your particular brand of attention.
Unfortunately,
I am not one of them.
So if you don't mind, would you please unlock this door?
I'm concerned you might be a danger to yourself.
And in such cases...
- state law requires...
- Hello?
Will someone please open this...
Fuck...
Everything all right,
Dr. Geisler?
Yes, Gretchen.
Everything's fine.
So, Stuart, I'm going to prescribe something called Prolixin.
It's a mild antipsychotic.
Nothing too strong.
"I was wondering..."
"I was wondering if you would like to accompany me..."
"If you have a previous engagement,
I understand."
Tonight at 7:00, 7:30.
Please don't be late.
I got to talk to you about this, okay?
'Cause there's some shit here that just cannot be said.
Did you assemble a bouquet for Patrice?
I'll just get one of these, but look, you just can't tell a woman she's...
- "gracefully serene."
- No, no, this one won't do.
Wha... Why?
What is wrong with this one?
The orange lily implies extreme hatred.
The begonia and lavender danger and suspicion, respectively.
Every flower has a meaning, Charles.
Might I suggest the amaryllis, which declares the recipient a most splendid beauty.
Or the cabbage rose.
Darci!
- What is this?
- It's a reply to Leopold's invitation.
You're going, right?
I haven't decided yet.
Oh, you haven't decided if you want to have dinner on your rooftop with a duke?
...Who thinks he's from 1876!
- No! And I would appreciate it if...
- Kate, come on, okay?
I don't know what this guy did to piss you off but that is the best apology letter in the history of mankind.
Just sign it, Kate.
It's 4:30. We'll fax it.
Kate McKay's office.
They hung up.
Hi. Is Patrice there?
Hey, Patrice?
- Hi. It's me, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.
I was just calling to find out if you got my flowers- your flowers.
I was calling to see if you got the flowers I sent you.
Yeah, I did.
And I was just wondering if you would like to go to a movie tonight and maybe afterwards perhaps accompany me to a dinner?
I mean, I...
I understand completely if you're otherwise engaged.
But, uh, you know,
I just wanted to say that, um...
Yeah?
I wanted to say that you've, uh... you've made an impression on me.
And-and it-it's not just the way you look-
I mean, which are great.
Your looks are, you know, top-top shelf.
But, uh...
I don't know, it's, um...
What?
You're graceful.
You know, the way you move and speak.
I mean, some people have a way with words and, you know, you... you do.
The bottom line is, I like you.
Patrice?
What about 7:00?
7:00 would be heaven. Okay.
See you then.
It worked! It worked cool!
Who's going out with Patrice?
Charlie's going out with Patrice!
Over there! Charlie's going over there!
Oh, better go get ready.
Better go get changed.
Shouldn't change too much, though
'cause she likes me for who I am.
- Hey.
- Charlie, you look fantastic.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I got a date.
I got to go. Bye.
Bye.
- Kate?
- Yeah?
Um, have a good time tonight.
Bye.
My God.
This is beautiful.
The very word for which
I was searching.
May I?
She was a real romantic, my mom.
When Prince Charles and Lady Di got married, she had a party.
She made crumpets and jam.
It was like a Super Bowl party, but for moms.
She cried for a week.
I don't know the story of Prince Charles and Lady Di.
Oh, you don't want to.
It's a cautionary tale. Further proof.
- Of what?
- That you can't live a fairy tale.
I'm not very good with men.
Perhaps you haven't found the right one.
Maybe. Or... maybe the whole love thing is just a grown-up version of Santa Claus just a myth we've been fed since childhood so we keep buying magazines and joining clubs and doing therapy and watching movies with hit pop songs played over love montages all in this pathetic attempt to explain why our love Santa keeps getting caught in the chimney.
Otis always told me love is a leap.
Lamentably,
I was never inspired to jump.
By my 30th birthday,
I had, according to my uncle become a blemish on the family name.
So he brought me to this country with the proviso
I marry an American.
A girl with a good deal of, um...
Charm?
Money. Since my parents died our family fortune had become, shall we say, depleted.
I would be married now if I hadn't followed Stuart.
I was to announce a bride that night.
Who?
I don't know.
Someone.
One of them.
What are you doing?
I'm just cleaning up.
Would you do me the honor of a dance?
Please?
- I am not much of a dancer.
- You're doing famously, then.
Leopold, this was lovely.
But I don't know if I can leap even if I am inspired.
People might think
I'm brave, but I'm not.
The brave are simply those with the clearest vision of what is before them.
Glory and danger alike and notwithstanding, go out to meet it.
Hey.
Morning, Charles.
How was your evening with Patrice?
Good. Nice.
How was yours?
Good. Nice.
So, Leo, don't you think it's time you tell me who you are?
- What do you mean?
- I mean... it's a blast doing the duke thing with you 24/7 but...
I don't want to see Kate go through Stuart: The Sequel.
I know she seems pretty tough but she hasn't had it that easy.
She's always getting stuck with people who don't hold up their end.
Like me.
- I just don't...
- I understand, Charles.
- You do?
- Yes.
So...
Who are you?
I am the man who loves your sister.
Okay, pour the soap in.
Shut the lid.
Push the drawers in.
Close the door, and you push this button.
A word to the wise:
Don't press that till she wakes up.
So she sees you doing it.
How clever.
The proverbial tree in the woods.
If a man washes a dish and no one sees it...
Did it happen?
- A cup of coffee, my dear.
- Thank you.
Breakfast?
Nine-grain toast with strawberries and mascarpone, Madame.
It's apparently low... in polyunsaturates.
It's really good.
It's good.
What should we do today?
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.
Thank you. No.
You know what makes me happy?
You don't look good in those.
They're so completely inappropriate for you.
Kate.
Kate, Kate, come.
Leopold? Leopold?
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It boggles the mind that it is still here.
This is my uncle's home. Well, was.
This is where I lived.
Good Lord.
A portrait of my parents... and me.
Leopold?
Look, I just don't think that we should just be barging around here like that.
Leopold?
My old quarters.
What are you doing?
The place where I put everything I most cared for.
Things I didn't want my uncle to touch.
My mother's ring.
Oh, it's beautiful.
You know,
I live on an island connected to everything by bridges and I never cross them.
I've lived here for ten years and I've... never been to the other side of anything.
You've never traveled?
No.
Do you...
What?
Do you miss where you're from?
In a way, I...
I miss...
I miss its rhythm.
It was slower?
Quite a bit slower.
- Like today?
- Yes.
Do you hear that, Leopold?
Do you hear that music?
Yes.
Have you ever seen the movie
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Uh, no.
"No."
Not yet.
You see that guy down there with the light on?
He listens to the soundtrack of Breakfast at Tiffany's every night until exactly midnight.
And then he turns his light off goes to sleep.
* My huckleberry friend *
* Moon River *
* And me. *
Oh, that means it's Sunday.
Oh, I don't want it to be Sunday.
I want more of this.
More 1876.
But, Kate, you don't work on
Sundays. We can have more.
Well, I don't know,
'cause Sunday is the day before the day I work, so... it gets poisoned.
I see.
Besides, tomorrow is the day we shoot your commercial.
Kate.
Would you...?
Might you ever... consider...?
Hmm?
It's time for bed.
I'm so relaxed.
That's all right.
You're tucking me in.
Yes.
You're my Otis.
Yes, Your Grace.
Oh, wait.
Hey, hey, don't... don't go upstairs.
Stay.
I love you, Kate McKay.
Scone, Your Grace?
Ah, thank you, Millard.
And you brought the Farmer's Bounty?
But of course.
Ah!
Fresh creamery butter.
Is there anything more comforting?
I say there is and perhaps you'll agree when you sample fat-free
Farmer's Bounty with the genuine essence of creamery butter in every bite.
With every mouthful of Farmer's Bounty you shall receive butter's luxurious comfort in your mouth without adding to the luxury of your waistline.
Farmer's Bounty.
Now, on this one take a bite and smile.
And... cut!
All right, check gate.
Good enough for me.
Can we get a Dedo up here and something...
Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me. Is this an actual sample of Farmer's Bounty?
Yeah. Why?
This tastes like saddle soap.
Well, it's not really your concern, now, is it?
Not my concern?
This product tastes like raw suet.
How is that not my concern?
Hey, pal, it's a paycheck!
- A Paycheck?
- Wait a minute...
This is an outrage!
Don't worry about the taste.
Come back. We need another shot.
Something that brings the light up on this...
Leopold.
Leopold!
Leopold, what's going on?
What are you doing?
They-they need you back in there.
Do they?
Yeah. They have to shoot the rest of the spot. They're not finished yet.
Well, I want no part of it.
Why?
Have you tasted it?
- Farmer's Bounty?
- Yes, Farmer's Bounty.
- Yeah, I've tasted it.
- It's revolting.
I know.
You know it's revolting yet you have no qualms enlisting me to endorse it?
It's diet; it's supposed to be awful.
I mean, what is the problem?
The problem is that for no reason beyond my affection for you
I find myself peddling pond scum to an unsuspecting public.
Hey, listen, you know the stakes are very high for me here.
- You can't just quit because...
- Yes, I can. And so can you.
When one finds oneself participating in an endeavor entirely without merit, one withdraws.
No. No. Because sometimes you have to do things that you don't like.
Sometimes you have to suck it up and finish what you started.
It's part of life.
You sound like my uncle.
Look, Leopold, Jansen Foods is a very important account for my company.
If you don't go back in there then I get into a lot of trouble.
Is this what you do at work, Kate?
Research methods to deceive people?
Refine lies until they resemble truth?
It's no wonder you dread your work week.
Oh! Man, I don't have time for this.
What has happened to the world?
You have every convenience, every comfort
- yet no time for integrity.
- No.
What I don't have time for are pious speeches by 200-year-old men who've never had to work a day in their life.
You have no idea what I've done with my life.
And you-you have no idea what I've done with mine!
I haven't had all that many comforts and conveniences, Leopold, because I've been paying dues all of my life and I'm tired, and I need a rest and if I have to peddle a little pond scum to get one then so be it.
Very well.
We're kidding ourselves,
Leopold.
In point of fact I don't even really know who you are.
You still don't believe
I'm the man I say I am?
We had a great weekend; that's that.
Now it's Sunday.
It's over.
* There's such a lot of world to see. *
I know.
I know, I know, it sounds crazy- talking about... finding a crack in time under the East River.
But in, in point, in point fact, Gretchen you know... it is no more crazy than, uh, a dog finding a rainbow.
Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.
They don't see color.
- Really?
- Just like we can't see time.
We can feel it.
Oh... we can feel it passing but, we can't see it; it's just a blur.
It's like, uh... it's like we're riding in a, in a supersonic train and the world is just blowing by.
But imagine if we could stop that train, Gretchen. Hmm?
Imagine if we could stop that train get out, look around and see time for what it really is.
A universe, a world, a thing as unimaginable as color to a dog.
And as real and tangible as that chair you're sitting in.
Now, if we could see it like that
I mean, really look at it then... maybe we could see the flaws as well as the form.
And that's it.
It's that simple.
That's all I discovered.
I'm just a... just a guy who saw a crack in a chair that no one else could see.
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.
Only, uh... none of the other dogs believe me.
I believe you.
I can see that some things have... happened since I went away.
But... you have to go back.
You understand you'll be going back to the same day you left,
- April 28th.
- Yes.
So you understand you might be repeating a few things.
You might even see me.
Just don't follow me this time.
Can I go in?
J.J., you asked to see me?
Come on in.
I understand you, uh, put out a fire at the shoot yesterday.
Guess Mr. Duke's got a bit of an ego on him, huh?
Yeah.
I'm going to England this week and I made a decision.
You're going to be the top New York honcho.
So, this is going to be your office.
I'll be making it official tonight.
Thank you, J.J. Thank you.
You've earned it.
I'm heading over to Jansen to sign the buy-out papers,
FTC stuff. So I'll... see you later at the thing.
- What did he say?
- I got it.
Oh, my God.
It's wonderful!
Just give me one second.
I'm sorry, Darci. One second.
Hi. You've reached Stuart.
Please leave a message.
Hello?
Leopold, I-I don't know where you are but if you're there, please pick up.
I got it.
I got the job.
I'm the new senior vice president at CRG.
Uh, please call me. I...
I'm sorry about the way things came down yesterday.
I apologize. I...
I just really need to see you.
I'd love to see you tonight but I have this thing at Farmer's Bounty.
But I'd love to see you later.
I miss you..
I miss you.
Hey, Stuart.
How're you feeling?
Where's Leo?
He went home.
He was for real..
He was for real!
Holy shit!
Look at this!
Oh, my God.
Chilled, do you understand? Chilled.
And be sure to leave another case of the Chateau Laffite.
Yes, sir.
Leopold! Where have you been?!
Otis, I demand explication!
It's half past five.
He's not even dressed!
He'll be ready, my lord,
I assure you.
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!
This is the invitation. You've got... your table number, your car number and I've got Morty down there- the guy you like. He's on the Madison side.
Also, your phone sheet is in here.
And Stuart called you a couple times. So...
Have a great time tonight.
You look beautiful.
I don't think this is right.
I'm supposed to be going to 2640 Madison.
That's where we are,
Miss McKay.
Have a nice evening.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Invitation, please.
No, no.
Look, they're still plugged.
But they're just randomly seeded with Minoxidil.
- No cornrows.
- Excuse me.
Hey, Kate.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
To hell with the facelifts.
I'm into mini-lifts now.
Just a tiny little bit each year.
I hear they'll bring them back to 840 next year.
So I'm just running out my lease.
- Kate, congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.
Hey, Kate.
J.J. Hi, Barry.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
Anyway, I'm just glad they've got them fixed.
I was going to move my office down to the lobby.
Excuse me.
Kate, don't powder your nose for too long.
I'm going to give this speech in a couple of minutes.
Okay.
All this time I thought that I had pretezled fate and it had to be untwisted.
But what I never considered is that the whole thing is a pretzel.
A beautiful 4D pretzel of kismetic inevitability.
Okay, you know what, get off Park as soon as you can, and then go up Madison.
I was supposed to go back.
He was supposed to come forward then he was supposed to go back again and... so was she.
Now it is my pleasure and honor... to turn this over to my friend,
J.J. Camden...
...to take priests to the bell tower.
You speak of progress and invention.
But what I offer you downstairs is reality.
Take a wife. Marry.
Let us not bother with this banter, Uncle.
Tell me whom you want me to marry.
Well, who has the most money?
Well... that would be Miss Tree of the Trees of Schenectady.
Good. Consider it done.
Otis, fetch the ring.
I will announce at midnight.
Invitation, please.
Uh, hello.
My name is Stuart Besser.
I'm sorry, I know we're not on your list
- but his sister is Kate McKay...
- I'm sorry, sir, I can't just let you in.
...and I learned that there was one thing that I could do and it didn't require money and it didn't require a fancy school.
I learned that I could please people.
And there is nothing wrong with that!
I am a people pleaser, people!
Thank you so much. I am so...
Kate!
Stuart!
Charlie! What are you doing?
- You should look at these pictures, Kate.
- No! No-no-no-no!
Now it's time to introduce the woman who's going to be holding down the fort in our New York offices our own little rising star,
Miss Kate McKay!
- Just listen to me for a second, please?
- They're introducing me downstairs right now!
I'm sorry I was a lousy boyfriend.
I'm sorry I let you down.
I know all you wanted was someone you could trust...
Oh, Stuart, really
I can't talk about...
No, Kate, just listen to me, okay? Please.
Maybe we weren't such a waste of time after all.
- I mean, maybe there's a reason I was your guy.
- What are you talking about?
Maybe I was supposed to help you find your guy... Leopold.
You got to go back, Kate.
You got to go back there.
Go back?
How?
You have to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes.
Kate? Katie?
Kate, just look at the pictures, okay?
Is there a... a Kate McKay in the house?
- Yeah. Here I am!
- Kate?
Here she is. Here she is.
Well, without further ado the new senior vice president of our New York offices.
Here she is, ladies and gentlemen- Kate McKay.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Quite an entrance, huh?
Thank you, J.J.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Wow.
Well...
This is a great night.
We here at...
CRG have always considered ourselves to be in the "Find what people want" business and at Jansen, you guys are in the
"Make what people want" business.
So, imagine what we can do together.
We'll be able to find out exactly what people want and make it... for them.
So... yeah, so our customers... will be able to get exactly...
...what they...
...they want.
And...
...it's a great thing to... to get what you want.
Uh, it's a really good thing.
Unless what you thought you wanted wasn't really what you wanted because what you really...
...wanted you couldn't imagine, or you didn't think it was possible.
But... but what if someone came along who knew exactly what you wanted without asking?
They just knew. Like they could... hear your heart beating or listen to your thoughts.
And what if they were sure of themselves and they didn't have to take a poll and they loved you... and you hesitated?
And...
I have to go.
I...
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
Kate?
Stuart, can you tell me in short, complete sentences featuring no words over two syllables why exactly
I am in these pictures?
- Probably not.
- Try.
- Because you were there.
- I wasn't.
I would remember. Believe me,
I would remember if I was there.
Because you're going to be there.
If we get there in time.
These are pictures of the past, not the future.
Not exactly.
Theoretically speaking if you go to the past in the future then your future lies in the past.
And that is a picture of you in the future, in the past.
We'll have to make a run for it. Let's go.
Come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go. Come on!
Whoa, where the hell do you think you're going?
$6.80 on the meter, pal.
It's going to close, Kate!
Come on!
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention?
The Duke of Albany will be making a very important announcement in 20 minutes from this very stage.
And I believe it shall be an announcement that will justify the playing of a bridal waltz.
Okay... this is the hard part.
- What?
- The girder.
- The girder?
- You have to cross the girder, Kate.
That girder?
Stuart, I can't cross that girder.
- You love him, right?
- What?
Leopold.
You love him, right?
Yeah.
That's all you need to know.
Now go.
- You'll be fine.
- Katie...
Charlie... Charlie, what am I...
How are you gonna...
No, go! Don't worry about me.
- Now, Kate, now.
- Now?
- The portal's going to close.
- All right.
Go.
-Oh!
- Jesus.
Oh, God.
You can do it.
Don't look down.
Charlie...
I'll love you forever.
Love you.
It's okay.
Lady... lady, what are you doing?
Step back, lady.
- It's okay.
- Step back from there, lady.
Come back, lady.
Central, be advised, this is Bridge Post Four.
I've got a jumper on the southwest location of the bridge.
Have a supervisor, ESU and Harbor respond to this location forthwith.
Ladies and gentlemen it is with a glad heart and a bright eye that I proudly introduce my beloved nephew
Leopold, Duke of Albany.
Thank you, Uncle Millard.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, madam, but this is a private affair.
No, you don't seem to understand.
I need to get inside.
- I need to get inside right now and...
- What seems to be the problem?
Are you Otis?
Well, let us proceed.
Please raise your glasses... so we may toast to my bride-to-be the woman whose welfare and happiness shall be my solemn duty to maintain.
The future Duchess of Albany...
Kate McKay.
Of the McKays of...?
Massapequa..
Massapequa.
- I love you.
- I love you.

Airai has if!
When the new malakal lost their third challenge in a row,
Chet volunteered to be voted out,
Expat tribal council erik received two throw-away voteses and chet got the rest leaving two fans, Tracy and erik,on ozzy's tribe.
13 are left.
Who will be voted out tonight?
Anybody check the eggs this morning?
I did.There wasn't any.
I bet we should cut it open right now.
It's only laid two eggs right now.
Let's kill it right now.
The chicken issue. Come ogirls.
I think tracy started it for some reason.
I'm going to blame it on tracy.
We have three chickens that lay three eggs almost every day.
No.
No. It's not going to happen.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter the way this game works.
It's three weeks,three chickens.
Tracy is breeding a lot of insecurity around camp.
Of course,she's trying to play the game.
She's trying to scramble to save her own asis,but we don't need that.
Look at this,crabs.
We have massive crabs.
There's plenty of other food. We have to just get it.
Ozzy is in control of this tribe.
He's like the kingpin.
He tells you what you can and can't do.
He tells you when you're going to eat.
He cooks the food and then we have to wait until ozzy says,"eat it."
It's crazy. It's just crazy.
Ozzy is going to win this thing if we don't get him out of this game.

<font color="#ffff00">Survivor
Season016 Episode07</font>
We've been on a rain streak.
I was attacked by skeeters.
I just want to get clean.
Another day in the lap of luxury.
How do we do it? Ladies?
They complain about the rain.
But they didn't get wet because we were in the cave.
I mean,it could be like it was before--
Outside,under a bush,getting pummeled by this rain.
I bet nothing can capture the true essence of the stench in this bunk.
And how filthy we are are right now.
Deal with the funk.
Ouldn't have smelled better than before.
Just relax. We're not going to be here forever.
This is a game called can the survivor."
I don't even see where there's a...
- Sign of hope?
- No.
Is my face just dirty?
This is just the stupidest thing i did in my life.
Just probably just because i'm crabby.
I'm not a morning opinion.
The moods out here are you're on one day and feeling good,and the next day it's just all crap.
Today,this morning,it's a crap day.
Could we just get a day of sunshine,please!
Wash and dry our clothes.
Oh,my god.
Thinking of home and my washer and dryer and food and my daughter and my husband and...
It's going to make me cry.
It's going to make me want to be there.
Nope,still here. Damn!
Ozzy is amazing.
I honestly like ozzy.
He's an awesome guy,and i want to learn.
I want to grow.
I want to go outside the small scope that i've lived in and just see a lot more of the world,
And everybody thinks ozzy is,look,the wonder kid,or whatever.
And i'm like,i can do that.
I can climb a coconut tree,too.
Some of them look like they're stable,b then you pull it,and they'll pull right off.
When you grab the green palm frond,give it a little test.
Erik and ozzy are like the "lion king."
The father,when he was teaching the cub,and you can just see,like,stars.
Whenever he says ozzy's name,like,stardust comes out of his mouth.
Erik is just like,"ozzy..."
A couple of more steps and that you are there.
Cool,huh?
Good job,dude.
They're bonding right now.
Oh,my god.
Yes! Gouf got good nuts now.
I think if ozzy was to propose marriage to erik right now,done deal.
Um,i want to move the boat.
Okay.
It makes way more sense to have it on that side.
It will be fast.
They asked me to help move the boat to the back beach.
We better be able to get back,i know that.
Before it's sundown.
Everybody knows there's no secret i'm not a strong swimmer,
But being a team player,you think you can get more fish on the back beach,
I'll help you row to the back beach.
When we get way out in the middle of nowhere,and ozzy decides,
"well,the reef is right there.
Come on,we can geteally big fish at the reef."
I'm nervous as hell.
I've never been that far out in the ocean in a little wooden boat.
We're not that far from shore,guys.
We're not.Look.
It's right there.
I swear,this is where I come myself.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Don't worry.
Just trust me for a little bit.
There could be a giant clam out there that will feed us for the rest of the time.
Maybe there will be a pearl in there i can give cirie for paddling out here.
Ozzy is about numero uno,and that's oscar.
Yea,reef,reef.
Oh,you're unhappy!
They'll have this little reef adventure at my expense today,but it won't happen again.
Come on in,guys!
Airai getting your first look at the new malakal tribe.
Chet voted out at the last tribal council.
Guys ready to get to today's challenge?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
This is a traditional microneegz money stone.
For years,these stones were the currency in micronesia.
The larger the stone,the more value.
Today they're a part of your challenge.
For today's challenge,four of you will be blindfolded.
The other two tribe members will use verbal direction to guide you
As you push a giant monmoney stone through the jungle course.
Along the way,you will crush the tiles at four stations revealing a pair of smaller money stones.
You'll then use those eight stones to solve a rotating cog puzzle.
First tribe to get it right wins reward.
- Want to know what you're playing for?
- Yeah.
Close your eyes and imagine you're under a beautiful refreshing waterfall.
Oh,god!
And you're cleaning your body,and you're washing your hair. that's your reward.
It is the herbal essence great escape spa.
The winning tribe will be taken to an island.
You'll have plenty of products.
You can wash up,get clean.
When you're finished,i a nice little snack toound out the day.
- Worth playing for?
- Absolutely.
In addition,the winning tribe will send one member from the losing tribe to exile island.
You will also choose somebody,again,from your own tribe to join them.
Airai you have one extra member.
Who is going to sit this one out?
I am.
All right,natalie,take a spot over here.
Give the rest of you a minute to strategize.
We'll get started.
All right,here we go.
For reward,survivors ready?
Go!
Come oguys,come on,come on,come on! Keep going.
Follow my voice,follow my voice. Keep coming straight.
Keep coming,keep coming,keep coming.
Come on,straight,straight.
To your left,to your left. The other way!
That's right
Cirie,it's backwards,right,right,right.
Stop!Come across!
Malakal is through their first tile.
Keep going. Okay,you're at the thing.
You have to pivot left a little.
Straight,keep going!
Keep going.Straight.
You broke the stone.
Airai through the first tile.
They have their first money stone.
To your left-- no,i'm sorry,right.
To your left,to your left.
Back up.
Right,right,keep going,keep going!
Straight over it this way!
Got it,got it!
Malakal smashes their second tile.
Perfect,perfect! Straight.
Another you broke it.
Airai smashes their second tile.
Over here! Come on n-come on!
Stop! Come forward.
Slow,slow. malakal lined up for their third tile and they have it.
Over here!
One tile left to break before you start working on that puzzle.
Come straight towards me,straight toward me.
It didn't break. It didn't break.Back it up.
Which way do we move it now?
Shut up and listen!
Pivot right,pivot right.
Come straight through,come straight through.
Airai smashes their third tile.
Turn to your right a little more.
Straight across,right now!
Cirie not messing around.
They're straight through.
Malakal has all eight.
Start working on the puzzle.
Three people.
Okay,you're almost at the last one guys. Keep coming straight.
Perfect. You should be able to come straight through.
Yes n-good jock,good job.
Airai has their eighth and final money stone.
Start working on the puzzle.
This pusle will only go together one way that does not mean certain pieces won't fit in
And appear to be right and still be wrong.
Okay.
It is trial and error.
I don't think you force it that way.
James hoping it's in the right spot.
This one prit here. Right here!
Eliza,james,kathy,not making much progress.
That's it,that's.
Malakal thinks they're getting closer.
We need one more. Do we got it.
We got it!
Malakal thinks they have it.
Malakal wins reward!
Malakal,congratulations.
Thank you.
Mice big reward coming your way.
First things first,choosing somebody from airai to go to exile island.
Jason.
Jason,you're going back to exile island.
Now,malakal,you have to choose somebody from your own tribe to go to exile island,
Which means they will not go on the spa reward.
Can you take one for the team?
Me?
Oh,god. I'm going to exile.
All right,tracy.
Jason,get your stuff.
The boat's waiting on you.
Airai,got nothing for you. Grab your stuff.Head back to camp.
Malakal,come get your stuff.
The boat is waiting for you.
Oh,damn!
Cookies!
It was so fun tow see erik.
For one,he was experiencing reward for the first time since he's been here.
I'm so happy right now.
It was really cool.
I mean,he's like a wide-eyed kid in a candy store.
It made me feel proud that we were able to win and bring him in and let him experience this.
That was nice.
What is that?
I think that's our shower right there.
You want to go shower?
I'll come scrub your back when you're halfway through.
Oh,my gosh.
Ami,come on!
Oh,my god!
Everyone,get naked.
My goodness.
I looked over and saw a couple of pair of boobs, and ozzy's head smack dab in the middle.
The only thing funnier was erik drooling from the side.
Hey,to each his own.
If you feel free like that,then by all means,get free.
I just wouldn't do it.
Oh,oh,man.
This is as perfect as i could have ever hoped for.
It's a freaking mon-freaking-soon.
It came out of nowhere.
It's completely different.
You watch this show at home,and when they show the rain, they show it for,like,30 second.
They're not showing that you're standing in the rain or trying to sleep
While you're being rained on for five,six hours straight,nonstop.
We had to stand out there and james went out in the rain and cut a clam,
And we had to sit around and eat a raw clam because there's no fire,
And you're all just digging in it with your hands like you're animals.
You okay if i put a little on my lemon.
It's disgusting.
And it's full of sand,and it's full of dirt.
And the coconut you're cleaning falls on the ground,but you don't care.
You just put it back in because it's food.
And it's just savagery. It's--
It's like you're caved men. You know.
Never in a million years would i ever do this twice.
Is it scary in there?
It just rained and it rained,and we crawled way down into the cave.
And it's miserable.
And it's awful. And it's dirty.
And you don't even know what's dead and crawling--
We sleep in the caves with bats and rats and crawley things.
It's hard to explain that experience that it's just--
It's just so uncomfortable.
It's so unpleasant.
And i said it myself the other day this is the stupidest thing i've ever done in my life.
This is the dumbest thing i've ever done.
When i woke thup morning,i hadn't gotten any sleep.
Again,we were in the cave.
It rained all night,and i was looking for some kind of strength, and i couldn't find it.
I was thinking of put something wood on the beach,
But i don't know how high the tide will come in.
I can have one more hug,one more?
I need one more hug to get me through the day.
I'm just so out of it,james.
It's okay.
Everybody has their day.
You know,i was trying to send-- it sounds so stupid--
I was trying to send,like,vibes to my daughter,maddie.
You know,"can you hear me? You can feel me?
I need your help.
Of i need your help to help me through this because i can't do this.
And i couldn't-- i couldn't feel her.
I can't feel my family.
I don't know what it is,but i'm just downward spiraling
And i can't take another minute i can't.
I can't.
I know it's sunny,it's beautiful,it's like ooh! But i can't.
I can't be here one more minute. I can't take it.
And iust want you guys to be okay and not hate me for it.
I just can't take it one more minute,i can't.
- You have to be 100% sure- - i'm 100% sure.
I can't. I can't do it anymore.
Not to make light of how you're feeling,but we all feel like that today.
We're all going bananas.
And i'm not trying to make light of what's going on in your head.
It's a tough day.
It's just a hard day.
- Let's walk in the sun a little bit.
- Come here,come here.
- Iment to go now.
- It's okay.
I want them to come and get a boat and pick me up
And take me away because i can't do this anymore. I can't.
- I tried so hard.
- I know,sweetie,i know.
- I tried so hard.
- I know.
Last night was a horrible night,and i think it just took its told on-- Toll on kathy.
Kathy just really got in her head today.
Everything compiled and built up one upon another, and she's just severely depressed.
Iust want to go.
She just came up to us on the beach,baulg,crying,
And told us she can't take another day out here and she has to go. She's done.
She's quitting the game.
Hello,guys.
So,well,i got word that you wanted to see me. You've had enough.
What's going on?
- It's 19 days you've been out here.
- I know.
Let me come over-- let me just come over here.
I kind of,um...
Sat on the boat for a while today,and i-- i couldn't feel my family. You know.And...
I'm never leaving my baby girl or husband again ever for this amount of time ever again.
So what is it that-- you've had a tough time out here.
You've had-- you've had as tough as anybody with all the time on exile.
But you weathered all that.
So you want to leave,you're leaving.
There's no-- i'm not here to talk you into staying.
- That's for sure.
- Right.
I just want to understand it.
It was doing it everybody else.
Doing it for my husband.
Doing it for my sister who wants to live vicariously through me.
I don't want to hurt these people.
So i want to stay to help them this is like the first decision i've made that is,
Like,for me,you know,because i don't want to let anybody down.
I don't want anybody to hate me.
I don't want anybody to think that i'm quitting.
This adventure means different things to different people.
It represents different things to different people.
You certainly have given it your best.
Yeah.
And all's going to be okay.
- Ready to get out of here?
- I am.
Let's get your stuff.
Thanks.
- I'm sorry,guys.
- Don't apologize.
I'm sorry.
You know,kathy's been through a lot,and most of it is she lost most of her motivation,
So what's the point of going through the suffering.
It was nice to get to know you these last couple of days.
She just said she's had enough and she's quitting.
Which is sad,but it's up to her.
You can't fault her. You can't be upset with her.
Hope she has a good trip,and i'm sure i'll see her again.
So the airai is down to six.
In spite of winning challenges.
Game continues.
See you soon.
Bye.
Kathy leaving,it's sad,but at the same time,life goes on here,
And there's a reality to the fact that the sun is going down,
And we haven't had water in three days,
And we haven't had a cooked meal because we haven't had fire.
So "survivor" continues for the rest of us.
I think you got a dose of who oscar really is.
With the boat ride yesterday.And-- i'm starting to see that.
He's kind of arrogant.
You think?
Kind of bothering me.
Amanda got to see how there's a selfish,arrogant part to ozzy.
It's so sad. Very sad.
And if i got that out of the trip,then,okay,
I can suck it up because there was a benefit to it,letting her see,you know ozzy is about ozzy.
I don't know,like,i've been trying to figure out
If people really think ozzy is the best thing in the world Or if they're just playing.
Did you hear erik?
"oh,my god,if he wasn't here we'd die."
It's like,"shut up,erik."
How can we vote erik,though?
How many of us is it?
Because ozzy is not going to vote erik.
He's kind of in love with erik right now.
They climbed that coconut tree.
He just worships the ground that he walks on.
He'll never get rid of erik.
I think it's the best move to make.
To get rid of erik?
Maybe.
Ozzy's not going to do it.
We just have to let him think he's in complete control.
You know what i'm saying?
Come on in,guys.
Malakal,getting your first look at the new airai tribe.
Kathy has left the game.
- Kathy?
- What?
We'll bring jason and tracy in from exile.
I'll explain what happened.
Well,hello! let me kitchen everybody up on what's going on.
Yesterday,kathy sent word that she wanted out of the game.
I went over to airai's camp.
She said,i've had enough. I need to go."
We packed up her belongings. She quit.
Both tribes at six.
- All right,you guys ready to get to today's immunity challenge?
- Yeah.
First things first,give it up,eliza.
Once again,immunity is back up for grabs.
On my "go," one member of each tribe will race across a floating bridge carrying one end of a piece of rope.
When you reach the platform,you'll clip the rope into large puzzle piece,
And then hang on as the rest of the tribe will crank a giant Winch holding you and the puzzle piece back to shore.
Once you have collected all five puzzle pieces,
Two tribe members will unfold the bundle
And use the pieces to form a puzzle in the form of a perfect square.
- Make sense?
- Yeah.
I'll give you a chance to strategize and we'll get started.
Eliza and ozzy first off.
Here we go for immunity,survivors ready? Go!
Come on,ozzy!
You got it eliza!
Come on,ozzy!
Go,go,go!
Ozzy first to the puzzle piece. Eliza right there.

Oh,get...
Help it off!Help it off!

Only two puzzle pieces left.
- You got it,girl.
- Almost there!
Ozzy having no trouble on this bridge.
Parvati reaches the end. She's clipped in.
Parvati now being dragged in.
Ozzy reaches the end of the platform quickly.
There you go!
Ozzy like he's on a boogie board.
Ozzy's going to go again.
Malakal with their fourth puzzle piece.
Parvati back with the third puzzle piece for airai.
Natalie heading out on the course.
Malakal leads 4-3.
You got it,nat!
Come on,ozzy!
Ozzy heads out for that fifth and final puzzle piece for malakal.
Natalie losing a lot of time for airai.
Ozzy's coming back with that fifth and final piece.
Natalie's at the platform and clipped in.
Hold on!
Malakal pulling him back.
Ozzy really working it like it's a board.
Malakal has all five pieces. Go!
- Two puzzle makers.
- Go,go,go!
Amanda and cirie start working on the puzzle for malakal.
Eliza heads out for that fifth and final puzzle piece per airai.
Malakal already working on that puzzle with a big lead.
This puzzle will form a perfect square.
Go,go!
Eliza clips in to the fifth puzzle piece for airai.
The quicker you get started,the faster you will finish.
Eliza back with the final piece!
Go!
Jason and eliza going to work on the puzzle.
Amanda and cirie working on the puzzle for malakal.
Immunity on the line.
You guys are doing great!
These pieces are heavy,going to be hard to move.
Jason and eliza still untying.
It's okay,guys,get them untied.
We have them untied. We just need to get them out.
Malakal with a big lead already starting to work on this puzzle.
Eliza and jason have all five of their pieces untied.
They're starting to work on the puzzle.
Right there. Push that one over,amanda!
Amanda and cirie now starting to struggle a bit.
Jason and eliza have a different strategy,spreading all the piss out,looking for patterns.
Help her pull this one!
Help her pull this one!
Cirie and amanda really slowing down.
Eliza and jason starting to make progress.
There you go.
Turn it,turn it! Right here,right here.
That one might be the center.
Sirry and amanda taking their time.
Eliza and jason trying to shove one last piece in. It will fit?
Is it right?
Airai wins immunity!
Airai,category-- congratulations,immunity is yours once again.
For the third straight time,airai wins immunity,safe from tribal council.
Malakal,tribal council tonight.
Where one of you is going home.
Grab your stuff. See thru.
Airai,head out. Nice job.
Hey,oz,i'm sor sorry about the puzzle.
I feel like crap about it.
It was so easy.
That's all right.
None of us are going home.
Yeah,but which one of them?
We need to keep erik.
So then who do we choose?
I think it just makes more sense...
Ozzy is wanting erik to stay because he's got a good relationship going with erik,
But i just feel like i can work more with tracy.
She's more into the game,and being third or fourth among stirry,ozzy,And amanda is something that's definitely always on my mind.
Could i betray him if it comes down to that?
Sometimes you have to pull the dirty cards it stay in the game.
Let me tell you what's has gone.
The girls want to get rid of erik.
Ozzy wants to get rid of you.
- It was his idea to send you to exile.
- I know.
And,so if we can get ozzy to vote for you and us three girls to vote for,
Uh,erik,then you,me,and erik can vote for ozzy and get ozzy out of here.
The plan that tracey and i talked about is talk amanda and cirie into voting for erik, Which they want to do anyway.
Tell them that i'll vote with them.
Go for that. We all three say we're voting for erik.
Ozzy doesn't know and doesn't want to vote for erik
And he'll vote for tracy thinking we're all going to vote for tracy.
Well,underneath all of that,tracy,erik,And i are going to vote for ozzy,and just take ozzy out at the knees.
Hey...
I'm writing Ozzy's name down.
I'm writing Ozzy's name down.
You are?
You're next after me.
If you think you are.
In order to pull off voting out ozzy at this point,
We have to either pull in cirie and amanda.
If this doesn't work out,i have to vote tracy.
If i voted ozzy with tracy,they would flip out and i would be so done,whatever came next.
Well,i know ozzy wants me.
But i'd like to stay.
And you gotta think right now what you're going to do.
Would you rather go up against me or would you rather go up against ozziy?
Would you rather go up against erik or would you rather go up against me?
I'm willing to vote erik as long as you two say that that's good.
So you're voting erik,right,because of--
Well,yeah. Are you?
Do you think that's the best decision?
I'm just nervous about what ozzy might have planned on the other side with erik and those girls.
If i was definitely set on wanting erik out tonight,
He'd be gone tonight. I guarantee you.
But i don't know at this point if i will be able to turn on ozzy or not.
If i go against ozzy,then i can pretty much kiss that relationship good-bye.
I mean,there are so many people that you have to vote out.
You're going to hurt someone's feel-ings in this game.
It's inevitable.
Who's it gonna be,lazies?
Don't look at me!
If cirie and amanda don't vote with me,
There's a whole other path that could be taken.
I'm kind of going both ways in my head still.
Am i going to take ozzy out,or am i going to stick with these people that
I've known from the beginning and vote out one of the fans?
Tonight's decision is a very big decision.
It could change the game in a serious way.
Let's get straight to it.
This tribe is,obviously,in trouble.
You've lost three straight immunity challenges.
The only reason you're even halfway in it is because of odd circumstances.
Penner having to be medically pulled out of the game.
And kathy deciding to quit.
Tracy,who is leading this tribe?
Ozzy.
Ozzy is leading this tribe.
I mean,ozzy was the first one that looked at me and said,,,
You need to go to exile island for the tribe."
Ozzy tells us who is going to compete,
When you're going to eat,and what you're going to eat.
Ozzy,you had a big reaction which tracy said you're the leader.
It's ridiculous.
If i'm the leader of this tribe,i haven't known about it.
I do what needs to get done at certain times,
But i really don't feel like i'm the leader of the tribe.
And i definitely don't feel like i'm deciding who eats what when.
That doesn't make any sense and doesn't jibe with me at all.
Cirie,somebody has to be leading the tribe to one degree or another.
In a way i kind of see where trace secoming from.
I'm not saying ozzy is the leader of the tribe,
But just about 90% of everything that we do, everyone checks with ozzy first.
Erik,do you see what everybody's talking about,the dynamics right now?
There's a conflict going on.
There's a conflictn this tribe and,i mean,i understand ozzy's point.
Nobody wants to be the leader,but things need to get done.
Things need to happen,and he's doing so much for this tribe.
If he was gone,we would fall apart faster than we are right now.
Ami,there are two different approaches this tribe could take right now.
Short-term thinking,which is we need to win challenges.
Long-term thinking is,i need to start getting rid of people who could beat me in this game.
Take me down that line.
Well,you always have to be looking out for which one of these people
Is going to be the biggest threat to me
And when's the best time to get rid of them.
And you have to play your cards when it makes the most sense.
Ozzy,when you hear ami talking about getting rid of the people more threatening, make you a little concerned?
Oh,yeah it does.
I'm not that naive t think that people don't want me gone even if they need me to win challenges.
I'm still going to give it my all,
And i'm still going to be loyal to the people that i've said i'm going to be loyal to.
Nothing's going to change that.
So if i'm a threat and people want to get rid of me,
You know,that's one strategy.
But the other strategy is they can be with me and we can try to go to the end together.
Racy,why keep you tonight?
I think i'd be a better tribe member than somebody's that's going to demolish you if you go to the merge.
And i think that's that needs to be a thought all these people need to think about.
I would be less of a threat than ozzy to ami,to amanda,
To cirie than ozzy.
It's just as simple as thap.
It's plaque and white. There's no gray.
All right,let's get to it.
It is time to vote.
Amanda,you're up.
You said you were honest,and that's bull.
This is because you wanted me out.
Good player. No hard feelings.
I'll go tally the votes.
If anybody has the hidden immunity idol and you want to play it,now wouldn't time to do so.
Okay. Once the votes are read,the decision is final.
The fortune voted out will be asked to leave the tribal council area immediately.
I'll read the votes.
First vote,tracy.
Ozzy. One vote traisy,one vote ozzy.
Tracy.
Two votes tracy,one vote ozzy.
Tracy.
That's three votes tracy,one vote ozzy.
Seventh person voted out of requested survivor: fans versus favorites," tracy.
That's four,that's enough. You need to bring me your torch.
Tracy,the tribe has spoken.
Time for you to go.
Billion,tonight's vote was big for one simple reason--
You gotta start winning some challenges.
Hopefully you made the right choice.
Grab your torches. Head back to camp.
Good night.
Next time on"survivor":
Ami and cirie go on the war path.
On airai, parvati makes new friends
You and alexis, me and amanda final four.
And the injuries continue to pile up.
Erik takes a hard hit. He's out!
<font color="#ffff00">-=www.ydy.com/bbs=- proudly presents</font>
<font color="#ffff00">-=www.ydy.com/bbs=- sync:咔肉肉</font>
Going up against the favorites was quite difficult.
Ozzy's a wonderful player in this game.He is manipulative and he is strategic.
He will definitely take the rest of the tribe down.
They need to get rid of him A.S.A.P.
Or else they don't stand a chance.

The world is changed.
I feel it in the water.
I feel it in the earth.
I smell it in the air.
Much that once was...
...is lost.
For none now live who remember it.
It began with the forging of the Great Rings.
Three were given to the Elves.
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
Seven to the Dwarf-lords.
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
And nine...
...nine rings were gifted to the race of Men...
... who, above all else, desire power.
For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
But they were all of them deceived.
For another ring was made.
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom...
... the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a Master Ring...
... to control all others.
And into this Ring he poured his cruelty, his malice...
...and his will to dominate all life.
One Ring to rule them all.
One by one...
... the Free Lands of Middle-earth fell to the power of the Ring.
But there were some who resisted.
A Last Alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor.
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.
Victory was near.
But the power of the Ring...
...could not be undone.
It was in this moment...
... when all hope had faded...
... that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's sword.
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle-earth, was defeated.
The Ring passed to Isildur...
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.
But the hearts of Men...
...are easily corrupted.
And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
It betrayed Isildur...
... to his death.
And some things that should not have been forgotten...
... were lost.
History became legend...
...legend became myth.
And for two and a half thousand years...
... the Ring passed out of all knowledge.
Until, when chance came...
...it ensnared a new bearer.
My precious.
The Ring came to the creature
Gollum...
... who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains.
And there it consumed him.
It came to me.
My own. My love. My own.
My precious.
The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...
... whispers of a nameless fear.
And the Ring of Power perceived...
...its time had now come.
It abandoned Gollum.
But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
What's this?
A Hobbit.
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.
A ring.
Lost!
My precious is lost!
For the time will soon come...
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.
The 22nd day of September...
...in the year 1 400...
...by Shire-reckoning.
Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton,
Westfarthing...
...the Shire...
...Middle-earth.
The Third Age of this world.
There and Back Again.
A Hobbit's Tale.
By Bilbo Baggins.
Now...
...where to begin?
Ah, yes....
''Concerning...
...Hobbits.''
Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire...
...for many hundreds of years...
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...
...by the world of the Big Folk.
Middle-earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count...
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...
...being neither renowned as great warriors...
...nor counted among the very wise.
Frodo! Someone at the door.
In fact, it has been remarked by some...
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.
A rather unfair observation...
...as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales...
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.
But where our hearts truly lie...
...is in peace and quiet...
...and good, tilled earth.
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.
And, yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint.
But today of all days, it is brought home to me.
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.
Frodo, the door!
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?
Frodo!
Down from the door where it began
And I must follow if I can
The road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began
Now far ahead the road has gone
-And I must follow if I can
-You're late.
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.
Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!
You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
How is the old rascal?
I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole place in an uproar.
Well, that should please him.
Half the Shire's been invited.
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
And so life in the Shire goes on...
... very much as it has this past Age...
...full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly.
If it comes at all.
For things are made to endure in the Shire...
...passing from one generation to the next.
There's always been a Baggins living here under the Hill...
...in Bag End.
And there always will be.
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lately.
I mean, more than usual.
He's taken to locking himself in his study.
He spends hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.
Where's it gone?
He's up to something.
-All right, then. Keep your secrets.
-What?
But I know you have something to do with it.
Good gracious me.
Before you came along, we Bagginses were very well thought of.
Indeed.
Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved.
All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
Oh, really?
Gandalf! Gandalf!
Fireworks, Gandalf!
-Gandalf!
-Fireworks, Gandalf!
Gandalf?
-I'm glad you're back.
-So am I, dear boy.
So am I.
No, thank you!
We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!
And what about very old friends?
Gandalf?
-Bilbo Baggins.
-My dear Gandalf!
Good to see you. 1 1 1 years old!
Who would believe it?
You haven't aged a day.
Come on, come in!
Welcome, welcome.
Oh, here we are.
Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger?
I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. 1 296.
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?
Just tea, thank you.
I was expecting you sometime last week.
Not that it matters. You come and go as you please. Always have and always will.
You caught me a bit unprepared. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.
I've just found some sponge cake.
I could make you some eggs if you'd--
-Just tea, thank you.
-Oh, right.
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?
-No, not at all.
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!
I'm not at home!
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.
-I know you're in there!
-They're after the house.
They've never forgiven me for living this long.
I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day...
...never giving me a moment's peace.
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!
And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.
-So you mean to go through with your plan?
-Yes, yes. It's all in hand.
All the arrangements are made.
Oh, thank you.
Frodo suspects something.
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
You will tell him, won't you?
-Yes, yes.
-He's very fond of you.
I know.
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.
I think in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire.
The woods, the fields.
Little rivers.
I am old, Gandalf.
I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.
I feel thin.
Sort of stretched...
...like butter scraped over too much bread.
I need a holiday. A very long holiday.
And I don't expect I shall return.
In fact, I mean not to.
Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.
Gandalf, my old friend...
...this will be a night to remember.
Hello, hello.
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.
-I think I'll just have another ale.
-Oh, no, you don't.
Go on!
So there I was...
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...
...about how they were going to cook us.
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit on us one by one, squash us into jelly.
They spent so much time arguing the whithertos and the whyfors...
...that the sun's first light crept over the top of the trees...
...and turned them all to stone!
Quickly.
Up they go!
No, the big one.
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.
Are all these children yours?
Good gracious, you have been productive.
Bilbo?
Sackville-Bagginses!
Quickly, hide!
Thank you, my boy.
You're a good lad, Frodo.
I'm very selfish, you know.
Yes, I am. Very selfish.
I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died...
...but it wasn't out of charity.
I think it was because...
...of all my numerous relations...
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?
No.
Well, yes, but that's not the point.
The point is, Frodo...
...you'll be all right.
-Done!
-You're supposed to stick it in the ground.
-It is in the ground.
-Outside!
This was your idea.
Bilbo.
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years.
-That was good.
-Let's get another one.
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.
I might've known.
Speech, Bilbo!
Speech!
Speech!
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...
...Tooks and Brandybucks...
...Grubbs, Chubbs...
...Hornblowers...
...Bolgers...
...Bracegirdles...
-...and Proudfoots.
-Proudfeet!
Today is my 1 1 1th birthday!
Happy birthday!
But alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among...
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.
I don't know half of you half as well as I should like...
...and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
I have things to do.
I've put this off far too long.
I regret to announce this is the end!
I'm going now.
I bid you all a very fond farewell.
Goodbye.
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?
There are many magic rings in this world, and none of them should be used lightly.
It was just a bit of fun.
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.
-You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
-Two eyes.
As often as I can spare them.
-I'm leaving everything to him.
-What about this ring of yours?
-Is that staying too?
-Yes, yes.
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
No. Wait, it's...
...here in my pocket.
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?
Yet, after all, why not?
-Why shouldn't I keep it?
-I think you should leave the ring behind.
Is that so hard?
Well, no.
And yes.
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!
-There's no need to get angry.
-Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!
It's mine.
My own.
-My precious.
-Precious?
It's been called that before, but not by you.
What business is it of yours what I do with my own things?
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.
-You want it for yourself!
-Bilbo Baggins!
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.
I am not trying to rob you.
I'm trying to help you.
All your long years, we've been friends.
Trust me as you once did.
Let it go.
You're right, Gandalf.
The ring must go to Frodo.
It's late. The road is long.
Yes, it is time.
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.
I've thought up an ending for my book:
''And he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.''
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.
Goodbye, Gandalf.
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.
The road goes ever on and on
Until our next meeting.
It's mine. My own.
My precious.
Riddles in the dark.
Bilbo!
Bilbo!
My precious.
Precious.
He's gone, hasn't he?
He talked for so long about leaving...
...I didn't think he'd really do it.
Gandalf?
Bilbo's ring.
He's gone to stay with the Elves.
He's left you Bag End.
Along with all his possessions.
The ring is yours now.
-Put it somewhere out of sight.
-Where are you going?
-There are some things that I must see to.
-What things?
-Questions. Questions that need answering.
-You've only just arrived.
I don't understand.
Neither do I.
Keep it secret.
Keep it safe.
Shire!
Baggins!
''The year 3434 of the Second Age.
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...
...and the finding of the Ring of Power. ''
''It has come to me.
The One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.
All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate...
...for I will risk no hurt to the Ring.
It is precious to me...
... though I buy it with great pain.
The markings upon the band begin to fade.
The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared.
A secret now that only fire can tell. ''
Shire.
Baggins.
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.
That way.
To heal my heart and drown my woe
Rain may fall and wind may blow
But there still be
Many miles to go
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain
And the stream that falls
From hill to plain
Better than rain or rippling brook
Is a mug of beer inside this Took
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.
War is brewing.
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.
Far-off tales and children's stories, that's all that is.
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.
And proud of it.
-Cheers, Gaffer.
-Cheers.
It's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders.
Keep your nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll come to you.
-Good night, lads.
-Good night.
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.
Mind who you're sweet-talking.
Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.
Does she?
-Good night, Sam.
-Good night, Mister Frodo.
Is it secret? Is it safe?
What are you doing?
Hold out your hand, Frodo.
It's quite cool.
What can you see?
Can you see anything?
Nothing.
There's nothing.
Wait.
There are markings.
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.
There are few who can.
The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
Mordor!
In the common tongue, it says:
''One Ring to rule them all...
...One Ring to find them...
...One Ring to bring them all...
...and in the darkness bind them.''
This is the One Ring...
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom.
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
Bilbo found it.
-In Gollum's cave.
-Yes.
For 60 years, the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.
The Ring has awoken.
It's heard its master's call.
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.
No, Frodo.
The spirit of Sauron endured.
His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived.
Sauron has returned.
His Orcs have multiplied.
His fortress at Barad-dûr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.
Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands in a second darkness.
He is seeking it.
Seeking it. All his thought is bent on it.
For the Ring yearns above all else...
...to return to the hand of its master.
They are one...
...the Ring and the Dark Lord.
Frodo...
...he must never find it.
All right.
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.
No one knows it's here, do they?
Do they, Gandalf?
There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring.
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.
But the enemy found him first.
I don't know how long they tortured him.
But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.
Shire!
Baggins!
Shire.
Baggins. But that would lead them here!
Who goes there?
Take it, Gandalf!
-Take it!
-No, Frodo.
-You must take it!
-You cannot offer me this ring!
-I'm giving it to you!
-Don't tempt me, Frodo!
I dare not take it.
Not even to keep it safe.
Understand, Frodo...
...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good.
But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
-But it cannot stay in the Shire!
-No.
No, it can't.
What must I do?
-You must leave. And leave quickly.
-Where? Where do I go?
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.
Bree.
-What about you?
-I'll be waiting for you...
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.
-And the Ring will be safe there?
-I don't know, Frodo.
I don't have any answers.
I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.
He'll know what to do.
You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you.
That name is not safe outside the Shire.
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.
I can cut across country easily enough.
My dear Frodo.
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.
You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month.
And yet, after a hundred years...
...they can still surprise you.
Get down.
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.
I was cutting the grass under the window.
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?
-I heard raised voices.
-What did you hear? Speak!
Nothing important.
That is, I heard a good deal about a ring, a Dark Lord and the end of the world but--
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.
No?
Perhaps not.
I've thought of a better use for you.
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.
Be careful, both of you.
The enemy has many spies in his service:
Birds, beasts.
Is it safe?
Never put it on...
...for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.
Always remember, Frodo...
...the Ring is trying to get back to its master.
It wants to be found.
This is it.
This is what?
If I take one more step...
...it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
Come on, Sam.
Remember what Bilbo used to say:
-''It's a dangerous business, Frodo.''
-''Going out your door.
You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet...
... there's no knowing where you might be swept off to. ''
Sam.
Wood-elves.
They're going to the harbor beyond the White Towers.
To the Grey Havens.
They're leaving Middle-earth.
Never to return.
I don't know why...
...it makes me sad.
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.
Just shut your eyes...
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.
Me neither, Sam.
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.
The hour grows late.
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...
...seeking my counsel.
For that is why you have come, is it not?
My old friend.
Saruman.
-You are sure of this?
-Beyond any doubt.
So the Ring of Power has been found.
All these long years, it was in the Shire.
-Under my very nose.
-Yet you did not have the wit to see it.
Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
Time?
What time do you think we have?
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.
He cannot yet take physical form...
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.
A Great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.
The Eye of Sauron.
He is gathering all evil to him.
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.
You know this?
How?
I have seen it.
A palantyr is a dangerous tool,
Saruman.
Why?
Why should we fear to use it?
They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing-stones.
We do not know who else may be watching.
The hour is later than you think.
Sauron's forces are already moving.
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
The Nine?
They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve...
...disguised as riders in black.
-They've reached the Shire?
-They will find the Ring.
And kill the one who carries it.
Frodo!
You did not seriously think that a Hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron?
There are none who can.
Against the power of Mordor...
...there can be no victory.
We must join with him, Gandalf.
We must join with Sauron.
It would be wise, my friend.
Tell me...
...friend...
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?
I gave you the chance...
...of aiding me willingly...
...but you have elected the way of pain!
Mr. Frodo?
Frodo? Frodo!
-I thought I'd lost you.
-What are you talking about?
-It's just something Gandalf said.
-What did he say?
''Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee.''
And I don't mean to.
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?
Frodo.
-Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
-Hello, Frodo.
Get off him.
Come on, Frodo.
What's the meaning of this?
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
You get back here!
Get out of my field!
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.
And some cabbages.
And those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week.
-And then the mushrooms the week before.
-Yes, Pippin. My point is...
...he's clearly overreacting.
Run!
Oh, that was close.
I think I've broken something.
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.
-Short cut to what?
-Mushrooms!
That's mine.
That's nice, Merry.
Here's a nice one, Sam.
I think we should get off the road.
Get off the road!
Quick!
Be quiet!
What was that?
Anything?
Nothing.
What is going on?
That Black Rider was looking for something. Or someone.
Frodo?
Get down!
I have to leave the Shire.
Sam and I must get to Bree.
Right.
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.
Run!
This way! Follow me!
Run!
Get the rope, Sam!
Frodo!
Run, Frodo!
Go!
-Hurry!
Frodo, come on!
-Come on! Faster!
-Jump!
-How far to the nearest crossing?
-The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.
Come on.
-What do you want?
-We're heading for the Prancing Pony.
Hobbits. Four Hobbits!
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk. What business brings you to Bree?
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.
All right, young sir.
I meant no offense.
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.
There's talk of strange folk abroad.
Can't be too careful.
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.
Excuse me.
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?
If you're seeking accommodation, we got some cozy Hobbit-sized rooms available.
Always proud to cater to the Little Folk, Mister...?
Underhill. My name's Underhill.
-Underhill, yes.
-We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.
-Can you tell him we've arrived?
-Gandalf?
Gandalf.
Oh, yes...
...I remember. Elderly chap.
Big grey beard, pointy hat.
Not seen him for six months.
What do we do now?
Sam...
...he'll be here. He'll come.
Get out of my way!
What's that?
This, my friend, is a pint.
It comes in pints?
-I'm getting one.
-You got a whole half already!
That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we arrived.
Excuse me.
That Man in the corner. Who is he?
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous folk, wandering the Wilds.
What his right name is, I've never heard, but around here he's known as Strider.
Strider.
Baggins.
Baggins.
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.
He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side...
...and my third cousin, twice removed....
-Pippin!
-Steady on, Frodo.
You cannot hide.
I see you.
There is no life...
...in the void.
Only...
...death.
You draw far too much attention to yourself, ''Mr. Underhill.''
What do you want?
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.
-I carry nothing.
-Indeed.
I can avoid being seen if I wish...
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
-Who are you?
-Are you frightened?
Yes.
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.
You have a stout heart, little Hobbit.
But that will not save you.
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.
They're coming.
What are they?
They were once Men.
Great kings of Men.
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine rings of power.
Blinded by their greed, they took them without question.
One by one, falling into darkness.
Now they are slaves to his will.
They are the Nazgûl.
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.
At all times they feel...
... the presence of the Ring...
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.
-Where are you taking us?
-Into the Wild.
How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...
-...and feel fouler.
-He's foul enough.
We have no choice but to trust him.
-But where is he leading us?
-To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.
-To the house of Elrond.
-Did you hear that? Rivendell.
We're going to see the Elves.
-Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
-What about breakfast?
-You've already had it.
-We've had one, yes.
What about second breakfast?
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?
-He knows about them, doesn't he?
-I wouldn't count on it.
Pippin!
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?
Who is she?
This woman you sing of.
'Tis the lady of Lûthien.
The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.
What happened to her?
She died.
Get some sleep, Frodo.
The power of Isengard is at your command...
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?
We have work to do.
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.
Rip them all down.
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.
We shall rest here tonight.
These are for you.
Keep them close.
I'm going to have a look around.
Stay here.
My tomato's burst.
Could I have some bacon?
Want a tomato, Sam?
-What are you doing?!
-Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.
-We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
-Put it out, you fools!
-Put it out!
-That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!
Go!
Back, you devils!
Frodo!
Oh, Sam.
Strider!
-Help him, Strider.
-He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs Elvish medicine.
Hurry!
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!
Hold on, Frodo.
Gandalf!
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.
Is he going to die?
He's passing into the Shadow World.
He'll soon become a Wraith like them.
-They're close.
-Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?
-Athelas?
-Kingsfoil.
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!
What's this?
A Ranger caught off his guard?
Frodo.
I am Arwen - I've come to help you.
Hear my voice...
Come back to the light.
Who is she?
Frodo.
-She's an Elf.
-He's fading.
He's not going to last.
We must get him to my father.
-I've been looking for you for two days.
-Where are you taking him?
There are five Wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.
Stay with the Hobbits -
I'll send horses for you.
I'm the faster rider - I'll take him
The Road is too dangerous.
What are they saying?
If I can get across the river...
...the power of my people will protect him.
I do not fear them.
Arwen...
...ride hard. Don't look back.
What are you doing?!
Those Wraiths are still out there!
Give up the halfling, She-Elf.
If you want him, come and claim him.
No. No!
Frodo, no.
Frodo, don't give in.
Not now.
What grace is given me...
...let it pass to him.
Let him be spared.
Save him.
-Where am I?
-You are in the house of Elrond.
And it is 1 0:00 in the morning on October 24th, if you want to know.
-Gandalf!
-Yes, I'm here.
And you're lucky to be here too.
A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid.
But you have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit.
What happened, Gandalf?
-Why didn't you meet us?
-I am sorry, Frodo.
I was delayed.
A friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside.
One ill turn deserves another.
It is over.
Embrace the power of the Ring...
...or embrace your own destruction!
There is only one Lord of the Ring.
Only one who can bend it to his will.
And he does not share power.
So you have chosen death.
Gandalf? What is it?
Nothing, Frodo.
Frodo!
-Sam.
-Bless you, you're awake!
Sam has hardly left your side.
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?
By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
-Bilbo!
-Hello, Frodo, my lad.
Bilbo.
''There and Back Again.
A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''
-This is wonderful.
-I meant to go back...
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...
...visit Lake-town...
...see the Lonely Mountain again.
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.
I miss the Shire.
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.
Off with you, on one of your adventures.
But my own adventure turned out to be quite different.
I'm not like you, Bilbo.
My dear boy.
-Now, what have I forgotten?
-Packed already?
No harm in being prepared.
-I thought you wanted to see the Elves.
-I do.
-More than anything.
-I did.
It's just....
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?
We got the Ring this far, to Rivendell. And I thought...
...seeing as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon.
Off home.
You are right, Sam.
We did what we set out to do.
The Ring will be safe in Rivendell.
I am ready to go home.
His strength returns.
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.
And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ring...
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.
-We can ask no more of Frodo.
-Gandalf, the enemy is moving.
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His Eye is fixed on Rivendell.
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.
Our list of allies grows thin.
His treachery runs deeper than you know.
By foul craft, Saruman has crossed Orcs with Goblin-men.
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.
An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed.
Saruman is coming for the Ring.
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.
We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
Gandalf...
...the Ring cannot stay here.
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.
They must decide now how to end it.
The time of the Elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The Dwarves?
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care not for the troubles of others.
It is in Men that we must place our hope.
Men?
Men are weak.
The race of Men is failing.
The blood of Nûmenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten.
It is because of Men the Ring survives.
I was there, Gandalf.
I was there 3000 years ago...
... when Isildur took the Ring.
I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...
... where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
Cast it into the fire!
-Destroy it!
-No.
Isildur!
It should have ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
Isildur kept the Ring.
The line of kings is broken.
There's no strength left in the world of Men.
-They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
-There is one who could unite them.
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
He turned from that path a long time ago.
He has chosen exile.
You are no Elf.
Men of the South are welcome here.
-Who are you?
-I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.
Then we are here on common purpose...
...friend.
The shards of Narsil.
The blade that cut the Ring from Sauron's hand.
It's still sharp.
But no more than a broken heirloom.
Why do you fear the past?
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself.
You are not bound to his fate.
The same blood flows in my veins.
The same weakness.
Your time will come.
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.
The Shadow does not hold sway yet.
Not over you... not over me.
Do you remember when we first met?
I thought I had strayed into a dream.
Long years have passed.
You did not have the cares you carry now.
Do you remember what I told you?
You said you'd bind yourself to me...
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.
And to that I hold.
I would rather share one lifetime with you...
...than face all the Ages of this world alone.
I choose a mortal life.
-You cannot give me this.
-It is mine to give to whom I will...
...like my heart.
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...
...you've been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it.
You will unite, or you will fall.
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.
Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
So it is true.
In a dream...
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...
...but in the West a pale light lingered.
A voice was crying:
''Your doom is near at hand.
Isildur's Bane is found.''
Isildur's Bane.
Boromir!
Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris.
I do not ask your pardon,
Master Elrond...
...for the Black Speech of Mordor...
...may yet be heard...
...in every corner of the West!
The Ring is altogether evil.
It is a gift.
A gift to the foes of Mordor.
Why not use this Ring?
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...
...are your lands kept safe.
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.
You cannot wield it.
None of us can.
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.
And what would a Ranger know of this matter?
This is no mere Ranger.
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
You owe him your allegiance.
Aragorn.
This is Isildur's heir?
And heir to the throne of Gondor.
Sit down, Legolas.
Gondor has no king.
Gondor needs no king.
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.
You have only one choice.
The Ring must be destroyed.
What are we waiting for?
The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin...
...by any craft that we here possess.
The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.
Only there can it be unmade.
It must be taken deep into Mordor...
...and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
One of you...
...must do this.
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
Its Black Gates are guarded by more than just Orcs.
There is evil there that does not sleep.
The Great Eye is ever-watchful.
It is a barren wasteland...
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.
Not with 1 0,000 men could you do this. It is folly.
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed.
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!
And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!
Never trust an Elf!
Do you not understand? While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!
I will take it.
I will take it.
I will take the Ring to Mordor.
Though...
...I do not know the way.
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...
...as long as it is yours to bear.
If by my life or death I can protect you...
...I will.
You have my sword.
And you have my bow.
And my ax.
You carry the fates of us all, little one.
If this is indeed the will of the Council...
...then Gondor will see it done.
-Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
-It is hardly possible to separate you...
...even when he is summoned to a secret Council and you are not.
We're coming too!
You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us.
Anyway, you need people of intelligence on this sort of...
...mission.
Quest.
Thing.
Well, that rules you out, Pip.
Nine companions.
So be it.
You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring.
Great!
Where are we going?
She wanted to protect her child... she thought in Rivendell you would be safe.
In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life.
That you'd never escape your fate.
The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of kings...
...but only you have the power to wield it.
I do not want that power.
I have never wanted it.
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.
My old sword! Sting.
Here, take it. Take it.
-It's so light.
-Yes. Made by the Elves, you know.
The blade glows blue when Orcs are close.
And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful.
Here's a pretty thing.
Mithril.
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.
Let me see you put it on. Come on.
My old ring.
I should very much like...
...to hold it again, one last time.
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.
I'm sorry for everything.
The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom.
On you who travel with him, no oath...
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.
May the blessings of Elves and Men...
...and all Free Folk go with you.
The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?
Left.
We must hold to this course, west of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.
Move your feet.
-You look good, Pippin.
-Thanks.
Faster!
If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not...
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.
Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria.
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.
No, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.
Sorry!
Get him!
-For the Shire!
-Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!
Gentlemen, that's enough.
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!
-What is that?
-Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.
It's moving fast.
Against the wind.
-Crebain from Dunland!
-Hide!
-Hurry!
-Take cover!
Spies of Saruman.
The passage south is being watched.
We must take the Pass of Caradhras.
Frodo!
Boromir.
It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt...
...over so small a thing.
Such a little thing.
Boromir!
Give the Ring to Frodo.
As you wish.
I care not.
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.
And if that fails, where then will you go?
If the mountain defeats you...
... will you risk a more dangerous road?
There is a fell voice on the air.
It's Saruman!
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!
No!
We must get off the mountain!
Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.
Let us go through the Mines of Moria.
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.
The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm.
Shadow and flame.
Let the Ring-bearer decide.
We cannot stay here!
This will be the death of the Hobbits.
Frodo?
We will go through the mines.
So be it.
Frodo, come and help an old man.
How is your shoulder?
-Better than it was.
-And the Ring?
You feel its power growing, don't you?
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.
Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship.
And, I fear, from within.
-Who then do I trust?
-You must trust yourself.
Trust your own strengths.
-What do you mean?
-There are many powers in this world...
...for good or for evil.
Some are greater than I am.
And against some I have not yet been tested.
The walls...
...of Moria.
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them if their secrets are forgotten.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Well, let's see.
Ithildin.
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.
It reads, ''The Doors of Durin,
Lord of Moria.
-Speak, friend, and enter.''
-What do you suppose that means?
It's simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password and the doors will open.
Nothing's happening.
I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves...
...Men and Orcs.
What are you going to do, then?
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!
And if that does not shatter them...
...and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions...
...I will try to find the opening words.
Mines are no place for a pony.
-Even one so brave as Bill.
-Bye-bye, Bill.
Go on, Bill. Go on.
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.
Do not disturb the water.
Oh, it's useless.
It's a riddle.
''Speak 'friend' and enter.''
What's the Elvish word for ''friend''?
Mellon.
Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves.
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.
And they call it a mine.
A mine!
This is no mine. It's a tomb.
No....
No!
Goblins.
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.
Now, get out of here. Get out!
-Frodo!
-Help!
Strider!
-Help!
-Get off him!
Aragorn!
Frodo!
Into the mines!
-Legolas!
-Into the cave!
Run!
We now have but one choice.
We must face the long dark of Moria.
Be on your guard.
There are older and fouler things than Orcs...
...in the deep places of the world.
Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side.
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...
...or jewels...
...but mithril.
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him.
-Oh, that was a kingly gift.
-Yes.
I never told him...
...but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.
Pippin.
I have no memory of this place.
-Are we lost?
-No.
-I think we are.
-Gandalf's thinking.
-Merry?
-What?
I'm hungry.
-There's something down there.
-It's Gollum.
-Gollum?
-He's been following us for three days.
-He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
-Escaped...
...or was set loose.
Now the Ring has brought him here.
He will never be rid of his need for it.
He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.
Sméagol's life is a sad story.
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the Ring found him.
Before it drove him mad.
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.
Pity?
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.
Can you give it to them, Frodo?
Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgment.
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.
My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill...
...before this is over.
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.
All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.
There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
Bilbo was meant to find the Ring.
In which case, you also were meant to have it.
And that is an encouraging thought.
It's that way.
-He's remembered.
-No.
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
Let me risk a little more light.
Behold...
...the great realm and Dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.
There's an eye opener, and no mistake.
Gimli!
No!
Oh, no.
No.
''Here lies Balin...
...son of Fundin...
...Lord of Moria.''
He is dead, then.
It's as I feared.
We must move on. We cannot linger.
''They have taken the bridge and the second hall.
We have barred the gates...
...but cannot hold them for long.
The ground shakes.
Drums...
...drums in the deep.
We cannot get out.
A Shadow moves in the dark.
We cannot get out.
They are coming.''
Fool of a Took!
Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity.
Frodo!
Orcs.
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!
They have a cave-troll.
Let them come!
There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath.
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
Frodo!
Aragorn! Aragorn!
Frodo!
Frodo!
Oh, no.
He's alive.
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.
You should be dead.
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.
I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.
Mithril.
You are full of surprises,
Master Baggins.
To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!
This way!
What is this new devilry?
A Balrog.
A demon of the ancient world.
This foe is beyond any of you.
Run!
Quickly!
Gandalf.
Lead them on, Aragorn.
The bridge is near.
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.
Gandalf!
Merry! Pippin!
Sam!
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.
Not the beard!
Steady.
Hold on!
Hang on!
Lean forward!
Steady.
Come on!
Now!
Over the bridge!
Fly!
You cannot pass!
Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
Go back to the Shadow.
You shall not pass!
-No! No!
-Gandalf!
Fly, you fools!
No!
Aragorn!
Legolas, get them up.
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with Orcs.
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.
On your feet, Sam.
Frodo?
Frodo!
Stay close, young Hobbits!
They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods.
An Elf-witch...
...of terrible power.
All who look upon her...
...fall under her spell.
Frodo!
And are never seen again.
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.
You bring great evil here,
Ring-bearer.
Mr. Frodo?
Well, here's one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.
The Dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.
Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.
Our Fellowship stands in your debt.
Aragorn of the Dunedain... you are known to us.
So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves!
Speak words we can all understand!
We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.
And you know what this Dwarf says to that?
That was not so courteous.
You bring great evil with you.
You can go no further.
Gandalf's death was not in vain.
Nor would he have you give up hope.
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.
Don't carry the weight of the dead.
You will follow me.
Caras Galadhon.
The heart of Elvendom on earth.
Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.
The enemy knows you have entered here.
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.
Eight there are here, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell.
Tell me, where is Gandalf?
For I much desire to speak with him.
I can no longer see him from afar.
Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land.
He has fallen into Shadow.
He was taken by both Shadow and flame.
A Balrog of Morgoth.
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.
We do not yet know his full purpose.
Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...
...Gimli, son of Glóin.
For the world has grown full of peril...
...and in all lands...
...love is now mingled with grief.
What now becomes of this Fellowship?
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.
Stray but a little and it will fail...
...to the ruin of all.
Yet hope remains while the Company is true.
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.
Tonight, you will sleep....
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...
...one who has seen the Eye!
A lament for Gandalf.
What do they say about him?
I have not the heart to tell you.
For me, the grief is still too near.
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.
There should be a verse about them.
The finest rockets ever seen
They burst in stars of blue and green
Or after thunder, silver showers
Came falling like a rain of flowers
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.
Take some rest.
These borders are well-protected.
I will find no rest here.
I heard her voice inside my head.
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.
She said to me,
''Even now there is hope left.''
But I cannot see it.
It is long since we had any hope.
My father is a noble man.
But his rule is failing...
...and our people lose faith.
He looks to me to make things right, and I would do it.
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?
The White Tower of Ecthelion.
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.
Have you ever been called home...
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
I have seen the White City...
...long ago.
One day, our paths will lead us there.
And the tower guard shall take up the call:
''The Lords of Gondor have returned.''
Will you look into the mirror?
What will I see?
Even the wisest cannot tell.
For the mirror...
...shows many things.
Things that were...
...things that are...
...and some things...
...that have not yet come to pass.
I know what it is you saw.
For it is also in my mind.
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.
The Fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.
He will try to take the Ring.
You know of whom I speak.
One by one, it will destroy them all.
If you ask it of me...
... I will give you the One Ring.
You offer it to me freely.
I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen...
...not dark but beautiful, and terrible as the dawn!
Treacherous as the sea!
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!
All shall love me...
...and despair.
I pass the test. I will diminish...
...and go into the West...
-...and remain Galadriel.
-I cannot do this alone.
You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a Ring of Power...
...is to be alone.
This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant.
And I am its keeper.
This task was appointed to you.
And if you do not find a way...
...no one will.
Then I know what I must do.
It's just...
...I'm afraid to do it.
Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
Do you know how the Orcs first came into being?
They were Elves once.
Taken by the Dark Powers...
...tortured and mutilated.
A ruined and terrible form of life.
And now...
...perfected.
My fighting Uruk-hai...
...whom do you serve?
Saruman!
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found.
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.
You will taste Man-flesh!
One of the halflings carries something of great value.
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.
Kill the others.
Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.
May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.
Lembas.
Elvish waybread.
One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.
How many did you eat?
Four.
Every league you travel south, the danger will increase.
Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.
Strange creatures bearing the White Hand have been seen on our borders.
Seldom do Orcs journey in the open under the sun, yet these have done so.
You are being tracked.
By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.
They have already seen service in war.
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.
You will find your courage.
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...
...Elven rope made of hithlain.
Thank you, my lady.
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the Elves?
Nothing.
Except to look upon the lady of the Galadhrim one last time...
...for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.
Actually....
There was one thing.
No, no, I couldn't.
It's quite impossible.
Stupid to ask.
I have nothing greater to give...
...than the gift you already bear.
For her love,
I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar will diminish.
I would have her leave these shores, and be with her people.
I would have her take the ship to Valinor.
That choice is yet before her.
You have your own choice to make,
Aragorn.
To rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil...
...or to fall into darkness with all that is left of your kin.
Farewell.
There is much you have yet to do.
We shall not meet again...
Elessar.
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.
I give you the light of Eärendil...
...our most beloved star.
May it be a light for you in dark places...
... when all other lights go out.
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.
Henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.
What was her gift?
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.
She gave me three.
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.
But he's too clever a waterman.
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.
-No, Sam.
-You haven't eaten anything all day.
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.
-Mr. Frodo--
-I'm all right.
But you're not.
I'm here to help you.
I promised Gandalf that I would.
You can't help me, Sam.
Not this time.
Get some sleep.
Minas Tirith is the safer road.
You know that.
From there we can regroup.
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.
You were quick enough to trust the Elves.
Have you so little faith in your own people?
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.
But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men.
But you will not see that.
You are afraid!
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.
Scared of who you are, of what you are.
I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city.
Frodo.
The Argonath.
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.
My kin.
We cross the lake at nightfall.
Hide the boats and continue on foot.
-We approach Mordor from the North.
-Oh, yes?
Just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil...
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.
And after that, it gets even better.
Festering, stinking marshland as far as the eye can see.
That is our road.
I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
Recover my--
-We should leave now.
-No.
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.
A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind.
Something draws near.
I can feel it.
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.
Where's Frodo?
None of us should wander alone.
You, least of all.
So much depends on you.
Frodo?
I know why you seek solitude.
You suffer. I see it day by day.
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?
There are other ways, Frodo.
-Other paths that we might take.
-I know what you would say.
It would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.
Warning? Against what?
We're all afraid, Frodo.
But to let that fear drive us, to destroy what hope we have...
-...don't you see that is madness?
-There is no other way.
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!
-If you would but lend me the Ring.
-No.
-Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
-You are not yourself.
What chance do you think you have?
They will find you.
They will take the Ring.
And you will beg for death before the end!
You fool!
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.
It should be mine! Give it to me!
-Give it to me!
-No!
-Give it to me!
-No.
I see your mind.
You will take the Ring to Sauron!
You will betray us!
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!
Frodo?
Frodo.
What have I done?
Please, Frodo.
Frodo, I'm sorry!
Frodo?
-It has taken Boromir.
-Where is the Ring?
Stay away!
Frodo!
-I swore to protect you.
-Can you protect me from yourself?
Would you destroy it?
Aragorn.
Aragorn.
Elessar.
I would have gone with you to the end.
Into the very fires of Mordor.
I know.
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.
Go, Frodo!
Run.
Run!
Mr. Frodo!
Find the halfling!
Find the halfling!
Elendil!
Aragorn, go!
Frodo!
Hide here. Quick!
Come on!
What's he doing?
He's leaving.
-No!
-Pippin!
Run, Frodo. Go on!
-Hey! Hey, you!
-Over here!
-Over here!
-This way!
-It's working!
-I know it's working! Run!
-The horn of Gondor.
-Boromir.
Run!
No.
-They took the little ones.
-Hold still.
Frodo. Where is Frodo?
I let Frodo go.
Then you did what I could not.
I tried to take the Ring from him.
-The Ring is beyond our reach now.
-Forgive me.
I did not see it.
-I have failed you all.
-No, Boromir.
You fought bravely.
You have kept your honor.
Leave it.
It is over.
The world of Men will fall.
And all will come to darkness...
...and my city to ruin.
I do not know what strength is in my blood...
...but I swear to you,
I will not let the White City fall...
...nor our people fail.
Our people.
Our people.
I would have followed you, my brother.
My captain.
My king.
Be at peace...
...son of Gondor.
They will look for his coming from the White Tower.
But he will not return.
Frodo!
I wish the Ring had never come to me.
I wish none of this had happened.
So do all who live to see such times...
...but that is not for them to decide.
All you have to decide...
...is what to do with the time that is given to you.
Frodo, no!
Frodo!
-Mr. Frodo!
-No, Sam.
Go back, Sam!
-I'm going to Mordor alone.
-Of course you are.
And I'm coming with you!
You can't swim!
Sam!
Sam!
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.
A promise:
''Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.''
And I don't mean to.
I don't mean to.
Sam.
Come on.
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have reached the eastern shore.
-You mean not to follow them.
-Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.
Then it has all been in vain.
The Fellowship has failed.
Not if we hold true to each other.
We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death.
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.
We travel light.
Let us hunt some Orc.
Yes!
Mordor.
I hope the others find a safer road.
Strider will look after them.
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.
We may.
Sam...
...I'm glad you are with me.

WOMAN: 12 years of war.
12 years since
Emperor Shaddam IV was defeated and Paul Muad'Dib's wild Fremen spread out across the universe, exterminating all that remained of the old Imperial armies.
Colonising the planets of the known universe one by one, under his rule.
Sweeping away anything and anyone who resisted.
Millions have been defeated, millions more have been slaughtered.
There are no innocents anywhere and the name of Muad'Dib is no longer a prayer.
For many, it is now a curse.
MAN: The mercy of Muad'Dib is comfort to all enemies.
The compassion of Muad'Dib...
MAN: Commander Farok!
The conversions have begun!
Anyone refusing the peace of Muad'Dib will be executed!
So it is written!
MAN: You who deny the glory of Muad'Dib are condemned to death.
Sir, your son.
He's been wounded.
Your soul...
My eyes. My eyes!
I'm blind, Father. I'm blind.
Don't give me to the desert, Father.
Please!
Don't send me to die.
(Screams) Muad'Dib!
WOMAN: If history teaches us anything, it is simply this - every revolution carries within it the seeds of its own destruction, and empires that rise will one day fall.
Arrakis.
Dune.
Once the wasteland of the universe, now an Imperial capital, for it is here and only here the giant worms still roam, creating spice - still the greatest treasure in the universe, still the cause of conspiracy, betrayal and murder.
MAN: Alia!
WOMAN: Alia!
MAN: It's her!
WOMAN: The holy sister!
WOMAN: Alia!
Alia! Alia! Alia! Alia!
Alia! Alia! Alia! Alia!
In the beginning, we were all empty.
ALL: Ignorant of all things.
We did not know the power that resides in every place.
ALL: And in all time.
He is the power that awakens the soul.
ALL: And brings us joy.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib. Muad'Dib.
MAN: Muad'Dib!
I don't suppose you feel it's necessary to inform me when you go on these walkabouts?
You'd only try and stop me.
Again.
The streets are full of danger, Muad'Dib.
The truth is in the streets, Stil, not in this parade of sycophants who flutter around this palace with their meaningless statistics and empty ritual.
Ritual is the whip by which men are enlightened, Muad'Dib.
Tell me, Korba, when was it you reinvented yourself from
Fremen Fedaykin to religious fanatic?
The day you defeated Shaddam and his armies, Muad'Dib.
The day I saw the future.
The city's filled with adventurers,
Muad'Dib, not to mention agents of the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit and the former Imperial family.
Surely they conspire to something a little more elegant than assassination on the streets of Arrakeen?
You are vulnerable, Muad'Dib.
No matter how powerful you have become, you cannot escape this simple fact.
You're right about one thing, Stil.
There is no escape.
(Whispers) Chani.
I'm not asleep.
I thought the doctor said you were supposed to rest.
As long as you insist on wandering the city like some off-world pilgrim,
I will never be able to rest.
Are you going to lecture me too?
Hmm!
While I was walking,
I stepped in a puddle...
...an open pool of water in the street.
Muad'Dib has brought many wonders to Arrakis...
..the people say.
"Muad'Dib spends water like a madman."
That's what they say, Chani.
The old Fremen, I hear them...
...on the streets when I walk.
"We've become water-fat."
They resent the 'wonders'
I've brought to their desert.
They resent me.
You know what I'd pay to end these wars?
Separate myself from this...
...damnable myth I've become?
What's to stop you?
Command it, Muad'Dib.
After all, you are the Emperor.
Even if I vanished tomorrow, the revolution would follow my ghost.
This is not a clean place.
It's time to return to the desert.
We were happy there.
BOY: Father.
I'm waiting and I'm ready.
To know the future is to be trapped by it.
But knowing there's a trap is the first step in evading it.
It's the first step along the Golden Path.
I'm the answer.
I'm ready, Father.
And I am ready, Father.
The answer's standing right in front of you, on the Golden Path.
Is there no other way?
Everywhere we turn, his power confronts us.
He's a curse.
He's a messiah.
You can't launch a frontal attack on a messiah.
Even if you succeed, their martyrdom remains.
But he is human, and because he is human, he has his weaknesses.
So, what do you suggest, Princess?
Something subtle, something... unexpected.
A ghost, perhaps?
Mmm.
May I introduce our friend,
Reverend Mother, Scytale of the Tleilaxu.
Get to the point, Wensicia.
I haven't travelled all the way to the edge of the universe to discuss nonsense with a... face dancer.
No, you Bene Gesserit are desperate to regain control of Muad'Dib's bloodline and because you want to break his monopoly on spice.
He who controls the spice controls the universe.
As long as Muad'Dib controls Arrakis, we are all at his mercy.
And that's why I intend to destroy that domination and return the Imperial Throne to the planet Kaitain, and the Corrino family, where it rightfully belongs.
Face dancers, sex toys, musicians, technicians.
Whatever the need...
...we have the breed.
Good God!
Good chemistry is more like it.
Duncan Idaho.
WENSICIA: Yes, the Atreides hero.
Paul Muad'Dib's most beloved friend and teacher.
But Idaho is dead.
Killed by your father's Sardaukar.
Even in defeat, my father's men did not abandon wisdom, Reverend Mother.
A few precious pieces of Idaho's ruined flesh, hidden away, saved.
Awaiting just the right time, the right place.
A perfect duplicate.
A perfect ghola.
Perfect gift for a lonely emperor.
A time bomb, waiting for the trigger to explode.
You intend to KILL Muad'Dib?
Exactly.
But that will mean chaos.
Spice production will be disrupted.
Learn the lesson my father ignored - it's not who controls the spice, but who has the ability to disrupt the spice who controls the universe.
But what makes you think
Muad'Dib will ever accept this... ghost?
I'm leaving it up to the Spacing Guild.
And what of the trigger?
The device to set the time bomb off?
Leave that to me.
Test after test, and still nothing.
I'm healthy, strong.
No matter what they do, the doctors can't find the reason why I am unable to conceive.
What does Muad'Dib say?
Muad'Dib is... afraid.
He fears for me if I have another child.
I can feel it.
He may be right to fear.
Someone has been feeding you a poison.
It's the only possibility left.
But the doctors have never found evidence.
They wouldn't.
Its traces are subtle, confusing.
Of the most sophisticated chemistry, beyond our knowledge.
Surely from off-world.
But... there are remedies.
The ancient Fremen diet, which might overcome the contraceptive's effects.
But it's dangerous.
You would be required to eat greater and greater quantities of spice.
And if you conceive, it will accelerate your pregnancy.
But the question remains,
"Who has been able
"to feed you the contraceptives for so long?"
MAN: Be that as it may, this is a question that cannot be delayed any longer.
The Great Houses are still demanding that a constitution be on the agenda at the next convention of the Landsraad.
It's nothing but a ruse, contrived by enemies of House Atreides to conceal far more sinister motives.
Perhaps we could offer the appearance of a constitution.
Something ceremonial.
It doesn't need to be real.
Deceit, after all, is a legitimate tool of statecraft.
Bravo, sister-in-law.
I couldn't have said it better.
Yes, perhaps something at the local level?
Something impotent.
Virtually meaningless.
No!
Atreides power must never be marginalised by the chaos of democracy.
I'm sure my brother agrees.
(Voice echoes) Father, Father.
I'm waiting.
You must decide.
It's the first step. It can't wait.
Love is all you have.
The answer's standing right in front of you but you must decide.
(Voice whispers) Muad'Dib.
Alia knows my mind.
I forbid a constitution.
"Order in Council this day, " etc, etc.
Irulan. Are you taking this down?
Yes, My Lord.
We will deliver the formal declaration when the Guild ambassador arrives to present his credentials.
Then there's nothing more.
A Guild embassy, Muad'Dib, on Arrakis?
The Council of Naibs won't like this, Muad'Dib.
We remember well how the Guild brought those who oppressed us, how they blackmailed us for spice to keep our secrets from our enemies.
Think I've forgotten, Stil?
This... decision troubles me, Muad'Dib.
There's something... reckless about it.
Not reckless, necessary.
You will know my reasons soon enough.
Now, I trust you'll convince the Naibs of the wisdom in this.
IRULAN: A Guild ambassador, here on Arrakis.
Muad'Dib's decision strikes some as mysterious, even dangerous.
But Muad'Dib never does anything without reason.
I should spill your water on the sand for what you've done.
I know it was you, Irulan.
You're the only one who could have hidden the poison.
(Hoarsely) Don't lie!
You will insult me if you lie!
It is my right to bear the royal heir.
It is your duty to play a role, nothing more.
I am his wife!
You have his name.
I am the one he calls 'wife'.
Do you think you are the only woman who truly loves him?
No.
But I am the only woman HE loves.
I could cuckold him.
Dare him to expose me.
Cuckold him all you like.
As long as you're discreet, he won't deny you.
But no child, Irulan.
Ever.
So, what do you think, Tyekanik?
Does my little prince have what it takes to lead a Sardaukar army one day?
There are many ways to lead an army, Princess.
Being a warrior is only one of them.
And not necessarily the best.
MAN: Prince Farad'N, your turn.
Muad'Dib's decision to accept the Guild ambassador is causing much unrest on Arrakis.
Hmm. Good.
Once the face dancer is insinuated into Muad'Dib's palace...
...we shall light the fuse.
PRINCE: Arggh!
And the Idaho ghola will do its work.
Mom! Mommy.
What is this?
I am sorry, Princess.
A future emperor crying?
I don't want to be an emperor.
Let someone else do it.
Oh, nonsense! Wipe your tears. Here.
Getting all over me now.
Alright, now, go back to your men.
Go back. Go.
Do you want the men to see you crying?
Do you want them thinking you're weak?
I don't care.
Well, I do.
So now you will go back.
And this time...
...you will do it properly.
Won't you?
Commander Farok, hero of the Naraj campaign.
I bring you greetings from your new friends on Salusa Secundus.
Hurry. The eyes of Muad'Dib are everywhere.
These are seats once occupied in sietch by Muad'Dib...
...during the days when he taught us the weirding way.
It is some time since you've seen him.
I think he's forgotten I ever existed.
He's blind.
Your son.
At the battle of Naraj.
I wonder if Muad'Dib knows how many have been maimed in his name.
I couldn't leave him to the desert.
Even I violated the old laws.
Laws of men have gone.
The laws of a god have replaced them.
We were a noble people once.
We had a proper sietch.
I owned a crysknife.
My own share of spice.
I was a rider of worms.
And then Muad'Dib came.
With his witch mother.
And he promised to fulfil Liet's prophecy.
And we fought.
You joined his jihad.
Do you know why?
I heard there was a thing called a 'sea'.
Men came back from Muad'Dib's wars and they said they had seen it.
And... did you find your sea?
It healed me of jihad.
Now I'm ready to help rid the universe of the cancer that is Muad'Dib.
And that is Otheym's daughter?
Lichna.
If you bring her to Muad'Dib, he will never refuse to see her.
I was hoping that's what you'd say.
Lichna.
I will enjoy being called Lichna.
What is the meaning of this?
Helen Gaius Mohiam of the Bene Gesserit, you have violated Muad'Dib's eternal order never to set foot on Arrakis again.
I am not on Arrakis. I am in free space.
There is no such thing as free space where Muad'Dib rules.
I abase myself before the Emperor.
We welcome you to our court,
Edric of the Spacing Guild, and to a new understanding between us.
Please allow me the honour of presenting His Majesty with a small token of our esteem.
According to our investigators, this one was killed here on Arrakis.
The body recovered after the unfortunate conflict between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen.
Terrible wounds required many months of regrowth by Tleilaxu technicians.
We acquired him as a gift befitting an emperor.
What is your name, ghola?
They say it was Duncan Idaho.
Idaho is dead!
This... thing is a horror!
Send him away!
And do you enjoy the name?
It stirs up curious feelings.
You don't know who you are?
I know nothing of my past, Sire.
How was this one trained?
It amused the Tleilaxu to train him as a Mentat.
I beg you, My Lord!
Let me take its water.
Find quarters in the keep for the ghola, Stil.
We accept this gift in the spirit with which it was given.
Majesty, there is the matter of Reverend Mother Mohiam.
She was removed from our heighliner by your agents in violation of our neutrality.
Be careful, Ambassador.
To be neutral is to be indifferent.
You would do well to disassociate yourself from those who have proven they are not.
As you will learn, Edric, my sister has the pulse of the court.
Be advised.
Reverend Mother.
I shudder to see you in such circumstances.
I've been in worse.
Do the cards answer all your questions?
Answers only breed more questions.
What is important is how one navigates between the two.
So you haven't forgotten everything we taught you.
Has the Emperor explained why I am to be detained?
He has not confided in me,
Reverend Mother.
But I hope it will not be too long.
We understand.
The sisterhood is aware of my delay?
They have changed your schedule in light of the situation.
I'll be patient, then.
You seem to be adapting to life here quite well.
I have made my peace with it.
I hope your training has been a help.
A comfort.
One day, even Muad'Dib will know the good you have done.
For us all.
You know how dangerous that was?
11 blades, Paul! 11!
Some of the finest swordsmen in the Imperium have never gone up against more than nine.
Experienced swordsmen would never be so reckless.
This is why you invaded my privacy?
To disapprove of my recklessness?
Spice gatherers found a body in the desert.
A young woman - a Fremen.
Fremen?
Decapitated.
And her hands removed.
So someone's afraid she'd be found before the desert does its work.
I want you to examine the scene the way our mother taught us.
You will take the ghola Mentat with you.
I assume you can handle him.
I should arrange a 'thopter.
Poison!
How can you tell?
The moulting of the skin.
Clearly the effect of rapid neurological atrophy - a Tleilaxu speciality.
Tleilaxu?
Face dancers.
This is a dead Fremen girl, My Lady.
What if there are no women reported missing amongst the Fremen?
Otheym's daughter, My Lord.
Lichna.
It's been many years since I've seen you.
And my father.
I must beg Muad'Dib's forgiveness for this intrusion, but...
...I am the smoke who banishes sleep in the night.
Sit.
Deliver your warning, then.
You must visit my father as soon as possible, My Lord.
There is a plot against you.
There are many plots against me.
This is a Fremen plot, Majesty.
My father has information for you.
But he is weak.
He is sick.
He needs you to visit so he can tell you.
Why didn't he tell you so you could tell me?
He feared I might be captured before seeing you.
If I know nothing, I can divulge nothing.
I leave for Otheym's tonight.
Otheym has missed... his old friend.
A face dancer.
Good one too.
Let me take its water.
No, Stil.
This must play out the way I've seen it.
MAN: Cursed be thy name, Atreides.
Your time has finally come.
BOY: Korba!
The stone burner is set and ready.
Let the others know, Javid.
Muad'Dib is in the streets.
Go.
So you've come, then.
We meet again, Muad'Dib.
Answering the call of the Fedaykin.
I carry your water burden, Otheym.
Command me.
(Sighs) I caught the spitting disease in Tarahell.
Ohh.
The tribe will take my water soon.
Let me summon my doctors.
WOMAN: We've had doctors...
...as good as any Muad'Dib could provide.
There's treachery, Muad'Dib.
I'm ashamed to say it.
Fremen plot against you.
They want time to stop.
They want things the way they used to be.
Bijaz has told me their names.
He was a gift to me, after our victories in Tarahell.
I am a person, not a gift.
Cheap to feed, but costly to fill.
Empty me as you will, Sire.
He always prattles on like that.
He's a good spy, though.
You should take him tonight.
Our enemies will think
I'm selling him for the money.
To be gone is to be bygone.
Let bygones be bygones and Bijaz and Muad'Dib must be gone by now.
He's right, Muad'Dib.
It's not safe for you to be here.
These are troubled times, old friend.
It was better when we were alone in the desert...
...with only the Harkonnen as our enemies.
BIJAZ: There's a thin line between enemy and friend.
Where that line stops, there's no beginning.
And no end.
Bygones be bygones, let them fall where they may.
This has been a dirty day.
The wind speaks of demons.
That is not the wind.
Stone burner!
Don't look at it, My Lord!
You can't look at it!
It was in the old quarter.
Stone burner, for sure.
What about Muad'Dib?
We are just entering the area now.
My Lord, is that you?!
Here. I'm over here!
Take this one and get him to the keep immediately.
Your eyes.
Do it, Fedaykin. DO IT NOW!
This way.
My Lord... your eyes.
My eyes are gone, Stil.
Muad'Dib... my gods!
Muad'Dib...
Calm, Stil.
They've blinded my body... but not my vision.
There are men who need your help,
Fedaykin, here and here!
The Law, Muad'Dib.
We live by Atreides law now, Stil.
None of these men are to be taken out into the desert.
Anyone who wants is to be fitted with Tleilaxu eyes.
MAN: Without eyes, yet he sees.
He has sight without eyes.
You knew this would happen.
It had to be.
Why?
Why?
For our son.
How long have you known?
I've always known.
It was just a matter of when.
Forgive me, Chani.
There was no way I could spare us this.
I waited as long as I could.
We will return to our desert, my love...
...to the sietch where our son will be born.
I'm afraid, Muad'Dib.
I suddenly feel like we have so little time.
We have eternity.
YOU have eternity.
I have only now.
So you are Bijaz?
Would I were Bijou and not Bijaz, a jewel is prettier than a horse's ass.
You're a mockery, then.
A trick of nature meant to confuse and annoy.
Annoy, yes.
Confuse, no.
Is wind a trick?
Then you're the wind?
No, I am words in the wind, words that are names, names that are death.
He knows.
What does he mean?
What I mean is what I say, and what I say is what I mean.
Time for account, unless you come just to mock at me.
My brother says you know the names of the traitors.
Poor Muad'Dib... poor Bijaz.
(Sings) ♫ Betrayed and betrayer together at last. ♫
You will give me the names of those who would betray us.
Very well, then.
Let's start with your priests.
He has another agenda.
How do you know?
I sense it.
Senses are dangerous.
They can be fooled.
Only a machine functions without senses.
Are you a machine, ghola?
I am a Mentat.
I trust only logic and statistics.
Not mysticism and prophecy?
My brother had a Mentat teacher who talked like that.
Hawat.
You remember?
You did that on purpose.
You remember.
No.
I feel.
There is a difference.
(Laughs) Is there?
It frightens you, doesn't it?
The memory?
You're afraid you'll remember who you were.
No ghola has ever been restored to his former being, child.
I'm no child.
I awakened to consciousness in my mother's womb.
I have memories of many women alive inside of me.
I know what they knew,
I feel what they felt, but I can handle it.
Can you?
Palace Fedaykin are everywhere.
By the time Alia's through, a common pickpocket won't be safe.
The fools even had a stone burner and they couldn't succeed.
Our spies have no idea who was responsible.
It could have been Fremen rebels from the deep desert.
It could have been an element within the Gesserit itself. We may never know.
What about Scytale?
He maintains his masquerade.
And the dwarf?
Confined to the keep.
No-one knows where.
Then our plan is still in place.
Mmm.
He's alive?
Gurney, tell me he's alive.
He is alive.
But he's blind.
It was a stone burner.
Stilgar suspects Fremen.
Alia? Chani?
All safe.
Blind?
Blind?
There are rumours that Paul can still see despite his blindness - vision sight.
They say it's a miracle.
Another brick for the myth of Muad'Dib.
My Lady?
Make arrangements for the Guild ambassador for immediate transport to Arrakis.
I don't think that would be wise.
It was only a matter of time before this happened.
Might not be long before it happens again.
And you would not want to encourage it.
Oh, forgive me, My Lady, but those who would rid themselves of Muad'Dib would only be more provoked by the arrival of his mother.
If Paul needs you, he would surely send for you.
We go forward. We come back.
We go forward. We come back.
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer's right in front of you.
The Golden Path. But you must decide.
It's the only way.
What troubles you, My Lord?
The future.
You're drunk on too much time.
I'm drunk on too much me.
You know how many people have died since I became Emperor?
Even your empire must live its time... and then die.
That's why you're here, isn't it?
Is that what you've seen... in your visions?
It's obvious to anyone who can see.
It's what the Tleilaxu have written upon you - to kill me.
What is it, Stil?
I have just received word from Salusa Secundus.
Shaddam is dead.
How very generous of Muad'Dib to permit his wife to attend the funeral of his mortal enemy.
And how grateful you must be for the safety my sacrifice assured our father...
...and you.
Not one major house representative.
Not one!
Muad'Dib would not allow any formal delegations, My Lady.
As far as he was concerned, your father died the day he was defeated on Arrakis.
My father was the 81st
Padishah Emperor, a colossus!
I mean, who is this bastard Atreides but some Bedouin charlatan?
Do not underestimate the power of Muad'Dib's prescience, My Lady.
Your father did... to his great misfortune.
My father was betrayed by you and your simpering Spacing Guild and those witches of the Bene Gesserit.
And for what? For spice.
You abandoned your emperor for spice.
We cannot guide our ships without it, My Lady.
And that is why you will help me kidnap a worm and bring it here.
I mean no disrespect, Princess, but take a worm from Arrakis?
Even if the Idaho ghola succeeds, there is still the sister to contend with.
We must be prepared with other means to diminish the Atreides power.
You want to bring a worm here?
Salusa Secundus might prove hospitable to the great worms of Arrakis.
If they thrived, a new spice cycle could begin.
And...?
Atreides monopoly would be broken.
Plans within plans.
If Muad'Dib ever suspected such a gambit, he would smash this planet and the Corrino name into oblivion.
We're already in oblivion.
Kidnap a worm from Arrakis.
The spice must flow.
Get out of the way!
The doctors say her metabolism has accelerated.
Pregnancy is proceeding faster than normal.
It, er... will be a dangerous birth.
Beloved.
I'm sorry. I've distracted you.
Shh, shh, shh.
If only you could distract me forever.
My body is confusing me, Muad'Dib.
My life burns faster.
I'm so hungry.
Always hungry.
Make arrangements, Stil.
We leave for the sietch as soon as possible.
The baby will be born there.
Inform my sister.
How long have you been there?
Long enough.
Are you sick, My Lady?
You don't know what it's like to hunt the future.
You've taken spice.
Too much.
My brother needs me, Duncan, and my vision is incomplete.
I need to remember. I need...
I need to remember the future.
I'm going to summon doctors.
No, no.
(Desperately) Don't leave me.
I just need to... just...
(Desperately) I can't move.
What are you doing to me?
I am playing. (Voice echoes)
You were made to be played...
...like Otheym, poor fellow.
We had a terrific struggle with you.
The flesh did not want to come back.
You are Tleilaxu?
Born and bred... in the same tank... just we two.
First me, then you.
Then you.
You are trying to bring out the violence in me.
Oh, no... not yet.
The script is written... but the stage is not set.
But one day soon, the Emperor will come to you, a mask of grief obscuring his face.
A mask of grief. (Hums tunefully)
And he'll say, "She's gone."
"She is gone."
And then you will finally remember what you're expected to do.
What you're expected to do.
What you're expected to do.
"She is gone." (Hums tunefully)
PAUL: She is gone, Duncan.
Now it's time to forget what you remember when day becomes night.
♫ Forgetting is not having
♫ Till the words are right. ♫
What do you see with those eyes?
What everyone sees.
We're leaving for the sietch this morning.
And I'm being left behind?
Appropriate, I'd say, considering what you've done.
I never meant to hurt Chani... or you.
I just...
I've given orders no harm is to come to you.
No matter what happens.
Is she...
She's well.
For the moment.
I've been cruel to you, Irulan.
I don't want your pity.
I'm offering none.
Simply telling you the truth.
You were destined.
A condition I understand only too well.
Destined to be used.
By you?
By your father.
By the Bene Gesserit, by the Spacing Guild.
Protect them from me.
And they'll get their wish.
I'm not exactly as they'd like.
I don't understand.
The time of plots and revenge is coming to an end.
You must have a chance to find peace.
I'm going to give you that chance.
It's ironic...
...but your selfish, clumsy attempts to mother an Imperial heir actually prolonged Chani's life.
And for that, I am grateful.
Forever.
Muad'Dib, is it truly necessary to bring the face dancer AND the dwarf?
They have their parts to play, Stil, just like you and me.
Chani and I will take this one.
Muad'Dib!
I know the way better than anyone else, Stil.
Except, perhaps, you.
You must remain here, as we agreed.
Time to settle accounts.
MAN: Stay where you are!
What's the meaning of this?
You plotted against Muad'Dib, Korba.
You conspired against your emperor.
You are under arrest for treason.
I am a Fremen.
I demand to be judged by Fremen law.
You will be, Korba.
You will be.
I used to hunt these here, when I was little.
It's amazing, the simple pleasures one has as a child.
But the desert is leaving now...
...taking simple pleasure with it.
I wonder if my father would approve of the future he inspired.
A storm comes, My Lady.
(Whispers) I am a desert creature, ghola.
I know when to hide.
Ooh!
Paul said he would join you as soon as the night council is concluded.
You called him Paul...
...his Atreides name.
I did.
A memory intruded where none should have been.
Then there are more... and it frightens you.
Duncan's memories, they scare you.
Are they Duncan's memories...
...or the inventions of those who made me?
When the moment comes to decide...
...you will know.
My Lady...
Ohh!
Oh!
(Weakly) Muad'Dib.
It was the birth, My Lord.
They said her body was drained by the speed of it.
These are your children, Muad'Dib.
Both are alive and strong.
Children?
Twins, My Lord. A boy and a girl.
I never saw children.
CHANI: Muad'Dib.
(Weakly) Muad'Dib.
Beloved...
...forgive me.
There are some things no-one can bear.
Problems in this universe...
...for which there are no answers...
(Tearfully) ..for which nothing can be done - nothing!
I am sorry.
Nothing in this universe...
...is as great...
...as my love for you.
(Panicked) Oh, I can't see!
My Lord? My Lord!
She's gone.
She is gone, Duncan.
She is gone, Duncan.
(Softly) She is gone.
VOICE: Then you'll finally remember what you're expected to do.
...you're expected to do... (Echoes)
This was the moment you came back to me, Duncan.
Stay where you are, both of you.
I warn you, a face dancer can move faster than you can possibly imagine.
So, it is truly you.
Duncan Idaho of the Atreides.
A ghola CAN regain his past.
Tell me, what do you remember?
Tell him.
Everything.
My childhood, my youth...
...my death.
We did it! We did it.
Majesty, don't you see what this means?
You can have her back again, your beloved Chani.
The proof is standing right in front of you.
We can restore the flesh and the spirit.
We can re-create her.
This was your plan all along.
Plots within plots, My Lord - you should know better than anyone.
We've been trying for decades to achieve this.
Make an alliance with us, Muad'Dib, the Tleilaxu.
Let us restore your beloved Chani.
Live content and safe for the rest of your life...
...with her, with your children.
(Echoing) With her, with your children.
My Lord, please, don't listen to this blasphemy.
Don't move, Duncan Idaho.
You kill me, and you're killing
Muad'Dib's children.
You can feel it, can't you, Muad'Dib?
Can't you?
You can hear her...
CHANI: I am afraid, Muad'Dib.
...calling your name.
(In Chani's voice) Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib.
Father... don't be afraid, Father.
I'm here, Father, as you knew I would be.
We go forward, we go back - don't be afraid.
We are pre-born, my sister and I, thanks to our mother and the spice.
Thanks to you.
Father, yes, it IS me!
We go forward, we go back...
Father, we are pre-born, my sister and I.
Thanks to you.
(Echoing) My eyes...
...let me see for you.
I can do it. I can bring her back to you.
Use my eyes, Father. Use them!
My eyes, let me see for you.
My eyes, Father. Use them!
I can do it. I can bring her back.
Let us give you back your love.
The children. The children!
They're safe, Muad'Dib.
I meddled in the future, in all possible futures...
...trying to create them.
Instead, they created me and I became trapped by them.
Yes, but knowing there's a trap is the first step in evading it.
The first step along the Golden Path.
Don't be afraid, Father.
The answer is right in front of you.
Finally I am free.
IRULAN: History is written on the sands of Arrakis.
Those who wished an end to House Atreides have failed.
No longer an emperor, no longer a god, a simple blind Fremen wanders alone into the desert to die.
They say he has gone on a journey...
...into the land where men walk without footprints.
He will not be found.
Yet all men will find him.
I wonder if that's what he wanted.
I need you, Duncan.
More than ever.
Stay with me.
IRULAN: Muad'Dib is gone but his children remain and conspiracies continue to breed.
The saga of Dune is far from over.

Too much for you? Give up?
Ay! Let go of me!
Ay! Let me go!
You've disappointed me.
Good! The best!
I told you, Muay, to bet on him. We're rich! Rich!!
Muay! Pick up the coins!
Enough for today!
You won't get your money back.
Ai Tim!
You're so good, we have a great opportunity to get rich now.
Brilliant!
Ai Don!
Follow them!
Music!
Get them!
Quick! Let's go!
Ai Don!
Follow them.
This week I have to see customers.
I want you to get things ready.
Tell me first if there is a problem.
Yes, Boss.
I want you to report everything.
Ai Hum Lae!
Where will we find Ai Bak Don?
You eat your food first. Eat!
Don't worry.
I'll find him!
At the rice mill everyone know him well.
Eat!
Muay! Tomorrow you'll go with me.
May be some chance to get money.
I can't. Exams tomorrow.
Exams! I've never seen you attend class.
How can you pass?
Do you have something special with the teacher?
- What!?
- A joke, a joke.
You're a good student, you're clever.
Eat...
Thanks a lot for helping me to find Ong-Bak.
Don't thank me.
Ai Yod, you owe me 3 months of rent.
What are you going to do?
Er... Give me 3 days.
I'll pay you. This time for sure.
You said "sure" too many times already.
I want money today... otherwise you must move out.
Will you accept this ring instead?
Okay.
You must pay the rent within 7 days.
If you have no money again,
I'll kick you out. Understand?
Son, I want you to return home with Bak Tim.
Don't worry if you don't have enough money.
I don't mind if you don't want to become a monk.
I only want you to visit us.
I miss you, son.
What's the matter!?
Am I not as good as your ex-husband?
You spoil my mood.
Don!
I don't want to sell drugs any more.
Why?
I want to stop.
You want to stop?
Really want to stop?
Come here!
You think you can stop that easily.
You think you can, but you can't.
Who?
Hey! Ai Don!
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek!
- Where is Ong-Bak?
- I don't know.
- You brought it here!
- I don't know!
Ai Tim.
Get away.
Pi Ngek!
Get out quickly, Don.
Go. Go!
Call an ambulance for Room 212.
She's dying. Urgent!
Ai Tim! Come here quickly in a Tuk Tuk.
Hurry up.
You're dead.
Keep following me!
Come! You're dead.
Huh! Ai Tim.
Ai Tim! Brake! Brake! Brake quickly!
Oh, Bhudda! Oh!
Spread them out.
Oh! Damn!
Get out!
You're dead.
Remember! You must search every square metre.
Don't miss anything.
Most important, you must not allow any strangers in.
Understand?
Damn them! They keep chasing after me.
Get in.
Today the Police and National Heritage have found... lots of Buddha statues and relics on the Chao Praya river's bank.
This finding of invaluable objects is very significant.
Because every piece is a national treasure.
National Heritage is making a catalogue for protective conservation.
We will report any developments to this story.
I told you not to cause trouble.
I didn't. They are looking for Ong-Bak.
What's Ong-Bak?
The head of the Buddha statue that I brought to you.
Why does this man cause me so much trouble?
I lost my betting money, and all my relics collection... because of one peasant.
I'm sorry. I can't save her.
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek!
Pi Ngek! Pi Ngek, don't leave me.
Who's she?
Muay's big sister.
You can't leave me. I have nobody.
Muay... Muay...
Ngek asked me to give this to you...
"For Muay - College Fees"
I don't want it. Don't want it.
I want you. I have nobody else.
You can't leave. I've no one else.
Don't be so sad, Muay.
Birth and death are part of life.
I won't leave you.
What's this? What?
Where are you taking me?
Let's go. Go quickly. Go, go!
Do you know who I am?
How dare you attack my property!
I don't know. It's between Ai Tim and Ai Don.
True! I don't know.
I know that you are looking for this head.
Do you really want it?
If you want it, I've a game for you to play.
I saw Ong-Bak with my own eyes.
If you accept to fight for him, he will give you Ong-Bak and release Muay.
What are you going to do?
Tell me.
I will do anything... to bring back Ong-Bak to Ban Nong Pradoo.
I'll sacrifice even my life.
Why do you call me to leave the frontier?
To warn you to stay away from political issues and I want you to make a bet.
Oh. You want to revenge that country boxer to death!
How much you want to bet? Your call.
You don't call the shots anymore!?
On the east corner is a Thai Boxer.
He's new to us.
The Burmese Boxer is on the west corner.
He's one of the best.
Now the fight has begun.
Ai Tim! Ai Tim! Are you okay?
Enough.
Hey! If you want Ong-Bak, follow me.
You're crooks too.
Tim lost the fight so I could win the bet.
Huh! This is Pra.
It's just the head of some worthless statue that you're trying to get.
I'm not interested in the head.
I just want you to box for me.
Don't dare challenge me, because I can make you live or die.
Damn you! You did betray us.
Ai Tim lost the fight for you...
Why don't you return the head to him?
Son of a bitch!
Calm down.
Finish them after I've gone.
You got hurt, but I got the money.
Remember that I ordered this.
Get rid of them.
I can't help if they don't listen.
Huh! Kill them!
Pi Yod!
Damn! I told him not to make a noise.
Hey! Do it quickly!
Police may be here soon.
Hey! Go there.
Where is Ong-Bak?
- Hey! I go with you.
- No. I can't let anyone die for Ong-Bak.
Except me... only me.
Ai Tim... Ai Tim!
Let me help you.
I don't want to be like this.
I apologize to you.
Let me do one good deed for Ban Nong Pradoo.
At least... let me start the bike for you.
I, Bak Hum Lae, from Ban Nong Pradoo.
Don told me there is a secret cave behind the next mountain.
Still not dead!
You want Ong-Bak!
You have to exchange it with your life.
We're cutting the biggest head.
Ai Tim! Ai Tim... Ai Ti...
Ai Hum Lae! Are you okay?
Go and get Ong-Bak. Go!
Don't worry about me.
Go and get Ong-Bak.
Go!
Huh! Where're you running to?
Continue working! Cut the head off!
Be careful!
Last time I told him to lose.
- The head is off now, Boss.
- Good. Pull it off.
Die... e... e...
You want this head!
I want to see if it's unbreakable.
Ai Hum Lae!
Ai Hum Lae... Are you hurt?
Take... take... Ong-Bak back to our... our village.
Ai Pi Yod! Ai Pi Yod!
What's happenning?
Ai Hum Lae.
Muay... finish... your studies... and find... a good job.
Bak Tim...
Tell my dad I can't become a monk.
Huh! What are you saying?
Let's go to the hospital and you'll be fine, Pi Yod.
Ai Hum Lae.
Ai Pi Yod, Ai Pi Yod. Huh!
You can't die!
You promised not to leave me. You can't die.
You can't do this!
You mustn't lie to me. You cannot lie to me.
Do you understand? You promised me!
I've nobody else! I've nobody else!
Wake up now! Don't do this to me.
You can't... can't. Understand?
Wake up now! Ai Pi Yod, you can't die.
You must keep your promise!
Arrakis.
Dune.
A land so starved for water a single tear is cherished.
It is here and only here where can be found:
The spice.
Greatest treasure in the universe.
And the never-ending cause of conflict, betrayal, and murder.
Muad'Dib.
No.
Another bad dream, Uncle?
No, it's indigestion, that's all, miserable food here.
I can't wait to be off this foul planet.
What are you doing here, boy?
They're dead, Uncle.
The Bene Gesserit witch and her son, both dead.
We discovered a Fremen sietch not far from where our thopter crashed.
They'd been rescued by that Atreides snake, Duncan Idaho.
The ecologist, Kynes, was with them.
The Emperor's man.
We killed Idaho, captured Kynes.
The witch and her son were last seen driving a thopter into a sandstorm.
- You've seen the bodies?
- They're most certainly dead.
You've seen the bodies?
Nothing survives one of those storms, Uncle.
The wind was over 800 kilometers an hour.
Nothing survives.
How long have I been asleep?
Not long.
The storm passed a little while ago.
It was Yueh.
He's the one who betrayed us.
They had his wife.
You should put it on, Paul.
You're the duke now.
We have to get out of here.
I found some supplies stowed in the compartment by the hatch:
Paracompass, vision goggles, stillsuits.
- But where will we go?
- To find the Fremen.
Fremen?
We're going to need them...
...to take back Arrakis.
How do we know which way to go?
South.
That's into the deep desert.
There were rumors of sietch communities there.
That's where we'll find the Fremen...
...or die trying.
I'm all right.
It's just the stress. I'm fine.
Please, Your Majesty, please.
You must control your anger.
Did you think I wouldn't find out?
Or did you think I would just be too simple-minded to see the truth?
Leave us alone.
What happened on Arrakis was beyond my control, Daughter.
An ancient feud between royal houses.
Don't patronize me, Father.
Isn't it enough that you used me?
Used you?
Sending me to the duke as a token of your support...
...making me a courier of your esteemed respect...
- ...while you were plotting behind his back.
- Quiet, child.
Or was that your idea, Fenring?
That would be something your perverse mind would suggest.
- Watch your tongue, girl.
- And what will you do if I don't?
Send me into the desert to die like that poor boy and his mother?
No one sent them anywhere. They fled.
Despite the Baron's efforts...
...he assures me he did everything he could to secure them from harm.
You were involved, Father.
I know you were.
Or at least you did nothing to prevent it.
Enough!
There will come a time, Daughter...
...when you will have to shed this naiveté of yours...
...and learn what it means to rule an empire.
And when that time comes, Father...
...you may learn to regret it.
It's only another few kilometers, that's all.
Hurry, we don't have much time.
The sun will soon be up full.
We'll have some shade in here.
If there are Harkonnen patrols this far out, they'll have a tough time spotting us.
Such a pity.
A pity that you had to get mixed up in this business, Doctor.
I'm not mixed up in it, Baron.
I'm the Emperor's servant, nothing more and nothing less.
So you did not lead them to that warren of Fremen scum?
That was Idaho's idea.
- He had forged a friendship with them.
- Yes.
We know all about Idaho and his efforts on the duke's behalf.
A foolish, desperate gambit.
And where was that Fremen trash when he needed them?
What will you say when the Emperor questions you about what happened here?
What's your impression?
The desert is an indiscriminate executioner, Baron.
I suppose that Bene Gesserit whore...
...and her spawn have found that out, haven't they?
Be sure he recalls his flimsy denials when he's face to face...
...with death's sweet smile.
Muad'Dib.
Tell me about the waters of your homeland, Muad'Dib.
On Caladan we ruled by air and sea, Paul.
But here, on Arrakis, you need desert power.
- It's calling to you.
- Tell me about the waters.
Tell me about the waters of your homeland, Muad'Dib.
It'll be night soon. We'll move on.
Did you get any rest?
Some.
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
Try not to slow us down as much tonight.
How is my sister?
I'm having dreams again.
Visions.
Even when I'm awake.
I've seen her, Mother, inside of you.
Even your father didn't know.
Why not?
There wasn't time.
What have you done to me?
- I gave birth to you.
- A freak.
- No, not a freak.
- Then what?
This place is changing me.
It's the spice.
It's in the air we breathe, in the food we eat.
I can't escape it.
Drink it all.
The best place to conserve water is in your body.
The stillsuit will do the rest.
If we stay on this dune we'll reach those mountains a lot sooner.
Is that a good idea?
It's the most direct path.
You all right?
Yes.
Hold on.
That shouldn't have happened.
I was careless about these dunes.
We lost our paracompass.
Can you hear that?
It's a worm!
It must have heard the sand fall.
Run! Just run!
- I can't see it!
- Don't stop!
A thumper?
Someone called it away.
Did you smell it? The cinnamon smell.
The spice.
Everywhere.
When the worm came.
There had to have been people for this many plants to survive.
Fremen.
We have to find them.
Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen.
Don't run, intruders. There is no escape.
I know you.
You're Stilgar...
...the Fremen who came to see my father with Duncan Idaho.
That was a sloppy crossing you made from the crash.
You called a worm.
You were watching us?
- All of that time?
- We didn't see you.
- You weren't meant to.
- We're wasting time here, Stil.
- This is the boy Liet told us to seek.
- How can you be sure?
- I say we take their water and move on.
- Be quiet, Jamis.
As you can hear, I have a problem to solve.
My people are cautious and pragmatic.
Good qualities in the desert.
Better sometimes to miss an opportunity than invite disaster.
Your only value at the moment is the water in your flesh.
You know the law, Stil.
Yes.
The law.
Tell them to stop hunting my son.
Tell them.
Leave off! Leave the boy alone!
Do you hear me?
Is this the way you welcome friends of Liet?
Is it?
As leader of this tribe...
...I'm offering the Weirding woman and her son sanctuary.
No Fremen will lay a hand on you while you have my protection.
For how long?
Don't be a fool, woman.
You're fugitives from the Harkonnen.
Don't be fugitives from us as well.
Merciful God!
I've heard of the Weirding ways.
Imagine what a man could do with it.
No doubt we have much to teach each other.
You can come down, boy!
Your mother has shown her worth.
He won't move unless I say so.
Discipline. Good.
He's here!
He is unharmed.
We are coming down.
Leave me alone.
Made a lot of noise climbing.
He has much to learn.
- Stilgar.
- Can you travel, Jamis?
He surprised me, that's all.
- Of course I can travel.
- Good.
We have now two with us who are not trained.
In squad lines with flankers.
We have to make Cave of Ridges before full sun.
Chani, you will be responsible for him.
My name is Paul.
Only until we give you a new one.
Follow me. Do exactly as I do.
Across there is home...
...Sietch Tabr.
We'll be there tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
That must be hundreds of kilometers from here.
It will be a hard ride.
Sun will be up soon.
Patrols sometimes come this far.
We can't let them see us.
When you give us your stillsuits, we will recover your water for you.
Here is some food.
Spice.
We don't have delicacies from the cities like you are used to.
It's fine.
She's the one, isn't she?
The one you've seen in your dreams?
I can tell by the way you stare at her.
I don't know what it means.
Be careful, Paul.
We are new to these people as they are to us.
Everything we say and do must be careful.
Predicting the future, then plotting to make it so.
These are superstitious people.
If we are to survive, it will be best to accommodate their legends.
I'm the steward of the sand.
I am a desert creature.
A desert creature.
Not finished yet!
Still have work to do!
The pre-spice mass.
I am a desert crea...
Spice blow.
Somewhere to the east.
A large field from the looks of it.
We have to send gatherers before Harkonnen pirates come for it.
You harvest the spice?
For bribes to the Spacing Guild.
It's Liet's wish.
We pay them to keep our skies free of their satellites...
...so that no one can know what we are doing here.
You will learn.
Amtal!
I invoke amtal.
Jamis.
What is this?
His way of dealing with what happened the other night.
That was an accident.
He bested me because there was witch-force at Tuono basin.
Amtal! It's my right!
We must not interfere.
Jamis has called him out.
You're starting something you're going to regret.
- Stilgar.
- You must step back.
If you know what's good for you, you'll find an honorable way...
...to leave this thing alone.
Silence!
I invoke silence.
She's trying to put a spell on me.
If you try that again, we know it's your witchcraft.
I won't be able to protect you or the boy anymore.
Come. You can't stop this.
A crysknife, our ritual weapon.
Use it well.
May your blade chip and shatter.
I'm going to bathe this knife with your blood.
First, you'll have to find my blood.
- Do you yield?
- Yield?
There is no yielding. It's to the death, boy!
- He's never had to kill.
- What?
Then he'd better learn.
Finish. Don't toy with him.
He's bested Jamis.
This didn't have to happen.
It is our way.
Your way. Killing each other.
No man recognizes leadership without the challenge of combat.
There is a legend among us...
...that a voice from the out-world will come.
The Mahdi.
He will hold the key to our future.
It is said that a Bene Gesserit will be his mother.
A Sayyadina.
Friend of God.
There are rumors about you and your son.
From the city. Liet.
You hope I am that one? That Paul is?
I hope...
...and I fear.
If it's true, your boy will have to call me out one day...
...to challenge me for the leadership of the tribe.
The huanui is prepared. It's time.
It's our way.
From water does all life begin.
The flesh belongs to the person...
...but his water belongs to the tribe.
I was a friend of Jamis.
When the hawk plane fell upon us...
...at Hole-in-the-Rock...
...it was Jamis who pulled me to safety.
I was a friend of Jamis.
I was a friend of Jamis.
I was a friend of Jamis.
He taught me...
...that when you kill...
...you pay for it.
Bila-Kayfa!
He sheds tears.
He gives water to the dead.
Jamis carried 33 liters of the tribe's water.
Counted and measured.
Combat water is entrusted to the winner.
Because you fight without stillsuit...
...you may regain the water you lost fighting.
May you guard it for the tribe, preserve it against loss...
...be generous with it in time of need.
May you pass it on in your time for the good of the tribe.
Needs a naming now, Stil.
It's time.
What would you have us call you, young Atreides?
By what name do you wish Fremen to know you?
What is the name of that little mouse?
The one in the desert. The one that jumps.
Muad'Dib.
Is that the name you wish?
Yes.
Muad'Dib.
Wise in the ways of the desert.
Hiding from the sun. Traveling at night.
We call him the "teacher of boys".
Muad'Dib.
A fine choice.
So, from now on you will be addressed as Muad'Dib.
Wait for my signal.
Then you must do exactly as I do.
Your lives will depend on it.
There.
Get ready.
What is that?
The one who will come. Mahdi.
It's the gatherer Stilgar sent to the spice blow.
Give her some time, Muad'Dib.
Liet is dead.
- We found his remains at the spice blow.
- Doctor Kynes is dead?
Harkonnen treachery.
She loved her father very much.
It needs a new dew collector.
Tell me about the waters of your homeland, Muad'Dib.
We had rivers of it.
Great flowing veins of water.
From the snows of mountains...
...into lakes so wide you couldn't see the other side.
Oceans of water.
Our home was on the coast.
Great waves would hurl themselves against the cliffs.
They used to put me to sleep.
My father had a dream, Muad'Dib.
A dream that one day...
...we could change this place...
...make it more like your homeland.
Windtrap.
Plenty of moisture this morning.
My father is at peace.
Muad'Dib.
We have thousands of these caches.
Only a few of us know them all.
I know this place.
- No off-worlder has ever seen it.
- I have.
In my dreams.
This is the water we will use to change the face of Arrakis.
As my father taught us...
...the voice from the out-world will come.
The Mahdi.
We will make a paradise of Arrakis.
And no man shall ever want for water again.
Muad'Dib.
Come.
You summoned me, Highness?
- I have a special errand for you, Farrah.
- I'm here to serve, Milady.
I'm sending you to the Harkonnen planet,
Giedi Prime.
I want you to insinuate yourself among the fat Baron's family.
His nephew, Feyd, the narcissistic type...
...should be especially amenable to your expert charms.
And how will you want me to use him?
I want to know what happened the night
Duke Leto and his family were killed.
I want to know how it was planned...
...who was involved...
...and I want to know who the Harkonnen allies were.
I'll do my best.
I've no doubt of that.
Just as you said, Stil.
Harkonnen greed for spice is the most reliable beacon in the universe.
- Reconnaissance team on the ground.
- Ground recon proceed to spice patch.
Anyone else hear that?
We didn't even have to damage the thopter.
The men will fly it to our caves at Bight.
That was our last communication.
No mayday or wreckage when we went to investigate.
That's the third thopter this month!
The patch turned out to be mock spice.
- It was probably a plant to lure them there.
- Fremen scum!
We caught these last night, a village near the rimwall...
...known to be desert sympathizers.
Mercy, Governor.
We are refugees.
- We need food.
- Liar!
Spies! That's what you are!
Spies for the Fremen scum!
Fremen scum who raid my spice warehouses!
- Who destroy royal equipment!
- No. We are poor. We have no weapons.
He was trying to dispose of this when we caught him.
Send words to the filth of the desert!
Tell them what you witness here!
Tell them this is what awaits them!
Mahdi!
Put that away, Feyd, and come here.
I want you to see this.
The latest love letter from your brother.
Mahdi!
Appears to be enjoying himself.
The moron's appetite for killing never ceases to amaze me.
By the time he's finished, there won't be a population left to rule.
Cheer up, lovely boy.
I merely allow him to brutalize them, to savage them, until you arrive...
...the handsome Feyd, to rescue them from the beast, Rabban.
They will be ripe for you, lovely boy.
Feyd, the saviour.
There will be cheering in the streets.
You can even give them your brother's head as a gift, if you like.
And then you will squeeze, like the grips of a vice...
...so our treasuries become fat with the profit of spice.
No man recognizes leadership...
...without the challenge of combat.
It is the way.
Call him out!
What do you see...
...Muad'Dib...
...when you go away like that?
Where is it you go?
Many places, Stil.
Many roads.
Many choices.
These choices...
...are good or bad?
It's hard to know sometimes.
Either they are good choices or bad choices.
Aren't you ever afraid, Stil?
Of storms?
Of the future.
The future, Muad'Dib, just is.
They're like ghosts! Everywhere!
Need immediate evacuation!
They just keep coming!
Need immediate evacuation!
We are ready, Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib, it's time. We must hurry.
He's waiting, Reverend Mother.
- Who else knows he's here?
- No one.
He made it clear on his arrival that we should summon you and no other.
The other witches must leave.
As you wish.
This visit is as indiscreet as it is unexpected.
Let's hope the Emperor's curiosity isn't aroused.
The Emperor's suspicions are easily moderated...
...by his dependence on our services.
As you are so fond of reminding us.
The navigators are concerned.
- Concerned?
- They are disturbed about the future.
There is a problem on the horizon.
What kind of problem?
They are troubled by a nexus they can't fully explore...
...an intersection of events...
...a meeting of countless delicate decisions beyond which lies a path...
...they cannot see.
And where is this nexus?
Planet Arrakis.
House Harkonnen controls Arrakis now.
The Atreides are dead.
It is not a matter of feuding royal houses.
We sense a higher order interfering.
A misstep could be catastrophic.
Then we understand one another.
Completely.
We'll do what we can.
I thought...
...I felt something.
The spice must flow.
The balance of power must be maintained.
Sayyadina?
I'm awake, Chani.
Has there been any word, a courier perhaps?
No. The raids are in the Haga basin.
They won't risk communication until they are deep across the bled.
- Forgive me, Sayyadina.
- Was there something else?
No.
It's just your skin.
My skin?
We've heard the stories about off-worlders...
...the ones who come from water planets.
Skin so moist it's like cream.
- Muad'Dib's skin is like that.
- Paul?
Muad'Dib is still a boy.
I mean, he still has the glow of youth.
Yes.
I say my prayers for his safe return.
We both do, Chani.
The smugglers transport our spice tribute to the cursed Spacing Guild.
The Emperor never knows.
But bribes are dangerous, Stil.
They have a way of getting larger.
The safe way is the slow way, Muad'Dib.
Bribes keep the skies of our sietches clear.
Bribes buy us time.
Something wrong, Muad'Dib?
I thought I saw someone I knew.
I'll call them in.
Tell them to hold the smugglers' departure.
No, Stil.
Let them go.
I must have been mistaken.
Gurney.
My father's patience is wearing thin.
These troubles on Arrakis are proving difficult to manage...
...and our time is running short.
I want you to make arrangements for a trip to Giedi Prime.
Milady?
The Baron's nephew is having a birthday celebration.
The Emperor ought to be represented, don't you think?
I'm in the mood for a party.
Besides, it's time to shed some of this naiveté.
She is not going!
I'm not going to allow that headstrong, meddlesome child loose in Babylon.
My God, what a catastrophe that would be.
The eldest daughter of the Imperial House ensnared by the likes of Harkonnen...
...and his dreadful progeny.
Yes, catastrophe indeed.
But perhaps the seducer could be seduced.
The more we know of the Baron's schemes, the more we are prepared for the endgame.
Our operatives on Giedi Prime have limited access.
Your daughter, on the other hand...
...has proved quite adept at intelligence gathering.
Gently chaperoned,
I should think she'd prove quite useful...
...once again.
You've heard the voices from your sietches.
They say the Mahdi has come.
But you...
...the naibs of your tribes are still cautious.
You resist.
But I am offering you the future.
The future as Liet saw it.
- How do you know what Liet saw?
- Because I've seen it.
Here.
And here.
And once we rid Arrakis of the vile Harkonnen...
...we can complete his dream.
I promise this.
Arrakis will become the paradise
Liet imagined.
You'll never rid Arrakis with guerrilla raids, boy.
It will take all-out war.
That's why I'm asking you for hundreds of your best young men.
I want to give them the Weirding way...
...so they can come back to you and train hundreds more.
So those hundreds can train hundreds more.
And then hundreds will become thousands!
The Fedaykin.
A force to rival the dreaded Sardaukar.
A force to terrify the Emperor himself!
My father once told me...
...that here on Arrakis...
...one needed desert power to rule.
You are desert power...
...and nothing can stop you...
...if you believe.
So you are the one.
Jessica of the Weirding, our Reverend Mother Ramallo.
Mapes said you were beautiful.
She also said she pitied you.
I need no one's pity.
That remains to be seen.
There is much talk of you in the sietches.
I hear the people speaking of the Mahdi.
I hear them shout the name Muad'Dib.
He is a natural leader like his father.
The men admire his courage.
It will take more than courage to survive what's coming.
The boy...
...he knows what it is that's happening here?
He is aware.
You've exploited our legends well.
We had to survive.
And you may...
...for a while.
But remember this: the very legend which protects you...
...can also destroy you.
- How are you feeling?
- Well.
Tired sometimes.
Healthy.
And growing fast.
I saw the one they call the Reverend Mother.
Yes. She came from the southern sietch.
- Why?
- To see me.
To see you.
She's Bene Gesserit.
One of our missionaries.
Convenient.
Stilgar says you've learned much.
He's tougher than Hawat ever was.
Chani is happy to see you, I noticed.
Why didn't you marry him, Mother?
Because I loved him.
As long as your father remained unmarried...
...some of the great houses could still hope for an alliance through marriage.
We both knew what that meant.
- There were no illusions.
- You would have allowed it?
I would have encouraged it.
Politics.
Yes.
Politics.
While I was on the hajra...
...I had dreams about this garden.
Except it wasn't here, it was somewhere else.
Was I there?
Yes.
And there were children...
...playing, very happy.
A wonderful dream.
Do you think it's possible to love someone enough...
...you'd be willing to give that person up?
I think...
...there are times when it's necessary to share the one you love...
...with things greater than both of you.
Everything is connected, one thing to another.
The living and the dead, the animate and the inanimate.
A system.
All parts functioning to serve the whole.
Smell the air, Muad'Dib.
Cinnamon.
The pre-spice mass is below us.
Maybe 100 feet or more, but ripe.
The Maker has left her nest long ago.
Her children have joined together for survival.
They have grown.
They are losing water now.
It will mix with their waste.
If enough has accumulated...
...a giant bubble of foam will heave up with tremendous force.
A spice blow.
Trading places with the sands above.
The sun and heat will dry it out and...
...soon...
- Spice.
- Treasure of the universe.
The worm...
...is the spice.
So now you know.
Many of the little makers will die in the blow.
The rest will swim off to become Shai-hulud, the Great Worm.
We may capture a few.
Keep them stunted for Water of Life.
That's enough for now.
When religion and politics ride in the same cart...
...the whirlwind follows.
You are the Kwisatz Haderach, boy.
The one who can be many places at once.
You are the whirlwind.
It's almost night, Muad'Dib.
Time to return to the sietch.
You've been dreaming.
Too impatient, Farok.
You moved too soon.
Try again.
Watch his posture.
Even the slightest change in his breathing gives you advantage.
Better, Farok. You'll have it soon.
I am Otheym.
These are my brothers from Sietch Gara Kulan.
We've come to find the one who calls himself Muad'Dib.
You're a long way from your tribe, Otheym.
We've come to join your crusade.
We want to learn the Weirding way.
We want to become Fedaykin.
- You have the blessing of your naib?
- We do.
- We could fight as Muad'Dib.
- I believe you.
Let their waters join with ours.
I must congratulate you on the perfection of your heir, Baron.
He faces his 100th slave gladiator in the arena this afternoon.
He appears ready.
Well then, perhaps we might take this opportunity...
...to conduct our conversations.
There is much to discuss.
Indeed.
If that meets with your approval, Milady.
I am quite entertained here.
Fine.
By your leave, then.
What other house would have been willing to humiliate itself...
...so the Emperor could rid himself of a troublesome duke?
He's been asking himself that very question.
Are you suggesting that the Emperor contemplates a move against me?
Speculation is not a worthy science, Baron.
Better we spend our energy on what's most important.
The spice must flow.
I must say I've always found
Harkonnen architecture rather...
...curious.
Harkonnen patrols have taken more risks...
...coming deeper into the southern regions than ever before.
Sooner or later our bribes to the Guild won't be enough to protect us.
Then it's agreed.
We move with the next moons.
When the Harkonnen find this place...
...there must be nothing left but the wind howling through the rocks.
There is no turning back now.
Subdue the Maker.
The Maker is dead.
The Water of Life.
May Shai-hulud have mercy on both of us.
When night falls again, we have to leave this sietch...
...that has sheltered us for so long.
We must go south into the deep desert...
...where the demon Harkonnen will not pursue us.
But our Reverend Mother will not survive another hajra.
So that we don't have to make the journey without her strength and guidance...
...Sayyadina Jessica has consented to undergo the rites at this time.
This is dangerous and Jessica may fail.
So that we don't lose all, Chani...
...daughter of Liet, will be consecrated as Sayyadina...
...Friend of God.
I consecrate the daughter of Liet...
...in the Sayyadina.
Here is the Water of Life, the water that will free your soul.
If you are our Reverend Mother, the universe will open to you.
Let Shai-hulud judge now.
You must drink it now.
What's happening to her?
The water is poisoned until she changes it.
This must take its course.
Mother? Mother?
You cannot go there.
That is the place we cannot look.
The place only the Kwisatz Haderach may go.
You must turn away, Jessica, or it will drive you mad.
Don't be afraid. I have much to show you.
Here is my life, Jessica of the Weirding.
And the lives that have come before, they are yours now.
You are pregnant.
You should have told us.
Holy Mothers, what have we done?
This changes you both.
Your daughter is in danger.
Take her into your arms.
She must see all that we see.
That is the only way you can save her.
Change the waters, Jessica.
You must change them now.
The plan was perfect in its simplicity and viciousness.
Of course it was.
You helped your uncle design it, didn't you?
Duke Leto thought he was gaining control of Arrakis...
...but he was only being fattened up for sacrifice.
The kill, Feyd. Tell me about the kill.
Swift and merciless.
The Atreides never had a chance.
The Sardaukar had the palace sealed within hours.
The Sardaukar.
I sent the final communique to your father myself.
Mother?
Yes?
Mother Ramallo is gone.
But she remains.
You have changed the waters.
Now we know you cannot be false.
Paul?
The Reverend Mother has changed the Water of Life.
It's now safe for us to drink!
The son and his mother, the duke's concubine and her son...
...what did you do with them?
Lost in the storm, devoured by the desert.
You found their bodies and disposed of them?
Never found them.
You never found the bodies?
You're trembling.
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Of you.
You make me see things.
What do you see?
I see us together.
There is a great storm.
I have a child in my arms.
Our child, Muad'Dib.
It's not a dream.
I know you, Chani.
I've always known you.
We've sat upon a rock above the sands and I've eased your fears.
We've caressed in the darkness of the sietch.
We've grown old together.
History will say that the Fremen were about to find their messiah.
That Paul Atreides would find his revenge...
...and the world, as we knew it, would change forever.
The saga of Dune is far from over.
Stop!
Hey, y'all
Little bugger!
Not live rounds, Lara.
He's in real pain right now.
This is a major remodel.
This is a disaster.
Was it programmed to stop before it took my head off?
Ah, well, that would be a no.
But you said make it more challenging, so...
Hence, the live fire.
Live rounds again.
Poor Simon.
What has she done to you?
Oh. Very funny.
I'm only trying to turn you into a lady.
And a lady should be modest.
Yes, a lady should be modest.
Brothers and sisters, today is the 15th of May, the first day of the planetary alignment, and we are still no nearer to discovering the location of the key.
It seems we are running out of time.
This is not acceptable.
Mr Powell, your explanation for this, please?
I have no explanation.
Certainly no excuses.
Except to once again respectfully remind the council that we are working from clues based on ancient cosmological models predating Aristotle.
But I'm happy to announce that we're almost ready.
And I am supremely confident that we will have our answer in time for the relevant planetary alignment.
So, we will have possession of the key in one week.
Yes, indeed. One week.
This is good news, Mr Powell, but remember, we have only a single opportunity to retrieve the two halves of the triangle.
And if we fail, we must wait another 5,000 years.
I don't know about you, but that's more time than I am prepared to commit to this enterprise.
We shall be ready.
Trust me.
- We're not... We're not ready, are we?
- No.
Good morning, Lara.
And what a beautiful morning it is.
Back to work, I'm afraid.
It's adventure time.
Egypt again.
It's nothing but pyramids and sand.
I know. Gets everywhere. In the cracks.
Spanish galleon?
Do you know what day it is, Hillary?
Yes, of course.
The 15th.
And that is never a good day.
I miss you, Daddy.
I wish we could get back the time that was stolen from us.
My father would loved to have seen this.
Tonight Pluto and Neptune align with Uranus.
It's the first stage of the alignment of all nine planets culminating in a full solar eclipse.
It only happens once every 5,000 years.
When is the eclipse?
One week from today.
But there is plenty to look out for until then.
Incredible.
I wish you could remember her.
She loved you so much.
Mummy!
I wish I could remember her, too.
- I still have you, Daddy.
- Yes, you do.
The exact alignment of the planets necessary to activate the triangle only occurs once every 5,000 years.
But that will prove to be just long enough for little Lara Croft to grow up and to find it.
Bryce!
Hello, fellas.
- How's business?
- Bryce!
Okay, okay. I'm coming. I'm coming.
We have 83 rooms.
Why can't you live in the house?
Well, I'm a free spirit, me.
Right.
What's that smell?
5:00 a. M. Let's go.
This had better be good.
It's a clock.
I found it last night. It was ticking.
Must be one of them ticking clocks, eh?
It was hidden in a secret room.
Bryce.
Don't start.
Well, Lara, it's a clock. It ticks.
It tells the time. It's wrong.
It started ticking last night during the first stage of the alignment.
Well, gonna need some coffee.
Okay, in we go.
Looks pretty ordinary to me.
Well, keep looking.
Your coffee, sir.
Decaf latte with non-fat milk.
Oh, champion. Steaming sump oil.
Wait. What did you do?
- I don't know. What did I do?
- Where is that?
I don't know.
I just took my hand off the fibre optics.
What is that?
- Oh, bugger!
- Bugger.
Screw 13 to quadrant four.
- Screw 14 to quadrant three.
- Oh, please.
It's my map, so I know where they all came from.
It's camouflage.
Okay.
Hidden within.
What is that?
The All Seeing Eye.
Lot 121, a Louis XV Ormolu mounted bracket clock.
Showing on my left, #1,800,000.
#1,800,000. Thank you.
#2,000,000. #2,000,000, now.
#2,100,000. #2,100,000, now.
Any advance on #2,100,000?
Any more?
#2,100,000. #2,200,000. Thank you, sir.
#2,200,000 now.
At #2,200,000. #2,300,000.
Lady's bid, #2,400,000 now. #2,400,000.
Against you, sir. Two million five? No.
#2,400,000, then.
Lady's bid at #2,400,000.
In a new place at #2,500,000.
Any more at #2,500,000?
Sold.
Lara, my dear.
- Mr Wilson.
- Let's go into my study.
Let me take that for you.
Lara Croft. I don't believe it.
- I'll just be a minute.
- Hi.
You still pretending to be a photojournalist?
You know, I think it's really cool that you still have a day job, even though it's obviously just for show.
So, Alex, are you still pretending to be an archaeologist?
Lara, do we always have to fight like this?
I mean, maybe we don't.
- Maybe we do.
- Why?
- You stole my prayer wheels.
- Stole? Stole?
From you? You know, that's funny.
You know, it's...
It's not like you ever really owned them or anything.
Hey, you're the tomb raider.
Mr West, we are ready for you.
Oh, I think your clients need you.
Go ahead. You're wanted on the floor.
After all, as you once said so memorably, "It's all just a business."
Right? So go do business.
Go.
Lara, this is a unique object.
Only one of the dials is working.
It glows, like the eye, lesser.
But it seems to be getting brighter.
And it's also running backwards, like it's not so much keeping time, but counting down to something.
- Yes.
- And look at the back.
It's as though it fits into something, almost like a key.
Yes. Yes, fascinating.
Incredibly beautiful.
My father once told me of a magical triangle stamped with the All Seeing Eye.
He said it gave its possessor extraordinary power, the power to control time.
He called it the Triangle of Light.
Have you heard of it?
No. No, I haven't.
He always steered his own course, your father.
He was a great man.
Would you like some port?
- It's really very fine.
- No.
I can't help you, Lara.
This clock truly is mystery.
- Hello.
- Lara?
Hello, it's Mr Wilson.
Yes. Well, I...
You see, I had a second thought about that clock.
There is a man who may be able to help you.
I gave him your number.
His name is Manfred Powell.
You should see him.
Thank you. I will.
- Goodbye, Lara.
- You take care.
Thank you.
Bugger.
Forgive me.
Lady Croft.
- Ah, Mr Powell.
- Oh, no, no, no. Good heavens, no.
I'm actually his associate, Mr Pimms.
- Mr Pimms?
- Yeah, like the beverage.
Yeah, she's here.
What does Mr Powell do?
He's a lawyer. I'm his law clerk.
It's a fairly recent appointment, but enjoying it, all the varied work.
- A lawyer.
- Isn't it obvious?
Lady Croft, my pleasure.
- Manfred Powell, Q.C.
- Good morning.
I believe you are quite an authority on things ancient and mythological.
Well, I travel.
No, no, Mr Wilson said you were quite the archaeologist.
Please.
Oh, he's very sweet.
He knew your father, I believe.
Yes, they were great friends.
I had the honour of meeting him myself once, in Venice.
I was so sorry to hear about his death.
This is the clock I spoke of.
Very interesting.
It's a shame you only brought photographs.
Nevertheless, it is fascinating.
You said it started ticking the night of the alignment.
Yes.
- You said you were a lawyer?
- Yes.
And the study of clocks is a hobby?
This is an obsession.
Really my speciality.
My practise centres around antiquities.
But the origin of this clock completely eludes me.
I think I've never seen anything quite so beautiful that I know so little about.
This is a pleasurable torment.
My ignorance amuses me.
"My ignorance amuses me."
"My ignorance amuses me"?
Yes, well, I've always found your ignorance quite amusing.
- Powell, however, is not ignorant.
- No?
No.
He's a liar.
- Anything you need?
- No. Thank you, Hillary.
- Don't you stay up too late.
- I won't.
Forward team, wait for my command.
In position awaiting your order.
Bastards!
Bloody hell!
On the left. On the left.
Come on, Simon!
Bugger!
Lara, Lara, are you there? Pick up!
Lara, can you hear me? Are you okay?
I'm in the equipment room.
They're stealing my bloody clock.
I know. I saw them.
- You have to be my eyes.
- Are you armed?
After a fashion, yes.
All right. Three bad guys.
Number one standing by the Aston Martin.
Right.
Bingo!
- Next.
- Okay, number two, crouched by the McLaren.
Oh, bugger!
- Are you okay?
- I just found my car keys.
You're done, mate. Nice one.
I think they've all gone.
Well, they got what they came for.
Sorry about that.
That's fine.
Hello?
What the hell happened here?
- Morning.
- Lady Lara Croft?
Yes. You have something for me?
I woke up this morning, and I just hated everything.
Right. Thanks.
Who's Stribling,
Clive and Winterset then?
- Sounds like a bunch of lawyers.
- They are a bunch of lawyers.
- Well, I'll shut my face again.
- You are nosy.
I'm not nosy. I just saw the name.
It was a funny name.
I just asked her what the name was.
It's from my father.
It was written before he died and delivered today as per his instructions.
- Blimey!
- Holy...
"To see a world in a grain of sand
"and a heaven in a wild flower,
"hold infinity in the palm of your hand
"and eternity in an hour."
William Blake.
The All Seeing Eye.
"My darling daughter,
"I knew you'd figure this out.
"If you are reading this letter,
I am no longer with you" and I miss you, and love you always and forever.
It also means I have failed and must place an awful burden on your shoulders.
"Lara, by now I am sure you will have discovered the clock I concealed."
The clock is the key, Lara.
"It will unlock the hiding place of two pieces of a sacred icon."
This is the magical triangle I told you about when you were a little girl.
The Triangle of Light.
But it is no bedtime story.
"The triangle was forged from metal found in the crater of a meteor
"that had fallen to Earth at the exact moment
"of the previous alignment of the nine planets.
"The people of the light built a great city in this crater
"where they worshipped the triangle for its ability to control time.
"It gave its possessor a power that could be used for good or great evil.
"An abuse of this power led to the destruction of the city.
"To be sure no man would ever again wield this power,
"they split the triangle into two pieces
"and hid them at opposite ends of the Earth.
"Lara, do you remember the jasmine that only grows in one temple
"along the ancient Khmer trail in Cambodia?
"Find that, and you will have found the entrance
"to the Tomb of the Dancing Light
"where the first half of the triangle is hidden."
You must be there at the exact moment of the second phase of the planetary alignment.
"You must hurry.
You have very little time.
"And as the planets move into alignment,
"the world will be in great danger,
"for the secret society known as the Illuminati,
"devious, dangerous men
"who seek to fulfil an ancient prophecy by reuniting the two halves
"and attaining the triangle's awesome and terrible powers.
"This you must prevent at all costs.
"So, Lara,
I am asking you to complete my work,
"to find and destroy both halves of the triangle."
How are you going to get to Cambodia and get the clock back in 15 hours?
I'll be calling in a favour.
- What kind of favour?
- Well, that is a secret.
If I told you, I'd have to kill you.
Lady Croft, are you on target? Over.
Right on target. Thank you, boys.
Over and out.
How predictable.
Alex West.
What are you doing here?
We have 72 minutes to the next alignment.
We have to work faster.
Come on, guys!
Come on, guys! Come on. Pull!
Pull! It's coming!
Good.
So, any sign of Lady Croft?
Not yet.
Lara's overrated.
She's good, don't get me wrong, but she's in it for the glory, whereas I'm in it for the money.
Fortunately.
- Into the belly of the beast.
- And out of the demon's ass.
Jasmine.
Remember, what we are looking for is hidden not only in space, but also in time.
The clock is the key.
My God.
"Return the iron to the stone's embrace,
"the wheel of heaven will turn.
"Exhume the light from its watery grave
"to receive the gift of heaven
"as you are condemned to the depths of hell."
Right. Pretty much touch anything and you get your head chopped off.
We have two minutes, Mr West.
You're the tomb raider. Figure it out.
Mr West.
Tempus fugit.
Yes, "time flies."
It's the swords!
Come on, guys. Get up here.
Give me a hand here.
That's it. Come on. Coming down.
I want them all down.
Take them, carry them across the ladders.
Come on, guys. Let's hustle.
All right.
Now slide them into the slots over there.
We place the clock here at the exact moment of alignment.
Come on. Let's go! Move it!
Too slow, ladies, too slow. Come on.
- That's it.
- Count it down.
- The timing needs to be exact.
- No shit.
60 seconds to go.
50 seconds.
Cease fire! Hold your fire!
- Keep counting.
- You're making a big mistake!
- Alex West.
- Hey, Lara.
- Tourist visa?
- No, I'm working.
- Lady Croft, tell me, is there a good reason why I just kept you alive?
Yes. That is not the true eye.
- This is the true eye.
- It's not, actually.
- It's a mirror image.
- Miss Croft,
I think you're trying to cheat me out of my little ray of sunshine.
Why would I try and cheat you out of anything now?
I need you to get the piece so I can steal it from you later.
You're bluffing.
Julius, make a mental note.
Kill Miss Croft if she attempts any such thing.
Yes, sir, Mr Powell.
Well, we can do it my way or we can all come back in time for the next alignment and you are welcome to try and kill me, then.
In, oh, say another 5,000 years.
Twelve, eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Well, I guess she was right.
The log must pierce the urn.
Come on!
It's slowing down.
It's never gonna make it.
No.
Pure light, fire and water.
Croft!
Get the clock.
Got it.
Blast!
Hold it right there!
Lara, give it up.
Are you going to shoot me, Alex?
My phone is wet.
Yes?
Lady Croft, how are you?
Alive.
And kicking, I hope.
- And you?
- Superlative.
Of course, I digress.
You have my half of the triangle.
And you have my father's clock.
Listen, my dear. Without each other we are quite useless at this point.
We should reevaluate our positions.
Like it or not, you and I are in business together.
We should have a business meeting.
You mean you'd love to have another opportunity to try and kill me.
Oh, that's harsh.
But perhaps. Wait and see.
Come to Venice, Via Dolorosa.
Wonderful. Bye then.
Harder.
Here it comes. Hide, everybody.
Look out. It's some sort of machine.
Bryce, it's me.
- Hello?
- Bryce, it's Lara. I found the temple.
- Ran into Mr Powell.
- Did you get the clock?
No, but I got the first piece.
Oh, beautiful, smashing.
Seems I'm level pegging with Mr Powell.
Well, won't he just want to kill you now?
No, silly.
His problem is that he needs the piece that I have.
Until then, I'm his new best friend.
What about the other half?
The final alignment is in 66 hours and 53 minutes, and we've still got no idea where the second piece is hidden.
He's going to tell me where the second piece is.
- He will?
- Bryce, trust me. Pack for Venice.
Pack for where? Hello? Lara?
Bye then.
Drink.
Rest.
There's no rest for the wicked.
You got what you came for?
- I did, yes.
- Too bad.
Bad for the world.
The world is safe now.
Little bit safer, perhaps, because you will go on.
Your father said you will never give up.
My father? You knew my father?
Now, drink.
Finish your tea.
It tastes quite bad, but it is good for you.
See?
Good evening.
You're with the Illuminati.
Beg your pardon?
There's no such thing.
It's just a bedtime story.
Illuminati.
The people of the light.
Have you brought my triangle?
No, of course you haven't.
You've hidden it somewhere.
Well, you can keep the triangle you have and I will keep your father's clock, and we can be partners.
Who sits here?
We can be partners and go for the big prize, the Triangle of Light.
Yes, but who sits here?
It's an incredible dream, an awesome power.
It could set right so many wrongs.
I don't think you sit here, do you?
I sit here on God's right hand, as it were.
In fact,
I now sit exactly where your father sat.
You're lying.
No. No, he mentored me in the order.
It was truly an honour.
I don't believe you.
My father was not with the Illuminati.
- He would have told me.
- He had a great many secrets.
Not from me.
Especially from you.
I know what you want, Lara.
Oh, I doubt it.
Another life with your father, a second chance.
It'll be within my power to give.
The triangle gives its possessor the power of God, to move back and forth through time, undo the past.
Help me, and you will get what I know you want, to have your father returned to you.
And how do I know once I gave you that piece that you wouldn't then just try to kill me?
Would it make it easier for you on more familiar ground, if I killed you now?
Will you reconsider?
- Hello, Alex.
- I suppose you think
I'm a greedy, unscrupulous sellout
- and do about anything for money.
- Yes, that's right.
Well, the money bit's true, I guess.
Is it, Alex?
If you cross me, we may not be able to remain friends.
Always a pleasure.
Now for a cold shower.
I think we're in big trouble.
- Hold this, will you?
- Thank you.
They... They already think that we have
Lady Croft's piece of the triangle.
Yes. They think it's in that box you're carrying right now.
Is it?
Why don't you worry about something else?
Of course it's not.
I don't understand. What chance of success do we have without the piece?
Zero. Don't dwell on it.
But...
Lady Croft.
What a nice surprise.
Thank you.
Now, time to save the universe again then, is it?
Absolutely.
Are we sure she's really necessary?
Well, one tomb raider is good.
Two, better.
Me bum's gone to sleep again, all down the left cheek.
Really? That's fascinating.
- How much longer?
- A few hours.
We have to take the last hour over land.
Helicopters won't fly near the ruined city.
It's a dead zone.
We take all doggies.
Much-o U.S. Greenback.
All doggies.
Welcome to the dead zone.
It's not a country. It's an ice cube!
Come on!
All right. Let's go.
Go on, get it!
Holy shit.
It's a time storm. Time is broken here.
We must find the eye! All of you! Hurry!
We're running out of time! Hurry! Hurry!
It's begun.
$50 says the piece is inside the sun.
For God's sake, hurry! The eclipse will be over in a few minutes!
Alex, give me the clock.
I know what to do.
Has she got the piece?
We will now unite these two parts, the past and the present.
At last, we of the Illuminati will control time and fulfil the sacred promise to our ancestors.
- Soon, the entire world will bow...
- Enough of this twaddle.
Go on! Go on!
Not quite what you hoped for,
Mr Powell?
Lara,
I have a gut instinct about this.
After all, you are the daughter of a genius.
Let me test my theory.
You had to let him go.
No more bubbles.
You show me how to complete the triangle, we can change his fate.
If you deliver me the power of God,
I will spare him.
It's only a little trip back in time.
But I'm pretty sure you've figured out the answer to the problem.
And then, of course, there's the loss of your father.
I can change that.
You'd better be ready for this.
- Unhook your laser sight.
- Do it.
"To see a world in a grain of sand."
Daddy?
Lara.
Is this real?
It is a crossing of my past and your present.
Why did you not tell me about the Illuminati?
You were only a child.
You could have written in your journals.
- You never mentioned it, not once.
- Lara, I burst to tell you everything.
But in the fierceness of my own battles,
I strove to tell you only that which would inspire you and keep you safe.
I love you so much.
But I've missed you.
And I have missed you.
I know why you came here, why you took the power of the light, but this must not happen.
Why? Why can't we use the power just this once?
Why can't you stay?
We can't change time.
But time was stolen from us and it's not fair.
No, it's not fair.
But you have stolen time itself and you must give it back.
You must destroy the triangle.
Suddenly I feel so alone.
You're never alone. I am with you always, just as I've always been.
No.
Move out!
Lara.
Wait!
Your father begged for his life when we caught him betraying us.
He pleaded like a baby.
Surrender.
Never.
He seemed particularly concerned that I shouldn't take this.
Lara, no! The place is coming down!
- This is insane!
- Get them out of here.
You just hurry.
There you go, safe and sound.
No guns.
Oh, my God!
Quiet.
Wanta hotdog?
No,thanks.
Just ketchup, please.
Thanks.
Listen, I've got an errand to run.
[Chuckles]
Kind of skimpy on the ketchup.
Duncan, I've go tto do this alone.
What?
Wait,wait,wait.
You called me in Paris, and you said,
"We have to meet."
Now suddenly you've got an errand to run?
What's going on?
I don't know.
It's... nothing.
You okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Really.
I know you better than that, Connor.
Haven't seen you like this.
People change, Duncan.
You'll learn that.
Fine.
You can tell me all about it tonight.
8:00 at the bar.
And you're buying.
Right.
8:00, and I'm buying.
Mm-hmm.
You sure you gonna be all right, Connor? of course.
Duncan... watch your back.
[ Bell Ringing]
Connor?
Connor?
(Connor)Okay.
What is it. Connor?
Open it.
Oh. A ballerina.
Wow. She's beautiful.
Thank you.
Mmm, my angel.
[ Music Playing]
(Connor)Oh, my God.
I'm so proud of you.
I love you, Connor.
I love you, my Rachel.
(Connor)Oh, God.
I'm proud of you.
(Rachel)Thank you.

[ Beep Beep]
Hello?
[ Beep Beep]
Rachel!
Rachel.
My beloed Rachel.
How long has it been since she died?
A year?
A century? More?
My mind keeps slipping. but somethings I know.
I am Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod. and once, a very long time ago,
I was a Highlander.
Born of this land. and like this land, immortal.
[ Dogs Barking]
(Man)Witch.
You brought this plague on us.
You damned us all.
Connor MacLeod.
You sold your soul!
(Man)You're a witch.
You child of Satan.
They drove you from your home, cut you off from your own people.
What else do they want?
Someone to blame.
Your mother will burn!
Connor.
Your mother will burn!
Rot in hell!
Get in the house.
Get off my land.
Leave us in peace.
Get off my land.
Connor, please.
You're not going back to Glenfinnan.
I have no choice.
Connor, please.
They can't hurt me, and they know it, but they can still hurt the ones I love.
I'm afraid.
I love you, Heather.
More than anything in this world.
Do you belive me?
Yes.
Then don't be afraid.
Nothing can keep me from you.
[ Horse Whinnies]
Nothing.
[ Horse Neighs]
Connor.
I thought you might be the water horse... come to take me on his back and drown me in the loch.
No one comes to take care of you?
(Mother)Not in years.
They think I bed evil their children... because my own was banished.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Tiny mites... and soured dispositions.
I've no need of them, Connor, any of them.
Then it's settled.
You're coming with me.
[Wind Blows]
Aah!
Connor!
Connor,what is it?
I'm not sure.
It happened once before.
Aah!
Aah! Connor!
(Priest)In the name of the Holy See... and the rule of law. you are hereby charged.
Connor MacLeod, with heresy... and the practice of black magic.
We were friends, remember,Jacob?
I stood at your ordination.
I vouched for you.
You shouldn't have come back, Connor.
(Priest)Take him.
Aah!
(Priest Speaking,
Indistinctly)
(Priest)The ties of blood... cannot be seered by word or deed.
[Gasps]
(Connor)Mother.
(Jacob)Due to the infinite compassion... you are entitled to one final opportunity... to renounce all that is unholy, and declare Connor MacLeod not of your loins.
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?
If your God... should persecute me into the next world, then I shall simply have to find myself another.
[Gasps]
[Crowd Muttering]
(Woman)Burn her.
No! No! No!
(Jacob)He is your son.
I am silent for you.
(Man)Black powder.
It will ease your suffering.
(Connor)Mother.
No!
No!
[Grunting]
[Screaming]
[Grunts]
You're next,you demon.
Aah!
[Growling]
Aah!
My water horse.
Unh!
The Deil's come back to life.
Let her be, Connor.
Aah!
Father?
(Jacob)Father?
Please.
Do not leave me.
Father.
Aah!
[Jacob Grunts]
Connor--
(Connor)My endless days... are filled with memories of the past... and the death of my mother by Jacob Kell.
[ Engine Revs]
(Man)Boy,you people are extremely difficult to find.
We like it that way.
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.
Unh!
Uhh!
Aah!
[ Engine Revs]
[Gun Cocks]
[ Fires Gun ]
Aah.
Take their heads.
They might be Immortals.
Yes,they might be.
Aah!
Don't be long.
[Coughs]
The Sanctuary.
So it's true.
What sacrifices they have made of you, ware housed like rotting pieces of meat.
Tell me, is this...the better way?
(Kell)I'm sure you'e had time to reflect upon it.
What you need to understand... is that I don't care about the game.
I don't care about the rules.
I don't even care about these pathetic souls... you keep locked away as a barrier to the prize.
Which one is
Connor MacLeod?
[Whistling]
[Grunts]
[Strained Breathing]
Well,what do we do now?
What we always do.
We're Watchers, not cops.
We'll find another volunteer.

(Woman)What you fear about Connor MacLeod, fear the worst.
Who is this?
A friend.
Don't bother looking for me. Duncan.
[ Dial Tone]
He's on the move.
Duncan MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.
Hello, Methos.
What brings you to my humble abode?
Need your help.
Why me?
You're been around for 5.000 years.
I want the benefit of your experience.
And I thought it was a social call.
You ever had nightmares?
What kind of nightmares?
Bloody images... powerful enough to even break your meditation.
We live violent lives, MacLeod.
Some of that's bound to stay with us.
These ones came
10 years to the day... that Connor MacLeod disappeared.
Connor had good reason to go.
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.
There was more to it than that.
I was with him that day.
The day Rachel was killed?
Something wasn't right.
Connor,you okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
Really.
I know you better than that, Connor.
I've never seen you like this.
People change, Duncan.
You'll learn that.
I need to know if he's still alive, Methos.
You know a little about Buddhist monks.
Some of them come to cherish life so much... that to step on an insect or harm a blade of grass... becomes a violation of their creed, so they place themselves under an extreme form... of protective custody--
A Sanctuary of sorts.
Well, for an Immortal... who comes to abhor the bloodshed, there's a similar solution--
Away to be removed from the game forever.
(Methos)The price is unimaginably high. but you are, for all practical purposes, protected from the violence within you.
And it's called The Sanctuary.
Connor would never do that.
(Methos)Are you sure?
It's been around since before you were born.
At least until last night.
What happened last night?
It was annihilated.
Hey. Duncan, what's the matter?
(Duncan)The British... destroyed the clans, Connor.
Scotland's finished.
Scotland will always be Scotland. and someday you'll go back.
You can beton it.
How much?
Aw, come on.
Does everything have to be a wager with you?
Well,you're the one that keep stelling me... our lives are nothing but a boundless game.
[Chuckles]
[ Duncan ]
Good morning, gentlemen.
What seems to be the problem here?
[ Man ]
They refuses to pay her toll, sir.
Really? How dare they.
These men are rogues.
(Faith)The semenare liar sands coundrels, sir.
They've done nothing but prey upon us 3 years running, right at this very spot.
And by whose authority do you act?
By Deed of the King.
There is a little  X down here.
Does the King always sign his name with an X?
Excuse me. Sorry. Ha ha.
I think these gentlemen should be paid.
That deed is a fake.
That's a matter of opinion.
You, sir, are no better than they.
That is also a matter of opinion.
Here you go.
Ladies.
It's gold!
Why not--
It's gold.
Firstman.Ha ha.
Hey,wait a minute.
They took my money! oh, it's here.
They took my money!
Let's go get 'em.
Shall we?
[Yelling]
Aye.
(Man)Aah.
-ooh.
-ooh.
Heh heh.
Not bad.
Uh-oh.
Mmm.
All right boys,time to go.
Let's go!
Come on.
Ohh. Cuckoo.
Oh, looks heavy, huh?
(Duncan)Looks like you lost your edge, lad.
(Connor)Really heavy. or could he be lass?
Could be.
Could be.
[Groaning]
Hyah!
(Drier)Come on.
Hyah.Hyah.
Hyah!
Corporal Duncan MacLeod, sir.
I'e come to pick up the wounded.
[ Indistinct Chatter]
You've improved greatly.
Ah,you really think so?
No.
I'm Just being gracious.
Hmm.
Now, remember.
You are only immortal... as long as you can keep your head... on your shoulders.
[ Duncan ] Gahh.
Duncan,what you give up to your adversary... in defeat... is everything.
I know.
And at that point,
I'm very,very dead.
Come on!
Heh heh heh.
Not Just dead, Duncan--
Empty!
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening. our strength and knowledge, our life essence, flows into the victor,feeds him, and makes him stronger,yes?
It's what drives the other Immortals... to kill us, and what forces us... to be smarter, better than the rest.
[Groans]
I understand.
Ooh.
You do?
Ohh.
(Connor)Good.
[Groans]
I slipped.
Listen, soon you and I will have to part.
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.
[Grunts]
Va ia. Va ia.
Ho ho ho. oh, aye! oh, aye.This is much more to my liking.
Good.
Bah! Heh heh heh.
Heh heh heh.
Attack me.
But you've got your back to me.
It's not always about strength, Duncan.
Attack me!
Aah!
It's about manipulation of the mind... as well as the body.
Aye, but now I'm in control.
Heh heh heh,Are you?
[Grunts]
Remember well, my friend.
Properly executed, this move is unstoppable.
Properly executed, we'll have this talk again.
[Wind Blows]
Who are you?
A friend... or a lover. or a wife.
Kate?
Attaboy.
Except I'm Faith now.
Part of the make over.
Whatare you doing here?
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?
I do.
[Sighs]
The way we danced.
[Scottish Music Playing]
I felt like we were flying. of course, we did come down... didn't we?
Crashing.
(Motorcyle Engines
Rewing) oh, shit.
(Man)It's time to show our Immortal brother... a thing or two.
Somebody order a club sandwich?
He's funny.
Nice outfit,too.
Faith, I told you I look like a fuckin' orange!
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.
Who are they?
Friends.
What, it's a team sport now?
What,you didn't know?
It's a whole new ball game.
Aah!
Hey!
Nice bat.
Aargh!
Told you I was gonna cut you.
[Growls]
Aaah!
Let my man Jin Ke deal with him.
Jin Ke... who served with the Emperor Chin.
The same man.
Some people say you're a man of honor.
What do you know about honor? oh, great.
Yaah!
Honor's not in a weapon.
It's in the man.
(Kell)Enough.
Boys, boys.
(Kell)I do apologize.
When it comes to discipline. the first hundred years are the hardest.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Guess I'm not much of a swords guy.
I thought I told you to stop.
(Carlos)Yeah, well.
I stopped.
Tell me, Carlos.
How much is your life worth?
Don't start this bullshit, man.
(Kell)'Cause the only way to win your freedom... is to kill me.
You're crazy.
Am I?
Then go ahead.
Stop the madness.
[Tires Squealing]
Can you live with the fear?
Can you live with the weakness?
[Saw Buzzes]
Weakness, Carlos.
I call this... decap with a twist--
No sugar.
[Gasping]
Watchers?
Huh?
Watchers observe Immortals.
They're no tsupposed to interfere.
Unfortunately, our role has changed somewhat.
Why?
Because the rules has been broken. one of your kind has gone renegade.
In doing so, he's gained himself a sizable advantage.
One that'll be impossible to overcome.
Nobody's unbeatable.
Oh,yes, Duncan. He is.
Unbeatable.
No.
[Grunting]
Ahh.
[Grunts]
Sorry about that.
There must always be two of your kind.
As long as there are two, and you're kept from fighting, then the prize is safe.
The Sanctuary must not fail again.
You're insane.
Get yourself another volunteer.
We had a number of volunteers!
Sadly,that's no longer the case.
You'll beware housed, hidden away.
Go to hell.
Don't worry.
[ Distorted ]
The drugs'll kick in momentarily.
[Woman Screaming]
[Gasps]
[ Horse Neighing]
[Swords Clanging]
[Gasps]
(Connor)Get up.
Get up.
You have better things to do than lie there on your ass.
Who are you?
Someone who knows more about you... than you know about yourself.
Are you a demon?
Heh, hehheh.
I've been called that... and worse.
I'm Connor MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.
Connor MacLeod?
And like you, my friend,
I have a hard time dying.
Dawson?
Heh,you look like shit.
Thanks.
How long have I--
We'll talk about it later.
We gotta get outta here.
Come on, can you walk?
Yeah.
Uhh.
(Duncan)Go. Go.
What are you doing here?
Keeping tabs on you.
(Duncan)Yeah?
Well... someone should keep tabs... on that psychotic asshole back there.
Didn't you get it back in London?
These guys don't play by the rules.
You don't know what you're up against, Mac.
So people keep telling me.
Stop the car.
I managed to liberate that from their lost and found.
There's blood on it.
I didn't say it was easy.
Pull over.
(Methos)What?
Pull over.
MacLeod, tell me something.
Mac, hear him out!
Mac!Will you tell me something?
Now, how many Quickenings have you had?
How many heads have you taken?
I don't keep score.
Well,we do.
MacLeod, Connor.
What's that?
The Watchers' version of a resume.
(Dawson)It's a bit like handicap ping horses. I know. but it's part of the gig, all right?
174 confirmed Immortal kills.
Sound about right?
So,what's your point?
[Sighs] Here's the gentleman you met in Connor's loft.
661 confirmed Immortal kills.
Welcome to your worst nightmare.
Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.
This guy is way out of your league.
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.
Why?
[ Duncan ] Something doesn't make sense.
What are you saying?
I think he's saying he wants to see the body.
Well, it's gonna be a rough I.D.
They're all missing their heads!
 [ Harmonica ]
We gave 'em a Christian burial, MacLeod.
It was decent,you know.
Said all the right words.
Can't begin to tell you how reassuring that is.
(Dawson)With all these unexplained corpses.
Well, we had to take it off the beaten track.
End of the road,Joe.
Thanks.
You watch your ass, MacLeod.
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.
Did I happen to mention about all this... coming to a bad end?
No, Methos.
I don't believe you did.
You were gonna stay and dig.
Dig? Oh,yeah!
(Duncan)I need to know if he's still alive, Professor.
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.
(Methos)One of your kind has gone renegade.
People change, Duncan.
You'll learn that.
[Wind Blows]
[Connor Speaking
Native Language]
No.
What are you doing here?
You walked out on your life, Connor.
Why?
I had my reasons.
Reasons?
Every life I touch ends... brutally... and for no reason.
It's a curse... that's followed me for centuries.
[ Laughs]
I can't outrun it, and I can't outlive it.
Rachel's death made you the last soul on this planet... that means a damn to me.
I thought there was a way out.
The Sanctuary?
Yes.
The Sanctuary.
So, how did you escape?
I didn't escape.
I was let go.
I couldn't see the slaughter, only heard it... and felt it.
[Wind Blows]
[ People Yell ]
Jacob Kell.
So, here we are--
Both immortal.
Missed the signs, didn't we?
But we were both so new at the game.
[Thunder]
[ Duncan ]
Connor.
What a glorious sight.
Just look, Connor.
Look back at the endless travesties of your life, and you'll see me, always there waiting in the shadows.
When friends and loers... are wiped from your sight-
I'm there.
When those you cherish... die abruptly and for no reason-
I'm there for you.
And when your cellmates... in their so-called Sanctuary... are left twitching like headless chickens-
Guess who?
(Duncan)Connor.
Stay out of it, Duncan.
Would you kill an unarmed man... again, Connor?
(Kell)Oh.
You didn't know, Duncan?
Because you didn't tell him.
Would that finally put the agony... in your soul to rest?
Then go ahead.
Send me home.
What's stopping you?
Honor?
Guilt?
The nagging sense that maybe you, more than I, deserve to die?
Or somewhere along the way... did you Just lose your nerve?
It's holyground, Connor.
Ooh.
Yes.
Take your shot.
What better chance than now?
Do it.
Do it for your sweet mother.
Aah! or the sweet little war orphan...
Rachel Ellenstein... who, if I'm not mistaken, you raised as your own daughter.
Tell me, do they even begin... to equal for the murder of a man of God... who raised me as his own son?
Aah!
Slow... close--
Feels good, doesn't it?
But look at you.
Even now,you're afraid--
Afraid you'll lose.
That's your true fear, isn't it?
The thought of giving up your essence to me, making me even stronger by it.
What's wrong?
Don't you want to be inside me?
I want you to think back to this moment, Connor!
In the endless nights ahead!
(Connor)Aah.
And know...
Aah! every time you close your eyes... from now to eternity,
I'll bet here!
Ripping apart the ones you care about most!
Aah!
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.
Living is what matters.
And you will live with this.
Count on it. one far-off day, you and I will be the only two remaining.
You will look back on this... and know you had one chance to stop me.
You failed.
But until thatday,
I will take my vengeance... on those you love.
Your ling... has been my prize.
For old times' sake.
(Jacob)He is your son.
You, on the other hand... are on borrowed time.
Call you.
Is what he said true?
Is it?
Believe only what your heart... and conscience tell you.
Connor... with time, anything can be forgiven.
You taught me that.
Did I?
[Clapping, Laughing,
Music Playing]
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!
(Kate)Behave yourself, Duncan.
(Man)No more talking.
May all your hardships fade away.
Till night becomes morn. let loe remain to guide your way.
Till the day we are reborn.
Till the day we are reborn.
Kiss her,won't you?
[CheeringAnd Clapping]
(Duncan)Connor?
I thought you'd never get here.
Connor!
(Connor)You know
Kate is like us, immortal.
Aye, I sensed something the day we met. but I wasn't sure.
Well, now you know.
And you know as well as I do... that her Immortality can only be triggered... by the shock of a violent death.
Yes, I do.
And without such a death, she will simply grow old and die.
Yes, I know, Connor.
Is that what you came to tell me on my wedding day?
Come on.
Drink up, man.
[Sets Down Mug]
No.
I was wondering.
Does she know?
Why?
Many years after I was married, one night...
I found Heather in front of the house.
She had a knife in one hand... and her hair in the other.
When I asked her... why she had done such a thing to herself. she said it was the one part of her... that would never age.
It would forever remain the same... as when I first fell in love with her.
That's how she wanted me to remember her.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I once loved a woman... more than life itself-- and I watched her die.
Unlike me,you have a choice.
What would you have me tell her?
I'd tell her nothing.
She wouldn't believe you anyway.
Then I can do nothing.
She's in the flower of her youth.
Enjoy the moment, and let it pass.
And if it were you in my place?
I was in your place!
But I thank God
I never had the choice.
I love Kate, and I will hold on to her as long as I can.
And that is all I can do!
[ Duncan ]
Forever, my love.
Until the day we are reborn.
Until the day we are reborn.
[Wind Blows]
You haven't lost your touch.
What do you want?
To talk.
Oh,that's a first.
I've tried to talk to you a thousand times--
Get to the point.
I was wrong.
(Faith)Oh. no. no.
Stealing's wrong.
Lying's wrong.
Killing's wrong.
What you did goes well beyond wrong.
Fine.
I deserve that, but I want a chance to make it right.
You want to make it right?
Then give me back the ability... to have children, to grow old with the man I love.
How about anything that resembles a normal life?
And you took it all away from me.
Those things I can't give you.
Oh, something else you forgot to tell me.
Good-bye, Duncan.
Kell can't give you those things, either, so tell me, Kate,why him?
Because I've never known anybody... with such a capacity for hate--
Except me.
That's what's kept you going all these years?
Hmm?
Fine.
Go home, Faith.
Take care of what's important.
You were with him.
A woman is a temple... built on a sewer.
Remember what you were when I first found you.
A whore.
Now, look at you.
A liberated whore.
Fuck you.
Oh,we'll get to that, blossom.
But in the interim, be grateful...
I don't take your pretty little face off.
Hurts, doesn't it... that there is something you actually can't have?
Hmm. I can hae... anything I want.
Except me.
[Sighs]
I've already had you.
[Softly]
Not really.
Close enough.
Forever.
May love remain to guide our way... till the day we are reborn.
Forgive me.
- Uhh!
- [Screams]
I'm sorry.
You had no right.
-(Wind Blows)
- Uhh!
[Thunder]
(Duncan)Kate?
No. Don't be frightened.
You're immortal.
We both are.
Aah!
(Faith)Uhh.
I did it for you--
For us.
- Uhh!
-(Duncan)Kate.
Kate? oh, no!
(Duncan)Oh. no.
Oh. my God.
What have I done?
Kate!
You wanted this.
You forced it on me.
I never asked for eternity.
[Crying]
I never wanted us to be apart.
Would you have really understood?
Which part?
The endless, numbing sameness of it all?
Or never bothering to love someone... because whole lifetimes tick by so fast... they don't even count anymore?
Then why did you come?
To see if I could feel again--
Anything.
[ Elevator Bell Dings]
You're missing the point, Kate.
The difference between Connor and I... is that as long as you're still alive, there's a chance that one day...
I might be forgiven.
It may take years--
Centuries, even.
But at least I can carry that hope inside me.
That's one blessing of immortality--
There's always tomorrow.
Even for us.
What are you doing,Jin?
Just thinking.
Men, for the most part. can mend their ways... only after they have made a mistake.
(Jin)One day soon. we will all... serv every little purpose to Kell, except dead.
(Kell)A toast.
I see tonight... as a celebration of the spirit.
To all of you... who continue to stand by me-- even those who might waver... at times-
You are my flock.
You... nourish my soul.
You are all a part... of a great Journey-- a 400-year quest-- for Justice.
And here, my friends. is the instrument of that Justice--
The giver... and taker of creation... baptized in blood.
It is the living... that matters... after all.
It sings like an angel.
Just listen.
(Jin)Uhh.
(Man)Uhh.
(Carlos)Uhh.
[Gasps]
Till the day we are reborn.
Ohh!
Ohh!
Aah!
Uhh!
[Wind Blows]
[ Distant Siren ]
Kell.
Jacob Kell.
Connor?
[Sighs]
We've lived many lives, you and I.
We've seen things... that most people could never understand.
But now what do you see?
I see someone who would never kill an unarmed man.
I also see someone who has lost hope.
Life brings hope and pain... but revenge never brings redemption.
The path and choice are ours.
Connor,what the hell's going on?
I have chosen mine.
Aah!
What are you doing?
Kell's too strong, and he's getting stronger.
Neither one of us can beat him alone.
Are you out of your mind?
Aah! If we let him win, it could mean the end.
Connor, no!
Kell is going to kill you, Duncan, just to torment me, and there is nothing you can do about it--
Nothing.
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.
Alone, neither one of us can beat him.
Together,we can.
You know the rules. only one Immortal can challenge another.
And only one will.
This isn't the answer.
Listen to me.
In the end, there can be only one, and that hasto be you.
No.
We can beat him together.
Then we are in agreement.
Enough, Connor!
I won't fight you.
I will never fight you, Connor.
Then you die!
Uhh.
No!You're not doing this, Connor.
Oh,yes,we're doing this.
Every day, every breath we took was for this end.
Look inside and tell me I'm wrong.
Aah!
Aah!Aah!
Do it!
I can't.
Remember how you first found me?
Sitting in that bloody bog, scared out of my mind?
You taught me how to live, Connor.
You taught me why we live.
Have you forgotten all of that?
No. our bonds... are all that hold us in this world.
Don't break this one.
Please, Connor.
I'm begging you.
It's too late.
This has to be done.
Haah!
No, Connor!
Not like this!
Come on, stop!
Connor, stop!
Duncan! one of us has to die now, old friend.
No.
And you know it.
No.
Good-bye, Duncan, my true brother.
I love you, Connor.
Aah!
No!
(Connor)Aah.
[ No Audible Dialogue]
[Thunder]
[Screaming]
[Thunder]
Duncan.
Well done.
I ever thought you had him in you.
What does it feel like to kill a brother?
Feels good, doesn't it?
You'll never know,will you?
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.
Are you going to run?
Are you going to hide?
Run?
Uhh!
Aah!
Brother, come on.
Aah!
[Grunts]
Aah!
-Aah!
-Aah!
How bad do you want it, Duncan?
You'll pay!
Ahh! ohh!
Duncan!
[Grunts]
Okay, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.
[Camera Winding]
Just watch.
Merry Christmas.
A valiant effort, Duncan.
Too bad.
And this is just the beginning.
You see,when you absorbed Connor's spirit, you inherited his curse.
Revenge... is so sweet.
I wonder who we'll start with?
Oh, Kate.
[Thunder]
[Whispering]
Forever.
Oh, God.
Kell!
Jacob Kell!
Revenge... will never bring you redemption, so I'm going to do it for you.
Aah.
Is that all you've got?
(Kell)Dunc.
I'd thought
I'd be home for dinner... an hour ago, but this is very impressive.
Come on.
Come on.What are you waiting for?
I'd be delighted.
Yaah!
Impressive... isn't it?
Uhh!
Duncan!
[ Drops Sword ]
You see at last your fate!
Yes!
Because this game is done!
Uhh!
Well, look on the bright side.
At least you went down swinging.
[Connor's Voice]
Jacob Kell.
Time for redemption.
The game isn't over yet.
What's the matter?
Don't you want to be inside me?
In the end-
[ Duncan's Voice]
...there can be only one.
[Connor's Voice]
And you're not it.
Uhh!
Call ya.
No!
[Screaming]
Aah!
[Screaming]
[Wind Blows]
Hope you found peace, my friend.
Oh, Bonnie Portmore
I am sorry to see
Such a woeful destruction
Of your ornament tree
For it stood on your shore
For many's the long day
 Till the long boats from Antrim
Came to float it away
[Wind Blowing]
So,why are you here?
You hoping you'd find me?
For whatever reason,
Kell made his choice.
So, um, what now?
Trust.
You can always trust me, Faith.
Faith is dead.
I thought we'd give
Kate another chance.
Not yet.
Till the day we are reborn.
You hold onto it for me.
We've got plenty of time.
First time giving blood?
Yes.
They pay cash here.
And there's no limit to how many times you give.
They even buy it in the jar.
Jared Nomak, we're ready for you.
In the past 1 2 months, have you gotten a tattoo, or undergone any ear, skin, or body piercings?
No.
Where did you get that scar on your chin?
Childhood accident.
You say you don't have any immediate next of kin,
- is that right?
- Not that I'm in contact with.
Nobody to call in case of an emergency?
No one.
- No family?
- I told you, no.
Are you telling me
I can't be a donor?
It depends.
We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
What?
How unusual?
Let me explain.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one we haven't encountered before.
What? What are you talking about?
- Who are you? No.
- Sit down, please.
What is this?
This is a good news-bad news scenario, Jared.
Good news for us... bad news...
...for you.
Forget what you think you know-- vampires exist.
My name is Blade.
I was born half human, half vampire.
They call me
''The Daywalker.''
I have all their strengths, none of their weaknesses.
Except for the thirst.
20 years ago I met a man that changed that.
Whistler.
He taught me how to hold the thirst at bay.
Taught me the rules.
Gave me the weapons to hunt with.
Silver, garlic, sunlight.
Two years ago he was attacked.
They took him, and turned him into the thing I hate most.
I should have finished him off.
Now I'm hunting him.
I will find him.
And nothing will stand in my way.
Daywalker's here!
Stop him!
Where is he?
Hey!
No, no.
Take me to him, and I'll consider you a loose end.
Catch you later.
Old man... look at what they've done to you.
Let's go home.
Lock up your daughters, boys and girls, the dark knight returns.
- Need a toke of the smokage, B?
- Later.
Cut the lights.
You found him.
You didn't kill him.
Give me a hand.
I got a bad feeling about this, B.
Listen to his breathing.
He's already dying. He's in pain.
Why don't you just put him out of his misery right now?
They had him on stasis in a halfway house.
I' m giving hi m an accelerated retr-viral det x.
Like a heroin addict.
Make him go cold turkey in one night.
Shit ain't going to work, man.
I say y u kill the m therfucker right nw.
Get out.
If there's anything left of you in there, Whistler, listen up.
In the morning those blinds are going to open whether you're cured... or not.
Hey, man,
I didn't mean to call him--
Listen to me, Blade.
You're going to have to finish me off.
No.
Give me that damn gun.
Now walk away.
Stubborn son of a bitch.
How do you feel?
Like hammered shit.
How'd you find me?
I started out in Moscow.
Then Romania.
- They kept moving you around.
- How long was I gone?
- Months?
- Too long.
Years.
They tortured me almost to death.
And then let me heal in a vat of blood so they could go at it again.
Sorry sons of bitches could have at least fixed my goddamn leg while they were at it.
Where's my arc welder?
What's up? Nice to meet you.
I heard a lot about you.
I'm Josh. You can call me ''Scud.''
Everybody does.
Tell me something, Skid--
No, man, it's ''Scud,'' like ''Stud.''
Whatever.
- What are you doing here?
- The pimpmobile?
Just a little aftermarket modification.
- Nitrous oxide and shit like that.
- Oh, yeah.
You gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
The whole package will crank that Betty up, maybe 300 horsepower.
You'll burn the thing out before your next oil change.
Where did you dig up this shitbird, anyway?
What the fuck is your problem, Poppy?
My problem is I've been sucking blood clots for two years.
I get out to find some jerkoff fucking with my life's work.
We jeopardized our whole operation to save your ass!
- Our operation?
- Yeah.
Our operation? I built this operation, you ass-wipe!
Motion sensors!
It's on three, gentlemen.
Human?
Body temperature, 50.
I'd guess suckhead.
Fried. They're using magnesium flares.
They've got your security system scoped out.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't trust you--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Cool outfit.
Guard lights!
We represent the ruling body of the Vampire Nation.
They are offering you a truce.
They want to meet with you.
Scud.
Take off your mask.
My name is Asad.
This is Nyssa.
You have been our most feared enemy.
But now there's something else loose on the streets.
Something worse than you.
What's so funny?
They tell stories about Blade as the Bogeyman.
Frankly,
I'm disappointed.
You hear that, B?
She's disappointed.
He agreed to come along so easily.
Come on, B, show her.
Pretty please?
Semtex.
Enough explosives to level a city block.
You still disappointed?
The guards look human.
They're probably familiars.
You sure about this?
Well, if I'm not...
The true power of the Vampire Nation lies here.
Father?
Blade, this is
Overlord Eli Damaskinos.
It has been said,
''Be proud of your enemy and enjoy his success.''
In that regard,
I should thank you.
- For what?
- Eliminating Deacon Frost.
You did us a favor.
Karel Kounen.
- You're human.
- Barely. I'm a lawyer.
European Health Consortium.
As you may know,
Vampirism is... a horrible virus, carried in the saliva of predators.
In 7 2 hours, it spreads through the human bloodstream, creating new parasitic organs.
Like cancer.
Cancer with a purpose.
Unfortunately, viruses evolve, too.
We've encountered a new one.
We dubbed it the Reaper Strain.
And like any good pathogen, it appears to have found a carrier.
There...
Jared Nomak.
Born a vampire, but an anomaly like you.
Unlike the rest of us, however, he feeds on not just humans, but vampires as well.
- Looks like he was doing me a favor.
- You're missing the point.
Their vampire victims don't die... they turn.
They become carriers.
You've got to understand.
These things are like crack addicts.
They need to feed daily.
Nomak's been up for 7 2 hours.
By our estimates, there are already a dozen Reapers.
There'll be hundreds before the week is out.
Thousands within a matter of months.
Do the math.
Wait. Let me get this right.
You want me to hunt them... for you?
When they are finished with us, who do you think they'll turn on next?
Your precious humans.
Not one of them will be left.
We spent two years training a small tactical unit--
The Bloodpack.
We want you to lead them.
Two years?
We've been training to hunt you.
So, B-man, what do you think?
Sounds like a plan.
What do you really think?
They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
So, we ain't gonna do this, right?
We'll play along for now.
They'll take us in deeper than we've ever been.
Get a chance to see how their world really ticks.
I had enough of their world.
They're just shitting bricks because they're no longer top of the food chain.
Damn, man,
I'm really worried about him.
I know he's your friend and all, but I think you should watch him.
Nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in just one night.
Looking to get hooked up?
Maybe.
What do you have?
No problem.
Horse, Hawaiian Ice, whatever you need.
Whatever I need.
I like that.
What if I need you?
So, so sweet.
They are ready whenever you are, Daywalker.
Blade, meet The Bloodpack.
Lighthammer,
Verlaine,
Priest,
Snowman,
Chupa, and Reinhardt.
Hey, um... me and the gang were wondering...
What was that?
Can you blush?
Here we go.
Oh, I get it.
I see now.
You've been training for two years to take me out.
And now, here I am.
Ooh, so exciting, isn't it?
Okay, here's your chance.
Come on.
What are you waiting for?
Here I am.
Right here in front of you.
Adolf here gets the first shot.
Come on.
What are you looking at her for?
You need permission?
Maybe you need a little bit of incentive.
Okay, I can help with that.
What's the matter?
Missed that?
It's okay,
I can do it again.
Come on.
What, do you need a manual?
- Do it!
- Kill the bastard!
Now you've got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head.
Silver nitrate. Rigged to go off if anybody tampers with it.
I'll have the detonator with me.
And you-- if you so much as look at me wrong--
From now on we work as a unit.
You'll be taking orders from me.
Any questions?
Good.
You want to catch the hunter?
You start with the prey.
We'll target all the night places where vampires congregate.
Blood banks, safe houses.
The bigger the better.
So... what's first?
The House of Pain.
Where's the entrance?
I don't see any signs.
No vampire glyphs.
No, because of you, we've had to rethink our habits, tighten our security.
Have a closer look.
Nice. and 9mm caliber.
All with foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate, and garlic extract.
This hyper-velocity stake gun spits out a silver stake at 6,000 feet per second.
Since you suckers don't like sunlight, we've modified the gun's entry light with a UV filter.
Pop it open-- instant UV light.
Filter's on, no problem.
Yo, B, check this out.
It's got an pneumatic syringe delivery system.
The vials are filled with an anti-coagulant called EDTA.
One punch with this, you'll blow your target up like a balloon.
The cartridge ejects.
Automatic reload.
Nice.
- Let's go.
- You won't pass for one of us.
- Like I give a shit.
- No, he's right.
Why don't you post up on the roof over there?
Cover our backs.
So the Bloodpack's calling the shots now, huh?
Great.
Better curb that dog of yours or we'll do it for you.
Keep pushing, asshole.
? I ya, I against I ?
? Flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind ?
? Two of a kind, but one won't survive ?
? My images reflect in the enemy's eye ?
? And his images reflect in mine the same time ?
? I ya, I ya, I against I ?
? Flesh of my flesh and mind of my mind ?
? Two of a kind, but one won't survive ?
? Survive, survive, survive. ?
We're in.
You're about to enter our world.
You will see things-- feeding.
Just remember why you're here.
I haven't forgotten.
What exactly are we looking for in here?
Anything that looks suspicious.
You got to be kidding me.
Scud, do you read me?
- Scud, you reading me?
- Reading you loud and clear.
The whole place is a safe house.
The windows are painted black, one access door.
- 200, 300 suckheads in here.
- That sounds cool.
Hey, W, you got me?
W?
Tell me something, how's the weather up there?
Walkin' on sunshine, toad boy.
Look at them.
Half of these bastards, they're not even pure bloods.
I tell you what, why don't we just fucking kill everyone?
Just to make sure.
God, it would be so easy.
He's got you.
Daywalker.
Mother's milk.
I say we got about half an hour till sunrise, Cinderella.
Hurry up.
I spotted one, but lost it.
Be on the lookout.
Fuck.
Whistler, they're on the roof.
I got them on the roof of my bus.
Shhh.
Nomak.
Daywalker.
What am I to you?
Is the enemy of my enemy my friend... or my enemy?
We're under attack!
There's three of them.
Probably more.
Daylight.
Silver don't do jack shit.
Don't waste the bullets!
- Motherfucker.
- You hear me, Chupa?
Say, ''cheese.''
Come on.
How about some daylight, motherfucker?
Fuck!
Listen to me. If you're under attack, use your UV lights.
Use your UV lights.
They can't take the light.
Priest?
We're not dying here.
- Come on.
- Priest is down.
Daylight's coming.
You're on your own, Blade.
You want me so bad, Blade?
Here I am.
Why kill me?
You and I, we have the same enemy.
We want the same thing.
We need the same thing,
Blade.
What happened?
Why didn't you tell me these things
- were immune to silver and garlic?
- I didn't know.
If you did, would you have told me?
I think you know the truth when you hear it.
Mm-hmm.
Then why didn't he kill you?
How long since he's been bitten?
- About 20 minutes.
- His skin is fucking burning.
He's already starting to change.
Will someone just shut him the fuck up?
Hold on!
- Hold him, Chupa!
- Come on, man!
Put him out of his fucking misery!
Don't you get it?
You can't finish him that way!
Hold him down!
Hold him down, Chupa!
Move.
Back off!
If that was your Bloodpack Sunday punch,
- we're in trouble.
- This motherfucker left his post.
- He just disappeared.
- Where were you?
Ran into a little Reaper action myself.
Oh, yeah?
How little?
We lost a man.
Priest.
You want me to carve his name on your chest?
Let me show you.
Saw him moving in the alley and followed it down.
Found it just like this.
I think they came through here.
It was trying to crawl back in the culvert.
Caught his arm.
Been gnawing at it like a coyote.
Little Boy Blue.
It's already dying.
I need to examine it as quickly as possible.
Okay, look for a lever.
Let's open it.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
- Any casualties?
- One so far.
It was not...
Nyssa, I trust?
No.
This a dangerous game you're playing, Damaskinos.
Blade is too volatile.
You're not going to be able to keep manipulating him.
You worry too much.
I've been informed by our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
You've already lost one of your own.
How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Everyone.
Even your own daughter?
Yes. Even her.
Recognize this?
The blood bank.
He's one of the guards.
So why is he dying?
What's killing him?
Time.
His metabolism is burning too fast.
They need fresh blood every couple of hours, or they'll start feeding on themselves.
Nomak's different.
He's the carrier.
It all started with him.
It'll end with him.
Open the mouth, Scud.
Open the mouth.
B, come on.
Sissy.
Only the tongue carries the virus.
It is injected through these barbs.
It has bifurcated masseter muscles.
Overdeveloped, allowing for a much stronger bite.
The jaw structure remains the same.
But there's no mandible bone.
Squeeze that tooth.
Neurotoxin.
Probably paralyzes their victim while they feed.
Garlic don't work.
Silver, that don't work.
We got to go with the sunlight, right?
That's deadly to us, too.
So let's see what else we can find.
These things are as different from us as we are from you.
Look at that.
The heart is encased in bone.
Only the side is vulnerable.
Good luck getting a stake through that.
Pull a leg off a spider, it keeps moving on its own, essentially trying to walk without a body attached to it.
- What are you doing?
- Hard-wired, right?
What the fuck is that?
Brain's dead.
Body's still trying to feed.
We got six hours before sunrise.
Be ready by then.
Hey...
What happens at sunrise?
Blade,
I'm talking to you.
What happens at sunrise?
- We hunt.
- In broad daylight?
You got be joking.
You better get you some sunscreen, buttercup.
Listen, shitkicker.
You're about one cunt hair away from hillbilly heaven.
I love it when you talk dirty.
Sunlight's the only edge we've got.
- They'll be more vulnerable then.
- And so will we.
Let's be real about one thing--
I don't expect everybody to make it back tomorrow.
Remember to protect yourselves... at all times.
What are you looking for?
Phosphor rods.
If I can suss out the light source maybe I can make some sort of
UV flash-bang grenade or something.
It's been tried already.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it then.
- Blade.
- Hmm?
- The way you talk to them-- us.
- What is it?
We are together in this, remember?
Why do you hate us so much?
It's fate.
- It's in my blood.
- It's in mine, too.
I'm a pure blood.
I was born a vampire.
You know the thirst better than any of us, shooting that serum of yours.
The only difference between us, is that I made peace with what I am a long time ago.
How long have you known Blade, anyway?
Going on 20 years.
He doesn't talk about the old days that much.
Blade doesn't talk about anything much.
You want to hear something funny?
Blade kind of looks at you like a father figure.
Tell me something.
How'd you two hook up?
I was backpacking.
I met these two chicks, decided to take them back to my tent for a little
''Three's Company'' action.
- Pretty.
- Next thing I know, Janet and Chrissy start tearing chunks out of my stomach.
Blade shows up, saves my ass.
Everything else just sort of fell into place.
- Let's try it.
- All right.
Maybe I fucked up.
Maybe you were right.
All right.
Papa's got a brand new bag.
Let me ask one question.
How are we going to find these Reapers?
We won't have to.
They'll come to us.
- What is this shit?
- Pheromones.
Harvested from the Reapers' adrenal glands.
They're going to key to it.
They want us to spray on some suckpuppy's nut juice?
First use your firearms to drive them back.
- Then toss your UV grenades.
- Right on.
This is what we got for the grand finale.
I hot-wired a couple of these babies into a nitro-vacuum.
Just be real careful where you pop your load.
And you, you're not coming?
No. I'm a lover, not a fighter.
UV's have a 1 0-second delay.
Nyssa... just remember to take cover.
Hey, Blade, give me a hand.
You and Miss Muffet getting a little cozy?
I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
Looks to me like you're getting confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
Those are real hollow words coming from a man wh just spent tw years running with the ene my.
And what the hell is that supposed to mean?
You know, Whistler, there's an old saying--
''Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer.''
You might want to remember that.
Blade, we should split into three units.
We're trying to attract them, not scare them off.
Yeah, well, some of us can't see in the dark, you fucking nipplehead.
What am I supposed to do?
Bifocals, grandpa.
And try to keep up.
Let's do this.
- Hey, hillbilly.
- What the fuck you doing?
Ain't nobody here but you... and us, buttercup.
We lose a partner, and Blade loses one!
I'll leave you two lovebirds some time to yourselves.
Ah!
I spotted a group in the east tunnel.
I'm prepping the bomb pack.
Nyssa.
Get out!
Right now!
No!
No!
I'll attract them to me.
Do what I tell you.
Move! nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one.
Piece of junk.
What the hell is this?
You trying to stink me to death, old man?
Wait.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
We got to move.
We got a lot of company.
All units, regroup.
Regroup!
Eat shit, you ugly motherfuckers!
There's nobody left!
- Where's the bomb pack?
- Down that tunnel.
Give me the rest of the pheromones.
Go down that tunnel!
Go, go, go, go!
You obviously... do not know... whom you are fucking with!
By the way, Blade.
Did I happen to mention the bomb lever is stuck?
Suck this!
Let's go!
You want a bite of me?
Well, come on!
Come on, motherfucker!
Whistler.
Wait.
You will survive this only to tell Blade... about this ring.
About the truth.
The truth, old man.
Damaskinos...
Nyssa.
You've done a great job.
Not that great--
I'd say.
What is it, my daughter?
They took them.
All our weapons.
Even your sword.
Somebody's been keeping tabs on us from inside.
- Where are we?
- Some kind of chamber deep in their lair.
They smashed up everything-- the workshop, all of it.
They've been lying to us from day one.
The reaper strain didn't evolve... it was designed.
What?
Designed.
Nomak told me.
I saw him back in the sewer.
- He let me live.
- Did he?
How generous of him.
I brought you here to see the fruits of our labor.
For years I've struggled to rid our kind of any hereditary weaknesses.
And so, recombining DNA... was simply the next logical step.
Nomak was the first.
A failure.
But in time, there will be a new pure race, begotten from my own flesh, immune to silver, soon even sunlight.
I got a question for you, you lying son of a bitch.
You want to explain how Nomak got ahold of this ring?
I would have thought that was obvious at this point.
I gave it to him, of course.
A gift from father to son.
I thought he'd never leave.
The wolf has lain with the sheep long enough.
Reinhardt, you can kiss your ass goodbye.
I'm sorry, man.
B, you're wasting your time, man.
The bomb's a dud.
It was never supposed to explode.
It was just supposed to make you feel in control.
You thought you had me on a short leash, didn't you, jefe?
Much better.
See this?
I'm one of Damaskinos' familiars.
They needed my help to bring you here to control Nomak.
The old fuck, he was always just bait.
I mean, look at him.
He's y ur  nly real weakness, man.
You may be fast, you may be strong, and all that other bullshit, but in the end, B... you're just too human!
Well, you little shit.
You think they scoped out my security system?
I let them in, asshole!
I practically handed them the keys.
You heard cue ball, right?
Pretty soon they're all going to be daywalkers.
When that happens,
I'd rather be a pet than cattle.
You got me, B?
- What do you think about that?
- Two things-- one...
I've been onto you since they turned you.
And two... it's not a dud.
Ah, great.
I was just starting to like him.
Take him down!
We're going to harvest your blood, every drop of it.
Then bone marrow, organs, everything.
We'll find the missing key to creating daywalkers.
Now this might hurt a bit.
Nice.
I wonder... how many vampires he's killed with this thing.
Not nearly enough, Fritz.
Keep talking, honky-tonk.
Just makes my sending you to the next world
- all the sweeter.
- Been there, done that.
Do your worst, chickenshit.
We'll settle up after.
What else should I find out?
I trusted you-- with my men; with my will; with my life.
You sent us out there.
You sent me to die.
Our enemy saved my life twice, and you have used us-- your own children.
Make no mistake, Nyssa, those blood ties mean nothing to me when measured against the ascendancy of our race.
Who do you think
God really favors in the web?
The spider, or the fly?
Nomak.
What about him?
He wants revenge... on the people... who created him.
You may be right.
But fortunately for us, he doesn't know this location.
Now... he does.
What the fuck?
Come on, kid.
Don't you even think about dying on me.
You didn't give up on me,
I won't give up on you.
Come on-- Blade.
Blood...
Yeah.
Blood.
Father!
He'll never enter here.
Father!
Father!
Go on, kid.
Go!
Get him!
Get in there!
Hmm. Well... like my daddy said before he killed my mom,
''You want anything done right, you got to do it yourself.''
He also said--
Can you blush?
Hey, kid.
I reset the security code.
- We're locked in.
- Are you insane?
- He'll kill us both.
- Yes.
Isn't it sad that you die not by the hand of your enemy, but by that of your own children?
Father.
Nyssa.
Nomak!
Blade, it could end right here.
What do you think, huh?
After all, it looks like I've finished my father's job.
It's strange.
It hurts... it hurts no more.
It won't be long.
I can already feel it burning inside of me.
I want to die while I'm still a vampire.
I want to see the sun.
By booth number three.
Enjoy, man.
Are you sure that the girls are live?
Last time I checked.
Thank you.
A couple of razor blades, just in case...
You didn't think I forgot about you, did you?
{2639}{2737}You know, at first, I thought|you was old-ass Raisinet|riding on a skateboard.
{2738}{2843}I'd like to come over there|and choke the life out of you|right in front of Jesus.
{2845}{2951}Sweet Lord, give me strength.|Don't make me have to whup|nobody's head in church.
{2953}{2999}Ignore him, Lord.|Ignore all his prayers.
{3001}{3083}He ain't nothing,|never did nothing.|Give him a stroke or something.
{3085}{3190}Do you, Sherman Klump ?
{3191}{3245}Yes, I do.
{3247}{3299}Indeed, I do.
{3301}{3397}~ Oh, happy day, happy day|Oh, happy day, happy day ~|~ Oh, yeah, happy day ~~

{3596}{3667}Oh, he lookhandsome.|
{3669}{3755}Oh, my baby's finally getting|married. Never thought I'd live|to see the day. Finally.
{3873}{3921}Oh, here she comes,|here she comes.
{4322}{4403}I'm gonna cry. I promised|myself I'm wasn't gonna cry.|Now I'm gonna cry.
{4574}{4642}Yeah, all right.|Dynamite.
{4644}{4709}You may be seated.
{4710}{4805}Oh, thank God.|Oh, thank God.
{5022}{5076}l always knew he'd find|the right girl. Always knew.
{5078}{5163}You see the Indian|in her cheekbones ? Ooh !|Sherman, Sherman. Sherman.
{5165}{5223}Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.|Sherman ! Oh, Lord.
{5225}{5290}Shh, my baby's so stupid.
{5292}{5357}Dearly beloved,|we have gathered here today...
{5358}{5421}to join these two people|in holy matrimony.
{5423}{5518}- Praise the Lord.|- The eminent scientist,|Professor Sherman Klump...
{5520}{5567}- Mm-hmm.|- and his longtime sweetheart,
{5569}{5633}Denise Gaines.|[ Sighing ]|Oh, Sherman.
{5705}{5841}lf anyone has any reason|why these two shouldnot be wed,|let him speaknow...
{5888}{5934}or forever hold his penis.
{5935}{6009}- Oh, Sherman.
{6011}{6086}That's it, son.|Show 'em what the Klumps|are made of !
{6088}{6189}- Sherman, put that away.|- Sherman, calm down, baby.|Save it for the honeymoon.
{6255}{6342}- Surprise !|- [ All Screaming ]
{6388}{6469}- [ Cackling ]|- Hey, Sherman, calm down, boy.|What's wrong with you ?
{7026}{7098}- This is some scar shit.|- Yeah, like The Outer Limits.
{7100}{7207}No, don't hurt yourself, baby.|You are coming with Buddy.
{7209}{7326}- No ! No !|- See you later, chunky butt !|[ Cackling ]
{7328}{7370}No !
{7372}{7435}And then I wake up|in a cold sweat.
{7437}{7526}How often do you have|this dream ?|More and more lately.
{7528}{7622}You seem to be very fond|of this girl, Denise.
{7624}{7683}My God, she is so special to me.
{7685}{7791}But how's she gonna love me when|I got Buddy Love inside me ?|I wanna be perfect for her.
{7793}{7862}Perfect ?|No one is perfect, Sherman.
{7863}{7957}You need to understand|that Buddy Love|is a representation...
{7958}{8033}of the uninhibited,|hedonistic id.
{8035}{8102}- He is not a real person.|- Buddy Love is real !
{8104}{8174}Well, he was real,|and he does take control|of me sometimes.
{8176}{8232}You will never learn|to control him...|Sherman !
{8234}{8305}until you accept the fact|that he is apart of you.
{8306}{8381}Yeah, and the best part too !|And I'll tell you|something else, punk !
{8382}{8450}All these diplomas on this wall|don't make up for the fact...
{8452}{8519}that you got|a little Vienna sausage|in your drawers.
{8521}{8593}- Is that why|they call you a shrink ?|- Shut up, fat a--
{8595}{8669}- Sorry.
{8671}{8734}Yeah, yes.|Session got a little outta--|outta control.
{8736}{8842}You see, we all have|a little Buddy Love inside us.
{8843}{8905}Yeah.|But we can't let him|rule our lives.
{8907}{8969}You're in charge, Sherman.|Can you say that for me ?
{8970}{9018}I'm in charge.|Can't hear you.
{9019}{9065}- I'm in charge.|- Can't hear you !
{9066}{9133}I'm in charge !|Sorry about that.|[ Glass Shattering ]
{9135}{9262}Yeah.|Klump in charge !|I'm in charge !
{9310}{9374}He's right. I am in charge.
{9376}{9446}Klump in charge. Yes, indeed.
{9498}{9601}Good afternoon, ladies.|Yeah.
{9710}{9785}Hey, Professor Klump.|How's it going ?|Fantastic. How about yourself?
{9786}{9847}Yeah.|Klump in charge.
{9850}{9906}Afternoon.|Good day.|Hi.
{9908}{9954}How you doing ?
{10053}{10144}- Beautiful day,|isn't it, Professor ?|- Bite me, old hag. Oh !
{10145}{10267}- What ?|- Uh, uh, I said, he likes me.|Look at him wag.
{10269}{10352}Hey, little fella.|See that little tail wagging ?
{10353}{10452}Have a good day.|I'm in charge.|My goodness.
{10654}{10736}Kinda hot today,|huh, Professor ?|You have no idea how hot it is.
{10738}{10852}- Hot ! Nice and hot !|- Oh, Professor ! I loved your lecture the other day.
{10853}{10989}Oh, thankyou.|Thankyou so much.|
{10991}{11070}You're the man.|You're the man.|I'm in control.
{11104}{11150}Yeah, keep tellin'|yoursel fthat, bubble butt !
{11373}{11450}It is theoretically possible|to isolate the elements...
{11452}{11534}of an individual's|genetic makeup and separate them.
{11536}{11667}Now someday, we may be able to|locate an unhealthy risk factor|in our DNA and remove it.
{11669}{11752}Excuse me. Beg your pardon.
{11753}{11800}l'm sorry.|Excuse me.
{11872}{11959}Whether this is advisable|is another question entirely.
{11961}{12049}Oh, my eye !|Oh, Professor Klump.
{12051}{12123}Oh ! Professor Gaines,|how are you ?
{12125}{12180}I was hoping I might be able|to sit in on your lecture.
{12181}{12265}I'm sure we can accommodate you|since you were so quiet coming in.
{12267}{12342}Well, it's very hard|to be quiet...
{12344}{12390}when you're lecturing|on genomic extractions.
{12392}{12456}I think it's ver exciting.|Oh, lagree completely.
{12458}{12548}Something about the way|the nucleotides cohere|with the target sequence.
{12549}{12622}Yeah. I always say,|ifyou can't be with|the nucleotide that you love,
{12624}{12672}cohere with|the one you're with.
{12866}{12934}- Yeah.|- Uh, anyway as I was--
{12936}{13004}Uh, l want those|lab reports on my desk.
{13005}{13114}No excuses.|I'll see you next time.
{13168}{13222}Professor Gaines.
{13224}{13306}Oh, Professor Klump.|Yeah.
{13308}{13417}Um, yes, I was, um--|I was wondering if you had a--
{13419}{13498}- Dean Richmond, we were--|-Just having... a little chat.
{13500}{13546}Don't be bashful,|ProfessorGaines.
{13548}{13610}Pound-for-pound, this big lug's the greatest|scientist on the planet.
{13612}{13724}And let's be honest, pound-for-pound, he is aplanet.|That's said with love.
{13726}{13806}- Did you get those goo-goo clusters I sent you ?|- Yes, I did, thank you,
{13808}{13880}but I'm on a diet right now,|so I can't eat 'em.
{13882}{13934}And it's working beautifully.|No, l'm telling you.
{13936}{14040}When I came in, with this light and in that outfiit,|you could really think for a second that--
{14041}{14112}Anyway, you said you had|something to show me.
{14115}{14185}I am so excited about this, Dean.|You will be too.
{14187}{14257}You got that ?|Come on. Jason, where's our patient ?
{14259}{14331}Right here, Professor. Come on, boy.
{14332}{14422}Now this is Buster.|Buster suffers from acute|arthritis and diminished vision,
{14424}{14472}which are both signs of advanced aging.
{14474}{14556}We're gonna see if we can fix all of Buster's|problems right now, aren't we, Buster ?
{14557}{14608}Yes, we are.|This little experiment...
{14610}{14700}makes use of Professor Gaines's brilliant|research on gene targeting.
{14702}{14784}Now, if I've composed this formula properly,
{14785}{14858}this should be most impressive.
{14860}{14942}All right, Buster.
{15124}{15170}Jiminy freaking Cricket !
{15172}{15268}Sherman, this is amazing.
{15270}{15372}You've just discovered--|The fountain of youth. This is huge.
{15373}{15454}Do you have any idea|what you've done ? This is unbelievable. We're rich.
{15456}{15515}We're gonna have every |pharmaceutical-company in the world...
{15517}{15552}lining up|to throw money at us.
{15553}{15598}Of course, it all has to be|properly tested first.
{15600}{15690}Exactly, yes.|He makes an interesting point. |Here's another. Shut up !
{15692}{15769}Besides, look at the little fella.|He can lick his own winky again.
{15771}{15840}|There's not a guy in the world|who wouldn't wanna do that.
{15841}{15912}Klump !|Dean Richmond !
{15914}{15964}The effect is only temporary.|l'm sorry, sir. You're sorry ?
{15966}{16041}Oh, my goodness.|I'm just tring not to think|where that tongue has been !
{16043}{16089}You all right ?
{16329}{16409}Klump, party of six, please.|Yes, and we're hungry.
{16892}{16943}Mama, you know, you really look good.|Have you been losing weight ?
{16945}{17018}Oh, thankyou, baby, no, but I'm getting ready|to start a new diet.
{17020}{17112}Have some of this ambrosia.|I don't even like ambrosia.
{17113}{17175}Don't tell me you don't like|ambrosia. You had some before, and you liked it.
{17177}{17241}Have some adventure !|Oh, now I'm a child-- I don't know what I like.
{17243}{17291}...for the all-girls soccer team.
{17292}{17360}Let me get that for you.|Oh, my baby's so gallant.
{17362}{17468}Sherman, come here.|And it's called ''All the pork you can eat'' diet.
{17469}{17570}You can have all the pork you want. |You can have ham, bacon, sausage.
{17572}{17639}I got the wrong thing.|Take that. Thank you.
{17640}{17695}Now I got a full portion.|Whateveryou wanna eat,
{17696}{17743}just as long as you have|three glasses of grapefruit|juice afterwards...
{17744}{17811}because the grapefruitjuice|breaks down all the unwanted--
{17812}{17905}Get away from there !|Stop that ! Baby !
{17907}{17990}Honey, get the baby. He's a boy, and boys|don't be doing stuff like that.
{17992}{18068}- Hey ! Get your ass--|- What ?
{18070}{18134}Please teach that boy manners.|He ain't gonna be acting like no hooligan with me.
{18136}{18206}That was a spoon or fork ?|That was a spoon. All right.|Boys will be boys.
{18208}{18281}- Boys will be boys.
{18283}{18360}Oh, this looks fabulous.|Yeah, it looks really good.
{18362}{18419}How about getting another bottle|of red over here ?|Get some more wine.
{18420}{18490}Hey, Ernie, maybe|you wanna pace yourself|and take it easy, huh ?
{18492}{18581}Pace myself?|Hey, this is a celebration|for Daddy retiring.
{18583}{18690}We owe it to Daddy|togetshit-faced,|andl'm gonnagetshit-faced.
{18692}{18748}By the way, congratulations, Mr. Klump.
{18749}{18835}She's so polite.|Look here, Denise, you have to|stop that ''Mr. Klump'' stuff...
{18837}{18904}'cause I've been hearing that|for the last year or so, and I'm starting to feel old.
{18905}{18984}- l ain't an oldman.|- You are an old man.

{24051}{24123}- To Daddy.|- Hear! Hear!
{24125}{24217}After 35 years of hard work|in the construction business,|Thirty-five years !
{24219}{24272}Daddy's gonna fii nally get|a chance to relax.
{24273}{24348}- Finallygonnaget to relax.|- This is true.|- Damn right.
{24350}{24383}And I'd like to say|in front ofeverbody here tonight--

{25381}{25484}Now you see what you did,|Joe College ? You done|messed up the whole party.
{25917}{25997}Jason, I just know I'm not the one saying|all those awful things.
{25999}{26108}It was him. You may be right, Professor.|Take a look at this reading.
{26181}{26273}Right there. Recombining with the gene that governs|testosterone production.
{26325}{26381}Buddy Love.
{26443}{26496}I told you.|That's Buddy Love.
{26497}{26541}Don't panic. Allright.
{26543}{26617}We should be able to get rid of him.|According to Denise's theories,
{26619}{26679}we should be able to isolate that gene and extract it.|No, no way.
{26681}{26740}Professor, what you're talking about|is extremely dangerous.
{26742}{26801}Those traces of Buddy must've been |in your system this whole time.
{26803}{26876}You've been able to keep them under control.|Not anymore. He's back now.
{26877}{26976}He's coming back 'cause he knows |I'm happy and he wanna ruin everthing.
{26978}{27042}Yeah, but he is not a he.|He is a gene.
{27044}{27132}He's just part of you.|Oh, no, he's not.
{27134}{27185}Am I interrupting ?
{27187}{27325}Oh, uh, not at all.|We were just doing some|last-minute tests on Buster.
{27327}{27364}Yeah.
{27365}{27452}Uh, Sherman, can I talk to you|in private for just a second ?
{27549}{27629}Sherman, I got a call today,
{27631}{27714}and, well, I've been offered a full professorship|at the University of Maine.
{27716}{27847}University of Maine ?|But, Denise, that's in Maine. |Yeah.
{27873}{27935}Oh.
{27937}{28033}Well, uh, that's a fine department|over there in Maine.
{28035}{28112}It is gonna be a...

{73876}{73934}So, uh, genomic extractions.
{73935}{73986}Fascinating.
{73988}{74090}But the whole concept|ofremoving faultygenes must|haveyou in an ethicalquandary..

{74615}{74726}Sherman is known as the leading expert|in genomic extractions.
{74727}{74802}Give us a little preview of the speech you're going to make|at the press conference.
{74907}{75000}- Say what now ?|- l know we would never be able to keep up,
{75002}{75072}but is there some way that you could explain it|in layman terms ?

{75144}{75214}Yes.|Well, I would love to.|I would be honored.
{75216}{75285}It's really quite simple.|This corn, for instance--
{75287}{75370}This piece ofcorn here|can represent a strand of DNA.

{75421}{75495}the individual--|the bumpy things that go--
{75497}{75551}The Green Giant|calls them ''niblets.''|Uh, niblets.
{75553}{75626}These niblets represent each gene, |and they determine everything about you.
{75628}{75724}For instance, Mrs. Gaines,|let's say if a person was to have big titties, like you.
{75726}{75779}- [Denise]|Sherman !|- l'm sorry. Big titties.
{75781}{75843}No, breasts. Scratch it.|Get off you. On me.
{75845}{75909}- Now, I have a big ass. Never mind that.|- [ Fork Clatters ]
{76018}{76131}What we're attempting|to do here is to extract|the, uh, the bad, badgenes.
{76133}{76193}Extract that titty out.|Andass comes out.
{76195}{76241}And just leave|the good genes,
{76243}{76295}which is very simple|if you think about it.
{76343}{76385}Just ignore that.
{76387}{76451}Please ignore those.|Those are the badgenes.
{76453}{76547}What I'm really tring to do|is go deep, deep down|into the gene structure,
{76549}{76599}which oftentimes|is much more difficult.

{76742}{76788}Oh, goodness !

Yo, what's up with that?
Tommy quit.
Looks like he went out in style.
You know Tommy.
You better steer clear of Bostick today.
Come on, man. I invented the low profile.
I ain't goin' near that.
Hey! Bostick wants to see everybody. Now!
Check it out. Openin' up two miles from here.
Hello, Castle World.
I heard that.
We've survived a recession, two earthquakes and a health inspector...
Who, despite my many advances, turned out to be gay.
We're not goin' anywhere. We're gonna stay right here and compete with Castle World.
I've been providing quality jobs for this community for over 27 years.
I got an idea.
Why don't you cash out?
Yeah, yeah. Go to Miami,
Get you a Cadillac and one of them bald-Headed pool boys.
Everybody get to work.
Jamal, you can clean the moat.
Oh, come on...
But first I wanna talk to you.
Damn it, Jamal. Can't you look outside yourself for two seconds...
And just buckle down and help me?
Why can't you help yourself?
Forget about the community and
"providing' quality jobs" for people.
Take what money you got, and jet.
Book it. You feel me?
Get out. Bye-Bye.
You don't get it, do you?
I had high hopes for you.
Maybe you shouldn't have.
Jamal.
Clean up them battin' helmets while you're at it.
Urgh! Dang, man!
Man, this is like some
Three Mile lsland, Exxon Valdez shit.
What other choice do we have, man?
In two weeks Castle World's gonna blow this place out the water.
We apply now,
Avoid the rush.
Oh!
You feel me?
Yes!
Cos I can't keep doin' this, not here.
Oh. All right. OK.
To Castle World!
To Castle World!
And then I go in...
Aah!
You dead.
Hey!
That's gotta be worth a lot of money.
What?
Oh, hold on.
Let me get something to get that out.
Agh!
What the hell...? Hey, Steve!
Mrs. Bostick!
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
The water's cold!
You disturb my peace.
What is your business here?
What the hell?
Oh, all right. I get it.
You had too much to drink, huh?
Opening' party for Castle World?
Oh, you're upset.
I ain't got no beef with you, dog.
Kindly address me with the proper respect.
I am Knolte of Marlboro.
And I am not a dog.
You may not be a dog, but you may wanna roll over.
Got my suit all soaked up.
Wait a minute. You ain't breathin', man!
Ohh!
He ain't breathin'! Um... 911!
911! White man down!
White man down!
I'm gonna get a little close to your mouth...
So if you wake up and you see a brother on you, I ain't like that.
It's about gettin' you to breathe.
So bear with me. Ahh!
Here we go. Here.

Don't mention it.
I owe you... thanks.
Don't even worry about it.
Where do you live, man?
Come on. Here you go. Come on.
This is it?
It is.
What the...?
Whoa, whoa. You got a license to have animals, man?
This is a big-Ass donkey.
Do you have a license for this?
Homie, may I make a suggestion?
IKEA. Yeah, get you some end tables and some of them $5 lamps, man.
You know, and a futon. Then you'll be stylin'.
And try to wear somethin' on your feet that has a little give other than metal.
You know, get you the proper sneaker.
Are you hungry?
What is that, man?
'Tis food.
'Tis road kill, man!
Ugh. You know what?
Get you some food stamps.
Just tell them you doin' bad.
You know what I mean?
You know, if they don't believe you, ask a social worker to come through your spot,
Check out where are you livin', cos this is...
It's like that, seriously.
And you oughta get yourself into a shelter, you know?
Try that. So, um...
Thank you for inviting me to your place.
Thank you
For your... conversation.
You thankin' me for talkin' to you?
I am a man reviled for my failings,
For... for I have not served well my queen.
I must be crazy, man.
Here's two bucks. All right?
Get yourself some soap and, uh, some Tic Tacs.
I'm gonna get up outta here.
Freeway should be that way?
I'll find it.
Brother lost in the woods: not good.
Oh, hell, no! You know you did wrong!
Oh, shit! Castle World?
Mrs Bostick, you're in trouble.
You all seen that?
They tried to run me...
Hold up! Hold up!
Hold up!
Hey, let me see your manager, OK?
I damn near got trampled by some of them dumb-Ass actors
Takin' their job way too seriously!
Who be ye?
Who be l?
I be stompin' your ass, you put your hand on me one more again!
OK? I'm from South Central.
Florence and Normandie.
Normandy? A thousand pardons.
We've been awaiting word from Normandy.
Please, enter.
We'll inform the king of your arrival.
That's more like it. That's how brothers need to be treated, you know?
And talk to your boy, cos punks jump up to get beat down.
I'll holler!
Whoa. Castle World's got it goin' on:
Horses, costumes, smells...
Hello. Lose the hat, homie.
Thank you for saving our little village.
And such is the legend of the Black Knight.
The princess will look so beautiful!
It will be a wedding for the ages.
Don't you agree?
Yes, but she doesn't love him.
So? She's but a woman.
What if a woman were not considered just a man's property...
And were free to choose her own husband?
Are you feeling ill?
Let us pray it's not plague.
Should she be bled?
No.
No, I'm quite well. It was just foolish talk.
Oh, damn.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Uh...
Allow me to introduce myself.
Jamal.
Victoria.
Oh, wait! Uh, look, darlin'.
Don't cheat yourself, treat yourself.
Uh, look, uh...
I, uh, I don't... work here.
Yeah, I'm a talent agent.
I represent, uh, people like...
Mariah... Denzel...
You can call him Zel.
I'll let him know just you gonna call him Zel.
But I gotta tell you... I'm just gonna be upfront and say it. You are gorgeous.
You glow, girl.
You speak with an unusual tongue.
Oh, no, that's just how we talk in my neighborhood.
Now, look, first thing we gotta do is get some pictures taken.
You own a thong?
A what?
OK, never mind. Why don't you just bring an old pair of drawers and cut the ass out?
You know? So just give me your number.
Seven.
Excuse me?
You asked my number.
I am one of the king's chambermaids, number seven.
Oh. Well, that must be your employee number.
No, I was talkin' about your phone number.
Don't worry. I'll write my number down.
Anybody got a pen?
You can read and write?
Yeah.
Who you been datin'? You gotta raise the bar.
Good day, ladies. How are you feeling today? Wait. I shall tell thee.
Yes.
Very nice.
You especially, my Nubian queen.
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?
Don't you know that's sexual harassment?
Ah! You the idiot that damn near ran me over, aren't you?
Wait till I find your boss.
He's gonna fire your metallic ass.
You would do well to mind your tongue, Moor.
Or I will cut it out and feed it to the dogs.
Come here.
Nah, I'm just messin' with you, man.
I ain't no talent agent, so cut the act.
I'm just tryin' to get at her.
Ain't she fine? Watch me work.
Moor! Do you mock me?
The king awaits thee, messenger.
You might want to take a chill pill, all right?
"Do you mock me, Moor?"
Hey, look, your boss makes you call him "king"?
We gotta talk union.
Yeah, man, that's not right.
We gotta get you a dental plan.
We do apologize, sire. We did not expect your arrival for several weeks.
How shall I introduce thee?
What do you mean?
Your formal introduction for your audience with the king.
Formal introduction?
Your Majesty, if I may have your attention?
Starting at small forward,
From lnglewood High,
Two-Time All-County Conference Player of the Year, the messenger from Normandy,
Jamal "Sky" Walker!
That be l! What's up? What's happenin', y'all?
Thank you! Appreciate it, big homie! Thank you!
It's the...
Hey, what's up, now?
Oh, man! Now, that brings back memories.
You arrive early. My daughter and I welcome you. What news from Normandy?
Uh... what news?
Well, a couple of drive-Bys.
Other than that, same ol', same ol'.
When will the duke arrive to take my daughter's hand?
This is a hell of a setup you got here.
I mean, I'm not lyin'. I mean, whoo!
You got to have major coins behind this.
Who's backin' you - Puffy?
Silence, Moor! Tell me, when will the duke arrive?
Oh, I get it. You wanna see if I can improve.
OK, well, let's see...
The duke will arriveth...
In all his royal pomposity and splendor on Tuesday.
Tuesday! Ha. That is excellent news.
Ah. Phillip, have the servants ply this messenger with much food and drink.
And let him lay with any damsel he desires.
Except my daughter, of course.
Can I get a ride back to town?
Oh, an excellent idea.
Phillip, show our guest the grounds.
Allow him rest, and then we shall ride, and ride we shall.
Oh, ho, ho! This is funky!
Hey, oh!
Y'all got the little cutout thing like the castles for real.
Hey, how you doin', Miss Darlin'?
Hey, look here.
I'm in the presidential suite. Uh-Huh.
Yeah! Oh, so, I get it.
This is like a theme park and a hotel, right?
Sire?
Y'all got the real brick.
None of that fake stuff, huh?
Oh, man! Oh, man!
Hey, I need to use your bathroom.
Bathroom? What is that, I pray thee?
I gotta drain the... you know, drain the anaconda.
Ah, the privy.
Yeah. Appreciate it.
Oh, got to go! Got to... Whoo!
Oh!
Oh, damn!
Seriously, you think you're gonna charge people money to stay here
And wipe their ass with straw?
Ain't gonna happen.
There's doo-Doo on top of the...
Tell me you don't see that shit!
And I mean that literally!
Where's the Texaco?
Texaco?
What's happenin'? Where y'all goin'?
To the beheading.
They're executing the leader of the rebellion.
Y'all went all-Out. Y'all got the...
You said, say what?
They're executing the leader of the rebellion.
Oh, that should be live. Let's check it out.
Remember that little honey I was hollerin' at?
Out the window?
Yeah, yes, yeah!
Hey, that's tight!
Long live our deposed queen!
Power to the people!
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your rehearsal.
Please, proceed, proceed.
Y'all got a head that comes off?
A neck that spurts blood?
Look at the head.
How do they make it look so real?
Oh, because it is real.
You have to calm yourself.
Calm myself?
I was just holdin' a human head!
You'd think you've never seen an execution.
Not lately!
Wait, uh...
OK, all right. What day is it?
Is it Sunday the 5th?
Yes, messenger, I believe it is.
Two?
It is the Year of our Lord, 1328.
Argh!
The date frightens you?
You think it don't when it does! Oh!
I didn't mean...
OK, let me calm... Let me just relax.
That's what... a seat. It's a...
All right, is this how you use the chair?
OK, cos I don't really know if you should go...
I gotta go!
But leave you cannot!
There's work to be done.
You wear the medallion.
Well, lots of brothers wear medallions.
I got a cousin. He'll wear a manhole cover if you get a big enough chain.
You gotta put some bling-Bling on it, though.
You're nervous.
Yeah, a little.
Cos this is not...
I don't even know where I'm from.
When I walked in I saw, like, um...
Let me calm your spirits.
Oh, my damn. Y'all really know how to make a brother feel welcome.
Yeah. Let's make it happen! Huh?
Grab that leg for me right there.
Why do you disrobe?
Um... Well, uh....
I saw you were gettin' out your drawers.
I wanted to show you that l, too, wear the medallion.
Yeah. You know what? That was my thinkin'.
Cos it looks just like mine right here. See?
Of course.
I'm here to help you kill the king and return the kingdom to our deposed queen.
Say what?
That's why we wear the medallion.
I was wearing my medallion cos I thought it looked good with my gear. You know?
So, how will you do it?
Huh?
Poisonous snakes in his chamber, or drop him off the edge of the earth?
God knows he deserves it, after killing King
John and stealing the throne from our queen.
He left a warning to all those who might dare oppose him.
What kind of warning?
Oh!
I'll be goin' now. Yeah, I'm just gonna step...
We have a horse ready for you, sire.
The king awaits thee.
Horse?
You said you wanted to ride.
Yeah.
Oh, shit!
He's yours to ride.
Me?
I haven't been, uh... totally honest to you about who I am.
Oh?
Uh...
I'm not only the duke's official messenger,
But I'm also the court jester.
Messenger and jester.
An odd combination of talents.
Bring him on.
That is funny.
Damn!
King Leo. Bastard.
I've a mind to slice him open and feed him to the masses.
Soon, brother. Very soon.
Come on, man. Help a brother out.
I admire his commitment.
He's no longer funny, but he refuses to give up on the joke.
Messenger and jester.
I have great respect for this man.
Does that feel better?
Yeah.
Good. The bloodletting appears to be working.
What's that?
It's to burn off the leeches.
The what?
Oh! Ah! Agh!
Now I gotta get home. Where's the lake?
Which lake? Where?
The one with the... drunk-Ass homeless guy.
Uh... Knolte.
Knolte?
He's dead.
No, he just smells dead.
Am I interrupting?
Yes.
My apologies. There is a banquet tonight, and the king requests your presence.
Oh, I don't think I can make that.
My schedule just opened up.
Mmm. Hmm?
Let us celebrate the upcoming union between my daughter and the Norman duke.
He is coming, isn't he?
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, the duke?
Oh, no doubt. He'll be here.
Yeah, the duke, he just likes to stop off, you know, see the sights and, uh...
Stuckey's. He likes to stop at Stuckey's because they got a banana pie that he likes.
But he'll be here.
Allow me to carve.
Peas?
Uh, uh...
Uh, please.
I'd like to learn more about your culture.
It is my understanding that the Normans are excellent dancers.
If you wanna know more about my culture, remove the dog from the table.
No offense, King, but the thing about dancing was a very stereotypical thing you said.
So, you cannot dance?
Ahh!
Can I dance? Come on, man.
That's how I get down.
Please, pleasure us with your skills.
Now?
Mmm. Silence!
Servants, clear the floor, so Sky Walker may demonstrate some fine Norman dancing.
Um...
Time to get the boogie on. Oh, yeah.
Dance well, Moor.
I'm startin' to like this word "Moor" Iess and less.
Your Kingliness, special request?
OK.
Now, this is a pretty white crowd, OK?
So nothin' too crazy.
OK? My life's dependin' on it.
OK, guys, I'm gonna need a bass line.
So I'm gonna need y'all to help me out here, cos I got a lot ridin' on this, man.
Cos y'all got the trumpets, so I'm gonna need y'all...
Sky Walker.
Yeah?
I'm getting impatient.
I got it together.
I just want the music to be crisp.
Cos if it's crisp, you're gonna jam.
All right. Kick the beat, man. I need you to kick it like a white boy ain't never kicked it!
Kick it. Uh, follow me, OK?
Just, uh, one...
Two.
Three.
Excuse me. Um... y'all gonna get me killed!
Sky Walker!
Uh, yeah?
OK.
We're ready, King. One...
Two.
Three.
I think our jester-Messenger knows not his place in society. Perhaps he should learn it.
Your tongue was in my mouth, swimming around like an eel.
Yeah, it's called a French kiss.
From Normandy?
Florence and Normandie.
Show me more of this.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Excuse me. You have no business with this woman.
She was comin' on to me.
Are you accusing our fair princess of having an interest in thee?
No, I'm accusing her of having an interest in me.
Prepare to taste cold steel.
Behold!
Halt, coward!
Dance to the music
Dance to the music
Agh!
Assassins! Seize them!
This is an outrage!
Lord Percival, how could this happen?
I would be dead right now were it not for the heroics of Sky Walker.
That's very nice of you, King, but we do what we can do.
Hey, look. Please, allow me.
Lighten up on Percy, OK?
Let's show a little mercy for Percy.
Everyone is entitled to one enormous,
Near-Fatal, catastrophic disaster.
Ain't that right, Percy?
Sky Walker,
Allow me to honor you by appointing you a lord of my court, in charge of security.
What?! My Liege...
The king is talkin'.
Now, that's rude, Percy.
But I guess that's how you were brought up.
Now, you were saying, Your Magnitude?
Yes, as I was saying, is there some way I could prevail upon you
To stay awhile and become a lord of my court?
Lord of the court? What comes with that?
Well, I would give you 60 hectares of land...
With 20 men to till it.
Farming?
No, I gotta think about that awhile.
I would also give you women for your bed.
As many as you need.
I've reached my decision.
His Lordship, Sir Sky Walker!
What's up, homie? You straight? Cool.
Um... I decided to stay.
Now, I got an idea how to make some serious coin.
Have you ever had a Frappuccino?
No? Check this out.
What is it?
Jamal-In-The-Box, man.
Yeah, the first of many. And the good thing is, it's gonna have a ride-Through.
Yeah, you just gallop up, place your order,
And in seconds, you're outta there,
Killin' and plundering.
Excellent work.
Now, I had my royal tailor whip this up.
Yeah!
Hey, hey, pay attention. See this?
This is my official Sky Walker logo. Yeah.
Whoo! Yes!
Damn, y'all catch on quick.
What do we have here?
Look like you can use some help.
If you think I need help, you do not understand the game, Moor.
Moor? Well, I prefer "Lordship."
Do you mind?
All right. Excuse me.
All right.
Oh.
To win this game, you're gonna need your knights.
And you might wanna leave your rim pawns at home.
Yeah. That's your ass.
Sometimes the queen has to be sacrificed for the good of the kingdom.
Yeah, but every pawn is a potential queen.
You turn your back, she'll bite you in your ass.
I don't intend to let the game last that long.
Checkmate.
We should get together and play again sometime.
I'm sure we will.
Mind your back, Moor.
Lord Sky Walker, the king demands your presence!
Excuse me there, cuz.
Hey, Your Kingliness.
What's up, big homie? What's happenin'?
Were you not to consult on issues of security?
Uh... yeah.
Why, what happened?
I was out for a ride with my men.
One of my soldiers caught this peasant stealing a turnip from the castle garden.
Sire, I beg your forgiveness.
I only did it to feed my starvin' family, for we are...
Silence. Round up his starving family, take them all away for execution.
You...
Man just said...
How much did you take?
Only a turnip.
Come on!
And Sky Walker?
Yeah?
We are still waiting on your duke.
My patience is wearing thin.
Yes, Y-Your Fabulousness.
I'm gonna handle a little somethin'.
Get your ass up!
That's the king. Take a good look at him.
Say "King, I'm sorry"!
King, I'm sorry!
King, I apologize!
King, I apologize!
King, that's my ass!
King, that's my ass!
That's your ass. Watch out!
Dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin'!
Dead man walkin'! Dead man walkin'!
Why you bring the mean out in me?!
That's the king, and you're gonna be punished! Punished severely!
With these coins.
Huh?
OK, go. Get outta here. Go.
Here, take the bag too. Go!
You're free. Go!
Get out. Go.
With the compliments of the king, it is his pleasure to share with Lord Sky Walker
His booty.
Booty, as in "spoils of war"?
Oh, that booty.
Good night.
Whoo!
Let's get it over with.
You asked to have me delivered to you?
Yeah, so we can talk.
Mm-Hm!
No, seriously.
Um... if you're not naked, they may hear us.
Uh... Iet me break it down for you.
I asked him to bring you here for this so they wouldn't get suspicious.
Now, we gotta act like we're doin' the do, OK?
Cos the guard's right out front. Uh...
Oh! Oh, yeah!
Oh! Oh, girl! Yeah, there it is.
Oh! Ooh! Oh, remind me to thank the king! Whoo!
Uh...
Sire, you're hung like a horse!
Oh! Oh!
Oh!
Work with me. The king is crazy.
He's killing people over vegetables.
So you'll help with the rebellion?
Oh, no, I got to get outta here.
If the real messenger shows up they'll slice me up like Wonder Bread.
But you wear the medallion.
You're a man with honor.
And as lord, you now have even greater access to the king.
Ohh!
Good.
Ohh!
Whoo! Put that up right there.
Now hold that right there. Whoo!
Look, I'm not the guy you're lookin' for.
Then I have nothing more to say to you.
And that is how I break it down.
She's quite a spirited one, eh, sire?
Whoo! Where did y'all get her?
Oh! One in a million.
I was hopin' you'd come back to say good night.
Halt!
I am Jobert of Normandy, with a message from the Duke DuBois.
Sky Walker.
Hm?
Oh!
Regina?
Regina?!
What are you doin' here?
You dare to deflower the king's daughter?
Somebody got to that flower long before I did.
You need to know...
Your daughter's a freak.
Ohh!
The girl has been soiled.
The duke will no longer be interested in...
The duke will no longer be interested in your daughter's hand in marriage. Good day.
You have not only tarnished my daughter,
But any chance of an alliance with Normandy!
He'll pay for this.
Well, what if I was to say,
In all seriousness,
That I'm really, really sorry?
Oh, we misjudged you, Sky Walker.
When you foiled our assassination attempt and doomed us to execution...
We were a little peeved.
To say the least.
But now, seeing your plan unfold...
Genius.
My plan?
Oh. Well, yeah. Well...
Uh...
Well, I don't like to be obvious, you know?
My plan, it just creeps up on ya.
Yes. Had the king united with Normandy,
Our rebels could never have defeated them.
Because you deflowered the princess,
Leo cannot form his alliance.
Your action has given us hope.
With luck, we can restore our queen in hiding to the throne.
Sounds like that's a good plan.
It's a perfect plan.
Our deaths will not be in vain.
Well, good, good.
Death?! Ain't nobody dyin' here!
Ah, that white girl came on to me!
We're all going to be put to death tomorrow.
You can bloody well bet those bastards are sharpening the ax.
At least, I hope they're sharpening it.
I saw it done with a blunt ax once.
Took all day.
Just hacking... and hacking
And hacking... and hacking...
We get it, man!
If only the Black Knight were here.
Who?
You never heard of the Black Knight?
You ever heard of Shaq?
We're even.
The legend of the Black Knight...
Legend?
The Black Knight was a great warrior.
Kings tried to buy his might,
But he swore allegiance only to justice.
It is said he was once swallowed whole by a fierce dragon.
Swallowed whole.
But lo, with a sword of gold,
Did he cut his way from the belly of the beast.
And when he emerged, he himself could breathe the fire of the dragon.
See, this is why you shouldn't drink your own urine.
Shit!
Let the execution commence!
Maybe we need a-A...
Should wait for a bigger crowd, OK?
I'm only gonna do this once!
Go forth!
OK. Uh...
They want us to line up in order of color, light to dark!
You a priest! I pay my tithe. I go to church.
I give up the moola! Ohh!
Wait! Primitives! They're backwards! Um...
Your Kingliness, um, one last word?
Uh...
Well, uh...
Behold!
I am a great sorcerer!
Ooh!
Uh, uh...
Do not anger me!
For with these hands,
I make... fire!
Wait. Uh... fire!
We have fire.
Oh.
Execute him! Now!
No, no!
No!
The sorcerer has cast a spell of death upon him!
Who?
Yeah! That's right!
I cast a spell of death on him!
But I can bring him back cos I'm a great sorcerer.
Boogedy-Boogedy-Boogedy!
Agh! Not me!
Behold!
I have somethin' to tell you.
I can make the sun fall from the sky
And burn you medieval motherf...
Fire!
The sun is falling! He'll kill us all!
Fear him not! He is no sorcerer!
He is a charlatan and a jester! Seize him!
This way! Down!
Aagh!
Get in!
Get him!
Come on!
Go!
Yah!
Close the portcullis!
Open it! Open the portcullis!
It's stuck, sire! It won't open!
Sky Walker!
Knolte!
Up we go.
Fifth time's the charm.
You find them... you kill them.
You done this shit before, haven't you, Knolte?
You saved my life. I simply repaid the debt.
Payin' debt? You were kickin' ass back there, man.
How'd you get in on this?
Your fair Victoria told me of your plight.
Victoria did this for me?
Well, you and the rebellion.
But, uh... a lot of it was for you.
Yeah, that's all right.
Agh!
I wish you well.
Look, I owe you one.
I got your back, all right?
But if you fall into trouble again, he will not be there. Will you, Sir Knolte?
Sir Knolte?
I paid my debt and now I must leave.
Knolte was once one of the greatest knights in England,
Until he fell for Percival's trick and the queen lost her throne.
That was a long time ago.
I've laid down my sword and I will not fight again.
Wait. Knolte!
Uh, uh...
But... check this out. Knolte!
Sir Knolte!
I still say we should move camp. It's just luck
Percival's patrols have yet to discover us.
An interesting suggestion. Now here's another suggestion: serve more gruel.
You know, y'all dead wrong.
You dead wrong. This is a lady here.
Uh, Vicky? I wanna thank you
For helping Sir Knolte save my life.
Actually, the plan was mine.
No shit?
I shit you not.
I had to tell everyone
I'd heard it from a great warrior,
Otherwise no one would have listened to me, a woman.
So you like me a little more than you...
Did you have a nice time with the princess?
Wait! Look, the only reason
I slept with the princess,
Cos I thought she was you. That's true.
That's the real true bill. True bill. OK?
It was dark, and I had no night-Light.
I'm tellin' you...
Whatever you think I want to hear.
I think all our words have been said.
Hey, Vicky...
I can help you get outta here, way outta here.
Take you to a place where a smart woman like you can do more than just ladle gruel.
Look, if you show me how to get to the lake, tomorrow you'll be at Fox Hills Mall
Gettin' your legs waxed.
Huh? Drinkin' mai tais, chillin'.
So what's it gonna be?
Gruel, leprosy, mean-Ass king?
Mai tais, chillin', bikini, thong?
I realize that our backward rebel society is far from perfect,
But it's a step in the right direction.
Now is the eve of our great offensive.
I can live with losing the good fight, but I cannot live with not fighting it.
The lake you seek is that way.
Safe journey.
Hey, old sot!
I have no quarrel with you, sir.
Finally, the lake.
Better not come out on the other end fightin' dinosaurs.
All right, think, think, think.
It's not my fight.
Yeah, that's it. It's not my battle.
That's right, it's... it is not my battle at all. Yeah.
So, uh... Iet's do this.
Home sweet home.
Perhaps I'll stand you to a drink.
Oh!
Thank you.
Bless you.
Man, I think it's time to admit you have a drinking problem.
I want my grog back. Pick it up.
You don't wanna be messin' with me cos I'm liable to stuff a mud hole in your ass.
You know?
It's an insult, dumb-Ass.
I have killed six men with these.
What do you move for?
It's called boxing.
That's called a Rope-A-Dope.
Look at the footwork! Look at the footwork!
You know it
Now let me introduce you to my little friend.
Knolte! Come on, man.
I know you got my back.
Knolte is not a fighter.
He is not even a man!
All right, wait.
Aaagh!
Get your ass outta here. That's right.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Perhaps there's life in the old dog yet.
Oh, man! High five.
This is a high five moment.
Yeah, put your arm up. Right here, like that.
Well, we'll work on that.
Hey, you bad man.
You put his face in the shit!
Yes, I did.
Oh, man.
Hey, Knolte, we was a great team back there, right? Like Shaq and Kobe.
Shaq and Kobe?
Well, I'll explain it to you when we get back to the camp. I loved it, man.
This... "Rope-A-Dope."
Could you teach me its mysterious ways?
You just let your man tire himself out, right?
He just get the punchin' on you.
Then you like that, while he like this...
Then he tired, and you ready to really...
What happened?
Percival's patrols. They found us.
The only men standing are those of us who were away from camp.
Damn! Victoria told us this would happen.
Victoria!
They took her.
Now she's lost, like our cause.
Just another bauble in the king's crown.
Look here, we just gotta rescue her. You know what I'm saying? Take out the king.
Uh, uh...
Who here will fight?
Who's ready to rumble?
Nobody?!
I will.
That's what I'm talkin' about, Knolte.
But we are greatly depleted, both in number and in spirit.
Nothing could inspire them to ever fight again.
These men might fight for their queen.
The queen.
What's happenin' now? How you doin'?
He's French.
Sir Knolte.
I am pleased to see you.
For all this time, I thought you were dead.
Well, l... was.
Your Majesty, I was.
I beg your forgiveness.
I should not have left you alone.
If you had not, you surely would have been killed with the others.
I'm therefore grateful that you did.
But now that you've returned from the dead, it is time to return me to my throne.
Will the men fight again on my behalf?
Oh! I can answer that. Ain't nothin' happenin'.
You know? They draggin' ass.
I asked them that same thing.
They go and act like they ain't hear me, didn't they, Knolte?
This is my friend Sky Walker, a man of unconventional wisdom and courage.
What do you think, Sky Walker?
I think they're gonna need a pep talk. You know what I'm sayin', Your Highnessness?
They gonna be needin' a major pep talk.
Gotta get up in here.
My queen could inspire the stars to fall from the heavens.
Gather the men, that I might give some words to stir the soul and burn the blood.
England!
Sceptered isle of lute and chattel,
Void your rheum upon my bosom!
Oh, England!
I've heard enough.
Oh, England!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Why don't you let me give it a try?
See if I can give 'em the ol' Al Sharpton.
Well, uh...
There once was a great king!
Rodney King,
Who said "Ow, ow, ow!"
"Officer Allen, ow!"
"Get 'em off... Ow! Bzz! Agh!"
And who also said
"Can't we all just get along?"
We need a knight, not a jester.
I'm gonna go and start diggin' our graves.
Well, I say sometimes we can't just get along!
Sometimes we gotta take up arms!
Look.
Hear what I'm sayin'.
Your lives are shitty.
I know because I've been there.
I know the feeling of waitin' for your ship to come in
And you're standing in the middle of the desert.
Oh, England, you lost your kingdom.
You live in huts. You look like hell.
Well, you do! Check your feet out.
Look at your feet. Mm-Hm, see?
Restore this lovely queen to her throne.
Cos when you can do that, she promises that there will be a horse in every stable,
A chicken in every pot.
That's right. Mm!
Can I get an "amen"?
I said, can I get an "amen"?!
Amen.
Can I get an "amen"?!
Amen! Amen!
King Leo.
He thinks he's King Arthur.
Well, I know King Arthur.
And you, King Leo, are no King Arthur!
No King Arthur, indeed!
No King Arthur! No King Arthur!
Ask not what your fiefdom could do for you,
But what you could do for your fiefdom!
Now, Sir Knolte, bring me back my crown.
Your Majesty, it will be an honor.
King Leo got a great big castle..
King Leo got a great big castle...
And we're gonna shove it right up his asshole...
We're gonna shove it right up his asshole...
Sound off
One, two...
Bring it on down.
Huh, huh, huh-Huh
Yeah, that's tight! Right to the chest.
I'm lovin' it!
Tight.
That's tight.
Yeah, yeah! Get it! Get it!
Try not to mount his ass next time.
Ooh! Oh!
One, two, three. Yes!
Set!
Eight! Shift! 27 blue!
Oh! Lovin' it, yeah! See what I'm sayin'?
Splendid.
Yeah, that's tight.
Here you go, man.
What are these?
Some new jumps, for when you lead your troops tomorrow.
Thought it might be easier for you to get around if your feet didn't weigh 500 pounds.
I thank you.
It's all good.
I, too, have something for you. John!
What's this?
A knight must be properly attired.
You and I both know I'm no knight.
You're as much a knight as any man I know, should you so choose.
Sleep well.
The portcullis is open, unguarded!
Where is Percival?
Where are the guards?
Knolte!
Be brave, lads!
Hold the line!
Slaughter them!
It's the Black Knight! The Black Knight!
He lives!
It's the Black Knight!
The Black Knight!
I can't believe it!
It's him! He lives!
It's the Moor!
Yah!
Blue 27!
Set! Hut, hut, hut!
Yeah, yeah!
Whoo!
Aagh!
I'll take him.
Good idea.
Is that all you got?
I pray you, is that all you possess?
Huh?
Phillip!
The kingdom is falling!
Be not afeard. I have everything in hand.
Are you mad? You must help me flee.
You must get me to safety.
Shut up!
Aaah!
Ha-Ha-Ha! Boo-Yeah!
Watch your step!
Ha-Ha-Ha! Good, eh?
And that, my friend, is the Rope-A-Dope.
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!
Hey, Knolte, you the man! Yeah!
Knolte!
Knolte!
You're a brave knight.
It's been an honor fighting beside you.
Take this.
You know what to do.
The Black Knight.
Drop the sword, or I kill the girl.
Let her go.
Do it!
Don't do it, Jamal!
So...
Now the Moor's a swordsman.
Now you shall die at my hands, as Knolte did.
Ohh!
Let me ask you somethin'.
You like baseball?
Or maybe you like basketball?
Maybe golf?
You can thank Tiger for that.
You OK?
I'm sure I'll be fine.
How's your neck?
You were very brave.
Let me help you up.
Jamal!
Knolte!
Long live the queen!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Knolte!
We'll have an amazing life together. You'll love LA.
But I was thinking...
I'm not goin' back without you.
You know, I'd go to the end of the earth for you.
That's only six miles from here.
You've got a lot to learn.
Teach me.
You want me to teach you?
'Tis a strange way to...
It's French.
Oh!
Sky Walker, are you both still determined to leave us?
We hate to lose such a brave warrior.
Nothin' personal, uh, Miss Queen.
But, uh, Knolte's right.
I got my own battles to fight, you know?
That's my bun. You hooked me up with her.
She knew I was down with somebody cool, so she started likin' me.
In acknowledgment for your service to the Crown,
I dub thee Sir Sky Walker, the Black Knight.
Clear.
Clear!
What...?
His vital signs appear normal.
Jamal! Jamal!
Yo, you OK, man?
You scared the hell outta me! You was under that water for, like, ten minutes!
Hey. Yo, where's Victoria? Vicky?
Who?
Stop playin', man!
Vicky. Victoria, my bun!
Jamal, what you talkin' about, man?
What...? Vicky?
Dude, you know, a workplace accident like this, we can sue.
There ain't no honor in that, man.
Don't think I don't know what you doin'.
You fake you some accident, get you a lawyer and walk away with my money.
Well, it won't work! And I already went ahead and took your advice.
What advice?
I quit.
Oh, Mrs Bostick, you can't quit.
OK? We can work it out.
We just gotta fight, that's all.
You on the pipe?
Mrs Bostick, look, um...
I know things can get a little scary, but courage isn't the absence of fear.
It is the presence of fear, yet the will to go on.
Good, good! I'm lovin' it!
How's the babies? Everybody's good? Good.
Oh, this is lovely.
How you doin', my queen?
I always knew you had it in you, Jamal.
Well, I'm just glad you like it.
I love it.
Good, good.
No, no, you can't be scared of it. Try it again.
Oh, lovin' it!
Way to go, Bobby!
Thanks. I think that's the first time he actually hit the ball.
You look familiar.
So do you. Uh...
Name's Jamal.
Nicole. My friends call me Nicky.
I work in admissions up at the college.
Is that where we met?
Maybe. I registered for some night classes.
Can I ask you where you got that scar?
This? Oh, it's from a long, long time ago.
Well, maybe I could take you out to lunch.
You could tell me all about it.
I'd like that... very much.
All right. Good.
Hey, Aunt Nicky?
I gotta go.
Yeah, well, uh, it's nice meetin' you.
I... I didn't get your number!
Excuse me. Yeah.
Release the lions!
LEFT BEHIND II
TRIBULATION FORCE
It's been a week since the greatest disaster the world has ever seen.
A week since people all around the world simply vanished off the face of the Earth.
People everywhere are still struggling to come to terms to the reality of what is happening.
Actual numbers may not be known for years, but initial estimates are in the number of hundreds of millions.
Even more unbelievable and terrifying is the fact that every child from every country.. is among the missing.
For those of us who have been left behind, we are living in a world of chaos and confusion.
Physical devastation is catastrophic and the clean-up process has only just begun.
With everything from driveless cars to crashing planes inflicting their destruction across the planet, the death toll is sure to be astronomical.
But the post-disaster clean-up is not the only issue facing overstrained governments around the..
- Look at this!
Young, energetic, honest.
With shock, grief and fear being the dominant emotions, countless numbers are choosing suicide.
People trust him.
You're right, Mr. Secretary General, they do.
Now many times must I tell you Nikolai is right?
After all, we are on the same team here.
And I want him to join us. 
The situation is even more serious.
My friends, I can only sit here  before you now,  and tell you, that for the first time in my carrier, I honestly don't know what to say.
Or even where to begin.
I can only ask each and every one of you to be strong.
This is Buck Williams reporting live from Chicago.
Good night and God bless.
Well, he sure manages to hold it together.
I don't know how he does it.
Told me the secret is not being calm, it's looking calm.
At least he's not afraid to say how he feels.
Hold your fire!
Man, you didn't have to kill them!
Back off!
Don't you know who this is?
Oh, yeah.
They were just kids. - Breaking into a van.
Give me a break. Hey, what difference does it make?
Look around. Let's get out of here.
Oh, come on, there is a huge spiritual void out there.
It's only natural that all the people are gonna try to return to all the ancient symbols of their religion to find answers.
You can't just shut down the Wailing Wall.
Well, it's being described as a safety precaution.
Yes, yes, the UN did shut down one of the world's holiest sites, but look what happened.
3 men were burned to death. Did they have any other choice?
But what really happened.
How did they die?
People don't just burn to death in the middle of the day.
And why weren't there any arrests?
And now the UN has said that it was under misterious circumstances.
Now, don't we have the right to know more?
I'm sure that we will know more, but we have to give them time. It just happens.
If it was anyone else running this show than 
Nikolai Carpathia..
- Mr. Williams, are you alright?
-I'm doing good. How about you, Joe?
Oh, yeah, someone's waiting for you.
A Mr. Steve Plank.
Buck Williams.
Hey, Steve.
You know, for a reporter, you're a pretty tough guy to track down.
What are you doing here?
Listen, Buck. Nikolai Carpathia wants to see you.
- Really..? Why?
I have no idea. But he asked me to find you personally.
And contact him at the UN.
Alright. I'll get to this later this afternoon.
Hey, Buck. Don't let this thing sit on your desk.
I promised him you'll call him right back.
I gotta go. You call him!
Alright.
..now, a slighly different track. What's your reaction to rabbi Ben Judah who is perhaps the world's leading religious scholar.. who claims he is going to announce the single biggest news in history?
Hey, Mr. Williams.
Good to see you back.
You have now heard all the delegates.
Each representing one of 10 permanent members of the Security Council.
Clearly, each of them agrees that this world is in need of one thing above all else, and that is leadership.
You've also heard them to ask you directly to take this mantle upon yourself.
But before you make your decision, please allow our representative from the
World Monetary Fund, to make one final appeal.
Sir, as you know, almost every currency has crashed completely.
There is little doubt that the entire world market could be just days form complete collapse. unless we can consolidate at least the major currencies.
But no one is going to allow one single world currency.
Perhaps no one would have, but now all of that has changed.
You are the one man that the entire world will accept to administer.
Mr. Secretary General, what we are looking for at this time is a leader who can unite a shattered world.
Please, I ask you, on behalf of every man and woman on the planet, to be that leader.
I am humbled by your trust.
If there is no other alternative, I accept.
Now, with control of all currency, we are finally in a position to make peace our only choice.
Immediately, we will call on every nation to disarm.
To put aside all their racial, social, political and the deadliest of all, their religious differences.
Today we must accept this truth.
There is no heaven or hell.
There is just us, here.
Now, let us not look beyond ourselves.
Let us look to ourselves.
Together we need not fear temptation or evil, for ours is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever and ever. Amen
Thank you all for coming.
Ray, people are missing. Dozens of seats, empty.
Captain Steele, please return to the flight deck, immediately.
Where are my kids? They were sitting right here.
We are at 37.000 feet. Nobody just walked off this airplane.
Captain Steele.
May you walk in the faith of the Lord.
What are you doing?
- What's it look like I'm doing?
You can't take them down. I live here too, you know.
Are you listening to me? That's my mother and my brother.
Chloe, if you want them, then take them to your room.
Fine.
Hello?
- Hi, Bruce.
Oh, good, good.
Yeah, we'll be there.
Good. Buck.
The UN just wrapped up another press conference.
Nikolai's not wasting any time. The way they're talking, he's not just Secretary General of the UN.
It's more like he's president of the entire planet.
What are we going to do?
- The only thing we can do.
Work together to share the truth to anyone who will hear it.
That's a pretty tall order. Everyone in the world thinks that Nikolai is osme sort of super-hero.
Convince them that he's a bad guy..well that's gonna be.. - Well, how do we stop him?
We can't stop him. We can't change the events of the Bible.
The Antichrist will rule. What we have to do is fight him.
All of us. Together.
Form our own Tribulation Force and spread God's word.
Why do I get the feeling that Nikolai is not going to like that idea?
The Bible makes it clear.
The Antichrist will hunt down and kill every Christian he can find.
Admitting you're a Christian during Tribulations is just like marking yourself for death.
You got any ideas?
You seen those reports about the 2 men who were burned to death at the Wailing Wall?
Yeah. The UN closed it down.
See these guys?
- Who are they?
The witnesses. The Bible talks about 2 men who will appear during the tribulation.
They will preach God's word, they will lead thousands to salvation.
It's a crucial end times prophecy.
A lot of people think they will do their work at the Wailing Wall, in Jerusalem.
I'm missing the connection.
God gives these men the power to defend themselves with fire from heaven.
Wait a minute. You think that the witnesses are here? Now?
That's what we need to find out. Something made the
UN close down that area.
You're right. I gotta get over there.
Are you crazy? You could get yourself killed.
Why can't someone else go?
Because I don't trust anybody else to stick to our mission.
What can I do?
The US government just gave Nikolai a brand new airplane.
He needs pilots.
And? - And you've flown dignitaries plenty of times.
You already have the security clearences.
No. No way..
- Ray..
Bruce, we're talking about the Antichrist here. He's going to slaughter millions of innocent people.
I won't be a part of that.
I'm sorry.
Hear me out.
These are not ordinary times. But we can't go back to the way we were.
You are asking me to drive Jack the Ripper from door to door so he can kill people.
- I'm not gonna do that.
- None of this is easy!
But we have a calling now and we have to stick together.
I'm not gonna fly that airplane, Bruce.
I'm sorry.
If you don't, then somebody else will.
Well, that's fine. Let 'em.
I don't care.
Who would you rather in the cockpit?
Someone who thinks Nikolai is a god?
Or someone who knows the truth?
We need the information to save souls, Ray.
Bruce, I'm sorry.
I can't believe you're gonna do this.
Chloe. I am not gonna let anything happen to me. I promise.
How could I? I'd never get to see you again.
Will you wait for me?
Is everything OK?
Yeah.
What's your plan to gest past Nikolai's men in Jerusalem?
I plan to get access. My old boss called me.
He told me that Nikolai wants to meet with me.
- Let's not forget who we're dealing with here.
- How could I?
You think that Nikolai suspects that you know the truth?
It's possible. This could be a trap.
Or some kind of test to see if I really know who he is.
Don't worry. This will be completely painless.
- Have you talked to anyone who was there?- Yes.
And they all swear it as a murder-suicide.
And if you hadn't accepted Christ, you would too.
But, Bruce, the UN controls the Wall.
Nikolai controls the UN.
If I want a shot of getting close to these witnesses, then I need Nikolai on my side.
I gotta meet with him sooner or later.
If I don't, he'll get suspicious.
Besides, I'm a journalist.
What journalist in the world would not give his arm for meeting with Carpathia?
We've got a seriously burned fireman here.
We need some help.
- The hospitals are all full. We need a bed.
- We've got a bed right here.
I'm gonna have to leave him with you.
You're OK, sir. You're gonna be alright.
Give me a hand here, will you?
Get him there. On my count.
- Hey.. How're you doing?
- Good.
Hey, Ivy, what are you doing here?
- You thought you could get rid of me?
- Yeah..
- No. No, this is great.
- Good.
Heard you came here, and I thought I'd be important, so here I am..
What are we working on?
Right here. Look at this.
I'm trying to figure out what's going on at the Wailing Wall.
Mr. Williams.
Who gave you clearence to waltz in here and take over this space?
Hey, Verna? How you doing?
It's been a long time.
Drop the chit-chat and just answer the question.
Verna, I'm trying to..
- You may address me as Miss V.!
Look, I don't know what's gotten into you, but I'm working on a special assignment.
Special? Who assigned you a special?
And you are?
- I'm Buck's assistant. But you could call me Miss Gold if you'd like. - Gold?
Well, I'm in charge here, so let me lay out the ground rules.
You will not touch, use or fool with otherwise employ this equipment
Unless you have my personal clearance in advance.
Furthermore, you will not be involved in the creation, development or broadcast of any specials while you're working here. Are we crystal?
Listen, let me make something crystal to you.
Specials are assigned by New-York, OK?
- And as long as I'm here. - Just drop it.
It doesn't matter.
Is that crystal?
- We'll see about that.
- We'll see about that?
Listen. It doesn't even matter. I know the truth about what happened.
I know what happened with the vanishings and the
 UN lie about the radiation has nothing to do with it.
- What we saw was an act of God. It was by.. - Crazy person, OK?
- You're temporarily insane and I cannot hear you.. - Keep it quiet!
Look, we'll work from my place.
First I want you to call the UN and get me in meeting with Nikolai Carpathia.
You know, this is just crazy. I can go to a motel or something.
I've got a mattress in this bedroom, I've got a couch in the other one. You can have your pick.
Very nice.
Bucky, Bucky, Bucky.
Buck Williams hospitality. You gotta love that.
Look at this view.
- When your fiancee comes, he can stay here too.
- Yeah.
Phone is blinking.
Very cool. It's just me.
No one has this number.
Hey, Buck. It's Steve Plank.
I'm glad you came to your sences.
Nikolai will be in Chicago in the next day or so.
We're just forming up a schedule. We'll get hold of you when we've got some time. OK?
OK. Ciao, Buck.
Did you give Steve Plank this number?
No.
I don't know how they found it.
Listen, if I'm not here, don't let anyone in.
OK? No one.
OK.
- Hey, Ray, he's starting.
- I know. I'm just waiting for Chris.
There he is.
- Buddy, how are you doing?
- I'm OK.
Chris. Buck. Good to see you again.
You too.
Let's go in.
Every person in this room has lost someone.
A mother, a brother, wife, friend.
Ask yourselves this question: did all of these people have something in common?
Yes. 2 things.
Either they had decided to follow Christ, or they were too young to have made that decision in their lives already.
So I've got good news for you tonight.
We lost our loved ones because of the rapture.
The Bible told us it was coming.
Anyone who believed in Jesus Christ is in heaven with God right now.
What's left for us is a second chance.
I'm not gonna stand here and tell you that the road ahead is gonna be an easy one, folks.
How many have heard of the tribulation?
The Bible predicts that there will be a treaty between Israel and the rest of the world.
That treay will be brokered by a great leader.
The signing of that treaty will mark the beginning of the 7 years of darkness.
That's what we're talking about when we refer to the Tribulation.
- So what's gonna happen? - What's gonna happen?
The world will experience judgments, terrible judgments.
Devastating wars, famines plagues.
And those judgments are represented in the prophecies by these guys.
How many have heard of the 4 horsemen of the Apocalypse?
And I looked and behold a white horse and he who sat on it had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went on conquering and to conquer.
Revelations 6:2.
Now who is this first horseman?
I believe he represents the Antichrist.
And his purpose is made clear by the
2 words: to conquer.
- Is he gonna kill us all?
- No.
Other passages make it clear that he will triumph not through force, but through diplomacy.
Through peace. Through a false peace that promises world unity.
Does that sound familiar to anyone?
That's what Nikolai Carpathia is trying to do.
But Nikolai can't be the devil.
All he talks about is peace and harmony.
- Does he strike you as a liar?
- How does he strike you?
- As a savior!
- As a savior..
There is only one person who can save you from your sins.
One Messiah. That's Jesus Christ.
I'm outta here.
These are dangerous times and we're all afraid. but this book also gives us a second chance.
Chris, come on man, wait!
- I can't sit there and listen to that garbage.
- What?
Save us from sin? Nikolai is the
Antichrist? Come on!
What is it with you people? You think everyone's bad.
Well I have something to tell you.
There are lots of good people in the world, including me.
- According to whose standards? Yours or God's?
- What?
You just said you were a good person.
- I mean, do you think you've kept the 10
Commandments? - Yeah, pretty much.
- I mean I'm not perfect, but I didn't kill anybody. - OK.
Well, have you ever lied?
Yeah, well, who hasn't?
So what does that make you?
- Human!
- Come on Chris, be honest.
If you've murdered somebody, that makes you a murderer.
- So if you've lied, what does that make you?
- OK. A liar.
Have you ever stolen anything? No.
- Even if it was something small?
- Well, yeah, once.
- So what does that make you?
- A thief.
You know, the one that really got me was
Jesus said..
Whoever looks at a woman to lust after her, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
- Have you ever done that?
Yeah. Guilty.
So, Chris, by your own admission, you're a lying thied and adulterer by heart.
And that's only 3 of the 10 Commandments.
So if God judges you by those standards?
- Do you honestly think you're gonna be innocent or guilty? - I guess I'd be guilty.
Chris, that's the point.
And what am I supposed to do?
Get religious?
That's what we're trying to tell you. Jesus took your punishment when He died on the cross. That..
God did that so you wouldn't have to go to hell.
That's how much He loves you.
Eternal life is a gift.
You don't have to do anything religious.
I can't accept that.
Ay, Chris.
We missed the rapture.
We missed the boat.
But that doesn't mean it's too late.
God calls all men everywhere to repent.
Come up here. Right now. Turn from your sins.
Trust in the Lord Jesus Christ.
Praise God.
You lost someone too?
Yes, I...
Hi Chris. What's going on?
What's going on, man?
Chris, it's me, Ray.
- Get out!
- Listen, you don't need that.
I know what it's like. I lost my wife and my son.
Everything. Just like you.
It hurts, man. I know that. It hurts more than anything I've ever felt.
I miss them terribly.
And I can cry, or hide or wreck anything in my house, but that's not gonna change anything.
They're not coming back.
I keep going because I know that they are in heaven.
- That there is a heaven. That it's real.
- Real?
This room is real. This is real.
- Chris, why don't you give me that gun.
- Don't!
Not unless you wanna die too.
I don't wanna die.
I thought I did. I thought I deserved to.
- It's not what God wants.
- God? God is dead.
You heard Nikolai. There is no heaven and no hell. Only us.
He wants you to think that there is no reason to go on and he wants you to kill yourself.
Right here. Right now. That's what he wants.
- Why?
- Because you have a purpose.
Because God created you and me.
Everybody.
I mean, look around you. Do you think that this is an accident?
That the oceans and the sunset just happened by chance?
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying that there is a God. There has to be.
It's the only thing that makes sense.
So if there's a God and there's a heaven, why are we here?
- Why aren't we in heaven?
- Because we weren't right with God.
- No.
- Chris..
You can pull that trigger,
I can't stop you.
But if you do, you are never gonna see your wife again.
Is that what you want? She's in heaven with my wife and my son.
She committed to God and she's in heaven.
If she's not..
Then where are they? You tell me.
Where are they?
You can guarantee me that there is no heaven.
Can you guarantee that?
What if you're wrong? You wanna be with them, don't you? I know you do.
And they want you to be with them.
Now you have got to make a decision.
It's the biggest decision of your life.
Trust me.
Trsut your wife.
You need to trade that gun for God.
You need to put your faith and trust in
God and you need to do it right now.
What do you say? Are you ready to make that trade?
I've just confirmed. There were 2 men preaching when the people got burned at the Wall.
Bruce, I think this is real and this is happening right now.
How do we share it?
By turning it into a GNN report.
I can tie it to all that talk about that new one world religion.
I get in there with a camera.
I uplink to a satellite.
Live TV. The world sees the truth on live TV.
- I love it. - Alright, guys, what about UN security, though?
The Wall's closed. I've got a meeting with Nikolai.
Chris just got saved.
It was amazing.
- Praise God.
- I finally got it.
I know what God's purpose is for me.
I'm going after that pilot job for Nikolai.
Ray, last time we talked you told me flat-out, No.
There's no half-way with the Antichrist.
You're either in 100 %..
When Nikolai signs that treaty with Israel, the tribulation begins.
- We don't have much time.
- You two are both crazy.
You wanna work for the Antichrist and you..you wanna have lunch with him?
What makes you think you're even gonna get the job?
I got a connection.
Whatever.
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.
Is that your family?
What are these? It means they were church members.
Listen, I know that you're concerned about your dad, and..
I do not want to talk about my family.
OK.
Chloe, I feel like there's something you're not telling me.
I think you're a wonderful guy, but I've got a real problem with this hanging out with the devil thing.
I don't even know if you're gonna be alive tomorrow.
Hattie.
Ray.
- It's great to see you.
- What is it, Ray?
Well, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
For what? Leading me on?
I'm over it.
I'm on a tight schedule. 
What can I do for you?
I need something. I wanna talk to you.
Funny how things change in the blink of an eye.
- Hattie, I wanna fly this plane.
- You and every other pilot.
A few days ago you were warning me about taking this job.
Waving your Bible around like you've gotten to the deep end. - Everything just happened.
I mean, my world was upside down.
I had lost my family.
- I didn't know where to turn.
- But not to me.
Besides Ray, I've heard all the lies.
All the rumours.
What is it? Oh, yes.
The Antichrist.
Isn't that what the Bible is saying?
So how can you waltz in here and ask me for this job?
Come on, Hattie. I'm a pilot.
I deal in facts.
We've worked together a long time, right?
In all that time did you ever see me spreading rumours and lies about people?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
I've lost almost anything, but
I can still fly.
I'm a good pilot and you know it.
I wanna give something.
And I believe the best way to do it is if I work for Nikolai.
- I believe you mean that.
- I do mean it. I do.
You have to see him. Once you know him, it's amazing.
He's always talking about the greater good and world peace.
You know, actually, I think he's christian.
Hey, Chloe. Come on in.
Everything OK?
- I have to ask you something.
- Sure. Come on. Sit down.
What do you think about relationships at a time like this?
- Relationships. What do you mean?
- Well, romantic ones.
Between a man and a woman.
Are you sure you don't wanna sit down?
I think I know this man.
- Someone's who's leaving very soon.
- I think the stakes are high. Everywhere.
Including in relationships. Maybe God wants you to make a sacrifice, Chloe.
- Maybe God wants you to let Buck go.
- Even if he doesn't come back?
I think you have to talk to him.
You're right. Thanks.
We don't want anything. Go away.
- I'm looking for Buck Williams..
- What? What?
Does Buck Williams live here?
No. No, he doesn't.
Look..what do you want? You want an autograph or something? Is that what you want?
Listen, chickie, let me give you some advice, OK?
You're not the first one to follow him home.
So why don't you go skedaddle and go play with some college boys. Bye!
Are you gonna get that?
It's him.
- Him who?
- Buck.
Buck? What is going on?
- Nothing.
- Well that nothing has a lot of omething behind it, Chloe.
He's engaged. I bet you didn't even know that, dad.
- He's living with someone.
- Oh, come on. Buck is not engaged.
- Yes, he is.
I don't know where you get your information, but if Buck were engaged, he would've told us.
- Hello.
- Hey, Ray!
- Hey, Buck. How are you doing?
A little frustrated. Is Chloe there. I think we've had some kind of misunderstanding.
- I'd say that's true.
- Why? Is she standing right there?
- Absolutely.
- Do you have any idea what the problem is?
No, not really.
Well, I'd like to get to the bottom of it.
I'd like to come over tonight.
I think that would be a good idea.
Great. You mind if I come over right now?
- That's a great idea.
- I'm already on my way.
OK. Buck. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Now, I am going to go take a shower and go to bed. Good night.
Come with us, mr. Williams.
Ah, mr. Williams, sorry to meet like this, but I knew you would appreciate the view.
Come.
It's good to see you again.
The last time we were together it was under rather unfortunate circumstances.
Yes. Yes, that was a terrible thing that happened.
Since that day it seems like perhaps you have been avoiding me.
No. Why would I do that?
- It's just that things have been very crazy. I mean everything.
- Yes, yes, of course.
There is a whole world out there looking for answers, Buck.
And I am sure you will agree that the most important thing right now is seeing that they get the right ones.
That's why the UN has decided to assume control of the world's major media.
- What?
- Sounds like you don't approve.
Well, a free press is the cornerstone of a free world.
Leadership without accountability does not sound very compelling.
I want only the best for this world.
You've heard enough to know that by now.
I have traveled from country to country in the last week, and I can tell you first hand that I have seen nothing but pain and suffering.
It seems that people just weren't build to deal with this kind of overwhelming stress.
People have only one natural reaction to something like this.
Find someone to blame.
It's up to us, Buck.
If people can't find the answers they are looking for, they will only have to make them up.
Think of it.
A world looking for someone to hate.
Turning for answers to a media who makes its living from feeding rumours and promoting conflict.
We may hold the secret to world peace and unity in our heads.
- Why me?
- Because people trust you.
You're exactly what they need in a time like this.
A voice of reason.
In a world of fear and suspicion, a voice like yours is the most powerful weapon in the fight for peace. - And if I refuse?
I don't think you can.
This is too important.
If I do this, I need complete freedom.
To cover any story I want.
- Of course.
And I want total UN security clearance.
If I'm going to report the truth,
I need access to it.
Buck Williams. I welcome the accountability.
Do we have a deal?
Good choice, Buck.
Hey, Buck.
Congratulations. I hear we're gonna be working together.
- Hey, why didn't you tell me Nikolai controls GNN?
- Not relevant.
Listen, I'm gonna be your man on the ground in Israel.
Anything you need, you come to me.
You know, it's gonna be a lot better for guys like us.
Journalistic integrity, freedom of the press.
- Nikolai is the boss you always wanted to have.
- Sure.
- Yeah, listen, I'm gonna go cover the peace treaty.
- No, no, no.
The ben Judah announcement, that's the event.
Believe me, it will the biggest story of your carrier.
Why is this speech so important?
Come on buddy. You're the reporter.
You figure it out.
See you later.
What are you doing here?
- Chloe, I need to talk to you.
- No. Go away.
- I'm not leaving until you talk with me.
- Fine.
- Daddy?
- Yeah?
Buck's here and he won't leave.
What do you want me to do? I'm taking a shower. I've got soap in my eyes.
- Get rid of him.
- Well, he's not here to see me.
Great.
You have 9 minutes.
- Can we go inside?
- No.
OK. We'll just stand out here and freeze.
Obviously, Chloe, there's some kind of misunderstanding.
Pretty smart, huh?
Chloe, I don't understand. I thought that we sort of.. headed off. I mean,
I really like you.
- Me and who else?
- What?
Nothing. You have 8 minutes.
Keep talking.
What do you mean, and who else?
Chloe, I honestly have no idea what you're talking about.
You know what? Forget it. Why don't you go back to your fiancee before she gets worried.
Wait, wait. Wow! My what?
- I met her today at your apartment.
- Who?
Brunette. Back-towel. Big shiny diamond. Ring a bell?
Ivy? Mrs. Ivy Williams.
Cute.
I am not engaged to Ivy.
Or anyone else.
She's just crashing at my place. She's my assistant. End of story.
So, she's not...?
- I feel like such an idiot.
- Don't.
You know, it's my fault. I really should've told, but I just didn't think that..
I'm sorry.
How are my 8 minutes doing?
You can have all the time you want.
Everything OK?
Shower huh?
You knew he was coming?
Thanks, daddy.
Good night, sweetheart.
But I know they're gonna have a plutoon straight up to Golden Gate.
Don't worry, I talked to Nikolai.
- He's given me full UN clearance.
- There's a twist.
The Antichrist approves a story that could reveal what he is to the world.
Once you finds out you plan to put the witnesses on GNN..
Well, I'm gonna convince him that everything
I'm doing is for the sake of world unity.
- I'll pray for you, Buck.
- And I'll be on the ground with you.
- If you need anything at all, I'll be there.
- Thanks.
There's still a lot of "what ifs"
Bruce, I've been praying. And I know this is the way to go.
Guys, the Antichrist may have powers we cannot even comprehend.
We walk by faith, not by sight.
I am troubled by the developments at the Wailing Wall.
Divided religions mean a divided world.
These men, these self-proclamed preachers, are dangerous.
Why don't you just arrest them?
I don't want to put them in jail.
This is not a dictatorship.
I simply don't want to see anyone else getting hurt.
Increase the guards at the Wall.
Are you waiting for something?
The Wailing Wall is an important symbol.
Thousands of people have flocked it.
Exactly. The world is in shoc, mr. Plank.
Millions vanished, no rational explanation.
People are grasping it's source.
It's our duty to give them faith.
How, Nikolai?
By creating spiritual unity, of course.
A one world religion.
Tolerance, harmony and peace.
How does this create harmony?
Yes, mr. President?
Cut Channel 10, then give me the Buck
Williams report.
Right away, sir.
I believe people are finally ready to accept it.
A united global society. The world will follow us to peace.
And this man will show them the way.
OK, one more here. OK....Oh...
Let's have a silly one.
I think there's another one.
- You feel like a cookie?
- Why? Do I look like one?
- That is so lame.
-  I know.
- I know. I know. Here we go.
- Let me see.
I like that one. Look at your face!
I think I'll keep all of them.
Just kidding.
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
Well, this is where I say goodbye.
Hey, you know I have no choice.
I know.
- Listen, we still have our pictures, right?
- Yeah.
I'll be thinking of you.
He will be OK.
- Watch him for me.
- You know I will.
Be careful, dad. I'm real proud of you.
I love you.
I love you too, angel.
- Are you OK?
- I'll get a cup of coffee.
Alright. Here we are.
Good.
Hey..it's me.
- What are you doing?
- Trying to see what I can find.
Be careful.
Excellent.
Good work on the speech. ben Judah loves the changes.
Well I'm glad to hear that.
Ben Judah speech..World presentation revised
Come on..Come on..
Captain Steele, is there something
I can help you with?
I was looking for Hattie. I wanted to give her our ETA.
Miss Durham speaks very highly of you.
- She tells me you once worked together..
- Yes, sir, that's correct.
That past relationship.. did it extend beyond the workplace?
- Excuse me?
- There are hundreds of qualified pilots all over the world.
I'd like to think she hired you for the right reasons.
No. In reference to your question about our past relationship.
- No, it didn't extend beyond the workplace.
- Good.
- I like to know where everyone stands.
- Yes, sir.
Captain, why don't you give me that?
I'm sorry?
Our ETA. I'm about to go see
Hattie right now.
Of course. Forgive me, I forgot.
- Captain Steele, are you OK?
- I'm fine.
Good. This plane, it meets your expectations?
- Yes sir, it's amazing.
- Thank you, Captain.
And captain.. glad to have you with us.
- Thank you, sir. Good to be here.
Jerusalem
OK. Come on in. How did it go?
Did you find anything?
Yeah, I think so.
The attachment is the Ben Judah speech.
OK, OK, here we go.
The Messiah will be pierced without breaking a bone.
Medical records show that when Nikolai was 6 years of age, he was pierced through the chest by a farm machine, without breaking a single bone.
The Messiah will travel to Egypt as a young child.
This is what Ben Judah's big announcement is all about.
He's gonna announce that Nikolai is the Messiah.
That's why Nikolai wants me here.
He's using me to promote the speech.
No, no, we're missing something here. If this is Ben Judah's speech, then why did I hear Nikolai thank Steve
Plank for writing it?
Or rewriting it.
Come on, Ray, look.
The Messiah will pe pierced without breaking a bone.
We all know that was Jesus Christ.
He was stabbed when He was hanging on the cross.
Ben Judah was going to announce that
Jesus Christ is the Messiah.
They changed the speech.
But how are they going to get
Ben Judah to read it?
Nikolai's got a lot of people under his power.
We've got to get to Ben Judah.
And then what? I mean, if he has all these people under his power, or his spell, or whatever you wanna call it, it's supernatural.
- What can you do?
- I can't do anything. But God can.
- The only thing that's gonna break it is the power of God. - But how?
We get Ben Judah face to face with the Word of God.
- Buck...
- We take him to the witnesses.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
- Buck, good to see you.
- Steve.
Listen, I need a favor.
- I need to get to the Wailing Wall.
- Why?
The 2 men at the Wall..
Listen, I know they're a problem for Nikolai.
I think I can discredit them, I think
I can make them go away.
Well, I like it. I like it a lot.
But I can't do it.
Not even for you.
It's off-limits.
- Oh, Steve, come on...
- No, no, no...
Nikoali has everyone's best interests at heart.
He wants to unify the world, not divide it.
The more attention you give to those guys, the worse they're gonna make it.
This, this right here, is where the world is going.
One faith for everyone.
Don't even think about it.
Can I read to you?
Let not your heart be troubled.
Ye who believe in God, believe also in Me.
In my Father's House are many mansions.
If it were not so, I would have told you.
I will go and prepare a place for you,
And if I go and prepare a place for you,
I'll come again.
I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.
Look. Buck told me where I could find you, but it kinda looks like you have your hands full, so..
I'll make it short. I owe you an apology.
- I guess we both jumped to the wrong conclusions. - Yeah...
- I'm Ch...
- Excuse me, sorry.
- I'm Chloe.
- I'm Ivy.
- So anyway, I'm sorry. - No problem,
You're quite the fierce protectoress.
I guess we all have our talents.
- So anyway,do you believe in this stuff?
- Yeah, yeah I do.
- Magic formula?
- It's not magic. It's faith.
And you get that from reading your Bible?
It's not just reading. It's believing.
I guess it's like my Mum said. Faith is a choice and it comes from the heart so, you either wanna believe it or you don't.
It's never been a strong point for me, so..
- But hey...Good luck.
 - Thanks.
Hey. Sorry about that.
And if I go and prepare a place for you..
I will come again and receive you unto myself. that where I am there you may also be.
Excuse me. Rabbi Ben Judah?
- Yes?
- Hi. My name is..
Buck Williams. I think the whole world knows who you are.
I was wondering if we could talk?
What can I do for you?
- It's about the 2 men at the Wall.
- They are dangerous men.
- Why? - They wish to divide the world through religion. This is not right.
There is no heaven or hell.
There is only us.
We must not allow closed-mind fanaticism to divide the world any further.
But there are many people who believe that these men have something very important to say.
- And that Nikolai must be hiding something.
- That's ridiculous.
Why would Nikolai do such a thing?
But rabbi, in a world like this a tiny rumour like that could spread like a wildfire.
And there's no telling how many people might believe it.
That's why I want you to come to the Wall to speak to them.
You are the world's most knowledgeable and respected religious scholar.
If anyone can discredit these men, it's you.
You can question them if you want and if they stumble for answers, if they contradict themselves, I'll have the whole thing on tape, for the whole world wide GNN audience to see.
Rabbi, think of it as a gift to Nikolai.
He has much more important things to worry about right now than a couple of radicals.
Let's expose these men for who they really are, before they become martyrs for their cause.
Nikolai is lucky to have a friend like you.
I know this guy. Ne never quits.
I mean this is the guy who broadcasted from
Israel with planes crashing all around him.
Exactly why he's with us.
People love him.
His coverage will help them understand and accept the peace process.
He came to me today. He wants access to the Wailing Wall.
- He wants to discredit the witnesses.
- If I thought he could...
I want 24 hours monitors on all GNN broadcasts
Immediate notification for any footage from the Wailing Wall. Go!
An official press release: due to extremist threats, against the Wailing Wall, any and all tresspassers will be shot on sight.
Alright. Well, that should keep even
Buck Williams away.
- Hey, how's it going?
- It's going great.
Good. You're ready?
Yes. The equipment's ready. The GNN uplink is good to go.
But I still don't know how we're gonna get to the Wailing Wall.
God got us this far, He'll take us the rest of the way.
You just get Ben Judah there, let me take care of the rest.
Besides, I've told Chloe that I'd look out for you.
Really? I told her that I'd look out for you. - Really?
Hey, listen, Ray.
You know I really have no idea what you must be feeling, having lost your wife and son.
But I know that Chloe is really worried about you.
It's just...it's just hard to let go.
You know?
I'm gonna be alright.
Let's pray.
God, some things are just so hard to understand and to accept.
Please help us to accept Your will and give us the faith and the strength that we need to do what you want us to do. and we thank You that You're in control.
We're praying in Your Son's name.
Amen.
- Hello. - Hey, it's me.
- Hi, Buck. It's so good to hear your voice.
- Are you guys OK?
- Yeah, yeah..we're fine.
Look, it's starting to get dark over here and
I just wanted to say that I miss you.
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
- Good. I'm still going to the Wailing Wall.
- Buck, you can't.
The UN just announced that anyone who tries to approach will be shot on sight.
Chloe, don't worry.
God will protect me.
Just pray.
I did. I asked Him to bring you home. I really miss you.
Me too.
Take care.
Glad you could make it.
The sooner we go, the sooner we put an end to the lies.
Let's go.
DO NOT CROSS.
VIOLATORS WILL BE SHOT.
Stay. Right here.
That's all. Stop. Show me your ID.  
I'm with GNN. I work with Nikolai Carpathia.
No. We have strict orders.
No one passes.
Give me strength, God.
May you walk in the faith of the Lord.
Stop!
You stop immediately!
Stay where you are!
Halt! Right now!
That's all!
Ready!
Aim!
The Lord has chosen this as a building for his sanctuary.
- He said: Take head now, for the Lord..
- I know, I know. He's speaking in English.
You are false prophets.
Claiming to know the secrets to God's kingdom.
God will bring every deed into judgment,
Ben Judah.
Including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.
I, the Lord, search the heart,
I test the mind.
And I will give to every man according to his ways and according to what he has done.
I have kept the Commandments since my youth.
By the deeds of the law, no flesh shall be justified in His sight.
For by grace you are saved, through faith, and this is not for yourselves, it is the gift of God.
Not by works, so that no one can boast.
Cut it.
- I don't understand.
- We are ambassadors.
As though God was making His appeal through us.
This is GNN. We are experiencing technical difficulties.
Please stand by.
Be reconciled to God.
God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him, we might become the righteousness of God.
For God so loved the world, that He gave
His one and only son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.
For God did not send His son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him.
He who believes in the Son is not condemned.
But he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
And the name of the Son of God?
He is the Christ, Jesus.
Buck, how did it go?
It was insane. But I got the witnesses on TV and..
- What? - I spoke to Chloe. The broadcast got cut. Nobody saw it.
What do you mean?
- But at least Ben Judah heard the truth..
- I don't know. He was gone...
- What do you mean you don't know?
- He was gone. Before I could talk to him.
It's in God's hands now.
It's good to see you back.
- I thought you could use some food.
- Thanks.
I'm ready.
- I'm ready for God.
- Then tell Him.
Dear God, I'm so sorry I've sinned against you,
Please forgive me. I want to do the right thing.
Jesus, thank You.
Thank You for dying for me.
I put my life in Your hands.
You were so great.
- It was good. Did you see his eyes?
- Yeah.
So much peace in his eyes.
- He found God.
- Yeah, he did.
I regret that I cannot be present for this long awaited announcement.
Rabbi Ben Judah, whom I have recently just met, is recognised as the world's leading authority on rabbinical teachings and the ancient scriptures.
He is known as an honest man.
A careful man.
A man who supports every conclusion with well researched data.
He will be joining you in approximately
1 hour.
Unfortunately, pressing UN business calls me back to New-York.
So I will leave you now.
I wish you peace.
- Hello.
- Buck.
- Ray, where are you?
- I'm on the plane. Nikolai is leaving.
- Yeah, I heard it.
Listen, I'm gonna do all that I can from this end. You take care of yourself.
Thanks. God bless.
I appreciate what you tried to do for me at the Wailing Wall.
Don't you worry, this is the real reason why you're here.
I'm sure you will find this announcement fascinating.
- I'll be back in a bit. You good?
- Yeah, sure.
 - Ready for the broadcast.
- Please.
Here we go.
And after years of study,
My team has concluded beyond the shadow of a doubt the identity of the Messiah.
The Bible has given clear prophecies that could be fullfilled by only one person in the entire universe.
Bassd on 456 Messianic passages and 558 references from the most ancient rabbinical writings,
There are 109 distinct prophecies that the Messiah must fullfill.
Perhaps you will be relieved to know that
I will not detail all 109 this evening. the possibility of even 20 of this 109 prophecies be fullfilled by one man is well to 1 in a 
100 million.
Now in light of recent world events there has been much speculation that the Messiah does indeed walk among us today.
So let us look at the prophecies.
Some of us could apply for any of us.
For example, the Messiah will be proceeded by a forerunner.
He, and the prophecies do refer of a man who will be pierced without breaking a bone.
Then it starts to narrow.
The Messiah must be born of an extremely rare bloodline.
He will travel to Egypt as a young child.
He will be rejected by his own people.
The Messiah must be born in Bethlehem.
The Messiah will be betrayed by a friend for 30 pieces of silver.
And perhaps the most amazing, the Messiah was predicted to have supernatural powers.
We don't have a connection.
Get the cell-phone. Now!
...be resurrected again.
There is only one person in history who fullfills all these prophecies.
And His name is Jesus Christ.
Praise God!
What I did not believe, I have seen.
God's witnesses.
And I have heard the truth. I beg you, each of you, to open your eyes to see the truth and turn to God's faith.
Please forgive me.
- He has sent us a Savior.
- I need You.
Jesus Christ.
Please forgive me for doubting.
Cut it. Cut it now!
This is GNN. We are experiecing technical difficulties.
Pray with me.
I accept you Jesus into my life.
I accept you Jesus into my life.
-  And my heart.
- And my heart.
And I ask you Jesus to stay with me forever.
And I ask you Jesus to stay with me forever.
 - Amen. 
- Amen.
- I don't know if you're gonna be safe here.
- I will be fine.
Thanks, Buck. Thanks to you, millions have heard the truth.
Thanks to God.
- Would you like taking a break?
- Yeah..
Thank you, God. Thank you.
- Nikolai, can I get you anything?
- Leave.
Leave!!
This is not the end!
This is my time!
My will be done!
I will rule.
Oh, Lord my God,
When I'm in awesome wonder
Consider all the work Thy hands have made
I see the stars,
I hear the roaring thunder.
My path throughout the universe displayed.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art.
This is it, Digipals.
In a few seconds, the doors will open for the best movie of all time.
A Digimon movie.
Seven hours of waiting in line and skipping breakfast...
...have finally paid off.
Nanette Manoir.
The end of the line starts at the end.
Au contraire, Angela Anaconda.
The end is for riffraff, which is French for:
Those who must wait since they don't have...
...all-access, VlP passes.
But thanks ever so for keeping our spot warm.
"Thanks for keeping our spot warm."
We are going to have to get digidrastic if we want to get the best seats.
Get ready to rumble.
Hey, wait up! I was first in line!
Saved!
Guys? Where are my best friends?
Refills are free, right?
Taken! Sorry! Saved! Back up, Grandma!
That's it!
If my friends do not get here soon--
Popcorn! Thanks, Johnny Abatti.
Digimon! Digimon!
We're about to have the best view of the best movie, in the best seats ever!
Hats, view, blocking!
S'il vous plait, Angela Anaconda.
As if we would ever be so gauche as to wear them in the actual theater.
Mrs. Brinks, we saved you a seat.
Enjoy the show, Angela Anaconda.
So Mrs. Brinks and Ninny-poo think they can block the Digimon show...
...with their big, fat,
Digimon-blocking heads, do they?
Well, not for long.
Angela Anaconda, digivolve to Angelamon!
Well, look who's here.
Ninnymon and her Brinksimonster robot...
...come to block our view of the entire world.
Prepare for battle, you pathetic Pukimon.
But first, let's make some concessions.
After all, refills are free. Right, Ginamon?
"Help me, Angelamon, more powerful
Digimon than l", you will cry.
Don't worry, Ninny-whinnymon.
My pal Johnnymon is here to give you a kick-start.
And now, get ready for my ultimate, anti-Ninnymon...
...super-secret powers.
Angela!
Angelamon! Angelamon!
Digimon!
-Digimon!
-Excusez-moi, but if you common...
...Iine waiters can't adhere to theater etiquette...
...then I'll be forced to summon an usher.
Oh, Guinevere, je t'aime depuis le premier jour.
I've loved you since the first day.
This isn't Digimon!
This is some boring, phony, fake French film.
But that means....
We're in the wrong theater.
I called dibs on the best seats!
Good heavens!
Who says,
"There's no such thing as monsters "?
You're never quite the same after you meet your first Digimon.
My name's Kari. I'm part of a team called the DigiDestined.
There were a handful of us at first, but we've added a few members since then.
That's me with T.K., another one of the DigiDestined.
And that's Willis, in America.
While the rest of us in Japan only had one Digimon, he had twins.
And while we had our team to count on...
... Willis didn't have any human friends, only his two Digimon.
His digital adventures, as well as ours, began that night, eight years ago.
Did you know there are actually two worlds?
Our world and the Digital World.
Now, don't plan a vacation there.
I'm not even sure where it is.
But when I first saw it, I was so scared,
I was so nervous, I was so cute.
That's my brother Tai, when he was a little kid.
Even back then, he was a born leader.
Brave, strong and graceful.
That night started like every other one.
Tai was making his fourth trip to the bathroom.
Kari, what are you doing in here?
You're not supposed to play with the computer.
But it's doing something weird.
I was right. It was our first DigiEgg.
On the other side of the world...
... Willis was getting his DigiEgg at the exact same time.
Tai, wake up!
Tai! I'm going to the health-food store.
What a weird dream. A computer egg?
I gotta stop watching scary movies before I go to bed.
Take care of your sister.
But, Mom,
I was gonna play soccer with my friends!
The egg's real!
I bet you this is gonna taste a lot better than your egg.
I know what we can do.
Let's use it as a soccer ball.
You're right, it probably wouldn't bounce that high.
If anyone asks where that weird-looking egg came from...
...Iet's tell them our chicken coop is on a nuclear-waste dump.
The rest of the kids are gonna be jealous of us this Easter.
Kari, where'd you go?
Kari, l--
It's alive!
Oh, it's cute. Come here, little baby.
Kari, stay away! I'll protect you.
As usual, Tai came up with a brave plan of action.
It worked about as well as his other plans.
It's taking a bubble bath.
That was the first time any of us really connected with a Digimon.
As time went on, we learned that not all Digimon turn out to be so friendly.
Kari, stop feeding it so many candy bars.
You'll make it sick.
Hey, those are mine! Thanks a lot.
Well, now that it's here, how do we get rid of it?
We can't keep it.
Where's it gonna sleep?
Oh, no, not in my bed!
Fine, then it sleeps on the couch.
I guess we'll just have to tell Mom it's a throw pillow.
I'll get it.
Hello? Tai speaking.
This is Sora. Mimi told me you were the one who threw up in my hat.
Something's wrong with her phone.
Perfect timing.
That's weird. All the electronic stuff in the house is going nuts.
Kari, look out!
It changed. It got bigger.
What did you do? Oh, no.
Where are we gonna hide him?
What's Mom gonna say if she finds out?
It can't get any worse.
It just got worse.
You'd better pin his ears back so they don't get in the food.
Boy, he looks pretty hungry.
He had a strange way of showing his appreciation.
Cut it out! Stop kissing my sister, you!
His breath stinks!
I've had enough. He's outta here.
We don't make much of a tag team, do we?
Kids, I made your favorite: liver sticks.
Great! In a minute.
-So, do you have a name?
-Koromon.
We're in luck. She burned them.
-Tai, his name is Koromon.
-Whose name?
Koromon, what are you anyway?
I'm a Digimon, short for Digital Monster.
I'm from the Digital World.
How come you talk to him, and only whistle at me?
My name is Kari. Kari.
And this is my brother.
His name is Tai. Tai.
-Hi, Kari-Kari, Tai-Tai.
-Never mind.
He can talk.
-You two are the best friends I ever had.
-We're the only friends you've had.
Thanks for saving me from that scratching fur-ball.
Just warn me before you kiss me again.
Once a Digimon truly becomes your friend, they'll do anything for you.
Anything.
Let's have a warning for this, too.
Every time that thing changed shape, or what we now call "digivolved"...
...there was a weird electrical surge throughout the city.
Of course, there was only one way to get Tai's attention.
I'm up. What?
Koromon? What's the matter with him?
Is he sick?
You gave him your liver sticks, didn't you?
You should know that this Koromon isn't the one we befriended later on.
Look! That's gotta hurt.
When this one digivolved, he expanded more than my Uncle Fred at Thanksgiving.
Nice dinosaur. Friendly dinosaur.
Kari, get down from there!
What are you doing?
I'm gonna get grounded for this.
What's going on in there?
Did you kids break another lamp?
Piggyback?
Kari, no!
Now let's play horsey.
If Mom's worried about the lamp, wait till she sees her car!
Look both ways before you cross the street.
See any cars?
Do you even know what a car is?
Just be careful, then.
Soda. I'm thirsty. Are you?
Mom usually just puts money in, but I guess that works too.
Just one each.
Where are you going?
How hard could it be to find a dinosaur?
You know, we really shouldn't be playing in the street.
-Did you see that?
-No, I was sleeping.
But you're driving!
-Can we do that ride again?
-Pepper Flame.
Tai wasn't far behind us. He was following our footprints in the diet soda.
Why are you looking at that bus?
Please don't blow it up.
I know my mom says they're always late...
...but they can't help it.
Don't be a bad boy!
I wanna go home now, okay?
Oh, boy!
And that's when we saw our second DigiEgg.
But this one was a lot bigger, and the Digimon inside it, a lot meaner.
I'd hate to see the chicken that egg came out of.
That's a big bird.
Pepper Flame!
Mimi, it's Joe.
Quick, look outside your window.
Polly want a cracker? A really big cracker?
Koromon? Kari!
-Koromon, please don't fight!
-Kari, come on, we gotta go!
-Koromon!
-Kari, it's too dangerous!
Pepper Flame!
My turn.
Sonic Destroyer!
Izzy, did you see that?
What's wrong with the phone?
-You okay?
-Who's that?
Koromon?
I'm Greymon now.
You can be whoever you want, big guy.
Nova Flame!
Cool!
Greymon!
Don't quit!
Sonic Destroyer!
Oh, no, Tai! He's hurt.
-There's nothing you can do.
-Greymon, get up!
Greymon, wake up. He's coming!
It worked on me.
Come on, Tai.
-Go for it!
-Nova Flame!
Greymon!
That night changed our lives.
It was a while before we realized that those of us...
...who saw what happened became the DigiDestined.
Greymon...
...don't you wanna play horsey with me anymore?
Where are you?
It was even longer before we found out that Willis met...
...his Digimon that same night.
He learned alone that being a DigiDestined means...
...sometimes you gotta save the world...
...even if you're the one who caused the problem.
It was another DigiDestined, Izzy, who first noticed there was trouble.
Prodigious!
A computer virus on the lnternet.
Wait a minute.
It's attacking something.
Let me see if I can get an image of its target.
Izzy wasn't the only one tracking the virus.
The whole world was watching.
But no one was prepared for what was about to happen.
Looks like a DigiEgg.
Where'd that come from?
The virus is causing the egg to develop abnormally fast.
I think it's gonna hatch.
Across town, Tai and another DigiDestined,
Sora, were facing their own problem.
"Dear Sora:
I'm sorry about what happened.
"l haven't felt so bad since I accidentally...
"...threw up in your hat and didn't tell you before you wore it.
"l know our relationship has been stormy lately.
"You love thundershowers, what's a few raindrops between friends?
"Love, Tai."
"Love." I mean, "From." I mean....
Who are you writing to, Tai?
It's just an e-mail joke.
What are you doing in here anyway, Kari?
I wanted to show you my new dress.
I'm going to a birthday party.
I got my friend a pink Power Ranger.
Tai and I had a give-and-take relationship.
I would give and he would take.
-Who cares?
-To send...
...you have to click this. Click!
I wasn't gonna send that letter.
-Then what did you write it for?
-Go to your party.
I can't believe Sora's gonna read my letter.
Wait a minute, "Unable to deliver"?
I can't believe she's not gonna read my letter.
You try to tell a girl you're sorry and your computer shuts you down.
Surprise!
Mom? Can I make a complaint?
Kari's eating birthday cake right now, and all we have is leftover tofu.
I can make you a cake, Tai.
Hand me an egg, please.
No.
I needed to use up the rest of the wheat germ anyway.
You get the door and I'll start on that cake.
Izzy, you're all sweaty. What's wrong?
Well, it's about the egg.
The egg has already hatched.
Not that egg. A DigiEgg!
My Digimon analyzer doesn't even recognize it.
Looks like a cross between a jellyfish and a contact lens.
-It's part Digimon, part virus.
-A Digimon with a virus? So?
You kidding? If it stays on the lnternet it could destroy technology as we know it.
If it just hatched, how do you know this stuff?
This kid I met on the lnternet,
Willis, from Colorado, e-mailed me.
I don't know where he gets his information.
He's smart though.
He's in elementary school...
...but he's already taking classes at Colorado State.
So what? I'm in junior high school and I take classes at junior high school.
Look! The jellyfish digivolved.
He's sending an e-mail.
It says: "I'm hungry! "
Am I supposed to call for pizza?
He's eating computer data.
When he's done in this buffet line...
...he's gonna look for a database with more food.
More food? What does he expect to find?
A grocery store?
Okay, that's one box of chocolates.
Your total comes to 1,000,125--
Yeah, that's what it says.
That must be really good chocolate.
Paper or plastic?
In supermarkets all over, computer systems are failing...
...causing congestion at the registers.
And now for the weather.
I made beef-jerky shakes.
-No, thanks, Mom.
-Where are you going?
We need to use Dad's computer.
Don't you want your shake?
-I'm glad someone appreciates my recipes.
-Thanks, Mrs. Kamiya.
-We gotta be careful with my dad's stuff.
-Get out of my way.
A Digimon is eating the lnternet and you're worried about a few books!
But my dad likes his mess where it is.
We'll have more capabilities by networking our computers together.
Why don't we just call up the Digimon on the screen and hit "Delete"?
Don't you think I've tried that?
If this is dangerous, maybe we should call someone...
-...Iike the principal or Bill Gates.
-They won't listen.
Willis warned his lnternet carrier about the new Digimon.
They said, "Great! Let's sign him up and give him 50 free hours."
-All right, we're online.
-He's digivolved again.
My name is Keramon.
-I think he's at the Rookie level.
-This soon? He's digivolving too quickly!
-He's probably at a fast food web site.
-Now what?
Nothing.
We have to watch it eat...
...the world out of house and homepage?
I wish Agumon was here to help us.
I can almost hear him now.
You can hear me now.
It's like he was here.
I am here.
Agumon, where are you?
I can barely hear you.
-Take me off speakerphone.
-It's a transmission...
...from the Digital World.
-Agumon!
-And he's with Gennai.
-It's been a long time.
-Don't forget me.
Tentomon!
Who else is there?
-Biyomon.
-Pabumon.
-Palmon.
-Patamon.
-Gomamon.
-Gatomon.
We need to talk.
Something's threatening the Internet.
We know. The Digimon's already causing major problems in our world.
-I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
-But it is dangerous.
The evil Dark Masters were cupcakes compared to this guy.
That's it, then. Let's do it!
We found a way to enter the Internet.
We'll help you guys because you're the best friends we've ever had.
What better way to express friendship than to save your world.
Tentomon.
Don't get so emotional.
Thanks a lot, guys. You won't be alone.
We'll be right here on the computer.
-lzzy, Digivice?
-I'm one step ahead of you, Tai.
Our Digivices will help you digivolve and together we'll squash that bug.
It'll take a minute for Agumon and Tentomon to get on the Net.
My modem 's older than I am.
I'll call the other DigiDestineds so their Digimon can help, too.
Hi, this is Tai Kamiya.
Can I speak to Joe, please? A test?
He's the only kid I know who volunteers for summer school.
Hi, is Matt or T.K. there?
They're visiting their grandmother in the country?
Hey, Tai. Any luck yet?
Would you like a glass of potato juice, lzzy?
Great! I'd love some.
Be there, be there.... Hello there!
This is Tai.
You're selling ties?
No, my name is Tai.
I'm looking for Matt or T.K.
That's a coincidence.
Those are my grandkids' names.
That's great. Are they there?
Right now? Can I talk to them?
I love to talk to them, too.
They're here visiting me.
Please, I need to speak to them right away.
Okay, I'll tell them. Kids!
I can't take this!
You know, lzzy, I can never get Tai to try any of my recipes.
-I think they taste great.
-Want to try my spinach cookies?
I got Mimi's machine.
Hi, it's Mimi. I'm so glad you called.
Let's get together for lunch.
Leave a very short message after the beep.
Mimi, I--
That girl loves to talk.
You're a natural in the kitchen, just like me.
Mom, I need to get a hold of Kari, right away.
Did she take your cell phone with her?
Do I have enough of this stuff?
Beats me, it's the first time
I've used flour to bake a cake.
Of course she's got it, in case of emergency.
Emergency. What does she think this is?
Happy birthday!
-Make a wish.
-Blow them out.
-Call them back.
-I can't come home.
A magician's coming over later and I volunteered to be sawed in half.
Whatever. Just tell the half with feet to run home soon.
I can't get anybody on the phone.
I want you to call Sora for me.
But you and she are good friends.
It makes more sense for you to call.
Just do it!
Are more friends coming?
I'll make three-bean salad.
Nobody's coming over, Mom.
That's all right.
I only have two beans, anyway.
Sorry, Sora's not home.
I'll tell her to call Tai's house as soon as she gets back.
Hold on, she just walked in.
I'll put her right on.
-Sora, I think Tai wants to speak to you.
-I'm not home.
I already said you're here.
Make something up.
I don't care what you tell him.
But, Sora l--
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.
Goodbye.
Sora said she's not home.
-Did you two have an argument?
-None of your business!
You must've been a jerk if she doesn't want to talk to you.
-I didn't do anything!
-I meant that in a good way.
I can't believe she's still mad.
It all started over a hair clip.
He'd better have written me.
Greetings. You have no new mail. Okay?
No, it's not okay. Stupid Tai!
Thank you for visiting meow.com.
Miko, get down from there.
Agumon and Tentomon should be on the lnternet by now.
Does this information superhighway have a rest stop? I've got to go potty.
You should've gone before we left.
Just hold it!
You're gonna need a password.
You can use mine to get on the Internet:
Prodigious.
-Prodigious.
-They're in!
So this is what the lnternet looks like.
They need new wallpaper.
I hope this doesn't take long, it's my bath night.
There he is, go get him!
He doesn't know we're here.
Let's sneak up on him quietly.
Super Shocker!
That's quietly?
Pepper Breath!
That should have worked, but it didn't.
Keramon's sending us an e-mail. It says:
"So, you like to play games?"
I got a bad feeling about this, Agumon.
You better digivolve. Both of you. Now!
Agumon, digivolve to....
Tentomon, digivolve to....
-Greymon.
-Kabuterimon.
Bug Buster!
Electro Shocker!
Nova Blast!
You guys make this stuff look easy.
Hold that thought!
Keramon, digivolve to....
Infermon.
-No way, he's digivolved again.
-We've never seen this before.
Now he's at the Champion level, like Greymon and Kabuterimon.
-Electro Shocker!
-Nova Blast!
-Yeah!
-All right!
He's stronger than a Champion.
Spider Shooter!
Kabuterimon!
-Greymon, no!
-I think I've got it figured out now.
He's bypassed the Champion level and digivolved into the Ultimate level.
He's too strong for our Digimon now.
Then they're just gonna have to digivolve again.
Not so fast.
Greymon, digivolve to....
MetalGreymon!
He's gotta digivolve faster.
Agumon, say something!
Don't take me out, coach.
Tentomon?
I'm fine. Just one question:
Who's Tentomon?
They'll be okay, Tai.
They just need to rest for a while.
I can't believe that two Digimon at the Champion level weren't enough.
We'll never be able to defeat this thing.
Check this out. We're getting e-mails from around the world.
Here's one from Willis in America.
It says, "lzzy, I'm sorry. It's all my fault.
Find a way to slow him down."
-What's he mean, "his fault"?
-I don't know.
Infermon is e-mailing us, too.
Why is he saying "hello" over and over again?
Look at the address.
He's at the telephone company taking over the phone lines.
If we lose our phone connection, we're finished.
That's the only way we have access to the lnternet.
I've got to warn everyone.
All circuits are busy. Try again later.
Oh, great. It's busy. Mimi!
-All circuits are busy. Try again later.
-Come on! How could that be busy too?
-All circuits are still busy.
-Don't tell me!
-Didn't you hear me? It's busy!
-I'm sorry, lady.
All the phones are dead.
-That Digimon did it.
-Not a single call can get through.
Hello, this is Tai.
Hello. Did you program me?
It's lnfermon.
Hello?
Talk about speed dialing!
Infermon was looking for someone.
He was calling every number in the world.
His long-distance bill will be enormous.
What?
"Connection terminated."
What next?
Kids, cake's almost ready.
Phones have gone dead worldwide.
If your telephone is dead, call your phone company.
At least my sister can't call me three times a day.
-See you!
-Are you leaving so soon?
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Save me a piece of cake.
What's the matter with you?
Have you heard? The phones are out.
The stock market is in chaos and people are rioting.
That's nice.
Tai says call, then he won't get off the phone.
We interrupt this programming for a special bulletin.
Goody, I bet it's one of those high-speed chases.
The phone company has set up an emergency voice-mail system.
Simply dial 171 for easy instructions.
Believe me, it wasn't so easy.
First you had to leave a message, then call back to hear one.
Basically, it was playing phone tag.
Perfect! Voice mail!
To leave a message, press 1.
To retrieve a message, press 2.
Please leave your message at the tone.
Matt, T.K., this is an emergency.
Call me right away! By the way, it's Tai.
Kari, if you want to see your toys again, get home right away!
Sora, listen, I'm sorry about the hairpin.
But I need to talk to you right away.
Call me. Or just come over.
Stupid Tai.
Mimi, it's Tai. Please come to my house as soon as you get this message. 'Bye.
That reminds me.
You got this postcard in the mail from Mimi.
What?
She's on vacation? In Hawaii?
Hawaii is paradise.
I don't have a care in the world.
I'm wishing you were here.
-Hi, lzzy. Welcome back.
-Thank you.
So, when's everybody coming over?
Cheer up already.
What happened to the days when we were a team?
We are a team, Tai, but we're just kind of spread out right now.
By the way, where did you disappear to?
-Well, I went to pick this up.
-What is it?
A satellite uplink.
We can get onto the lnternet by tapping into the military's satellite system.
You're a genius. How does it work?
Do you know what a semiconductor is?
One who works part-time on a train?
Never mind!
-ls it hooked up yet?
-Almost.
In the meantime, check the messages to see if anyone called back.
I forgot.
You have one new message.
Tai, it's Matt. What's the big emergency?
Call me back.
I gotta go.
Grandma fell asleep on T.K. again.
Good old Matt.
I knew that somebody on the team would come through.
Matt, did you and T.K. bring your Digivices with you?
Did you pack them?
This is T.K., of course we have them.
What's going on?
An evil Digimon has taken over the Internet.
Agumon and Tentomon are fighting it, but they need help.
Get your Digivices to a computer as fast as you can.
What do we do now?
The closest thing our grandmother has to a computer is an egg timer.
We're going into town to find one.
The uplink's working. We're back online.
Now let's exterminate that bug.
He left the phone company.
Now where is he?
He sent another e-mail.
"I'm close to him"? Close to who?
-He's in America.
-He doesn't even have a green card.
-I said slow down!
-I can't hear you!
The Digimon's in New York.
He's eaten all the data at Kennedy Airport and is headed for the subway system.
Good, that'll slow him down for sure.
I'll e-mail Willis and let him know that lnfermon is heading his way.
I do have one question though:
What do you think that Digimon would be like if the virus never attacked him?
I have one too:
Why are you still drinking that junk?
Just 'cause you don't eat healthy, doesn't mean that I don't.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
-We've got the Digivices.
-Now what?
Awesome! We'll tell Gennai to upload
Gabumon and Patamon onto the Net.
You can do that?
That sounds like fun.
-Usually I just play Solitaire on that thing.
-Careful, Floyd, you almost cut my ear off.
Kids today are so smart, aren't they?
I still can't set the time on my VCR.
Matt, who are all those weird people?
They're not weird. They're my best friends.
Considering this is the only computer in town.
Gennai's transfer of the Digimon is almost completed.
Can I have yours?
You're the bravest kid I have ever known.
We're going back in.
I assume lzzy and Tai were unsuccessful in finding anyone else.
Then you and I'll have to try to beat that thing by ourselves.
-Sorry we're late.
-I was surfing the Net and I wiped out.
Gabumon and Patamon!
-ls T.K. on this ride?
-He's not tall enough.
Gabumon!
Patamon!
Say hello later. We've got work to do.
Keep your legs and wings inside the ride at all times.
Just a little further, guys. Remember, he's dangerous, so stay focused.
I'm looking for the programmer.
Don't interfere!
-He's teasing us.
-Then let's get him.
It's time to digivolve.
-Gabumon, warp digivolve to....
-Agumon, warp digivolve to....
WarGreymon.
MetalGarurumon.
-All right!
-Patamon, you better digivolve.
Patamon, digivolve to....
Infermon, digivolve to....
Diaboromon.
-What's going on?
-He digivolved.
Cable Crusher!
Look out, Patamon!
I'll save him.
-Patamon, are you all right?
-Tentomon!
I'm fine. What about Patamon?
Patamon, speak to me!
Come on, get up! Say something!
-I'm coming! I'll come get you!
-You can't.
But you can.
Wipe him out!
Ice Wolf Spikes!
Web Wrecker!
Tentomon, circle around!
WarGreymon, attack!
-It's no use.
-What are you saying? We're winning.
-This could be it.
-Great.
Not that!
-What's going on?
-There's something wrong with me.
-What is it?
-I think it's your mother's recipes.
I hate to tell you I told you so, but, I told you so!
Look, something's wrong.
Oh, no, they're slowing down.
Come on!
Tai, where'd you go?
WarGreymon has practically stopped moving.
Oh, no!
-I feel a lot better.
-I didn't touch anything, I swear!
-Tai, what did you do?
-lt wasn't my fault.
Who told you to go to the bathroom at such an important time?
Like I had a choice!
Why did you crash the computer?
Now it has to reboot.
-It's not like I did it on purpose.
-Just like it wasn't your fault with Sora.
That wasn't my fault.
Okay, maybe it was my fault.
What happened?
I gave her this great hairpin for her birthday.
Then she got mad and said,
"You don't like my hair style?"
I said "Who could tell?
You always wear a hat. "
Then she said, "Now you hate my hat?"
It's very confusing.
That's what you fought about?
I tried to apologize, but she won't return my phone calls.
We're back online.
WarGreymon!
Where were you?
You two picked a lousy time to take a lunch break!
What happened to him? WarGreymon!
Tai, I can't move!
I let him down. I should have been there.
-"Your Digimon's a loser."
-What did you say?
"How could two Mega-level Digimon get beat by one lousy bug?
"WarGreymon quit like a coward."
You take that back or I'll--
I was reading an e-mail from another kid.
You didn't have to read it so well.
You two, this isn't the time for fighting.
Stupid e-mails!
Go back to the beginning.
Diaboromon's back! Another e-mail?
"Who can count backwards from ten?"
Is he giving us a math test?
What's that?
What's with the timer?
He's making copies of himself.
He's multiplying.
It gets worse! The USA just launched two nuclear missiles.
Willis says the government can't explain it...
...but he knows Diaboromon's in the Pentagon's computers.
I hope I didn't lead him there with my satellite uplink.
One of the missiles is headed for Colorado.
-They'll land in less than ten minutes.
-That explains the timer.
But what's in Colorado?
I have no idea. In the meantime,
Diaboromon keeps multiplying.
The military has the power to stop it.
Every country is trying to intercept them, including Japan.
But Diaboromon has infiltrated all their computers...
...and is rerouting them to fall in the ocean near Hawaii.
Fireworks!
I've got the trajectory for the other missile.
Let me calculate it.
Four carry the two, times three....
It's aimed right for this neighborhood.
Look, e-mails from around the world:
"Get that evil Digimon.
You're our only hope."
Here's another: "Be home by 6:00."
Wait. That's from my mom.
I'm trying to save the world and you're reading fan mail.
-We just lost our connection.
-Great!
I'll get it back. If we defeat the original
Diaboromon, the rest will disappear.
What?
All we have to do is destroy each one, until we find the original.
Sounds great. How many are there so far?
Spit it out, lzzy. How many are there?
There are over 75,000 and counting!
What's that?
It didn't sound like my stomach.
-Tai! Have faith! I'll find the original.
-WarGreymon!
I'll help you.
MetalGarurumon.
They're so slow.
It's because of all the e-mails.
They're slowing down our Digimon processing speed.
I'll write to everyone to stop them e-mailing till the Digimon are strong again.
Are you crazy? Do you know how long that'll take? There's no time.
Now we're...
...just about...
-...finished.
-lt can't end like this.
Tell me, will they make it?
I'm not sure.
But they're gonna try.
Don't give up! No matter what happens, don't give up!
Don't interfere!
How many copies of Diaboromon are there now?
To be honest, I don't know.
I stopped keeping track a while ago.
It's got to be well over a million.
MetalGarurumon!
WarGreymon has started to slow down again.
It's the e-mails.
They're coming in faster than ever.
They're slowing down the processing speed even more.
They're sitting ducks out there.
Please, guys, stop writing!
I know your intentions are good, but you're hurting our cause.
Your e-mails are putting our Digimon in danger.
I've got to help.
There must be a way....
Somehow.
More juice, lzzy?
I just squeezed some onions.
No, thanks, I'm rerouting incoming data from the remote server into local memory.
I'll just leave you two alone.
Wait a minute, where did Tai go?
None of us are sure how, but Tai's bond with WarGreymon was so strong...
... Tai, himself, became digital.
WarGreymon, I'm here.
MetalGarurumon!
Wake up! Don't quit now!
-Why won't he answer me, Tai?
-Keep trying, Matt.
Listen, I don't have a whistle to wake you.
But I want you to know you're not alone.
The mail keeps coming. It won't stop.
Kids from all over the world are writing to you.
They need your help.
You're the only one who can do it.
Feel their hope. Feel their strength.
I feel them.
Where'd your brother go?
They combined.
Part WarGreymon.
Part MetalGarurumon.
They digivolved together to become....
Omnimon.
Transcendent Sword!
Hurry!
Supreme Cannon!
Tai, there's the original. Get him!
We're running out of time!
Omnimon! Quick, attack!
Where is he?
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
One minute to go.
Squad leader to Command, we were unable to destroy the target.
The missile will impact.
Repeat: The missile will impact.
He keeps moving.
Every time he's in our sights, he jumps somewhere else.
He's too fast for us.
We have the power to destroy him now, but we don't have the time.
Willis was right, we have to find some way to slow down Diaboromon.
Thirty seconds left.
The e-mails!
If I forward him all the e-mails, it'll slow him down, just like it did to us.
Keep sending them, kids.
You've got mail.
Ten seconds left.
Nine...
...eight...
...seven...
...six...
...five...
...four...
...three...
...two...
...one.
Connection terminated.
Willis!
Lousy microwave!
How come every electronic appliance has to have a bug in it?
Greetings.
You have one new piece of mail.
It's about time.
"Dear Sora: I'm sorry.... Threw up hat....
"What's a few raindrops between friends?
Love, Tai."
Stupid Tai!
I'm about to barf.
Wait till you try the cake.
When Willis saw what happened on the Internet...
...he was as happy as the rest of us.
So were the twins,
Terriermon and Kokomon.
They figured that would be the end of it.
But they were wrong.
It was just the beginning.
Kokomon!
Willis was about to face the Digibattle of his life.
But he was all alone.
These days the team is older, but some things never change.
Tai's still obsessed with soccer, and Sora 's still waiting for him to call.
Izzy's idea of a fun night is upgrading his computer...
...and Matt's trying to make it as a rock star.
His stage name is: "The DigiDestined formerly known as Matt. "
Even though the older kids don't have much time for the DigiWorld...
...there are new DigiDestined kids to pick up the slack.
That's Cody, a real sensitive little kid, and that's his Digimon: Upamon.
Yolei and Poromon can match wits with the best of them...
...as well as tan lines.
And there's Davis and DemiVeemon.
I know, Davis looks like my brother Tai.
They even have the same personality: obnoxious.
While they were having a good time at the beach...
...I was in New York with T.K...
...partly to visit Mimi and partly to make Davis jealous.
Smile!
Not again.
-lt didn't go through?
-No.
What's wrong with it?
I don't know. It says all lines are busy.
There must be an electrical surge.
What do you think we should do now, T.K.?
How about lunch?
Did you guys hear that?
Did we hear what?
I'm getting a feeling there's something strange out there...
...but I'm not sure what it is.
It needs our help though.
I hate it when I'm right.
It turned out that the person who needed our help was Willis.
Kokomon, this has to stop!
Go back!
What do you mean "back"? Back to what?
Destroy!
No!
Terriermon!
Bunny Blast!
Koko Krusher!
Bunny Blast!
Terriermon!
Hurry, T.K. It's over this way.
Kokomon, stop!
A Digimon!
I'm not sure it is a Digimon.
All right, tell me, what do you want?
Go back.
He vanished.
Hey, kid.
Come here.
Don't follow me! You're in danger!
Leave it to me.
I'll find out where he's going.
-What does he mean, "we're in danger"?
-All I know is he needs help.
Hi, Mom. Our summer camp is going backpacking in Colorado.
-We're leaving--
-Please deposit $2 for....
I'll call you when I get there.
Come on, Terriermon.
We have to find transportation.
I can't keep running from him.
We're going back.
Colorado? Why there?
I'm sending an e-mail to Davis and the others.
I told him to meet up with us.
We could really use their help, and I'm sure he misses me.
The D-Terminal!
"Found new kid with Digimon"?
Yeah, a new friend.
She wants us to meet them in Colorado.
Well, how does she expect us to get to America?
We don't have the money.
Willis, do we have to go to Colorado?
You heard what Kokomon said.
"Go back." That's where it all started.
But why do we have to walk?
My soles are worn out and I don't even wear shoes.
Terriermon, listen. We--
Come on, Willis, can't we just call for someone to give us a ride?
I'm sorry. You know
Kokomon's getting more violent.
He makes anyone close to us disappear.
I'll find us a ride.
-Let's get out of this sun. It's too hot.
-Wait!
What exactly do you think you're doing?
This way I don't have to walk, and you can stay in the shade.
That's better.
I don't suppose you could turn into a glass of lemonade, could you?
Look, my Digivice.
What's happening to the train?
I don't think this is the entertainment portion of the trip.
It's that Digimon we saw in New York.
Don't interfere!
There's definitely something different about this Digimon.
We're not moving. Where are we?
Don't interfere?
I don't think that Digimon wants us in Colorado.
Explain one more time why we have to stop in three different cities?
We're using my uncle's flyer miles and restrictions apply.
Why did we have to take this particular taxi company?
I've an uncle who lives in Houston.
He has an account with them.
-It's not really that bad.
-At least it's free.
What do you say, guys, wanna hear some music?
Sure, why not?
We prefer something on the slow and easy side.
Sure.
I'm pretty good.
'Bye, Uncle Fred.
Thanks for the lift. Goodbye.
Yolei, your uncle's a lousy pilot.
On the map, we're abut 60 miles from where we're meeting Kari.
-How do we get there?
-I have an uncle who owns some horses.
No! No more uncles, no more horses, no trains, no planes.
It's got to stop!
Did someone say stop?
Come on, guys, this is our chance.
Well, at least my way we weren't stowaways.
-Climb in. It's perfect.
-Let me handle this.
Yeah, ma'am, I said stop. I'm starting my own truck stop and was testing it.
It seems to work fine.
You stopped. Thanks.
-Let's go.
-Come on.
Hey, pal, you must've had the same idea we did.
Hey, would you cut that out? That's rude.
Sorry about that. He's young.
Davis, guess what? He's a Digimon.
A what?
Hey, he's right.
Wow! In America, they have Digimon by the truck load.
Our Digimon like each other.
And the guy says,
"l was talking to the duck."
This is kind of nice, being around others for a change.
Yeah, for as long as I can remember, it's just been me and Willis.
Having a Digimon makes you a DigiDestined...
...and we're all part of a team.
Why are you alone?
Well, let's just say I have my reasons.
Anyway, it's nice meeting someone as cute as you.
Back off there, blondie.
What's wrong, Davis?
Did I say something wrong?
We found this kid. Now what do we do?
He's angry because he wanted to be with Kari by now.
My family's vacation home is just a couple of towns away from here.
You guys can wait for them there if you want to.
I'd better e-mail Kari and T.K. to tell them where to meet us.
-Where are they coming from?
-From New York.
The kids behind the fence.
That girl was cute, too.
That's it, lover-boy. Leave Kari out of this.
I'm sorry.
Listen, Davis,
I wasn't trying to step on anybody's toes.
Maybe I should just make a phone call and get us a lift to my house.
I'd like a pizza for delivery with mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni...
...pineapple, Canadian bacon, anchovies, and green peppers.
That sounds delicious, but aren't you going to have anything?
If Davis eats it all....
-There's no fat below my neck.
-Since you're delivering that pizza...
...to my house, would you mind picking us up on the way?
-Tell him to forget it. I want Chinese.
-Shut up!
I said, "Line up."
We'll line up on the side of the road with a sign, so we're easy to spot.
-You've done this before.
-They'll be here in two minutes or it's free.
-Willis, you're smart.
-Well, it was mostly my idea.
Great, then you're buying the pizza!
-Pizza!
-Guys, come on, let's go!
-Why do I have to be the one paying for it?
-It's your pie. You buy.
Don't open your big mouth unless it's to eat pizza.
If I'm paying for it, I get the first half.
And I get the second half, too.
Now that that's settled,
I guess we're ready to go.
We'll tell you how the pizza tasted.
If that driver thinks he's getting a tip, forget it!
What is it?
Davis!
Destroy!
Kokomon.
You know this Digimon?
DemiVeemon, quick, digivolve!
DemiVeemon, digivolve to....
Veemon!
Vee Head Butt!
How about a little teamwork?
Pick me up. We'll attack him from the air.
All right, we've got you!
Watch out for that sign.
Time for plan B.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Flamedramon, attack!
Fire Rocket!
One small detail.
Who is that? And why is he attacking us?
Cable Crusher!
Koko Krusher!
Kokomon, I'm doing what you want.
I'm going back.
Go back...
...to the beginning!
Willis, use your Digivice.
I feel strange.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
He's got pants now.
Bunny Bubble!
Gargo Pellets!
Go back.
-What for?
-Go back.
He put up a good fight, but we won.
We didn't win anything.
He won't stop until I give him what he wants.
What does he want? Maybe I can help.
Don't ask questions.
It's for your own good.
-The less you know the better.
-Willis, wait.
We're a team now.
It's okay to tell them the truth.
Well, the truth is, we don't have a ride anymore.
No problem. I can handle that.
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Raidramon! The Storm of Friendship!
-Did somebody call for a ride?
-That's cool.
Couldn't you have done that before?
Can we get a ride, too?
Sorry, we're on a mission.
-It's a big gust of wind.
-No, it's Davis.
Same difference.
How do you stop this thing?
So, this Kokomon attacked you?
I knew we shouldn't have split up.
Where are your friends T.K. and Kari?
They're still not here yet.
What? What do you mean,
Kari's not here yet?
Good question.
They really should have been here by now.
If I know Kokomon, your friends aren't coming at all.
That's it, pal.
Enough secrets.
You seem to know a lot about this monster.
Spill it. How do you two know each other?
And more importantly:
Why is he only attacking you?
Because I created him.
You must be kidding.
You just can't create a Digimon out of thin air.
I've told you too much already.
Kokomon makes everyone who tries to help me disappear...
...Iike I'll bet he did to your friends T.K. and Kari.
Willis.
I have to do this by myself.
I need to be alone.
Great, I'll go with you.
Willis, we've been walking for hours and you haven't said a word.
Being a DigiDestined means you don't have to face things alone.
What are you running away from?
Eight years ago, a DigiEgg came out of my computer...
...and it hatched into twin Digimon:
Terriermon and Kokomon.
I finally had someone to play with.
My very own pets, and they talked, too!
It was the best.
They depended on me.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Sometimes they would even do my chores for me.
I wanted more of them...
...so I got the stupid idea of creating a DigiEgg on the computer.
That's when it all went bad.
Before my DigiEgg hatched, it was attacked by a virus...
...and it mutated into Diaboromon.
When Tai and the others destroyed him,
I thought my bad dream was over.
But the real nightmare was just beginning.
The virus tracked us down and dragged Kokomon away from me.
I watched helplessly for four years as he slowly became this terrible monster.
And now he's obsessed with chasing me.
During the battle he said to you,
"Go back to the beginning."
What did he mean?
I think he wanted me to come here where it all started.
Every time he tries to tell me why, the virus stops him.
He can't fight it.
This won't end until he's destroyed.
But I can't do it. It's all my fault, not his.
What's the matter with you?
That's the saddest story I ever heard.
I'm the one with the problem, not you.
-Get over it.
-Okay.
That was fast.
You know what? We're gonna help you.
You will? How are you gonna do that?
My friend, we're DigiDestined.
We'll find the answer together, as a team.
I've never been on a team.
Anything I should know?
Yeah, I'm the only one who can kiss Kari.
-Just a little one?
-Don't even joke around about this, got it?
-She and I really hit it off in New York.
-I'm not kidding.
Willis?
I don't mean to eavesdrop, but I've got really big ears.
I know you're facing Kokomon tomorrow.
I want to be right there next to you.
I couldn't live with myself if something were to happen to you.
This is my mistake and I won't risk your safety to correct it.
-He's my brother.
-I don't care!
Willis, I'm not your pet. I'm your friend.
And friends are always there for each other.
Now that's what I'm talking about: teamwork.
Thanks, pal.
Okay, let's find Kokomon.
Don't worry. He'll find us.
Go back!
I did! I'm here! What else do you want?
Destroy!
He has a lot of issues.
He's digivolving.
Terriermon, be careful. He's stronger now.
Terriermon, digivolve to....
Gargomon!
Veemon, your turn.
Show him what you're made of!
Veemon, armor digivolve to....
Flamedramon, the Fire of Courage!
Armadillomon, you too!
Armadillomon, armor digivolve to....
Digmon, the Drill of Power!
Hawkmon, go for it!
Hawkmon, armor digivolve to....
Halsemon, the Wings of Love!
Fire Rocket!
That's the way!
I'll trip him up. Almost tripped myself.
Gargo Pellets!
Don't make me do this.
How do you like your Kokomon, flame-broiled or grilled?
Can't we end this quickly?
After all, I'm on vacation.
Howdy.
Aren't our Digimon fantastic?
Digmon could be a little more animated.
I guess that's it.
I don't think he's gone.
Now what?
I'm not a duck.
I need a nap.
I think I strained something trying to digivolve.
We're being sucked in.
This is my fault.
Why? Are you the one who taught him to juggle?
Put us down, you clown!
-Leave them alone! Take me instead.
-Okay.
Watch out!
What do we have to do to end this fighting?
Destroy!
Bunny Blast!
A little help here.
Veemon!
Let me help you up.
Now let me help you up.
-Hawkmon, I'll help you.
-No need. I'm--
Oh, Hawkmon, I'm so glad you're not hurt.
Yes, I know, but you don't have to choke me to prove it.
Armadillomon!
Cody, I've been digging all over for you.
Vee Head Butt!
Bunny Blast!
Bombs away!
-We got him!
-Think again.
He's gonna eat us.
Hand of Fate!
Angemon!
And Angewomon!
You saved us! Exquisite timing.
Sorry we're late.
-Hey, look, T.K.
-Kari!
We would've been here sooner, but our plans got derailed.
Yeah! Kari, you made it!
Gatomon and Patamon were worried.
So they digivolved into Angewomon and Angemon.
Celestial Arrow!
Angel Staff!
Either this is an eclipse, or we're in trouble.
-I'm not supposed to be out after dark.
-It's cold.
Look, his wounds are healing.
It's got to be that virus inside of him.
Poromon, there's nothing you can do.
Stay here.
Let me go!
Davis, what's happening to you?
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size, you big bully?
Kokomon is making time go backwards.
Everyone's getting younger.
Davis, you're a baby.
Who are you calling a baby, you baby?
I'm a baby, look!
"Back to the beginning"?
Willis, "Back to the beginning" didn't mean go back to Colorado.
It means, go back in time to when the virus first attacked Kokomon.
-That's it.
-We have to stop him.
Before you know it, we'll be changing diapers.
Let me go!
I'm sorry but you're grounded.
We don't have the strength to defeat him.
The new Digimon will have to use the power of the golden DigiEggs.
We must digivolve to our Mega forms to release the golden DigiEggs.
Angemon, warp digivolve to....
Seraphymon!
Angewomon, digivolve to....
Magnadramon!
Aren't they beautiful?
Hurry, here he comes.
We released the golden DigiEggs.
Now the others can golden armor digivolve.
This is our last shot.
-What do I do with this?
-Just do exactly what I do.
You ready?
Golden armor energize!
Golden armor energize!
Veemon, golden armor digivolve to....
Terriermon, golden armor digivolve to....
Magnamon!
Rapidmon!
Is that the coolest thing you've ever seen, or what?
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
-lt didn't work.
-He's too strong.
Every time we attack, he regenerates.
Let's blast him from the inside.
Good idea. Follow me!
He ate them. Terriermon!
Listen to me, Poromon.
You have to give it time to heal, okay?
Time to heal.
What's that up ahead?
I don't know. Look!
What's he doing?
He's trying to tell us something.
-What's he pointing to?
-There must be something inside of him.
The virus!
He's trying to show us how to help him.
What does he want us to do?
Destroy!
Destroy the virus!
Right. Time to heal.
Rapid Fire!
Magna Blast!
Kokomon!
Willis!
The virus, it's all gone.
Thank you.
Now I've lost both of them.
You'll never lose me, Willis.
I told you, I'm your friend.
Friends are always there for each other.
Terriermon!
I guess without the virus,
Kokomon couldn't heal himself anymore.
The battle was too much for him.
Don't be sad, Willis.
One thing you have to learn about Digimon, they never really die.
Thanks for coming back to New York with me. I'm gonna miss you guys.
-I think we'll see each other again.
-I sure hope so.
We're getting used to being part of a team.
Right, Terriermon?
Yeah.
One last thing. 'Bye.
Hey, what did I tell you about kissing Kari?
She's my girl.
What do you mean "your" girl?
Nothing, just guy talk.
Hi, Mom, I'm on the island.
I'm waiting for the ferry and I'll be home.
Yeah, I had a lot of fun. It was a great trip.
I met a lot of new friends.
I had a couple of fights, but I'll tell you later.
Yeah, I miss you, too.
Does anyone besides me smell a DigiEgg?
Kokomon!
Like I said, Willis learned about teamwork the hard way.
He also found out that Davis was right.
Digimon never really die.
Their information just gets reconfigured.
Only sometimes they come back singing a different tune.
He's tone-deaf.
^ xSilver ^
Aah! lt's love, isn't it?
Sometimes you walk into a house and you take one look around , and you know.
And you say, ''This is for me.''
Oh , l think it's perfect. lt's just what we've been looking for.
There aren't enough plugs.
Hey, wait, Mr. Coleman , now.
That place l showed you on Sycamore Street was absolutely, positively loaded with plugs.
That's right.
There were plenty.
But the steps were too high .
When we get older, we could trip.
Every house we look at you find something to pick at. l just know what l like.
Would you like a divorce?
'Cause l'll bring it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
No need for that. l'm gonna find this house for you . l am committed to finding the perfect house for you. l don't care how long it takes.
Because at Evers & Evers, we want you to be happy forevers and evers.
Oh , excuse me one second .
Let me take this call.
Sorry. l'm so sorry.
Hello. Evers & Evers
Real Estate. Jim Evers.
Hey, honey. How's it going?
Do they like the house?
Yes, this house is still available.

Hey, sign this!
Okay, Jim.
-Sorry about that.

Okay.
Bye-bye.
Oh, excuse me.
Did l hear you correctly?
Did you just sell their house? l sure did .
'Cause we're looking to buy.
Honey, forgive me.
Well, l'm Jim Evers of Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Tell me about your dream house.
Hi, Sara.
My name's Teddy.
Your husband told me to tell you he loves you very much, but sometimes he loses track of the time. l'm sorry l'm late.
Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Yes.
Look at what he brought you.
Look at that. lsn't that pretty?
Oh, you know, you have a wonderful husband that thinks about you like that on your anniversaries.
You're so fortunate! lt's beautiful. lt's actually Teddy's fault that l'm late.
He had a little accident in the backseat, cotton all over the place, but l cleaned it up. lt's okay. l forgive Teddy.
Hey, come on, Sara.
Don't be like that. l'm on a roll here.
We sold seven houses this month.
What about the three soccer games, two birthday parties, and barbecue you missed?
Did l miss that much stuff this month?
Okay. We're gonna take off this weekend .
What?
We're gonna take off and go down to the lake like we did last year with the kids for the whole weekend .
-How's that sound?
-Can we really close on this?
Yes. How about this?
We can close on this.
How about this?
Close on that.
Let me go tell the kids.
All right?
Okay. All right.
Megan and Michael , big family adventure!
Hey!
Michael Jordan Evers!
Aah! Aah!
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Dad ! There's a...
-What is it?
-There's a spider in my room!
-There's a what?
There's a spider in my room on the window.
Why don't you kill it, man?
That's a big spider!
Come on . lt's just a spider, Michael.
How big could it be?
What is this?
Where's the spider at?
What? Man, you're acting like it's Mothra. lt's just a spider.
You're making a big deal out of nothing, Michael .
You're 10 years old . lt's time l teach you how to kill a spider the right way.
The most efficient way to crush a spider.
You got to get a good magazine.
Doesn't matter what you use.
Some people like to use ''Life'' or ''Time'' or...
This is my ''Sports lllustrated''
Swimsuit Edition.
What are you doing with it?
-l don't know.
-Yeah, right. lf you can look at this, you should have enough courage to kill a spider the right way.
So l'm gonna roll this up so you get a good grip on it.
You get a bead on the spider.
You get a side swing.
That's where you can really get some good action going.
You want to come across like that so you really crush it.
You come across this way so you get his whole escape route in case he try to go...
You take it, and you whack it.
Go on.
Whack the spider. l don't want to whack it.
Come on, you got to whack the spider, Mike. Whack it.
Dad, l'm afraid of spiders. l can't whack it.
Let me explain something to you .
All your life you're gonna be facing spiders, okay? l am?
What l'm trying to say is you should never be afraid .
People know, they use that against you . l'm not scared of anything . l'm your dad, right?
You're my son .
You whack that spider. l can't whack the spider, Dad.
Come on . Whack it.
You can do it. Whack the spider.
-l don't want to whack it.
-Yes, you can . Come on.
Kill the spider.
Kill the spider.
Dad, l can't crush it. l can't whack it!
Hey.
There.
Happy?
No, l'm not happy, Megan . l was trying to make a point about how it's important to whack your own spiders!
Whatever.
Mm-hmm.
Past the Old Miller Road.
Okay. Great. lt is an old home, Ms. Evers.
And my employer is anxious to move on.
Would it be possible for you to come alone to discuss the situation?
But my husband and l work as a team.
The master usually does not take visitors.
However, from your photograph, he thought you to have a trustworthy face.
About your husband , he felt differently.
Oh .
You got our flyer.
The master had wished to meet you tomorrow evening.
Oh , l'm so sorry.
But tomorrow l've got plans that can't be broken.
Who is that?
-Excuse me a second .
-Who is that?
Just someone calling about repping a house.
What's the address?
Where is it?
Sara, do you know where this place is?
The places up here are big multimillion-dollar mansions.
This could be big.
And what about our big family adventure?
JlM: lt's just a little detour.
How long is it gonna take?
No more than 20 minutes.
20 minutes tops.
You kids should be excited.
You're gonna see Mommy and Daddy in real-estate action.
Somebody's calling me.
Who's calling me?
Hello. Jim Evers,
Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Stan , how you doing?
What's the latest?
Really?
The Selmer property?
Tomorrow?
Wow. l'm kind of out of town right now.
Hey. But, hey, listen .
Maybe l could come back early.
Oh, no. l can't come back early.
No, l can't come back early.
Maybe we should just take care of this on Monday.
All right?
Monday?
Monday sounds fantastic.
Okay. l'll talk to you on Monday.
We're gonna talk on Monday.
Are we still in America?
Here it is, right here.
Okay? All right?
Yeah, that's a whole lot of gate.
They must have a big possum problem down here.
That's some big possum.
Didn't they know we were coming?
Of course they knew.
Maybe there's a call box or something.
Hello?!
Hello!
The Evers are here!
Yes, we're here now!
Nobody's answering.
Now l got to get out in the dirt with my brand-new shoes on.
Wow.
How are we gonna get in?
What if you give me a boost, and l'll go around the back?
They're probably old .
We'll surprise them.
You'll probably kill them.
Let's just go. lt's getting late.
You know, Sara, you give up too easy.
You got to be more patient.
The Evers way is to be patient.
All right.
We're in business.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's do this.
Wow.
Bob Vila would have a field day with this place.
Hey, Megan , don't slam the door like that. lt's very sensitive. lt's a car, Dad.
Ah ! lt's not just a car. lt's a very delicate piece of machinery.
Shh . She didn't mean what she just said.
She didn't mean that.
Come on .
Let's see what's around back. l'm getting hungry.
Me too.
Don't worry.
We'll be 20 minutes tops.
Hey, Dad , when we get to the lake, can l go to that pizza shop where l ate that whole pizza, and when we got to the cabin, l threw up and you still saw the pepperoni chunks in it?
Yeah , we can go there if we can avoid a repeat performance.
Wow.
Now, that's something you don't see every day.
Oh, my God.
Dead people?
Hey, honey.
You know they have, uh , dead people in the backyard?
Well , some people have pools.
Some people have private cemeteries. lt happens.
You're gonna sell a house with this?
This historical sprawling manor with spacious grounds? Yes.
Hey, that's good .
We'll put that on the listing.
And leave out all the dead people?
We'll just stick to the bright side.
Oh, no. l got my good suit on.
Oh.
You think it's gonna stop?
Oh , l hope it's not raining at the lake.
When you're at work with Mommy and Daddy, you're always on your best behavior, right?
Okay.
Whoo!
Look at the size of these knockers.
Ever see anything like that before?
Hello?!
Evers Real Estate!
Evers Real Estate!
Hello? ls anybody home?
Hello?
We're the Evers from
Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Hi!
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Never.
Sara, this puts us in a whole new league.
Smells like Grandma's house.
Worse.
Smells like Grandma.
This place is just a little dusty.
We'll get a cleaning crew to come out here and shine it up.
This place would be sparkling from top to bottom.
Mom, this place has spiders.
Sara Evers.
Yes, l'm Sara.
My name is Ramsley.
Hello, Ramsley. l'm Jim Evers of Evers & Evers Real Estate at your service.
We were not expecting ...others.
Yes, we were on our way out of town .
Yeah, then when we realized the enormity and complexity of your unique estate, we wanted to commit the full resources of Evers & Evers Real Estate.
At Evers & Evers, we want you to be happy forevers and evers.
Please accept this waterproof calendar as a token of our appreciation.
Very well.
We shall have to place other settings.
Who do you have the settings for?
Master Gracey wishes to discuss his affairs over dinner.
Oh, l'm afraid we have plans.
Honey, we can't stay for dinner.
Oh, yes.
But we mustn't be rude, darling.
What about our family adventure?
Yeah, Dad.
We'll just have some soup, and then we'll get going, okay?
All right?
Wow.
Wow.
Nice.
Very nice.
Good job.
Good job.
Hey, Megan, how'd you like to eat like this every day at home?
The master will be with you shortly.
Carry on. l said, ''Carry on.''
He walks off.
Have you ever seen a fireplace this amazing? lncredible.
Ah , we could have one heck of a wienie roast in that thing, huh?
Seriously.
Look at this detail. l've never seen anything like this.
-Haven't you?
My grandfather spared no expense when he built this mansion.
Well , your grandfather had really good taste in tchotchkes. l'm Jim Evers of Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Charmed to make your acquaintance, sir.
Edward.
Edward Gracey.
Uh, this is my wife, Sara.
You want to come meet
Mr. Gracey?
Very nice to meet you ,
Mr. Gracey.
And this is our daughter, Megan , and our son , Michael.
You have very beautiful children , Ms. Evers. l kicked in some chromosomes, too.
Children.
Madam .
Oh. Nice.
Okay.
Thank you .
The master was very pleased when he heard you could come on such short notice.
Normally we would not have called you here so abruptly.
But we had no other choice.
What do you got, termites or something?
Big house like this must have a lot of termites.
No. But lately there have been more...disturbances.
What do you think of the house, Ms. Evers?
Oh. l think it's absolutely incredible.
The ltalian influence.
The Renaissance style of the molding.
The attention to detail is stunning.
You never see houses like this.
Or at least l don't.
Great care and love went into the building of this mansion.
This house is my inheritance.
My birthright.
But lately it's become too much to bear.
Tell me, Mr. Evers.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Ghosts?
Yeah. Sure. l believe in ghosts. Yeah . l don't think it's a good idea to put that on the listing.
You should talk about how many bathrooms are in the house.
People love bathrooms.
We should play up the toilet angle and leave out ghosts. l think that'd be best.
The storm has swollen the river.
How's that?
The storm has flooded the road. l'm afraid there will be no leaving the mansion tonight.
What?
Of course you are all more than welcome to spend the night here.
Oh, no. l really don't think we should.
We've got plans. l'm afraid there's no other way.
Ramsley will show you to your rooms. l believe the children will be comfortable in this room.
Yeah.
Real homey.
You'll be fine.
Wow.
Hey, listen .
When you flush the toilet, check and see how quickly it refills.
Good night, Dad.
Good night. l hope you and the madame will find this room to your liking.
Yeah. lt's great. lt'll be like spending the night in a fine hotel.
Will there be anything else that you require, sir?
Are you gonna get us some chocolates?
Pardon?
You know, the little chocolates they put on the hotel pillows.
Sometimes they have chocolates on the pillow.
They have little chocolates on the pillows... to have.
What's the problem? ln the first place, we weren't even supposed to be here.
We were supposed to be at the lake.
What am l supposed to do, control the weather now, Sara?
That's not the point.
You couldn't resist.
You just had to come.
Excuse me. This is a big opportunity for all of us.
Not for us, for you.
The only thing you seem to care about anymore is work.
Oh, but when l'm working hard , it doesn't matter as long as l'm bringing you home expensive gifts, right?
Hey, what are you ...
Hey, Sara.
Hey, Sara, l didn't mean to say that, okay?
Sara.
Come on.
Stop it.
Sara.
Sara. l'm sorry about that, honey.
Can you open up, please?
Aah!
Ooh.
You scared me.
-Pardon the intrusion, sir.
-Yes.
The master was wondering if he might have a word with you in the library.
A word? Okay. l'd love to have a word with him.
Sure.
Let's go talk some turkey.
Yes. Turkey.
-Very good, sir.
-Yeah. lf you will kindly follow me.
Yeah. Of course.
Of course.
Hey, Sara, l'm gonna have a word with Mr. Gracey. l'll be back in a minute.
Ramsley, l was just wondering.
Have you ever been to a tanning salon? l've got a friend who's got a really great place.
You can get a really smooth tan.
Do something about that ashy white look. l'm sure the ladies would love it.
Yes.
Sounds wonderful .
Would you care for a drink, sir, while you're waiting?
Yeah. Don't mind if l do.
Thank you , Ramsley.
Oh, wow!
Now, that's class.
That's what l need to do.
Get a big picture of myself to put on the living room wall.
Adds a touch of elegance to the room.
Yes, sir.
Very elegant.
Thank you .
Thank you so much , Ramsley.
Mmm.
So, Ramsley, how long you been a butler?
A long time.
What are the most important qualifications in case l might be doing some interviewing?
Attending to every detail.
Understanding priorities.
And above all, knowing one's place.
What does your boss like to do?
What's he into?
You know, what floats his boat?
The master likes a great many things.
Art, literature, beauty.
And all that stuff about ghosts.
Did he get, like, a bad clam in his jambalaya one night?
You don't believe in ghosts, sir?
Absolutely not.
Let me tell you something.
The way l see it, you only go around the track once.
So you do it full-out all the way around.
Mr. Evers, may l confide in you?
Please do.
The master is not well.
He must leave this house,
Mr. Evers.
He must move on. lt is of the gravest importance, l assure you.
Or l fear the very worst. l can't believe this.
Still no reception.
We had to take that little detour.
20 minutes tops.
Yeah, right.
Do you think it's gonna stop raining soon?
How should l know? l'm not the weatherman.
Hmm.
Stogies.
Not bad.
Not at all .
Hold onto that.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Wonderful.
Must be nice.
Must be really nice. l tell ya.
Ahh.
Hmm.
Hello there, good man .
Ramsley, fix the gentleman a drink.
Nigel , l just recently returned from the Continent, where l found the most interesting book.
Yes, it was called
''Raising the Dead.''
Oh! Oh, cripes.
Oh. l hope that doesn't stain.
Oh.
Wow. lnteresting.
Wow.
Wow. l wonder where this leads to.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, open this back up!
Hey, open up!
Ramsley!
Ramsley!
Push back the head !
Hey, will somebody push the head back?
Megan!
What do you think it is? lt's a ghost ball. l think it wants us to follow it. l think you're crazy. lt does. lt wants us to follow it.
Hey, Megan , wait up!
Where's that scary albino when you need him?
Oh.
Hello.
Have you seen my husband?
Excuse me.
Wait!
Wait!
Oh, Ramsley. lt's you.
May l help you?
Yes. l was just looking for my husband.
Ah, indeed. l left him in the library.
Right through there.
Honey, it's late.
Let's not fight anymore.
Come to bed?
Oh ! l'm sorry. l thought you were my husband.
Can l help you with that?
Ramsley hates it when l leave things lying about.
Yes.
He seems a bit proper.
He strikes most people that way.
Once you get to know him , you'll find that's not the case.
But he's really...
He's really very sweet.
Thank you.
He's been like a father to me.
Mr. Gracey, may l ask you something?
Yes. Of course.
Anything.
This house. lt's been in your family for generations. lt's your home.
Why do you want to sell it?
These walls are filled with so many memories.
Some of them painful. l think for you to understand , l really must show you. lt's all right.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Although it might be a bit worn and faded from its original grandeur, this house was once filled with so many things.
So much life.
With grand parties, dancing, laughter, and, above all, hope.
Being a Gracey meant that you were denied nothing.
The world was yours.
What happened here, Mr. Gracey?
She did.
Who?
Elizabeth.
Hers is the story that haunts these walls.
Come on.
Megan, wait.
You don't know the last time that thing's been inspected.
Would you just relax?
Where's your sense of adventure?
This is against all my better judgment.
Hi! ls anyone home?
Those must be termites.
Some big-ass termites.
That's all.
Hello?
-Oh!
Oh.
Aah! Aah!
Megan!
Mom.
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here!
This is unspeakable!
Unspeakable! You have to leave!
-Who is that?
-That's none of your business.
Now, come on. Get out of here. lt's way past your bedtime.
Her name was Elizabeth.
Are you kids hungry?
Does anybody want a cookie?
Cookies?!
Don't offer them cookies!
They're trespassers!
Trespassers don't get cookies!
This is none of their concern . lt is their concern!
They're involved!
Hide! Hide!
The children are not in their room.
Have you seen them?
Children?
What children?
What children?
Her children.
The children she wasn't supposed to bring.
Along with that brainless husband of hers.
Thank you. lf l had to listen to another word from that insufferable fool, l think l would have burst.
Of course, sir.
What a fool!
Did l not tell her to come alone? ls it really too much to ask for a little cooperation?
A little order?
Of course not, sir. lf you find the children , bring them to me.
-Certainly, sir.
-Yes, sir.
The final arrangements have been made.
Nothing further will interfere with the master's plan.
Thank God l heard your voice. l lost my way. l don't know how to get out of here. l'm sorry if l sound a little frazzled. l just had myself a little freak show back there. lt's time to respond. l was supposed to meet with Mr. Gracey.
But l got stuck in the wall.
Goblins and ghoulies from last Halloween, awaken the spirits with your tambourine.
Okay, l hear you, but l don't see you. Where are you? l am Madame Leota, seer of all, voice to the spirits.
Whom do you seek?
Hey! Hey!
Hey, let me out of here!
Silence!
Whom do you seek? l am seeking a way out of here.
Then you must look within. l don't want to look within . l want to look without.
There is great evil in this house.
A devil's curse. lt seeks to destroy you.
Why would something seek to destroy me? l'm just here to sell the house.
Dark spirits from the grave, come forth.
Lift us from the black and show us.
Show us the way back.
Dark spirits?
Hey, no dark spirits.
Don't you make no dark spirits come out.
Lift us.
Lift us up to the light.
And lead us through this stormy night.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey!
Hey, l'd really like to stay on the ground. l'd rather stay on the ground .
Can l stay on the ground?
Evil and darkness have fallen this night.
But now to survive, you must gain new sight. l must first gain new underwear.
Only the light will lead the way.
Follow it and find your way home.
There's no place like home.
There's no place like home.
Go, Mr. Evers.
Your family is at stake.
Your very life is at stake.
Break the curse.
There is no escape for you unless you lift this spell.
Go.
Save yourself.
Save your family.
Release her.
Release us all! l'm getting so queasy. l'm getting very queasy.
Oh !
Aah! Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
-Dad!
-Dad!
Hey!
Michael and Megan, you okay?
We're fine, thanks.
Get your things.
Let's get out of here.
We have a problem.
Because of the rain?
We're gonna get a little wet.
Let's just find your mom and get out of here. l'm afraid that's not possible.
She can't leave.
And why not?
Because she can't! lf l could tell you, l would.
But l can't, so l won't, okay?
Hey, how'd you ...
Hey, look.
Come on.
Daddy's having more hallucinations. Let's go.
-They're ghosts, Dad .
-They're not ghosts.
We're just having hallucinations from that dinner we ate. lt was that chicken . lt didn't taste right.
-Oh!
-lt's not the chicken!
All right. lt's not the chicken.
But we're getting out of here.
But we have to help them.
You can't help the dead, honey.
They're beyond help.
The man's talking sense.
Everyone should keep their noses in their own business.
But we have to help them break the curse.
Why is everybody talking about a curse?
Have you been talking to that crazy green gypsy in the giant paperweight?
We've got to go back to see her.
-No back. l'm not going back.
-But, Dad!
They had me floating all around the room.
Hey, l was strapped to a chair, floating around the room with a marching band chasing me. l'm not going back anywhere!
Forget it, Casper!
But Mom's in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
She died here in this house.
She was so very young.
So very beautiful.
She was in love with the heir to this mansion.
Your grandfather.
And he loved her more than life itself.
But they were from different worlds and couldn't be together.
How did she die, Mr. Gracey?
She took her own life.
Poison.
After that, his life became unbearable.
And so, without hope, without love, without Elizabeth, he hung himself.
His soul wanders these halls, waiting for her to return. lf you listen carefully, you can still hear the beating of his broken heart.
Wait a minute.
Hold it a second.
You're telling me this guy is dead and the reason we were brought here is he wants to try to get jiggy with my wife?
Pretty much.
Are you upset?
The guy is dead , and he's trying to get with my wife!
And the house isn't really for sale!
Yes, l'm upset!
Oh, Madame Leota, is it her? ls she truly our dear, departed
Elizabeth come back to us? lt is true.
She walks these halls.
You see? l told you it is her!
But do not be deceived.
All things are not as they appear.
For the curse to be lifted , the truth must be known.
And for the truth to be known , you must find the key.
What are you talking about, ball lady? What key?
Enter the tomb under the great dead oak and travel down deep under the ground.
And there you will find the key that must be found.
Find the black crypt that bears no name, or soon your fate will be the same.
You're telling me all l have to do is find this key, then l'm gonna walk out of here with my wife and kids?
The key is the answer to all .
Well, great. l'm in .
Let's get this key.
There's only one problem.
How do we get out of here?
Yeah, how do we get out of here?
Well, there's always, uh , my way.
Hey! l thought you said you could drive this thing!
Don't you worry. l know exactly what l'm doing.
-Aah!
-Aah!
Well, you better just keep your eyes on the road!
-Move over!
-What are you doing? lf you keep driving , you'll kill us all!
That's where you're wrong.
Because some of us are already dead!
Dad, look.
Ready?
Fire!
Dad?
Yes, son? l see dead people.
Excuse me.
Why are all these ghosts still hanging around here?
When they died , they couldn't find the light.
And now...
Now they're trapped.
Doomed to wander the Earth for all eternity.
Nice.
Nice job.
Whoa!
Okay.
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Can they see us?
No.
Of course not.
Yes, l can. l'm looking at you right now in your stupid hat.
Don't listen to him.
He's lying.
Whatever. Come on, kids.
Let's go. Come on. l could swear he was looking right at me.
He's psychic.
This was to have been her wedding dress.
Oh, it's lovely. lt would have been lovelier if she'd had a chance to wear it.
Now it serves only as a dark reminder of what could have been.
To love someone so much and then lose them so suddenly. l can't imagine how awful that must be. lf you truly love someone, they never leave you.
They remain in your heart forever. lsn't that romantic?
He was willing to throw everything away for love.
Well, now he's broke, dead , and cursed. Nice move.
-Oh, crap!
These are my new shoes.
Hey, kids, watch your step.
-Oh, crap!
Hey, Michael, don't say ''crap.''
All right.
Where is this place?
Okay, where are we? l think the gypsy lady said something about making a left at an oak.
Okay.
Well , glad she was so specific.
What is that?
Do you hear that?
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
# And harmonize #
# When we ghosts come out
to socialize #
# Doom, doom, doom, doom #
# When the cryptos creak
and the tombstones quake #
# Spooks come out
for a swinging wake #
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.
But we were wondering if you happen to know where the mausoleum was.
# Down by the #
# Old mill stream #
# Where l first met you #
No, no. l think they said it was an old oak.
That's what they said . lt's by the...
# By the light #
# By the light,
by the light #
# Of the silvery moon #
Yeah. You sound really good .
Your harmony's tight.
But we're trying to find my wife. She'll be...
# Comin' 'round the mountain
when she comes #
# She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain... #
Listen, guys. l'm trying to find a key. l'm trying to find a key...
# Where's the key?
Where's the key? #
# Where's the beautiful key? #
# Find the key, find the key #
# Oh, how happy you'll be #
The key that l'm trying to find is in the mausoleum.
The key is in the mausoleum.
# You left your key #
# ln a mausoleum #
# Down in Dixie #
Dad, there it is!
- # Dad, there it is #
-Thanks.
- # Dad, there it is #
-Thanks for nothing.
Okay.
We made it.
All right, kids.
Stay close.
Hey.
Look. lt's a warning.
Now, how do you know that? l studied Latin for three years, Dad.
You thought it was dumb, remember?
You said it was a dead language.
Oh , we see how wrong l was about that.
''Beware all who enter.
Here lies the passage to the dead.''
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Where are you going?
-l don't like Latin .
-Hey, wait. Michael.
You're 1 0 years old now.
You got to start being a man. l just turned 1 0. l'm still getting used to it.
Okay.
Here's what we do.
Megan, stay here with your brother.
What? l'm not gonna leave him out here by himself.
You guys stay together. l'll go in here, and l'll take care of this.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Oh.
Wow.
Okay.
All right.
Okay. l'll be right back.
20 minutes tops, right?
20 minutes tops.
What was it that gypsy told me to look for?
Look for a crypt with ...
Look for a crypt...
-A crypt without a name.
-Aah !
Oh !
What's the matter with you?
You can't just be popping out like that. l thought l told you to wait with Michael. l was worried you wouldn't find it.
Besides, Michael's fine.
She said, ''Find the black crypt with no name, or soon your fate will be the same.''
That must be it.
Good hunch, Dad. l'm officially starting to get sick of this place.
And we're here 'cause of who?
Because l take seriously my responsibility as breadwinner. l want you guys to have everything l never had before. l didn't know you had a bad childhood . l didn't have a bad childhood .
Then why do we have to have what you didn't have?
Because...
Hey, don't be tricking me, you little Latin-speaking
1 3-year-old .
Let's just get this over with.
Hold this.
Hold it with two hands, now.
Aah! Phew!
Oh, man .
Excuse me one second. l'm sorry to bother you.
Oh!
Aah. Ugh.
Oh, no.
Ew.
Aah.
Okay.
All right.
Now, that wasn't hard, was it?
Let's get out of here.
That gypsy had me thinking it was gonna be hard.
-That was easy.
Oh! Oh!
Oh, no.
Oh! Oh, no!
Go get the key! l'll take care of him!
Hey, man, go on back to bed .
Get back in your bed.
Go back to bed . l'm Jim Evers of Evers & Evers Real Estate.
Hey, look, l don't want no trouble, man.
The gypsy told me it was all right to get the key, so --
Oh!
Just lighten up.
Now, let me tell you something. l got to get my wife. l don't want no trouble.
Seriously, back up!
You asked for it.
Next time you're gonna think twice before coming back from the dead , ain't you?
-Did you get the key?
-l'm looking ! l'm looking!
Take your time. Relax. l have everything under control. l have everything completely under control.
Megan , you better look faster!
Oh , l don't want to do this.
Jeez.
Aah!
-Aah!
Give me your hand.
Okay.
Come on , come on , come on!
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!
Hold on!
Come on, guys!
Hurry up!
Michael!
Michael , open the door.
Michael, it's locked from the outside!
Michael, open the door.
Open the door. Michael!
Dad, there's spiders everywhere, and l don't have a magazine.
-Hey, Michael , are you scared?
-Uh-huh.
Michael, it's okay to be scared.
Everybody gets scared sometimes.
-Daddy's scared right now.
-You are?
Yes, l'm very scared .
Now, please open the door, son!
Michael , open the door, or l'll kill you!
That's great.
Keep him calm.
Hey, Michael, listen , it's okay to get scared.
Everybody gets scared now and then.
You just can't let it stop you.
Michael, if you think you're scared now, wait till the zombies come out!
What zombies?
Michael!
Hey, Michael, look.
Just open the door.
Please, man.
Open the door right now.
Dad, they're coming !
Michael , open the door right now!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open the door right now!
Open the door!
Oh!
Aah!
Lock it! Lock it!
Okay.
Come on !
All right.
Okay. All right.
Get 'em off!
Okay. Come on.
Get 'em off. Okay.
All right. We got it.
All right. You okay?
Okay.
My brave little man.
All right.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah .
You got the key?
Oh, no.
Wait. Whoa.
Yeah, l got it. l got it.
There it is.
Okay.
All right.
Now, we went to hell and back to get this thing.
Where's the door out of here?
First, you must find the trunk.
Trunk?
Yes, trunk.
Not door?
No. Not door.
Trunk.
All you said l had to do was find this key! l got the key.
Now you're telling me this story about a trunk!
The key is the answer to all, remember?
Look, l don't make the rules. l just work here.
Okay. That's it.
That's the last straw. l've had enough of this nonsense.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Put me down!
This is bad luck!
This is very bad luck! l'll show you bad luck. l'm tired of playing around. l'm getting nauseous!
You'll get over it.
Please don't drop me. l'm fragile. l'm very fragile.
Don't talk to me about being fragile. l'm the one that's feeling fragile right now. ls that it?
-That's it.
-Hmm. All right.
Now we're in business.
Hey, hold her for a second.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
How do l know what to look for?
This thing is full of junk.
Find the thing that must be read lest your heart be filled with dread .
There's nothing in here red.
Hey, wait a minute.
There's a letter here. lt's a letter.
''Yes, my dear heart, l will marry you. l will love you for all eternity.
And tonight at last, we will be together. l do.
Forever yours, Elizabeth.''
She didn't kill herself.
She wanted to be with him.
Yeah, and somebody gave him the wrong letter.
Yes.
Well done, Mr. Evers. l must say l'm impressed.
You are more persistent than l would have ever imagined.
The butler did it?
You got to be kidding me. l will deal with you two later.
Why'd you kill her?
Because the master would not listen to reason.
He had everything in the world.
And yet he was willing to throw it all away for love. l did tell him it would end badly.
You're a real cold dude.
No, Mr. Evers. l am a rational man. lt was my responsibility to the house.
My duty, sir, to see to it that the boy did not make a foolish error in judgment.
Running away with that girl would have destroyed this house. lt would have destroyed everything .
And l could not stand by and watch it all fall to ruin.
Punch his face in, Dad.
Yeah, but first l'm gonna tell his master what really happened.
The master must never know.
Edward and his love will be reunited, and this curse will be broken.
That's not her.
That's my wife.
And what she sees in you l'll never know.
But that is of little importance now.
The only thing that matters is that the master's pain must end.
And it will end tonight.
The curse will be broken, and we can all finally move on.
All right. That's it, man .
Where's my wife?
Getting ready for her wedding, of course.
What wedding?
He can't marry her.
He's dead, and she's not.
True.
But that can be easily corrected.
Life, l'm afraid, is such a delicate state. lf you put one finger on my wife, l swear l'll kill you.
How wonderful.
You're going to kill a ghost.
-Leave him alone!
-Stop it!
-Aah!
-Aah!
Let them go!
You're gonna let my kids out of here, take me to my wife, and let us out of here right now!
You want out, fine.
Let me show you out.
Now, for the last time, good night, Mr. Evers.
Aah!
Ugh!
Oh!
This house has waited so long to have its shroud of darkness lifted.
And tonight, for the first time in, oh, so many years, l believe it may be possible that the story will finally end differently.
Sara?
Do you believe that love is about second chances?
About forgiveness?
Yes, l do.
Don't you remember?
Remember?
Mr. Gracey, are you all right?
Don't you recognize me at all?
Mr. Gracey. l thought certainly bringing you back to Gracey Manor would help you remember.
Remember what?
Mr. Gracey, you're scaring me.
Where it happened.
Where we spent our last moments together.
Where we danced together for the last time before you...
Before you killed yourself!
But now you've returned to me.
And at long last, we can be together.
Why do you not remember?
You were my world, my life!
And l have loved you in death as l did in life!
Let me go!
Why do you not remember?
You are her.
You are Elizabeth.
You must be!
Can you not sense it?
Search your heart. l am your one true love.
And now we can finally be together.
Don't you understand?
Elizabeth , you must listen to me. l'm not Elizabeth!
Please! l implore you.
Leave me alone!
Get away from me!
She doesn't remember. lt can't be her. lt is her, sir.
The gypsy woman prophesied her return.
And now the time has come.
You had best get ready.
But she doesn't remember. ln time she will , sir. l assure you she will.
Open up!
Hey!
Let me in !
Aah!
Oh , Ramsley, you have to help me.
There's something horribly wrong. Mr. Gracey...
Yes. l know, my dear. l know.
He's expecting you .
He's always been expecting you.
And you haven't put on your dress yet.
We can't keep the master waiting.
Waiting?
For what?
Why, your wedding, of course.
My... l'm not Elizabeth!
Of course you are, my dear.
You may not see it yet.
But in time you will .
You don't actually think l'm going through with this madness?
Oh, yes. l very much do.
You see... we wouldn't want anything to happen to the children.
Now, would we?
Michael!
Megan!
You wouldn't.
Of course not, my dear.
But that is entirely up to you. lf not, l really do fear for the children.
Have her ready.
And this time, any further acts of insubordination will be dealt with in the harshest possible manner.
But, sir?
There are worse things than purgatory, madam. l can assure you.
Have her ready.
Tears of joy.
What are you doing?
Hey, you leave me alone.
Just get out of here and leave me alone.
Oh, l see.
You're just gonna sit there, feeling sorry for yourself.
You tell me why not.
This whole thing was my fault.
We should've never been here in the first place.
Supposed to be at the lake.
We'd be sitting by a warm fire right now.
And l made us come here.
And now it's too late.
No. lt's never too late.
Hey, look, l tried to get in there, and l can't, all right? l tried! l failed!
You try.
You fail.
You try.
You fail.
But the only true failure is when you stop trying.
What do you want me to do?
Huh?
Try again.
Hold on!
With what?
-Aah!
-Aah!
Elizabeth?
Yes, my love. l'll be right back.
Okay. l'll wait here.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
Dad!
Help us!
Michael!
Megan!
Wilt thou , Edward Gracey, have this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony? l will.
And do you, Elizabeth Henshaw, take this man to be your lawful husband, to love and cherish in death as you did in life? l do.
Whoa!
Aah!
From this day forward, you shall be joined together as one for all eternity until the very end of time.
What God has joined together let no man cast asunder.
-Dad!
-Dad! lf anyone has any objections...
Yeah, l got a few objections!
The next time l say we're going to the lake,
-we're going to the lake.
-Let's go.
Get away from her. l lost her once. l don't intend to let it happen again.
This is not Elizabeth .
Ramsley, you tell him the truth. l don't know what you're talking about.
Now you got amnesia, huh?
Elizabeth didn't kill herself.
He did it.
He's been lying to you all along. l'm warning you, sir.
Step away.
Don't think 'cause you pull out your sword l'm gonna let you marry my wife.
My patience is wearing thin.
Elizabeth , please, come along. l'm not Elizabeth.
You must be.
Her name is Sara.
She's from New Jersey.
Ramsley wants you to think she's Elizabeth so this curse would be lifted.
That is absurd.
Forgive me. lf you're gonna kill me, kill me.
But on the other side, l'm gonna be whipping your ass for all eternity.
So maybe you should read this before you stab somebody.
-What is it?
-lt's Elizabeth's letter.
Her real letter.
The one she wrote.
The one he stole.
You never saw it.
What's the meaning of this?
Must we continue to listen to the ramblings of a lunatic?
But it is written in her hand.
Yeah, it's written in her hand .
Explain that, Ramsley.
Well?
Your union was unacceptable. l tried to warn you , but you wouldn't listen.
So you killed her. l told you it would be a mistake to run away with that girl.
But l loved her!
Was love my mistake?
Yes! l tried to protect you.
All these years l've sacrificed for you.
But what would you understand of sacrifice, duty, or honor?
You loved her.
Well, damn you .
Damn you all to hell!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Jim!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
-Mom!
-Mom!
Mom , what's wrong?
Are you all right?
-Mom.
-Hey!
Hey, Sara.
Sara, what's the matter?
Sara, what's wrong?
Hey, what's the matter?
What's wrong? lt's the poison!
Oh, no.
No.
Hey, Sara.
Come on. Please.
Don't do this!
Sara, don't do this.
Please.
Jim...
Sara! Hey!
Sara.
Sara, come on. Please.
Sara.
Sara, l love you.
Sara, please. l love you so much.
Hey, get away from us!
Leave us alone!
No, Dad. lt won't hurt us.
Elizabeth, is that you?
Yes, my love.
The ghost ball was Elizabeth.
The truth had to be known for me to be released.
He saved me. lt was nothing.
Oh, Elizabeth.
Yes, my darling? l have waited so long for this moment.
And now only heaven awaits.
He's not really kissing your mom .
Hey.
That's my wife.
Sara?
Jim? l thought l lost you.
Oh. l thought l lost you, too. l'm back, Sara. l'm back.
Can you ever forgive me?
Oh, what's to forgive?
You loved her.
Here.
Take this.
What is it?
The deed to the house. lt's yours.
Do with it what you will.
Sell it, keep it.
Do whatever makes you and your family happy.
And thank you.
Thank you all so much.
Wait! Wait for us!
Hold on!
What's all this?
Well , l don't know what we'll need.
What are you talking about?
We're going to heaven.
You can't take it with you.
The hell l can't.
-Oh.
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.
-Thank you all so much.
You're welcome.
-Thank you.
-So long , now.
Okay, little man.
All right. Hurry!
Let's go!
-Bye!
-Bye!
Okay.
Here we go.
Whoo!
Bye-bye.
Angels in heaven together at last.
The tale is well ended for those who have passed.
Love endures all , no reason , no rhyme. lt lasts forever and forever all time.
Mom, Leota won't shut up.
-Are we there yet?
-l'm getting pretty hungry.
Can we get some pizza?
How long before we get there, Sara?
20 minutes tops.
Nothing takes 20 minutes.

Hurry back.
Hurry back.
Be sure to bring your death certificate. lf you decide to join us, make your final arrangements now.
We've been dying to have you.
Long ago, when the pyramids were still young, -
- Egyptian kings played a game of great and terrible power.
They did battle with magic and monsters for riches and glory.
From these Shadow Games erupted a war -
- that threatened to destroy the world, -
- until a brave and powerful pharaoh locked the dark magic away, -
- imprisoning it for all eternity within the mystical Millennium Items.
But even eternity doesn't last forever.
It was never to happen, and for 5000 years it never did.
The secret of the Millennium Puzzle remain safely beyond reach.
Within the imponderable conundrum of it's intricate design.
For a boy named Yugi, the mystery of the Millennium Puzzle -
- remains just that.
The solution, if one exists, eludes him as it did those that came before him.
But this time, fate has played a hand in bringing the puzzle -
- and this person together.
It was never to happen.
And for 5000 years it never did.
But while the desert does it's best to conceal -
- that which should remain burried, -
- it eventually yielded it's most ancient and terrible secrets.
We found it. The lost tomb of Anubis.
Professor, what do you make of this? It's amazing.
What possessed them to put the sarcophagus in chains?
Hey, all right!
Maybe this one next.
Yeah! One to go.
I've almost solved the
Millennium Puzzle.
Now what have we here?
Grandpa is sure gonna be surprised when he sees I've figured -
- this puzzle out all by myself.
The last piece.
This is it.
Awesome! I did it. The
Millennium Puzzle's complete.
What's going on?
- There still are men in there.
- The cave collapses.
This tomb is cursed.
Hey! What is this?
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Shadow Creatures. Begone.
I command you!
Return to the dark realm from whence you came!
It was never to happen but after 5000 years it did.
And with it the Shadow
Games begin again.
In the three short years since he started playing Duel Monsters -
- Yugi Moto has risen to international stardom, -
- by becoming the world wide Duel
Monsters card-playing champion.
But what makes this young man such a talented duelist?
Is it his masterly strategies?
Or does the secret lie in the -
- powerful God Cards he's assembled in his deck?
Whatever the reason, Yugi has proven his dueling powers time and again.
He has reigned victorious in the most prestigious tournaments, -
- including the Duelist
Kingdom competition.
And most reasonly the Battle City
Finals where once again -
- Yugi defeated former champ
Seto Kaiba to win it all.
Gimme a break. I bet
I could do a circle -
- around this little high school pipsqueak.
Yugi says his success is due to his grandfather's coaching -
- and to his belief in the heart of the cards.
If he'd play me for those God Cards
I'd take that chump down in a flash.
But other say it is the three Egyptian God Cards -
- that make Yugi virtually unbeatable.
And so the gauntlet is thrown.
Can anyone defeat Yugi Moto -
- and his unstoppable
Egyptian God Cards?
You wanted a rematch, Seto Kaiba?
You've got one.
And this time things are gonna end differently, you pompous windbag.
Even you must admit that your
Blue-Eyes White Dragon -
- is powerless against my
Egyptian God Cards.
Make all the smug pronouncements you like, but know this:
There's got to be a way to beat your God Cards.
And I won't stop until I find it.
Now I activate the Magic Card -
- Polymerization.
This allows me to fuse my three dragons together, -
- to form Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
And that's just for starters.
Next I play a Magic Card that doubles my dragon's attack points:
Megamorph.
Now my Blue-Eyes is more powerful than any monster on the field.
There is more to power than just attack points.
And just what is that supposed to mean?
It means my Egyptian God Cards possess powers far beyond meer monsters.
- They what?
- By sacrificing two of them -
- I can bestow upon the third, infinite strength.
They are melting.
Hooling their energy.
Now my Obelisk the Tormentor is the strongest monster in play.
No, I can beat your God Cards.
I won't lose to you again.
Obelisk the Tormentor, show him what true power is all about.
Attack with Fist of Fury!
No.
My dragon.
- No!
- System overload!
The simulation is malfunctioning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Kaiba, but I was certain that our calculations -
- were correct this time, sir.
If you just give us one more chance, sir.
So you can fail again? Sorry.
Please, sir. We're close to postulating a winning strategem.
Well if I were you I'd start postulating myself a new job.
You've had more than enough time to find a way to beat -
- Yugi's Egyptian God Cards. But as usual I have to do it myself.
- Now, get out!
- Ah, man.
There's gotta be some way to defeat Yugi's God Cards.
And I think I know were to start looking.
The God Cards?
What a horrible nightmare.
That's it, no more white wine spritzers before bedtime for me.
Looks peaceful enough.
Yet I sense chaos.
I may have lost my Millennium
Eye some time ago, -
- but I can still see that something terrible is about to unfold.
About time the museum got a descent display of Egyptian artifacts.
Hey, that looks just like a Millennium Item.
This I gotta see.
This is flight command.
Initiating Duel Dome launch convertion. Over.
Roger, dock command.
Prepare launch station -
- for immediate dragon-flight. Over.
We show Mr. Kaiba now approaching primary flight deck.
Begin complete systems check at once.
- Roger. Vector gauge.
- Check.
- Navigation sensors.
- Check.
- Ready the launch pad.
- Yes, sir. Opening hangar doors.
Blue-Eyes White Jet, you are clear for take-off.
Activating main thrust rockets.
- I hope you know what you're doing.
- I was just hoping the same thing.
Red wine spritzer, sir.
Can it be? My dear friend Kaiba-boy.
Spare me the pleasantries, Pegasus.
You and I have never been friends, so let's not start pretending that we are.
Oh, my. Sounds like someone's need a hug.
No, thanks. But since you mentioned it, there is something I need.
Listen. I've come to your little fantasy island -
- in search of a card powerful enough to beat Yugi's three Egyptian God Cards.
And you believe I'd might have this all-powerful God-smiting Card because?
Because you created the game, Pegasus.
Once upon a time, Kaiba-boy, but I'm retired now.
The only things I create these days are places like this for the fishies to enjoy.
I know you, Pegasus.
You created the God Cards -
- and would have never let them out of your sweaty little hands, -
- unless you also created a way to beat them.
- Just in case.
- Oh, very well, I confess.
I may have one card that could help, but you can't have it.
- What?
- I'm sorry, Kaiba-boy, -
- but I don't think you deserve it.
True I may not see as well as I once did.
But to be honest, it doesn't take a magic eye -
- to see just how thoroughly Yugi has trounced your sorry behind again and again.
Quite frankly it is embarrassing.
Well since I'm such a disappointment, you should have no trouble -
- defeating me in a duel.
- And why would I duel you?
Because if you'll put up the card I need to beat Yugi, I'll wager these.
Wow, you'd rish your precious
Blue-Eyes White Dragons, -
- just for a chance to trounce little Yugi?
My, my, my, seems you're even more desperate than I thought.
Well I guess I could dust off my deck.
Kaiba, my dear and devious friend, let the games begin.
- Come on
- Let's go everybody.
- Wonder what all the commotion's about?
- Don't know.
But I haven't seen this many people running from school since they served -
- meat loaf surprise last year.
- What in the...
- Let me see.
Wonder who these guys are all waiting for.
It's him.
Told you he's alot smaller than on tv.
Me first. Let me at him.
Please just give me one shot at those God Cards.
Get out of my way! If anyone gets the God Cards, it's me.
- Help me!
- What's going on with these guys?
Life on the top, Téa. Everyone knows
Yugi is the best duelist around.
So they all want a piece of him, and those God Cards.
Téa, try to sneak Yugi around the back, while we hold them off.
- You're sure?
- Yeah, me and Tristan will handle things here.
- Thanks, Joey.
- You can thank him later. Let's go, Yugi.
- The usual plan, T?
- On three, partner.
- On three.
- Quick, after them.
Forget about those nobodies.
- Now wait just a minute.
- What'd you say?
I said you're nobody.
Yeah, that's right. And everybody knows it too.
Well just everybody who's anybody, that is.
Listen up. Nobody but nobody calls me a nobody, -
- a bunch of nobodies. Got that?
- We wanna take on Yugi, not you.
- Yeah, right.
- We want the King of Games, -
- not the King of Lame.
- The Duel Monsters champ, not chump.
The Master of the Gods, not the Master of the Clods.
I think I get the point, already.
But you gotta prove yourselves first, -
- by doing top-contender, and I think I know one.
- Seto Kaiba?
- Me! Joey Wheeler.
So if you wanna get to the King of Games -
- you'll have to go through me, the Godfather of Games, capiche.
- All right, so who wants some?
- I wants some.
Won't take long. Let's do this.
Okay, ladies first.
Funny. Take this!
I summon Injection Fairy
Lily in attack mode.
Hi, there.
Let's give him a check-up, Lily.
Say ah!
What the...
I sacrifice Fenrir and Inpachi in order to summon Maju Garzett.
Attack! Sludge Regurgitate.
Hey, didn't nobody ever teach you to say it, not spray it? Some menace.
Or, boy. Now you're in trouble.
I sacrifice Baby Dragon, Rocket
Warrior and Little-Winguard -
- to summon Gilford the Lightning.
Which means all the monsters you got out on the field are destroyed, pal.
Lightning Sword.
Ah, nuts!
Maybe now, you'll have the proper respect for Joey -
- the Godfather of Games.
Is the coast clear yet, Joey?
Hey, it's Yugi. He's back.
- Let's go, Yugi.
- You better watch out.
We're gonna get ya.
- Yeah, they respect ya.
- I've could have been a contender.
Quick! Yugi, this way.
Those guys just won't give up.
We need to find a place to hide.
Some place where we will be save from that Duel Monsters mob.
Some place they'd never look.
So want do you think, Kaiba-boy?
Is this the latest in duel arena technology, or what?
This place is an outdated joke.
But then so are you, so I suppose it fits.
Now, now, Kaiba, let's not get nasty. Not just yet, anyhow.
Look, enough small talk.
Let's duel!
I'll start things off.
Oh, dear, I'm afraid you're about to enter into a world of pain, Kaiba-boy.
A world of chaos. A world of absolute mayhem.
That's right. A world of Toons.
Ha, don't tell me that you're actually still using that idiotic Toon World card.
Well, this is gonna be even easier than I thought.
I summon Toon Gemini
Elf in attack mode.
And this for later.
It's your turn, Kaiba-boy.
I summon X-Head Cannon.
I'll throw two cards face down.
For later.
Uh, I'm so scared, Kaiba.
Two cards face down.
Oh, mercy me, what will I do?
No wait that I now play this.
Card of Sanctity.
Isn't it pretty? And it allows us each to draw until we both -
- have six cards in our hand.
Just what I needed.And now
I'll activate the Magic Card Cost Down.
- Which means that.
- Do you ever shut up?
I know what it means. Now you can summon your strongest monsters to the field -
- more easily.
Please, what do you take me for, some kind of a rookie?
You're not quite that good, Kaiba-boy.
I summon the Toon Dark Magician Girl.
But I won't be using her just yet.
First I'll attack with the Gemini Elves.
And I think I'll have them target... -
- you.
Cartoons are so violent these days.
But we're not through yet.
My elves have another ability.
When they deal damage to a player, that player loses a card from his hand.
Aren't my Toons simply magnificent, Kaiba-boy?
Oh, don't look so sour.
Think of it this way, at least it will be them stopping you little quest to the top and not -
- Yugi-boy for the umpteenth time.
Now then, let's get on with it, shall we?
Oh, Toon Dark Magician Girl, your turn.
I guess it's true that when you get old, the mind is the first thing to go, because -
- you forgot all about my face down cards.
And now it's gonna cost you.
Attack Guidance Armor.
This trap's like a magnet that redirects your own attack right back at you.
No, you wouldn't.
Oh, yes I would. And I will.
Guidance Armor, attach to the Toon Gemini Elves.
But they were just innocent Toons.
You'll pay for that.
I activate the Magic Card Monster
Reborn to bring them back.
And play Ultimate Offering.
Now for every 500 life points I give up,
I can summon one additional monster.
And by sacrificing my
Toon Gemini Elf, Kaiba-boy, -
- this first monster will be quite a powerful one.
Introducing the Blue-Eyes
Toon Dragon.
Looks rather vicious, doesn't he?
But don't you worry yourself,
Kaiba-boy, he is actually quite docile.
Well, compared to the next Toon, that is.
Ladies and gents, the
Toon Summoned Skull.
Sure, I'll have to give up another 500 of my life ponts, -
- but then, you know what they say, Kaiba-boy:
You have to spend life points to take life points.
Of course, you know all about that.
Yugi's been taking your life points for what, going on three years now?
Oh, I'm sorry to keep bringing that up.
I activate the Magic Card Dark Core.
Now by discarding one card from my hand, -
- I can remove any monster from the game.
I see.
Well then, I'm sorry
Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, -
- but I guess this is goodbye.
Not quite, Pegasus. You won't be getting off that easily, -
- because I'm discarding Y-Dragon
Head from my hand.
So I can remove X-Head
Cannon from the game.
What? But X-Head Cannon is your own monster.
What are you scheming?
I also activate the Magic
Card Soul Release.
It removes one more monster from the game -
- and I'm using it on my Y-Dragon Head.
Why are you removing your own monsters?
And now, I summon -
- Z-Metal Tank.
That makes no sense, unless...
Unless I still have one more card to play, Pegasus.
And it so happens I do.
Activate Return from the
Different Dimension.
It's well worth half my life points to bring back all my monsters.
And nice trick to know when you wanna summon more than one monster in a turn.
And as you're well aware, these aren't just any monsters, Pegasus.
They combine.
Together they create the ultimate XYZ-Dragon Cannon.
Yes, now I have all the firepower I need to blast any card I want out of the duel.
If you still say you're gonna win, then it's time to change your tune.
- Go! Destroy Toon World!
- No!
Use Cannon Firestorm.
That's all folks.
Now let's see which you've got to beat the Egyptian Gods.
Looks like you had two cards up your sleeve.
What do you mean, two cards?
- Kaiba, there was only one.
- Yeah, right.
Nice try, you snake.
The museum is the last place those demented duelists would think to look for you.
Hope you're right.
Hey, it's some kind of an Egyptian exhibit.
Look, Téa.
That blue pyramid, there.
- It looks like my Millennium Puzzle.
- Yeah, it does.
Let's go check it out.
It says: The tomb of Anubis.
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.
If we stay here I'm gonna blow chunks.
Okay, I get the point, Téa.
You're not a mummy fan.
Hey, it's my grandfather.
What are you doing here?
Oh, well it looks like great minds think alike.
- So you came to see that Pyramid, too?
- Yep.
This says, it's called the Pyramid of Light.
In all my years of egyptology, I've never come across this relic before.
But it says here it belonged to an evil sorceror who tried to bring about the end of the world.
Well I guess it's pretty safe to say his plan didn't work, right?
Legends say a brave pharaoh destroyed him using -
- the mystical Dagger of Fate.
The same pharaoh who many believed possessed your Millennium Puzzle.
Come, I'll show you.
See? There is the knife.
- Can we leave?
- What's it say here on his sarcophagus.
Let's see. It's some sort of prophecy.
"The eye that sees what's yet to come its vision shall be fulfilled -"
"- unless blinded by events predetermined."
"Thus light and shadows both be killed."
From the light comes the dark.
Téa? Would you read me the story about the bunny?
I'm gonna pretend that's the concussion talking and forget all about it.
'Cause right now we got bigger problems.
Like where King Tut's freaky cousin went.
The mummy's body's been stolen.
And that's not all. He napped that pyramid thing too.
Grandpa. Stay here.
I have a feeling Kaiba's in danger. I have to warn him.
- Yugi.
- Just keep an eye on Grandpa.
I'll call you.
What hit me?
Probably whatever broke into the museum.
No. This is terrible.
Yeah, they took the mummy and the Pyramid of Light.
This is one crime those crooks is gonna regret.
According to the legend, Anubis found that he would one day return from the dead.
What's going on?
- You don't really think that...
- Téa, I don't know what to think.
Let's just hope that legend is just a legend.
Stop the car!
Yugi. I've been looking all over for you.
My brother sent me to find you.
And he says that it's real important that you bring your Dual Disc, right away.
- Wait, so he's okay then?
- I wouldn't say he's okay.
All I know is that Seto hasn't been acting like himself lately.
I think he's gonna totally lose it.
Way to hold back that crowd, champ.
Or, like you helped. Then again you duel worse than my mom.
You're just lucky I'm worn out, man.
Check it out. What's Kaiba's limo doing at Yugi's place?
Hey, Yugi, wait up. Stop!
- Bro, I smell trouble.
- Actually that's me. Sorry about that.
My brother's waiting for you on the top floor.
I got it. Thanks.
Welcome to the
Kaiba Corp. Duel Dome.
Destination: Skytop Dueling Platform.
This is want he wants.
But it is too much of a coincident that Kaiba would send for us -
- right after the vision we had at the museum.
There must be something more going on here.
And I'm pretty sure it has something to do with that Anubis guy.
It seams like you had some kind of battle with him 5000 years ago.
Perhaps. But sadly memories of my days as the pharaoh are clouded, -
- nor is it clear to me what role the
Egyptian God Cards have to play in all this.
I sure wish we knew more about what happened back in your past.
All that matters is that we face the future together.
And I wouldn't have it any other way. Are you ready partner?
Ready.
Yu-Gi-Oh!
Kaiba's car is outside so Yugi must be here.
Wow, you're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
Did you figure that out all by yourself?
- Hey, Yugi is upstairs.
- Hey, what's going on?
My brother is about to duel him.
Welcome.
Glad you came to duel, Yugi.
'Cause this time things are gonna be different.
Initiating duel simulation.
Calculating player strength.
God Cards destroyed.
I hope you've brought your Egyptian God Cards.
Otherwise, this duel isn't gonna be any fun at all.
Kaiba, I'm sensing the present of something far more dangerous than you can possibly imagine.
Spare me the fairy tales.
- We could all be in great danger.
- I've heard enough.
If you think you sense something dangerous, you're absolutely right, -
- because it's me and my deck, and in this Duel Monsters match -
- you're about to lose big-time.
Mokuba, seal all of the exits.
If you say so.
- What's the deal?
- We're trapped, man.
Now what'd you say we get down to business, already?
Something tells me that this duel is not a good idea.
Kaiba, why don't you stop thinking about yourself for once and listen to what I'm telling you?
You're in no position to be making demands.
So shut up and duel.
And may the best duelist win.
- I guess Yugi's going through with this.
- Kaiba ain't leaving him much choice.
All duel dome exits are now secured.
All dueling systems are online.
You've been taking credit for being the best duelist for way too long.
And to tell you the truth I'm sick of it.
By the time this duel is over, you'll be exposed to the world as a total fraud.
Let's duel!
I'll start.
First I'll summon my Familiar Knight in defence mode. Try and get past him.
Very well, I shall.
I play Queen's Knight.
And now, say goodbye to your monster.
Queen's Knight, attack!
By destroying your knight,
I've activated it's speciel ability -
- which allows you to play a new beast in it's place.
What? Yugi's lost it. Why would he let Kaiba play a monster -
- with 2400 attack points?
- He did what?
And you're being so helpful, because why?
Because by doing so I also get to summon a new monster.
King's Knight.
And these two knights are in play I can -
- automatically summon my Jack's Knight.
And next I place one card face down.
Make your move.
Looks like your luck's finally run out.
I'll keep this card face down on the field -
- until the time is right.
Right for me that is.
And then nothing in your deck will make a difference. Your move, Yugi.
An Egyptian God Card.
I sacrifice my three knights to bring forth my ultimate creature.
Behold the Egyptian God Card:
Slifer the Sky Dragon.
Your monster is completely defenceless against the devine power of Slifer.
Now my Sky Dragon. Attack!
Had enough?
Not only am I not afraid of your God Cards -
- but I'm gonna force you to summon all three of them at once.
Thanks to my Obligatory
Summon Magic Card -
- you have to bring out every monster in your deck that falls into -
- the same category as the one that's on the field already.
Very well. Then I play two more God Cards.
Obelisk the Tormentor and
The Winged Dragon of Ra.
You've allowed me to assemble the three strongest and most feared creatures in Duel Monsters, -
- Kaiba. A foolish mistake.
It's no mistake.
My entire strategy was to draw out your three Egyptian God Cards, -
- so I can be the first duelist to crush all of them at once.
- And just how do you attend to do that?
- You're about to find out right now.
Reveal Trap Card.
Pyramid of Light.
So the Pyramid of Light is more than just an ancient artifact.
It's also a card.
Now pyramid, activate!
Looks like your so called unstoppable monsters have been stopped.
Impossible.
See for yourself.
Wow, check it out.
- Your monsters are useless.
- But how?
He actually did it.
Yugi. What's this?
Oh, man, not more freaky magic.
This weird stuff always happens when Yugi duels.
- Hey, what're you looking at?
- I think you got it mad.
- Just hang on, man.
- Easier said than done, Joey.
What's going on?
This is crazy.
It's Kaiba's Duel Dome.
That blue beam is the same color of the Pyramid of Light from the museum -
- and I bet it's no coincidence.
What ever is going on in there, one thing's for sure: It can't be good.
Yugi, where are you?
Kaiba, do you have any idea what you've just done?
Well, let's see. I think I have just beaten you.
Hey, wait a sec. This place looks kinda familiar.
This is where the pharaoh's spirit lives.
Inside the Millennium Puzzle.
I've gotta find it so we can reconnect.
I'm pretty sure that one of these rooms belongs to him.
Question is, which one? There must be a million doorways in this place.
Oh, man I feel as bad as you look, Joey.
Tristan. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.
It looks like some weird maze. And man,
I think you and I are the lab rats.
Hello? Hello? Pharaoh?
Pharaoh, are you here?
Pharaoh?
Nothing.
Pharaoh!
- You hear that?
- Yeah, it sounded like Yugi. Come on.
It hurts doesn't it? When you put your faith in the Gods and they let you down.
If I were you now is a good time to start praying for mercy.
Because from here on out, I'm planning to take you apart piece by painful piece.
So let the torture continue with this:
The torrential magic of
Mystical Space Typhoon.
Your face down card is destroyed.
And if you like that, then you're gonna love this:
Peten the Dark Clown.
But don't let his name fool you.
He's no laughing matter.
Now, attack with Bloodlust Slash.
And to top it off I'll place this face down on the field.
That attack it drained me some.
But I'm far from finished.
Magician's Valkyria, attack!
Mystic Sceptre Blast.
Nice try, Yugi, but I knew you'd make that move, -
- which is why my face down card is Deck Destruction Virus.
You set off this cribleling trap when you destroyed my Dark Clown, -
- and now it's viral tentacles will infect ten random cards from your deck -
- and send them straight to the graveyard.
- Oh, no.
Oh, yes, Yugi. Now say goodbye to 25 percent of your Duel Deck.
No.
I hate to be the bearer of even more bad news, -
- but when you destroyed my Peten the Dark Clown, -
- you activated his special ability, allowing me to summon another -
- Dark Clown to take his place.
I summon Des Feral Imp.
And next I'll activate the magical Card of Demise.
It let's me draw five new cards from my deck.
But if I don't use them in five turns,
I lose them in five turns.
Now I'll sacrifice my Feral Imp and activate White Dragon Ritual -
- to summon Paladin of White Dragon.
Paladin, attack with
Bionic Spear Burst.
When I lose my life points I'm losing my actual life energy.
And now, I summon
Blue-Eyes White Dragon.
Take a good look.
It's the monster that's been the bane of your dueling existence ever since -
- our first match. And now he's back.
But he's not alone.
Any last requests?
There he is. Hey, Pharaoh!
Where did he go?
Hey, hold on!
This isn't his room.
Pharaoh. Oh, no.
Who's there?
- Yugi, you in here?
- Yugi?
Hi.
- Talk later. Run now.
- What's with him?
Woaw, it looks like an earthquake hit this place.
- And what in the world is that thing?
- That's what I wanna know.
Mokuba. Is Yugi inside that thing?
He's in there and so is my brother.
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Looks like that artifact we saw back at the museum, only this one's super-sized.
- But how is something like that possible?
- Anubis.
- You don't think?
- Don't you remember the legend?
Anubis once tried to destroy the world using the power of the Pyramid of Light.
The Pyramid of Light?
Wait, rewind a sec.
All of this insanity started when my brother played a card that -
- was called the Pyramid of Light.
- Well, Yugi and Kaiba are inside something -
- from 5000 years ago.
And if the myth is true then Anubis is using it to finish was he started in the past.
This is crazy. We gotta get them out of there.
I don't know what dark powers are at work here -
- but I can't let them go unchecked.
I play Premature Burial to raise
Valkyria from the graveyard -
- and I'll boost her strength with Mage Power.
It may cost me 800 life points, -
- but my Valkyria now gains 500 attack and defence points
- everytime I play a Magic or
Trap Card. Like these two.
1000 additional attack points make my Valkyria -
- more than a match for your
Blue-Eyes. Attack, Valkyria, -
- with Mystic Sceptre Blast.
Not so fast, Yugi. Attack Guidance
Armor will save my Blue-Eyes.
- A trap.
- Very observant.
Now your attack is diverted.
And since my Deck Destruction
Virus is still in play -
- it infects ten more cards in your deck.
I've lost half the cards in my deck already.
Soon you'll lose them all. But first
I'll bring back an old friend -
- who just hates to say goodbye.
And next... -
- I'm gonna summon up your worst nightmare.
Because if you couldn't defeat one Blue-Eyes... -
- there's no way you'll defeat three, -
- especially when combined as the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
If you think he's scary now, just wait till he attacks. In fact don't wait.
Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
Neutron Blast.
Look at the world's best duelist now.
- Think we've lost them.
- So what, what are those freaks?
Yugi, what the heck is going on?
We've been drawn into the Millennium Puzzle -
- and that thing up there is somehow responsible.
Then what's that, down there?
That blue one looks like the Pyramid of Light I saw at the museum.
Yeah? Well it looks like it's beating the crap out of your Millennium Puzzle.
Fighting pyramides and creepy floating eyes. Wonderful.
- It's crazy.
- Hey. When you around with Yugi -
- it's a path full of coarse.
- So, any idea what we're up against?
Maybe.
I think this all has to do with an ancient Egyptian sorceror.
I knew it was gonna be something insane.
He's called Anubis the
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.
- Lord of the Dead?
- Yeah.
Centuries ago he tried to destroy the world and I'm starting to believe -
- he's trying to make a comeback.
- What?
The eye that sees what's yet to come its vision shall be fulfilled -
- unless blinded by events predetermined.
Thus light and shadows both be killed.
Doesn't look like the duel's going too well for your friend the pharaoh.
Yeah, we got to do something to help him.
And all I can think of right now is -
- to head back to Anubis' tomb.
- You mean back towards the mummies?
- Hey, come on. We already know -
- we can outrun them.
Does it hurt Yugi? Because it only gets worse from here.
Kaiba, we can't continue this Duel.
There's another power at work here, -
- and it's destroying us both.
- That's getting a bit old.
No. That Pyramid of Light has created a deadly Shadow Game.
I know you sense it we must stop now.
The only thing I sense is your fear. Not that I blame you.
But I came here to win and stopping's not an option.
For all the times you humiliated me in a duel, when clearly I should have been champion.
For all the times I'd had to listen to your preach about the heart of the cards.
You're going down, Yugi. And my Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon is gonna put you there.
Kaiba, once again your ridiculously over-inflated ego blinds you to the truth.
I am far from beaten.
I play Monster Reborn.
To bring back Dark Magician Girl.
Next I reveal my face down card, Sage's Stone.
When Dark Magician Girl is on the field and Sage's Stone is played, -
- it allows me to automatically summon Dark Magician.
- Big deal.
- Oh, it's a very big deal.
For now I sacrifice both magicians -
- to summon the
Sorceror of Dark Magic.
And with his rise to power comes your Blue-Eyes far from grace.
Because for everyone of my sorceror's fallen comrades in the graveyard -
- your dragon loses 500 points.
And right now there have been three magicians laid down to rest, -
- so your precious Ultimate Dragon's power decreases by 1500 points.
But that means my Blue-Eyes Ultimate
Dragon is vulnerable to attack.
That's exactly what it means.
Attack with Celestial Blast.
Now, will you stop this madness?
After one lucky move?
I don't think so.
Very well, Kaiba you leave me no choice.
I move to attack Peten the Dark Clown.
No, I'll have no monsters on the field to defend my life points.
Sorcerer, Celestial Blast attack!
You may have destroyed my clown, but you forgot about -
- Deck Virus Trap Card.
And at a time when you couldn't afford to.
Your deck's about to be wiped out.
- What?
- Sorry, Kaiba...
But my Sorceror of Dark Magic mystic's powers are so mighty, -
- he can stop the activation of Trap Cards, like your Deck Virus and destroy it.
- My deck is safe.
- But your life points aren't.
I activate the magic of
Monster Reborn.
Then I sacrifice my reborned Ultimate
Dragon to summon a new monster.
- What?
- That's right.
You see I have an even more powerful monster, compliments of Pegasus.
A shiny new dragon.
The Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
Could it be? A card I'd never seen before?
And for every dragon in my graveyard -
- the Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon gains an additional 300 attack points.
That's an extra 1500 attack points, -
- for at punishing grand total of 4500 points.
But don't forget, due to my sorceres' powers, -
- your new dragon's attack points decrease by 1500.
I don't think so. Thanks to my dragon's Shining Diffusion.
What, your points didn't decrease.
Exactly. That's because my Blue-Eyes Shining
Dragon allows me to choose which Magic Trap -
- or Monster Effect Cards can be used against him.
Just face it, Yugi, your days as a champion duelist are over.
My Shining Dragon is gonna blast you back to the minor leagues -
- where you belong.
Now, hit him again, Blue-Eyes.
Shining Neutron Blast.
How do you like it? The pain, the sting of defeat. I felt it for too long.
Now it's your turn.
You're sure this is the way to that mummy guy?
Yeah, every hallway looks the same.
- Hey, what's wrong, Yugi?
- It's weird.
Suddenly I feel really weak, guys.
Check it out. It's some kind of energy stream.
Maybe if we follow this thing, it'll lead us to Anubis.
Sounds like a plan, come on, pal.
It's putting out energy waves that are making my pacemaker go haywire.
Up here!
- I'd hurry up.
- Pegasus?
Pegasus, what are you doing here?
How about we start with a thank you, you little ingrate?
If I hadn't figured out what this whole Pyramid of Light things about, you'd all be crushed.
You see, Kaiba thinks he got that card from me when in fact this is all been arranged by an -
- evil lord who tried to take over the world five millennia ago and is now back -
- to finish the job. I looked it up.
Now, this Anubis has created the ultimate Shadow Game -
- and he's getting stronger every moment.
- Then the prophecy is being fulfilled.
And Yugi and Kaiba are right in the middle of it.
We just gotta find a way to help them.
- Looks like this is it.
- Yeah.
Foolish mortals there is nothing you can do to stop my rebirth.
I have infiltrated the realm of the pharaoh and his life force now feeds mine.
We won't stand here while you suck the life out of others to save yourself.
- We're gonna take you down, Anubis.
- I'd stay in that casket if I were you.
Yeah, because just in case you haven't noticed, we've got you outnumbered.
This place is crawling with stiffs.
What do you want, anyway?
Behold the future since you won't live to see it for yourself.
Soon my beasts of destruction shall annihilate all traces of life on Earth.
And I will finally complete that which I started millennia ago.
It is by your very hand that this devastation will occur, mortal.
For when you released the pharaoh, you released me as well.
What's he mean?
This is between me and him.
Listen, you guys need to find a way outta this place and save yourselves.
- I'm gonna stay here and figure this out.
- Figure what out?
There was a prophecy my grandpa read to me in the museum.
And I think it may have something to do with this. I just don't know what.
Yugi, that's crazy.
Just go guys.
Wait there's no way we're leaving you, we're team.
We've been through everything together and there's no chance we're turning our back on you now.
- That's right.
- But...
The last thing I wanna do is put my best friends in danger.
What are you doing? Téa, please, get down from there.
My friends need me. I just know it.
Foolish girl.
Téa, come back in here at once.
I've got to help my friends.
- She's falling.
- Grab her.
I'm coming, guys!
- Téa.
- How did you find us?
Are you kidding me? Remember the friendship symbol we drew?
- Of course we do.
- The ink may have fated but our -
- bond never will.
- Right.
We're all with you. And we're always be with you.
Thanks, guys. Friends till the end.
- Yeah.
- Right.
You see? There's nothing out there that's more powerful than our friendship.
Téa is right. I can feel it. All we have to do is stick together.
Hey, stick it together, is what we do best.
We'll never leave your side.
- Téa.
- Your pathetic little bond -
- is nothing against my power.
Soon my soul will be fully restored and your world shrouded in darkness.
Yet, you fools prate along about togetherness?
- Then so be it.
- Téa!
- Téa!
- What's out!
What? I can do that.
- Let's take them apart.
- Literally.
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Johnny Rotten. Over here.
Take this.
That wasn't suppose to happen.
- Tristan.
- Kicks to the stomach don't work.
Neither do kicks to the head.
Let's try this.
These carcasses won't quit.
How do you destroy what's already dead?
It's no use. They just keep coming.
How the mighty has fallen.
Lying there on the ground like a dog waiting to be put out of it's misery.
Get up, get up so I can knock you back down.
Something's not right here,
Kaiba, and you know it.
Spare me the mystic mumbojumbo.
You just can't stand that your -
- reputation's at stake.
- You have no idea what's at stake here.
But believe me, I cannot let you win this duel.
Big Shield Gardna. Defence mode.
You know I think you're the one who doesn't have clue what this match is really about.
It's about pay back.
And this card will see to that.
But first let's deal with your so-called Big Shield Gardna.
Do you think it's big enough to block the power of -
-  Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon?
Hey, look. Joey and Tristan.
We gotta get down there.
Shining Dragon attack with
Shining Neutron Blast.
I told you when we started this duel -
- that this time things were gonna be different, Yugi.
You may have beaten me in the past, -
- but now there's nothing you can do to stop me from having my revenge.
You're finished.
Not yet. I'm not.
I activate Pot of Greed which let's me draw two cards.
Now I summon Watapon in defense mode.
And since I used Pot of
Greed to play Watapon -
- I can summon another monster to the field.
And I choose Obnoxious Celtic
Guardian. It's your move.
So let me see if I've got this right, now.
Your playing a cream puff and an elf.
Well, then it's your funeral.
First the Card of Demise I played before sends this dragon to the graveyard.
And I know you know what that means, don't you?
Now my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon has more destructive power than ever before.
Kaiba, please listen to me.
All I wanna hear from you is your anguished cry of defeat.
Kaiba, for the last time,
I'm begging you to stop this.
People are getting hurt, lives are in danger.
And this Pyramid of Light you've created is source of it all.
There's a dark power in our midst and you can't deny it.
With every life point lost, we both become weaker. I know you can feel it.
We must stop. Before it's too late.
Ridiculous. I can attack Yugi now with my Shining Dragon -
- and destroy the rest of his life points.
No, I should stick to my original strategy -
- and defeat Yugi with his very own Egyptian God Cards.
I'm afraid that for you it's already too late, Yugi.
No, Kaiba. Please you mustn't do this we still have time to stop this madness.
All we have to do is end this duel.
You know, Yugi, you're absolutely right.
Stopping the duel is exactly what I'm gonna do.
Now, Shining Blue-Eyes activate your final special ability.
No, you're playing with forces you can't possibly understand.
Finish him. Finish him, now!
No, I wanted a perfect victory, and with this card I can -
- use Yugi's own most powerful monsters against him.
I use Shining Nova.
It puts the rage of 1000 Blue-Eyes into a blast so strong it -
- destroys itself plus anything I choose.
And the card that will feel the wrath of my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon -
- is the Pyramid of Light.
No, I need the pyramid to destroy the pharaoh.
What am I saying? I must destroy it to gain control of Yugi's God Cards.
Your reign as the King of Games is over.
That title will be mine as will all three of your Egyptian God Cards.
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon sacrifice yourself -
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.
This I cannot allow.
What? The Pyramid of Light wasn't destroyed?
The Pyramid of Light endures because
I will it, so great is my power.
Hey, what is this? Show yourself, whoever you are.
I have been here the whole time, mortal, whispering in your ear.
The whole time? No.
This is some sort of trick.
Kaiba. Look out!
Kaiba. No!
You have served me well, little worm, -
- but you have outlived your usefulness.
So it's been you behind this whole duel, manipulating Kaiba all along.
The Egyptian Lord of the Dead, Anubis.
I am pleased that you remember me after all these years, my pharaoh.
It will make my ultimate vengence all the more sweeter.
You will fall and my reign of destruction shall begin.
- We'll see.
- The souls of your mortal friends -
- have already fallen, trapped within your puzzle.
- My friends?
- Lost in a labyrinth of the dead.
You're wrong. I can still sense their presence.
And I will fight to defend them.
No matter what happens, I will not let your evil plan come to pass, Anubis.
All I need due is defeat you in this duel.
And the prophecy will be fulfilled.
You will be destroyed.
The magic of the Shadow Games that you locked away centuries ago -
- will once again be unleashed into the world.
And I shall finally take my rightful place, as the pharaoh of this realm.
With the Pyramid of Light at my command -
- there's nothing you can do to stop me.
The ultimate Shadow
Game is just beginning.
I summon the terrible beasts,
Andro Sphinx and Sphinx Teleia.
Reverse of Reverse.
Search your deck from now until doomsday.
And you still won't find anything to stand against my savage Shadow Realm beasts.
No, my pharaoh, I'm afraid that for you doomsday is today.
Now watch as your last line of defense is ripped to shreds before your eyes.
Sphinx Teleia, it is feeding time.
My Celtic Guardian. No.
And now it is your turn,
Andro Sphinx.
Each time Andro Sphinx destroys a monster -
- half of that monster's attack points are taken away -
- from my opponent's life points.
You have only 100 points left.
- Oh, no.
- Yugi.
Your fate is sealed, pharaoh. Soon you will be the relic burried away.
Soon worms will feast on your flesh, just as they did on mine.
Your worms will have to wait, Anubis.
I trust my fate to the heart of the cards.
No monsters. Just two Magic Cards.
That's all I have left.
- He's all yours.
- I don't want you mummy.
That eye up there seems to be his power source.
Hey, hold on. The prophecy.
The eye that sees whats yet to come.
Its vision shall be fulfilled -
- unless blinded by events predetermined.
Predetermined events is just another way of saying fate.
The prophecy means the eye can be blinded by fate.
Heads up, you freak!
The prophecy, I think
I have figured it out.
- All right. The way is to use your head.
- We'll see.
If I'm right I gotta find that Dagger of Fate.
Yugi, please hurry!
It's empty. Please be in here somewhere. Yes.
Here it is.
Let's just hope that fate is on our side.
Come on!
No!
A weakness in the Pyramid's power.
I activate Double Spell.
By discarding one card from my hand, I can select a new one -
- from my opponent's graveyard.
And use it as my own.
And I know just the card I want.
Monster Reborn.
So come forth, mighty
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
And I have a hunch this time, your pyramid won't be able to stand up to it.
Go, Shining Nova.
Use all your power to finish what you started before -
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.
Impossible.
And with that I'll end my turn, now that the Pyramid of Light is gone.
Your opponent tried and failed to destroy the pyramid with that dragon.
You alone couldn't make such a difference.
You're quite right that I could not have done it all alone.
You may have destroyed the card, pharaoh, -
- but not the Pyramid of Light around my neck. Behold its power.
Inspired by your modern sayings:
Two heads are better than one.
Thenien the Great Sphinx.
And now, Pyramid of Light, feed this perfect beast with Dead Souls Set Free.
Hey look. Tell me that attack meter is broke.
Say hello, Thenien.
5000 years ago, I never had the chance -
- to summon Thenien to our battle.
So I think it'd be best if we made up for lost time -
- and finally had a proper introduction.
Thenien, meet the pharaoh, and pharaoh meet your doom.
We don't have anything that can beat that sphinx.
Yes, we do, Yugi. If I'm correct about what Kaiba was planning.
Now Anubis, this is still a duel -
- and I still have one face down card to play.
Reverse of Reverse, -
- which allows me to use the last card played by Kaiba:
Return from the Different Dimension.
When Kaiba spoke of dealing me the perfect defeat, -
- he meant wiping me out with my own Egyptian Gods.
Allow me to introduce Obelisk the Tormentor, Slifer the Sky Dragon -
- and The Winged Dragon of Ra.
My Egyptian Gods, combine now! For infinite power.
Now go, Titan Firestorm!
No.
- Yeah, Yugi!
- All right!
Yeah!
- You did it.
- We did it.
Kaiba. Are you all right?
Let me help you.
I can take care of myself.
What the...?
Shadows take life.
Creatures be born.
Now let see how well you play this game, when the monsters are real.
- Monsters?
- For real?
It is no longer time to duel.
Now it is time to die.
Nothing in your decks of cards can save you now.
It appears you are one card short, pharaoh.
Yeah, but I'm not.
Attack! Gilford the Lightning and Gearfried the Iron Knight.
Begone!
You have no concept of my powers and now the end begins.
We're pancakes.
Not yet.
These Toon Monsters won't last long.
We have to get out of here, while we still have the chance.
Yugi, I know you'll take this creep down.
Yes, you would, 'cause we will be with you all the way.
- Always.
- Always.
Fine, fine. Let's go, already.
How can we beat a real monster?
How? With a real monster.
- Yugi.
- What's this?
The one card that can beat him.
It's time to get real with a
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.
- Shining Nova, attack!
- Shining Nova, attack!
If the monsters are real, so are all their powers -
- including this dragon's ability to destroy any monster.
Destroy Anubis!
Wow, check it out.
No!
He's not coming back again, right?
We should take a closer look at that prophecy to see what it foretells for the future.
Oh please, old man. Anubis is gone.
No one could return after suffering a defeat so thoroughly devastating as that.
Well. No one but Kaiba, that is.
- I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
- Kaiba.
Oh, please, spare me all your bull about friendship, will ya?
If it wasn't for that freak crashing the party we both know that -
- the winner of todays duel would have been me.
So enjoy your last days of being champion. Why you still can.
I gotta say it's nice to have the old Kaiba back.
Yeah? Well this conversation's over. We'll duel again.
Wait up!
I'm sure glad he didn't bring up all the damage you did to the Duel Dome.
'Cause I don't think his insurance is gonna cover this.
He's got plenty of money, Grandpa.
But what he doesn't have is one of these.
And unless he changes he won't have best friends like this.
What Kaiba doesn't get is that victory means nothing, -
- unless you can share it with the people you love.
'Cause then...
You're really a winner.
You can say that again.
SUBTITLES BY
Lightkeeper
NARRATOR:
For some, time passes slowly.
An hour can seem an eternity.
For others, there's never enough.
For the Tucks, it didn't exist.
Time is like a wheel... turning and turning, never stopping and the woods are the center, the hub of the wheel.
It began the first week of summer a strange and breathless time, when accident, or fate bring lives together when people are led to do things they've never done before.
On this summer's day, not so very long ago the wheel set lives in motion in mysterious ways.
It set Mae Tuck out in her wagon for the village of Treegap to meet her two sons as she did once every ten years.
(music box playing wistful melody)
Ma!
Miles!
Jesse!
Oh...!
Oh, I missed you.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I couldn't wait to see you.
I missed you, Jesse.
Oh, wait,
I got something for you.
Oh, look at you.
I got something.
Here, look.
The Eiffel Tower.
Would you look at that.
Got it in Paris, France.
Oh, Mom, you've never seen anything
- So tall in your life.
- Hello...
Oh, I got something else.
I got something else.
How are you, old friend?
Your favorite... chocolates.
Oh, I've died and gone to Heaven.
Oh, Jesse.
(gasps):
Miles...
Miles.
Give your mother a hug.
Ten years.
You're as cozy as barbed wire.
I have you back.
WOMAN:
Winifred!
Winifred!
Yes, Mother?
I need a new name.
One that's not all worn out from being called so much.
Come inside this instant.
You're getting filthy!
Ow! I can scarcely breathe.
"You must suffer to be beautiful."
So say the French.
The French are crazy.
(piano music continues playing)
NARRATOR:
For Winnie Foster one thing was true: the heat of summer was not nearly as stifling as the formality of her life.
With every passing day the feeling grew stronger.
She was coming closer to the end of something and moving towards the beginning of something new.
- (groans)
- (music stops)
Change was in the air.
It was only a question of when.
Wait for me in the car.
I won't be a minute.
In the car, Mrs. Foster.
BOY 1:
Throw it home! Throw it home!
BOY 2:
Come on, throw it home!
- Go!
- Run to me!
Yay!
No, no, no, no, no.
Too large for tea cakes.
None of these will do.
I prefer petit fours.
BOY (laughing):
What kind of a funny hat is that?
Well, look'ee here.
If it's not Miss Moneybags in her fancy car.
What's the matter?
Don't want to get your feet dirty?
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Foster.
Not much call for such treats out here.
Well, I could just make them up for you, special.
GIRL:
Winnie Foster?
You've got to be kidding!
BOY:
Wow!
GIRL:
Winnie, run!
Run, Winnie, run!
Throw it! Throw it!
BOY 2:
Throw it home! Come on!
Slide, Winnie, slide!
Winifred!
JESSE:
Oh, and they had their arms crossed and you see, the lines were perfectly square.
Come here, come here.
I want to teach you. Come on.
Oh, all the way from France.
How about that?
Oh, look. Look-Look at this one.
I want to see, Pop. Let me see.
Look it.
Oh! Aah, he shot me!
Oh, I'm dead!
MAE:
Oh, oh, my!
- (Jesse groaning)
- Oh, my!
Oh, you'll have to see this one.
Miles, look at this!
Oh... let's see.
Okay, come here,
I want to show you.
I want to show you.
All right.
Good to have you home, son.
I'm glad to see you.
And the family together.
But don't get used to it.
War's coming, I hear.
I'm joining up.
I'm going to fight the Huns.
Get as far away from this place as I can.
Oh, you think that'll solve things, do you?
You haven't had enough killing for two lifetimes?
Somebody's on to us.
I know it.
There's a man who's been following us and we've lost him several times, but... he keeps coming back.
I think he knows something.
This man...
Jesse...
- (laughter)
- Whoo!
We're being tracked.
Oh, Miles, we lost him.
Don't go spoiling everything.
Yeah, we lost him, Jess... but he keeps coming back.
It was only a matter of time before someone found us.
The world is closing in.
Entire forest is almost gone.
All except this little wood.
I saw tire marks down on the lower wash... a few weeks ago.
There'll be more.
I don't want anyone going to town.
Not for anything, and that's that.
Tuck.
You see any strangers in the woods getting too close you know what to do.
No exceptions.
Our time here is almost done.
I can feel it.
MAN:
You'll never catch one that way.
Do you know about catching fireflies?
Afraid not, never tried.
I prefer... bigger game.
Though I suspect the strategy is much the same.
Strategy?
One must never announce one's presence to the prey.
One must become part of the scenery... invisible... almost disappear.
And be patient until the exact, right moment arrives... (grunts)
Take a prisoner.
For you?
No, thank you.
You're quite right.
A girl of your age should find... trapping suitors more interesting than trapping insects, anyway.
Far easier, I might add.
Have you lived here long?
Forever. Why?
I'm... looking for some old friends who live hereabouts.
Thought you might help me find them.
My father practically built Treegap.
He knows everyone.
Perhaps he can help you.
Perhaps.
I quite like talking to you.
MRS. FOSTER:
Winifred?
Winifred, who are you talking to out there?
I don't know.
He hasn't told me his name.
Good evening, madam.
Please forgive my intrusion.
This young lady tells me you've lived here forever.
I thought you might know of a certain family goes by the name of...
I hardly know everyone, nor do I want to.
And I don't stand outside discussing such a thing with... strangers.
Then I beg your pardon.
Good evening, young lady.
Madam.
This is why I worry about you, Winifred.
You don't have the sense not to talk to a man like that.
MRS. FOSTER:
A proper education gains one entré into society.
MR. FOSTER:
Your mother and I have given this a great deal of thought.
Middlehouse Academy for Girls in Pensford, has an excellent reputation.
Middlehouse?
But that's a terrible place, everyone says so.
It's like a jail.
Nonsense.
Girls emerge from there as refined young ladies well-versed in etiquette and manners, both of which you are sorely lacking.
But I don't want to be one of those girls.
Which is precisely why you must go.
I cannot let your unbridled nature ruin your chances for a respectable future.
Winifred... I'm sorry... but we have to do what's best for you.
I won't do it.
I'm not like those girls.
I won't go!
Winifred!
I won't go!
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was to be sent
500 miles away to be educated.
But what her parents didn't understand was she only wanted to step just outside her fence... so she did.
What in these quiet woods should be so forbidden?
Winnie had always sensed a mystery waiting for her there.
It was a place so entirely different from what she knew so far away from her tight, pruned world.
Ah!
Ah...
How long have you been standing there?
Not long at all.
I was only walking past, and I...
Well, you shouldn't... be in these parts of the woods.
It's best you turn around and go home.
Well, go on, now, get!
Excuse me, but I own these woods, and...
I'll go on and get when I want to.
You own these woods?
Yes, I do.
What's your name?
Winifred.
Winnie... Foster.
A Foster?
Well, I'll be.
Is that a fact?
Well... Winnie Foster, like I was saying you need to turn around and go home.
It just so happens that I was on my way home before you made your rude suggestion and I would be happy to continue on my way if I only knew which way to go.
In other words, you're lost?
I'll point you home.
I'd be much obliged.
But I want a drink first.
Wait... no!
No!
What?
You don't want that water.
Uh, it's poisoned.
I saw you drink some.
Well, now I'm feeling sick.
You don't look ill.
I'm dry as dust.
I said, leave it alone!
Let go of me! My father will have you arrested!
You're not going to go and tell him, now, are you?
Hey! Come back!
Don't run away!
Come back!
Where you going so fast, Miss?
Miles, wait!
- No! No!
- You know what Tuck said, Jesse.
- No exceptions.
- Help!
You can't do this.
Stop! Let go!
We can't.
Miles!
Miss Foster!
Miss Foster!
Miss Foster!
Where are you?!
Ho.
We're stopping here.
- Not a word out of you, hear me?
- (yells)
Miles!
- What are you doing?
- No!
Let the poor girl go.
There's no reason to be frightened, young lady.
I caught her at the spring with Jesse.
She's a Foster.
Oh, Lord.
It's finally happened.
I want to go home, please.
I want to go home.
There, there, child.
Please don't cry.
We're not bad people.
We'll take you home just as soon as we can.
I promise.
Miles, go find your father.
He's across the lake.
He'll know what to do with her.
Tell Jesse I'm going to fix that mouth of his.
(music box plays wistful melody)
I've heard that.
Have you?
It's, it's my little music box.
I found it in the forest one day.
Just waiting for me, I expect.
I've had it a long, long time.
Oh!
I put my baby boys to bed with it every night.
Gave 'em such sweet dreams.
I'm sure my boys didn't mean you any harm.
Then why did they bring me here this way?
Why am I here?
You have every right to be upset.
And I know your family must be... worried sick about you.
Where's the child?
MAE:
She's no child... Angus.
(whispering):
Does she know?
Why do you think
I brought her...?
Yeah, but now she knows about us, thanks to you.
Shh! Shh!
She's a Foster, she only knows...
Know what?
Miss Foster, this is my husband, Angus Tuck.
Angus, meet Miss Foster.
Hello, Miss Foster.
She's the most important event that's taken place in this house in 80 years.
You hungry?
MAE:
Oh, well, let's, let's all eat.
Yeah.
Jesse, pass your mother a plate, please?
JESSE:
Mmm, where's the fish?
Oh, they weren't biting for some reason.
(chuckles):
'Cause Pa can't fish?
Don't matter. There's plenty.
I catch fish.
If there's no fish, there's no fish if you keep scaring the fish away.
Mmm, this looks good.
MAE:
Oh! Isn't this nice?
Everybody sitting down together and having Miss Foster here.
It's just like having a party.
My father will come looking for me.
Your father... will cut down the entire forest the way things are changing around here.
Make himself a very rich man.
Oh, now, let's not ruin a perfectly good meal with a lot of talk.
My father has plenty of money.
He'll pay.
Anything you want.
We don't want your father's money, Miss Foster.
Then let me go home.
We will.
We'll let you go home... just like I promised.
Directly.
We'll need to be able to trust her first before we're sending her back to her folks.
Trust her? We can't trust her.
Or any normal people.
She'll turn on us in a second.
No, she won't.
You're a fool.
You don't even realize what you've done here.
Him.
It's him.
Robert!
I expect you to find her, Henry.
That's your job.
I've already wired her description down the main line.
They'll keep a lookout and we'll get up a search party come morning.
My wife is certain that this man wearing a yellow suit has something to do with Winifred's disappearance.
And Miss Foster says so based on...?
Her instincts.
Hmm.
Well, maybe you better step in here, Mr. Foster.
Am I whom you're looking for?
I do believe I fit the description.
My wife said she saw you talking to my daughter.
Yes, I did.
She's a charming girl, full of fire.
Perhaps too much.
She's gone, is she?
Looks like she... ran away.
Did she now?
Somehow I'm not surprised.
My daughter did not... run away.
And I'm not interested in what surprises you, sir.
I want to know if you know anything of her whereabouts.
No, Mr. Foster.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I do not.
I am quite coincidentally here in search of someone myself.
I'm seeking a family that used to live in these environs.
I thought the constable could help me locate them, but ironically, Mr. Foster your daughter thought you could help.
Name of Tuck.
Long lost relatives.
I-I can't help you.
Nor I you.
At least not now.
However, I'd be happy to search your woods for you, Mr. Foster.
I'm rather talented at finding people.
I just might meet with success.
Good evening, Constable.
Find out what happened to her, Henry.
Please.
She's our only child.
Angus made that cradle.
Brought it all the way from Scotland.
Oh, it's rocked a few Tucks.
There you go.
The breeze off the lake will keep you cool all night.
The boys sleep up in the loft when they're home so you'll have your privacy.
Oh, that corset looks painful.
May I help you off with it?
Oh, honestly, I can't understand why women torture themselves this way.
It's no way to live.
Do you have a daughter?
A granddaughter.
And a grandson.
Anna and Beau.
Oh, Miles loved them so.
What happened?
They died.
Their mother, too.
I'm afraid the good parts of Miles died along with them.
You'll have to forgive what's left of him.
I'm sorry.
Well, it's... it's the way things are, Miss Foster.
Can I call you Winnie?
MAE:
Do you have brothers and sisters?
WINIFRED:
No, it's only me.
My mother...
(conversation continues indistinctly)
MAE:
There.
WINNIE:
So where do they go?
Oh, they go different places, do different things.
Miles can do carpentry and he's good with his hands.
Jesse, now, he seems to have settled himself.
Of course, then, he's... he's young yet.
Well...
I hope you will be comfortable here.
It's a good feeling having another woman here.
Try and get some sleep now.
(church bells toll in distance)
MAN:
Hello?
Have you lost your way, friend?
Not hardly, Reverend.
I'm looking for a family name... Tuck.
Are you familiar with it?
Tuck. Tuck?
I'm afraid I can't help you.
There are no Tucks in this cemetery that I know of.
No, I wouldn't think so.
Ha!
Or in any other.
Tell me, Reverend you who have attended so many deathbeds... what is it people most desire as they face the end of their lives?
More time?
Well, I suppose.
Exactly.
They'd give almost anything,
I imagine, for one more year.
Imagine what they'd give for all eternity.
Sir, I don't quite understand what...
You will.
Reverend, are you prepared to die right now, this instant?
If it's God's will.
What if it is my will?
What if you could be eternal?
Right now, this instant?
Without having to face the uncertainty of death?
Hmm?
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
No muss, no fuss.
Invincible to disease.
Never having to suffer the stench and rot of old age.
Forever young.
You speak blasphemy, sir.
Fluently.
Good night, Reverend.
Hey, Winnie Foster, you asleep?
Not anymore.
Good.
Hey.
Listen.
How would you like to see the Eiffel Tower?
What?
Someday.
No, now.
While the day is still ours.
Get those dogs over there.
Yes, sir.
Come on, boys, let's go.
Henry, this is
Winifred's nightgown.
Give it to the dog handlers.
Start in the north end.
Let's split up when we get to the lake.
We'll find her.
I know we will.
Winifred!
Miss Foster!
Winnie!
Winifred Foster!
Miss Foster!
Winifred!
Over here!
I found something!
There it is.
This is the Eiffel Tower?
The one in Paris, it's pretty tall.
Mine's two feet higher.
Here.
Come on.
Have you really seen the real one in Paris?
Yes, I have.
And climbed 1,652 stairs to the top.
Much easier than this.
Yes.
You doing all right?
I think so.
You're doing great.
Here.
If I went to the Eiffel Tower
I would take one of those elevators.
Not with me.
You'd take off your shoes and walk up every single solitary step.
How old are you?
Do you really want to know?
Yes.
I'm serious.
So am I.
Let's just call it 17.
There's my Paris.
The view from the Eiffel Tower can't be better than this.
I've seen a lot of views, and this is one of the best.
(piano playing classical music)
Come on.
NARRATOR:
Winnie Foster was beginning to lose track of time.
Had she been there a day, a week, a month?
It seemed to Winnie that the Tucks lived in a way the rest of the world had forgotten.
They were never in a hurry and did things the slow way.
For the first time
Winnie felt free to explore, to ask questions, to play.
Me?
I'm going to see the world.
Every speck of it.
Heck, I may even find some new continents or something.
I mean, I've been to a lot of places but the world is huge!
Jesse Tuck, what-what are you doing?
What does it look like?
Woo-hoo!
Woo! Ah, whoo.
Come on!
I can't!
Why?
You're not afraid of a little cold water, are you?
No.
Are you afraid of me?
No.
Well, what then?
I can't swim.
You're joshing me.
I wish I were.
So, you're afraid you'll drown, right?
Swallow too much water, sink to the bottom and die.
Thank you for putting it so vividly.
And, yes, considering I'd sink like a rock drowning is a fair concern.
Well, I guess I'm just going to have to enjoy this all by myself.
Hmm...
Hmm!
Ah, Jesse!
Hey, hey, it's okay.
Come here, come here, come here.
I've got you, I've got you.
I've got you, relax.
Relax against me.
You all right?
I think so.
Whoo!
You did it!
I did it!
Ah, it feels wonderful.
I'm weightless.
That's 'cause we're carrying you, see?
The water and me.
We're both carrying you.
You like the feeling?
I love it.
Jesse, don't let go!
It's okay, it's okay.
There's no chance of that,
Winnie Foster.
I'm never going to let you go.
You know, I don't like being laughed at by a cheat.
Now "cheat" is a nasty word, sir.
I much prefer "card sharp."
You are looking for trouble, aren't you, mister?
Yes, sir, I sure am.
Going outside!
Come on!
Perhaps next time...
Come on!
He can't hurt me!
Whoo!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me, citizen.
You hear that?
Tuck says it's the most melancholy sound in all of nature.
Listen.
Just listen.
They're playing for you.
Whoo! Yeah!
I wish this moment could last forever.
Forever?
You want to spend forever with me, Winnie?
I do.
You know, we could see the world together.
We could do everything together.
Have a million moments like this one that... never, never stop.
There's a part about us you don't know... the part I've sworn not to tell you.
The secret?
The reason you don't want anyone to find out about you?
I knew it.
You're... you're bank robbers or grifters.
You are the first human
I've ever met
I wanted to know the truth.
Jesse Tuck, you're the first human I've ever met that I've ever wanted to... to...
...to do that.
Winnie, listen.
Remember the giant oak tree at the center of the wood where we met?
The little spring bubbling up you saw me drink from?
You remember when I told you
I was 104 years old?
Well... it's the honest truth.
I'm going to live forever.
I'm never going to change.
The same with Miles and Tuck and Mae.
Something happened to us.
As far as I know, I'm...
I'm going to be 17 until the end of the world.
It's the spring, Winnie.
The water, something's wrong with it.
It stops you right where you are.
If you had a drink of it today, you'd stay just like you are.
Don't you wish he'd told you... before you kissed him?
Did he tell you immortality isn't all the preachers crack it up to be?
Hey, leave her alone, Miles.
Oh, now... you want her to hear it, Jesse boy.
She's the first person you want to tell the truth to.
You just don't want me to have what you lost.
WINNIE:
Stop this...
...both of you and tell me the truth.
I want to know.
We all had a drink...
...except for the cat... that's important.
The water tasted like...
Heaven.
Floated over your tongue like a cloud.
Tuck carved a "T" in the trunk, to mark where we'd been.
We moved on west, looking for a place to settle down.
Put up a house for Mae and Tuck and a little shed for Jesse and me.
That was the first time we figured there was something... peculiar.
Jesse fell 30 feet, landed right on his neck.
He was up on his feet again before Mae could work up a good cry.
Didn't hurt him a bit.
No broken bones... nothing.
That's not all.
Not by a long shot.
Things began to happen.
Some brushpoppers mistook
- Mae's horse for a deer.
- (gunshots)
Thing is, the bullets didn't kill him.
Barely even left a mark.
Then Tuck got bitten by a rattlesnake, and you know what?
He didn't die...
...but the cat did of old age.
And Miles got married.
Daddy!
(whispering):
Beau.
Little Anna.
Tuck figured it early on.
It's the spring.
We all drank from it, even the horse.
Had to be... the source of our changelessness.
I begged her to come back... for me and find the spring and drink from it.
The children, too.
It was our only hope to be together.
She made up her mind
I'd sold my soul to the Devil...
...and she left me.
She took my babies with her.
Everyone... pulled away after that.
There was talk of witchcraft... black magic.
I went looking for wars to fight... and I saw brave men die at Vera Cruz... and then Gettysburg... thousands, in the blink of an eye...
(voice breaking):
...but not me.
I couldn't die...
...like little Anna.
The influenza took her before she's 15.
And Beau.
He'd be almost 80 now if he were still alive.
And my sweet...
...my sweet young bride.
She died in an insane asylum...
...old and alone.
(crying):
But I'm still here.
I'm still here.
Winnie Foster, you're the only other person in the world who knows about us.
We'll have to have a talk.
Pa.
Come on.
(whispering):
Look around you.
It's teeming life.
It's flowers and trees and frogs.
It's... it's all part of the wheel.
It's always changing; it's always growing like you, Winnie.
Your life is never the same.
You were once a child.
Now, you are about to become a woman.
One day, you'll grow up and you'll do something important.
You'll have children, maybe, and then one day you'll go out... just like the flame of a candle.
You'll make way for new life.
That's a certainty.
That's the natural way of things.
And then, there's us.
What we Tucks have, you can't call it living.
We just... are.
We're like rocks, stuck at the side of a stream.
Listen to me.
Winnie, you know a dangerous secret.
If people find out about the spring they'll trample all over each other to get to that water.
There's one thing I've learned about people.
Many will do anything, anything not to die and they'll do anything to keep from living their life.
Do you want to stay stuck as you are right now, forever?
I've just got to make you understand.
I don't want to die.
Is that wrong?
No.
No human does... but i-it's part of the wheel... the same as being born.
You can't have living without dying.
Don't be afraid of death,
Winnie.
Be afraid of the unlived life.
Your tea, sir.
She's with them now.
I came directly here, knowing how tormented you must be.
We-we just want her back safely.
Course you do.
Dreadful business, kidnapping.
Fortunate I was witness.
I'm perhaps the only person... who knows where to find her.
Just what is your game, sir?
What is my game?
You detect in me a playful mood?
"Playful" is not the word I had in mind.
What I have in mind is a simple, clear-cut trade.
You see,
I very much like your woods not for their timber, mind you but for their natural assets.
Wh-What is it you want?
You want your daughter.
I want your woods.
You're involved in this, aren't you?
If you have touched my daughter...!
I have my faults, Mr. Foster.
Kidnapping is not amongst them.
These are rough people, the ones who took her.
No telling what they might do.
Unless we do what you say.
Give the man whatever he wants.
Done and done.
Nice to have things legal and tidy, don't you agree?
You're an intelligent, reasonable man, Mr. Foster.
I'm seldom wrong as a judge of character.
Have your friendly constable on hand to make the appropriate arrests.
Your terrible ordeal is as good as over.
I'll get there before you.
We have to move quickly.
They were packing to leave.
ROBERT:
What kind of horrible people must these kidnappers be?
HENRY:
There is evil in the world,
Mr. Foster.
There aren't fences high enough to keep it out.
ROBERT:
Bring your men directly to my house.
I'm going with you.
It isn't fair, Tuck.
No, it isn't... but when has life ever been fair?
How am I going to take you home when I can't make my feet move from this spot?
If I could die tomorrow,
I'd do it... just to spend one more night with you.
Forgive me for interrupting such a tender moment.
Hello, Winifred.
Everyone's been so worried about you.
I'm relieved to find you so well.
You know this man?
I met him once.
Hello, Mr. Tuck.
You have no idea what a pleasure it is to meet you.
You're the man who's been following my boys.
Been expecting you.
Yes, and here I am.
Tell me, is it a relief... to finally be discovered?
Over a century of hiding out must have taken its toll on you.
Who are you?
And how do you know so much about us?
I first heard about your family from my grandmother.
She knew a woman in a mental facility who used to... rant and ramble about a family who never grew old and never died.
This woman, she used to call out a name.
What was it, now?
Anna.
Crazy old woman.
Kept on talking about a music box.
It seems the melody had a calming effect on her children.
I'm sure you know it, Mrs. Tuck?
You have no right... to come to our home... and bring us such pain.
There, good mother.
I mean no harm.
Tell us, sir.
What is it you want?
Well, you see, the Fosters have given me these woods in exchange for bringing young Winifred back home to them.
I have the papers, all signed and legal.
Gives me the rights to the forest and everything in it.
Don't be alarmed.
I'll let you stay here... on my land if you prove cooperative.
Cooperative?
I want you to take me to the spring.
I don't know what you mean.
Don't insult me, Mr. Tuck.
It's immediately clear to me that the water's powers have been wasted on... unimaginative people like you.
I intend to make this fountain of youth, as the simpletons would call it available to those who deserve it... for a price, of course.
You'll die of old age before I'll take you.
Is that so?
Then, perhaps Winifred will!
JESSE:
No!
Jesse!
(whispering):
Yes!
Bravo!
Come now, Winifred.
I'm feeling thirsty.
Show me where the spring is.
Perhaps I'll let you have a drink.
After all...
...then we can spend... eternity together.
- (yelps)
- (screams)
Winnie, Winnie, come here.
It's okay. It's okay, I gotcha.
Pa.
There they are!
Winnie Foster!
MAN:
I see her!
I got her!
Circle around to the right!
Watch the water!
Go!
Don't let anyone get away!
Jesse, come on.
ROBERT:
Winnie!
MAN:
Block that trail!
It's my father.
MAN:
Keep them alive!
Be careful of the girl!
Winnie!
Let's go!
Wait...
Get on.
MAN:
Behind the house, men!
He's setting the house on fire!
Winnie!
You're all right.
You're all right.
We found you. You're safe.
You're safe now.
Everything's all right.
Winnie.
Hyah!
NARRATOR:
The hall clock chimed the hour.
Outside, the wind was still.
Everything, it seemed, was waiting.
ROBERT:
We just want to understand what happened.
Winnie... try, please.
They didn't kidnap me.
I was with them because I wanted to be.
- (fan snaps)
- She doesn't know what she's saying.
The Tucks were kind to me.
They're my friends.
ROBERT:
If they didn't kidnap you, why on earth did that woman club that man over the head with a shotgun?
Because Mae Tuck was protecting me.
MAN:
Doesn't matter anyway.
That fella died.
It's a murder charge now.
I didn't much like the man but that won't stop that poor woman from hanging.
Miss is an eyewitness.
She'll have to testify.
Oh, my God.
I figured you might want this.
Doesn't exist, far as I'm concerned.
I sure am sorry about all this.
Good day.
Thank you, Henry.
(whispering):
Winnie.
Jesse!
Oh, it's you.
I was afraid
I would never see you again.
I need you to help me.
I need you to help us.
Mae can't go to the gallows.
She won't die.
She can't die.
They're going to find out our secret.
We have to get them out.
WINNIE:
Help me!
Please, help me!
Somebody, help me!
Please, someone help!
Please! Help!
All right.
Help me, please!
All right!
Help!
PI... Please!
Help me! You have to stop them!
They're after me!
Miss F... Miss Fo...
Who's after you?
The people who kidnapped me!
They're going to take me away again!
My parents couldn't stop them!
They're right outside!
You have to stop them, please!
Help!
They'll kill me if they find me!
Please, they're going to kill me, please!
Stay right there!
I'll handle this.
Hurry!
Help!
Come out and meet your doom!
Hell is upon you!
Stop right there!
You're under arrest!
Come on, we have to hurry.
The boys are outside.
Stay back, now!
I'll shoot!
My dear, sweet Winnie.
What I wouldn't do to keep you.
I wish you were ours... for Jesse.
For all of us.
(crying):
You have to hurry and get away from here.
JESSE:
Winnie...
Winnie, come with me.
There's nothing for you here.
We can be together forever.
If she comes with us, they'll hunt us down.
They'll never stop looking.
Tuck is right.
If I go with you it'll be too dangerous for all of you.
I can't go without you.
You have to.
Go back to the spring.
Drink from it.
When it's safe...
I'll come back for you.
Will you?
I have to show you the Eiffel Tower, don't I?
1,652 steps to the top.
Winnie... until we're together again... wake up with the dawn.
I will.
We got to go... before it's too late.
Winnie Foster...
I will love you till the day I die!
DOCTOR (whispering):
She's going fast but you can have a couple of minutes with her.
How are you?
MAN:
"...and to Almighty God
"we commend the soul of our sister
"and we commit her body to the ground.
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."
(pastor continuing indistinctly)
"...Resurrection into eternal life
"through our Lord Jesus Christ;
"at whose coming in glorious
Majesty to judge the World
"the Earth and the Sea shall give up their Dead;
"and the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him
"shall be changed, and made like unto his own glorious Body;
"according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things unto himself."
Mother?
I was just wondering what it is about these woods you love so much.
Mother, are you all right?
I'm going to miss her, too.
Oh...
Every time I look at you, you're different.
I'm losing you, too.
I'm right here.
Forgive me, Winnie.
I just wanted to keep you my little girl forever.
JESSE (echoing):
Go back to the spring.
When it's safe,
I'll come back for you.
ANGUS:
What we Tucks have, you can't call it living.
We just... are.
We're like rocks stuck at the side of a stream.
NARRATOR:
The first weeks of summer were long over.
There was a feeling that the wheel was turning again...
...slowly now, but soon to go faster.
Winnie and her family left Treegap to see the world.
She wasn't certain what herjourney might bring but this much she knew... it would be something of her own choosing.
For some, time passes slowly.
An hour can seem an eternity.
For others, there's never enough.
For Jesse Tuck, it didn't exist.
Tuck said it to Winnie the summer she turned 15:
Do not fear death, but rather the unlived life.
You don't have to live forever.
You just have to live.
And she did.
[Wind blowing]
[Distant shouting and yelling]
Unh!
[Rowdy shouting and yelling]
We have killed Babylonians!
We have killed Mesopotamians! 
We have killed Assyrians! 
Mycenaeans!
Sumerians!
But...
... we have never had the pleasure... 
... of killing... 
...an Akkadian.
[Loud cheering and shouting]
Which limb do I take first?
[Villagers shouting encouragement]
May the gods have pity on you.
Because my brother will not.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Crowd silences]
[Softly] Boo.
[Villagers shriek in terror]
[Hard rock music plays]
You missed.
[Hard rock music continues]
You're lucky we have the same mother.
MALE NARRATOR: Before the time of the pyramids, a fearsome horde came from the east... 
... and swept across the barren lands of the ancient world. 
[War-like drumbeat music]
By the law of the horde, their greatest warrior was proclaimed their king. 
His name was Memnon. 
He was the greatest swordsman the world had ever seen. 
With the predictions of a sorcerer, who could foretell the outcome of every battle... 
... Memnon slaughtered all who resisted him... 
[Crowd shouting and screaming]
... until only a brave few remained. 
[Crowd shouting]
Silence!
My father has called for silence!
Hold your tongues!
[Crowd becomes silent]
KING PHERON: We are gathered in this place to put our differences aside.
There is still time for us...
... the last of the free tribes... 
...to stand together against this tyrant.
With his sorcerer at his side...
...no mortal can defeat Memnon.
And, if the sorcerer were to die...
... what then? 
BALTHAZAR:
It's too late for your schemes, Pheron.
I have raided Memnon's caravans, broken the supply lines to his troops...
...but he still swept across the land like a plague.
I will not send my people to their deaths in a battle that can't be won.
And what people would that be, Balthazar?
You are the ruler of nothing... 
... but a pile of rocks... 
...and sand.
If I am no king...
...why are you on your knees before me?
Balthazar! Guards!
[Dramatic, rhythmic instrumental music]
Akkadians.
I thought they were wiped out long ago.
KING PHERON: They are the last of their kind.
By their hand, the sorcerer will die.
You put your faith in a clan of cutthroats who kill for money?
They are more than that.
They are skilled assassins...
... trained for generations in the deadly arts. 
What price do these mercenaries ask from us, Father?
Twenty blood rubies.
That's the last of our treasury.
Be quiet!
If these men kill the sorcerer, will you fight?
[Clan leaders shout their approval]
So be it.
As long as one of us still breathes...
...the sorcerer will die.
Assassin!
MATHAYUS: Him...
...we'll kill for free.
JESUP: We can reach
Memnon's encampment by nightfall.
Why do you keep that filthy beast?
He doesn't mean anything by it.
Horses are faster.
But camels are smarter.
[Slow, dramatic instrumental music]
[Mathayus whistles]
MATHAYUS: That one's mine.
Live free.
Die well.
ARPID: Stop! Listen to me!
I am a high priest of Set. 
Spare me, and I shall bless thee in five different languages.
You will scream in five different languages, horse thief!
Wait!
[Mathayus whistles]
[Slow, rhythmic rock music]
Hey! I'm not that heavy.
[Fast-paced, dramatic instrumental music]
Look out for the fat one! He's behind you!
Help me!
Help me, whoever you are, help me!
Thank you. Thank you, good sir.
Quiet.
Surely you've heard of the enormous reward for my safe return.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Mathayus whistles]
JESUP: The sorcerer's tent.
Back!
[Dramatic instrumental music]
GUARD #2: That way!
GUARD #3: Find the other one!
[Ominous instrumental music]
[Music builds]
CASSANDRA: You've been betrayed, Mathayus.
You know my name?
And why you're here.
[Climactic instrumental music]
GUARD #2: He's in the tent!
[Fast-paced, dramatic instrumental music]
A living, breathing Akkadian.
This is a rare pleasure. 
I hear you train yourselves to bear great pain.
You must teach me this, if you live long enough.
[Spits]
Not looking so full of yourself, are you now, assassin?
MATHAYUS: You...
MATHAYUS: . . Betrayed your own father!
TAKMET: Yes.
He was very shocked.
You could tell by the look on his face.
By my father's head... 
...I pledge my allegiance.
MEMNON: You have proven your loyalty, Takmet.
GUARD #4: This one still lives.
[Poignant instrumental music]
Beautiful.
Bring him to me. 
Mathayus.
Mathayus.
Live free.
Die well, my brother.
MEMNON: So...
...how shall this one die?
CASSANDRA: He shall not die tonight.
Really?
We shall see. 
Nor shall he die by your hand...
...or any hand you command.
You have seen this in a vision?
To ignore this would bring great misfortune.
The gods show him favor on this night. 
Just the gods?
A puzzle, then:
How to kill you without using my hand or any hand I command.
[Eerie instrumental music]
ARPID: Fascinating, isn't it?
This smoke, it causes the fire ants to abandon their homes, you see?
All the sooner to feast on our naked heads.
- You think that's funny?
- It's a little bit funny.
ARPID: Yes. You see, I am about to escape, while you are about to die a horrible death...
...for leaving me to die last night!
So, what are you waiting for?
You see that one up there?
He's been drinking that yak piss for an hour. 
And sometime very soon... 
You see?
[Rhythmic, suspenseful instrumental music]
RED GUARD #1: Where's the horse thief?
[Guard crying out with pain]
[Suspenseful instrumental music continues]
MATHAYUS: All right, come on, get me out of here.
ARPID: Do you...
...promise not to kill me?
MATHAYUS: Yes, I promise.
Remember, you are an Akkadian. You make an oath, you always have to keep it, right?
That's right.
Promise to take me with you and share in the spoils of your adventures.
What?
All right, fine. Yes, I promise.
All right. Now, hold still.
Oh, here's one.
Ah. That's a big one!
My, here comes the mother!
ARPID: So, where are we going?
MATHAYUS: To Memnon's kingdom to avenge my brother's death.
Never touch the bow.
Not a problem.
[Mathayus whistles]
- Who are you calling?
- My ride.
ARPID: It's a nice camel.
ARPID: Not much room back here.
Scoot up, please.
Aah. Hey!
We had a deal!
That's right. And I haven't killed you... yet.
MEMNON: What news from my sorceress today?
[Mystical instrumental music]
MEMNON: What news?
CASSANDRA:
Your armies will conquer in the west.
Queen Isis' forces will scatter to the four winds.
Give the generals the news. Have them make their armies ready for the final campaign.
TAKMET: Yes, my lord.
[Sound of tigers roaring]
MEMNON: You think I'm cruel, don't you?
Perhaps you've forgotten what it's like outside these walls.
Heartless, ignorant... 
...and savage.
But I can change that.
I will bring order after centuries of chaos. 
An order which will last for 1,000 years! 
Rivers of blood can never bring peace.
But they can bring obedience!
That will suffice for now. 
And when I become the king of legend... 
...then you shall take your place beside me, on a throne...
... and in my bed. 
But, my lord...
...in your bed, I would lose my gift of sight.
And you would lose your advantage in battle.
The day I speak of is the day I no longer need your vision.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
ARPID: Gomorrah.
After a hard day of looting and pillaging, there is no greater city than Gomorrah.
Except maybe Sodom.
I wish I could join you.
You're not going?
Believe me, I'd like to even the score with a few of those red guards myself.
But with the price they have on my head,
I'd never make it through the gates.
I have faith in you, my friend.
You'll get us in.
[Grunts]
[Poignant instrumental music]
You see? They've got the city sealed up tighter than a crab's buttocks.
I wish there was something I could do to help, but I-I--
But there is.
What business do you have here?
I've come to collect a bounty.
Horse thief.
I know this dog.
They'll behead him for sure this time.
He'll be all the prettier without it.
- What happened?
- You got us in. I knew you could do it.
A jug of your finest wine for my road-weary friend here.
Wait a minute.
The last thing that I remember was...
...this huge Akkadian fist coming straight into my...
BARMAID: Here's your wine, sir.
Let me know if there's anything else you'd like.
Ah. It's good to be back in the big city.
Watch my camel for me.
Gladly.
Been working here long time?
How's the kabob?
SWORD MERCHANT: Merchandiseof the highest quality. 
Virgin steel forged by the monks of Pompeii.
Here! Here they are! The world's finest swords. You can't get respect in Gomorrah without a quality blade...
Birds of paradise! Birds of prey!
The most beautiful birds in the world.
Hey, soldier, those big muscles look cramped.
- Perhaps one of us can help you relax.
- Maybe all of us.
[Arabic music plays]
[Mystical choral music plays]
TUTU: Mister, mister.
Guide, mister.
You need a guide to find your way in Gomorrah.
A good guide might be able to show
 me a way into Memnon's palace.
But a smart guide wouldn't, or he'd be shown into Memnon's dungeon.
[Children laugh]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
URCHIN: I don't have it!
[Dramatic, uptempo instrumental music]
[Light-hearted instrumental music]
Do you want to earn this one?
[Mathayus shushes Tutu]
Get ready. I'll kill half, you kill half.
All right. I'll kill them all.
How about we go around them and not kill anybody?
[Philos' chemical experiment explodes]
Good Lord! Are you going to kill me?
Maybe later.
Memnon's always threatened to have my head.
PHILOS: Don't touch that.
TUTU: What is it?
That's my special magic powder.
TUTU: Magic powder?
Yeah, magic powder. It's from a Chinese formula that I procured at great expense.
If I get the recipe right, it'll move mountains.
Clear roadways in an instant.
Do great things, wonderful things.
Or terrible things.
Like all my inventions,
Memnon will try to use it for war.
Where is Memnon?
You mean to kill him, do you?
Yes.
In that case,
I'd say he was in the training courtyard.
[Rhythmic drumbeat]
Aah!
[Memnon and sparring partners shouting and grunting]
[Crowd applauds]
[Lively instrumental music]
Shukrin.
[Somber instrumental music]
[Climactic instrumental music]
TUTU: No! Let me go!
I didn't do anything! 
You know the penalty for thievery.
TUTU: No!
[Tutu whimpers]
[Tense, climactic music]
TUTU: No!
GUARD: [Yelling] Intruder!
THORAK: Follow me!
You again.
How do I get out of here?
Through that door.
MATHAYUS: What's that?
PHILOS: That's one of my latest inventions.
It was meant to be a quick means of transportation, but there was a little problem with the landings.
[Pounding on door]
THORAK: Open!
Open! 
Don't touch that, you'll set it off.
Right.
[Mathayus yells]
Oh, my!
A man.
MATHAYUS: What is this place?
HAREM GIRL #1: Memnon's harem.
But he visits so rarely.
And it gets so lonely.
Can't you leave me alone, Thorak?
Watch your tongue, Philos.
Careful with those! They're delicate instruments.
You're lucky Lord Memnon has a taste for your science...
...you old fool!
If I find out that you had anything to do with this intruder, I will send the executioner.
We know how to please.
MATHAYUS: I'm sure you do, but...
GIRL #2: Stay.
GIRL #3: Stay with us.
MATHAYUS: That's nice, but now's not a good time.
We will make your every fantasy come true.
[Gong sounds and harem girls cry out]
[Tense instrumental music]
Kill him!
THORAK: After him!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
Go get him!
[Sensual instrumental music]
[Harem girls cry out]
[Mystical flute-based instrumental music]
CASSANDRA: Well, are you gonna try to kill me or just stare at me?
[Sound of guards trying to break down door]
Hyah!
- Ow.
- Humph.
Take a breath.
[Cassandra screaming]
[Slow Arabic wind instrument plays]
Gods be praised!
CASSANDRA: How dare you touch me?
Sorceress, I am an Akkadian, hired to kill you.
Now, I find myself in the position where you are more use to me alive.
Don't make me change my mind.
And he said, "It's not the size of the hump, it is the motion of the camel."
[Sound of women screaming]
Alas, I must leave you now.
EXECUTIONER: There's the traitor!
Great gods.
ARPID: He's dead!
Just admit it, you smelly camel.
I am your master now! You belong to me!
He is dead! Dead!
Dead!
You are alive! I knew it!
Right.
I was just saying to the camel:
"Camel, no one could kill our good friend Mathayus."
Get on.
Why should I make it easy for you?
You're sworn to kill me.
Others will die first.
That's comforting.
Who's your friend?
Memnon's sorcerer.
Memnon's sorcerer? Are you insane?
She's going to get us all killed!
MATHAYUS: Memnon must leave the safety of his palace to get her.
So you're going to use me first, and then kill me.
I feel so much better.
I could do it the other way around and kill you first.
So where are we going?
MATHAYUS: The Valley of the Dead.
The Valley of the Dead?
Nobody goes to the Valley of the Dead!
That's why they call it the Valley of the Dead!
Wait for me, please!
Take a dozen of your best men, track him down, kill him...
...and bring her back to me.
Send me news when he's dead.
THORAK: Yes, my lord.
TAKMET: My lord...
...there are rumors spreading to the armies that she is gone.
Is this true?
- It is, my lord.
- Then silence them.
MEMNON: They must believe she is here, if only for a short time.
And when you find the Akkadian...
...give him this from me.
[Mysterious instrumental music]
ARPID: Are we where I think we are?
Yes.
Home.
[Somber instrumental music]
Where are you going, sorceress?
[Frenetic instrumental music]
In a hurry to get back to Memnon?
No, I'm in a hurry to get away from you. 
I'll never go back to Memnon.
He's kept me prisoner since I was a child.
Why did you help me that night in the tent?
I knew you were the one man who could help me escape.
[Tender instrumental music]
Run, if you like.
There are worse dangers out there than me.
[Sound of camel nuzzing]
MATHAYUS: What do you mean you can't find it?
I know it's around here somewhere.
What are you looking for?
Just a place to get out of the storm.
What storm?
MATHAYUS: You'll see.
[Haunting instrumental music]
MATHAYUS: Thorak.
Memnon didn't come, did he?
He sent his maggots to do his work.
He's smarter than you think.
Or more cowardly.
Can I go home now?
Stay here.
MATHAYUS: Cover up.
You'll be safe.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
Hyah!
FALCONER: He's attacking. Alone?
The sun has fried his brain.
1,000 duranas to the one who brings me his head!
Hyah!
Hyah!
THORAK: Akkadian bastard!
Where is he? 
This way! 
You two first! 
[Henchman #1 yells]
[Henchman #2 yells]
Stay on the stones!
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
[Unexpected loud blast]
[Henchman #4 screams]
Come with me.
[Henchman #6 screams]
THORAK: Don't touch that.
[Henchman #7 screams]
[Henchman #8 screams]
[Henchman #9 screams]
Aah!
THORAK: Coward!
Show your face!
Aah!
Ah.
[Cassandra and Arpid gasp and cough]
The Akkadian.
Mathayus!
[Camel grunts loudly]
[Climactic instrumental music]
ARPID: You are alive! You swatted them like flies! You are invincible!
[Somber instrumental music]
Tell me, do you think you can save him?
His fever's high.
The poison was made with scorpion venom. 
If he does live... 
...the blood of the scorpion will always flow through his veins.
[Climactic mystical instrumental music]
ARPID: Sorceress?
[Gasps]
It is a miracle.
She cured you. I knew it! I felt her magic!
It almost killed her. 
But, the gods, they were on our side. 
Why? Why would you risk your life to save mine?
Because I believe you can save the people.
The people are not my problem.
Memnon is.
You and the people have the same problem.
[Falcon chirps]
[lmpassioned, dramatic instrumental music]
Pardon, my lord. A message from Thorak.
Finally, the Akkadian is dead.
Is there something wrong, my lord?
Not at all.
Everything is in order.
In fact, things are going so well... 
...that I'm moving up our plans.
Tomorrow night, we feast to celebrate our impending victory.
And then we'll drive the last of the rebels into the sea.
Now go. 
GENERAL: My lord.
It is customary for the sorceress to be present at these meetings.
Why is she not here today?
She is indisposed.
It is nothing serious, I hope.
MEMNON: If it were serious...
...then you would know about it.
Now go!
She is alive.
She is with him and he is coming here.
Get ready.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Explosion]
PHILOS: It works!
It works!
My lady, how lovely to see you out here in this desolate place. 
Let me show you. It works!
Come, come, come. 
My lady sorceress. 
You see? 
I worked it out.
My Chinese formula. My magic powder works!
All I needed was salt, petered salt. 
It was here all the time.
This place is just full of it.
By the way, do any of you happen to have any water?
[Poignant instrumental music]
CASSANDRA: What do you think, it is safe to drink?
[Arpid whoops as he jumps]
MATHAYUS: Not anymore.
Delicious. You see, the sandstone must act as a natural filter.
Quiet.
I'm alive! I'm alive!
For the moment.
[Ominous, rhythmic instrumental music]
Mathayus!
GUARD: Move.
Assassin!
The gods are good to me. 
When we last met, you offered to kill me.
Now I have a chance to return the favor.
You are trespassers here.
Our survival depends on this place being kept a secret. 
So we have a problem, as long as you're alive.
ARPID: No problem.
I can keep a secret like no other.
In fact, I cannot remember how we got here.
We took a left turn...
BALTHAZAR: It's too late for that.
CASSANDRA: Balthazar!
This place is sanctuary for all of Memnon's enemies. You know that.
- This man is dangerous!
- Your judgment is clouded.
My judgment keeps all of you alive!
This man cannot be trusted and I'll prove it.
Bring the woman to me!
The first man to touch her will have to come through me.
I had hoped for nothing less.
[Both grunt loudly]
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Crowd shouting encouragement]
[Fast-paced music]
That's not fair!
[Chicken squawks]
Get him!
Go!
Yeah!
Do you yield?
- Never!
- Then you're a fool.
MATHAYUS: We're brothers in the same cause.
BALTHAZAR: Brothers?
You brought death to my people.
Memnon will follow you.
He will come for his sorceress.
Yes, I know who she is. 
Memnon will stop at nothing to see her return.
He'll come swifter and deadlier once he has her.
Memnon will stop at nothing.
Hide here as long as you can, but believe me when I say he'll find you.
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep across this land and kill all of you.
[Balthazar laughs]
And who's going to stop him, Akkadian?
You?
Will you stand alone before the fury of his armies?
Yes.
[Majestic instrumental music]
[Crowd encouraging arm wrestling match]
A gentleman always lets a lady win.
Best two out of three?
BOY: Dates?
Thank you.
[Eerie, foreboding music]
MEMNON: [Voiceover] Cassandra! 
[Sound of pounding horse hooves]
[Gasps]
[Lively Arabic music playing]
CASSANDRA: I've had a vision.
Memnon will follow me here and destroy these people.
You know this?
The things I see...
...are like shimmers in a pond.
Some are certain and some remain shadows.
But I do know this:
Memnon will release his armies and ride straight through this place.
Memnon will die by my hand.
[Ominous instrumental music]
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
If you face Memnon...
...you'll die.
That is your destiny.
I make my own destiny.
[Poignant instrumental music]
[Camel grunting softly]
I need your help.
[Sounds of people chattering outside]
Where do you think you're going with my horse?
To Gomorrah.
Nothing we say will stop him.
Without your sorceress?
She returned to save the lives of your people.
I won't let her face Memnon's wrath alone.
Step aside.
BALTHAZAR:
Akkadian, you are riding to your death.
If I let you ride alone...
...what glory will there be left for me?
[Sound of rhythmic drumbeat]
[Fast-paced Arabic music]
[Crowd cheers]
This night we celebrate.
Eat...
...and drink your fill...
...for tomorrow we ride into battle.
[Crowd cheers]
I would have captured him myself, but he ran like a coward.
He left his bow behind.
[Women chuckle]
GENERAL: My lord...
...there is something troubling our soldiers.
How distressing.
Pray tell.
It's been said the sorceress is no longer by your side.
Soldiers will fall prey to...
...idle palace gossip.
You have my word, she is perfectly safe. 
If the men are to fight, to die...
...they may need more than that.
You doubt my word?
It is not that, sire.
It's just she is a symbol from which the men derive courage.
Symbols are most effective when seen.
CASSANDRA: My lord.
[Crowd murmurs in surprise]
I am here at your request.
Pardon my absence. 
I was not well.
But our impending victory has lifted my spirit.
Is this sufficient to placate your men?
Tell them what you see, sorceress.
[Foreboding instrumental music]
I see a great victory.
Your enemies will reveal themselves to you.
[Sound of horse hooves]
GATE GUARD: Halt!
What is in the cart?
What is in the cart?
Actually, it is a bit of a surprise. 
A gift for tonight's festivities. 
Prince Takmet's request.
GATE GUARD: Very nice.
GATE GUARD: Well, now.
Let's see that pretty little face.
[Dramatic instrumental music]
[Guard screams as he falls]
[Mathayus whistles and camel answers]
Now go to my chambers.
We have things to discuss.
GENERAL: My sincerest apologies, my lord.
I understand.
MEMNON: You are fearful, weak.
[Crowd gasps]
MEMNON: The feast is over.
To bed, men, for tomorrow we conquer!
Fortify the palace guard.
[Tense instrumental music]
Whoa.
MATHAYUS: All right, that was the easy part.
- Everybody know what to do?
- Cripple the guards.
Ignite the powder.
And try not to get killed.
What are you doing here? You could get hurt.
So could you.
Stay in the wagon.
You watch yourself, Akkadian.
No need for concern, miss.
Oh, he's gonna pay for that.
TAKMET: Seal the gates. Seal all the gates.
Though I'm relieved to see you unharmed...
...I am somewhat surprised the Akkadian didn't kill you.
He was after you. I was merely a pawn.
But you escaped his grasp.
I'm not without my wiles.
Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Bring them. 
Tomorrow my victory is complete.
MEMNON: That is your vision?
CASSANDRA: As I said, I have seen it.
Have you?
I sense a change in you.
You seem somehow... 
...diminished.
I assure you...
...I am myself.
Good.
A small demonstration shouldn't trouble you, then.
[Ominous instrumental music]
MEMNON: A simple test.
Now go.
Everyone leave! 
ARPID: Where am I going?
PHILOS: Stop.
It's over there. It should be just there.
[Suspenseful instrumental music]
PHILOS: Good man.
PALACE GUARD: Well, well.
What have we here? 
ARPID: One at a time!
MEMNON: Six urns. Four cobras.
Now...
...let's see what you can see.
[Climactic instrumental music]
Excellent.
One empty pot left now. 
Who dies first?
[Men shouting, women screaming]
PHILOS: We're almost there.
MEMNON: You know what I see?
Fear.
You have lost your power.
Thrown it all away.
[Music crescendo]
MEMNON: What magic is this?
CASSANDRA: Mine.
I see your fate, hollow king.
And its time has come.
Do you wish to test magic against steel?
I've come for the woman and your head.
The assassin and the sorceress.
How romantic.
[Shouting] I'll bury you both together!
[Fast-paced, suspenseful instrumental music]
PHILOS: And here it is.
The foundation stone.
[Fast-paced, dramatic music continues]
PHILOS: Hurry, we're running out of time.
I'm hurrying! I'm hurrying!
Fire in front.
Palace guard at your back. 
Looks like I'll be keeping my head after all, Akkadian.
Kill the witch!
[Fast-paced, suspenseful music continues]
BALTHAZAR: Mathayus!
[Slower, dramatic instrumental music]
[Sound of pounding horse hooves]
For your father.
[lntense choral chanting]
Die well, assassin.
It seems the gods favor me tonight, Akkadian.
Mathayus!
[Music builds to a crescendo]
PHILOS: Hurry up and light it.
ARPID: You hurry up. This is your invention.
ISIS: Follow me.
[lntense, dramatic music]
ARMY LEADER: Ready! Weapons!
[Mathayus groans in pain]
ARMY LEADER: Attack!
[Soldiers let out battle cry]
So much for not getting killed.
Catch this.
Oh.
[lntense music and shouting cease]
[Slow, dramatic instrumental music]
Hail to the king!
[Crowd cheers]
I knew it from the start.
- Hail!
- Yeah!
Mathayus!
[Triumphal instrumental music]
Stay here with us, Balthazar.
There's much work to be done.
I have to look after my own people.
You're a king now, Akkadian.
And a good one, I think. 
Don't forget how you got here, or the people you came from.
My people will live on through me.
Remember, there will always be a place for you here.
Live free.
Rule well.
Remember, Nubian eyes will be watching you,
Scorpion King.
I see a time of great peace and prosperity ahead.
How is it you see this?
Don't the legends say you'll lose your powers if you...
Can you think of a better way to keep a king from taking advantage?
Neither could my ancestors. 
How long will this time of peace last?
Nothing lasts forever, my king.
And that is the destiny of all kingdoms.
Then we'll make our own destiny.
[Music dramatically builds and crowd cheers]

I'm...
Not the monster I used to be...
I admit that.
I'm tired.
I'm weaker.
I'm losing my memory...
And I can't sleep.
Still, these friends of yours... well, they're dead now.
I tore all three of them to pieces... and tossed the whole mess off the cliffs out back.
Let the vultures fight over what's left.
This is ridiculous.
I try to withdraw...
I retire...
I hide... but still you find me out... even in my dreams... polluting my solitude... filling the air itself with your unending and pointless noise.
Go ahead, kill me!
Try it!
Try to be offended by my mere existence... you stupid fucking morons!
But don't send these flattering lackeys... with their cameras and their tape recorders.
Callous and shortsighted henchmen... talking to me like I was a goddamn child.
Shit!
The time it takes to kill these idiots is... it's depressing.
I can't go on like this.
If you won't come and kill me... well, then
I'll have to kill you.
Every last one of you.
Yes. You win.
Or it shall be.
I am awake again and put upon.
And then, well...
Silence.
Unless...
Fuck!
Fuck off!
Newsroom. Please hold.
Margaret, that's
Associated Press on line five.
Thank you.
You're late.
I'm twenty minutes early.
Yeah, well, so what.
Here. Go make some coffee.
There's a world of bad news out there... ladies and gentlemen, a world of bad news.
All we need to do is get our hands on the worst of it... the very worst news possible.
Fred, what do you got on the national scene?
Federal government's still on strike.
Old.
The nation's already forgotten... the government's on strike.
They're not impressed.
Has the president shot himself yet?
Rumors are unsubstantiated.
Well, substantiate them.
Domestic terrorist activities are up 60%%%... in the past two weeks.
Interesting.
A little ahead of the curve though... isn't it, Tom?
How many dead?
Hundreds.
Sad, but not catastrophic.
Judy, what about international?
Genocide in eastern Europe.
Economic collapse in Japan.
The Middle East, of course.
Bootleg nuclear arms being sold by the Russian mafia... to both Pakistan and India.
Climatic irregularities continue.
It's snowing in Johannesburg.
This is all last week's news.
It's filler.
Random facts to pad out the end of a show.
What do we have here in town?
What's happening down at city hall?
The mayor has sold lower Manhattan... to a major Hollywood studio.
OK. Sure.
That will fill air time till at least tomorrow afternoon.
Maybe by then the president will have done something drastic.
Have there been protests?
Violent demonstrations in all five boroughs.
OK. Cop an attitude about it... but not one we can't change tomorrow.
Come down hard on the mayor.
Careful, Boss.
Same Hollywood studio owns this television network.
So stupid!
Why?
Sorry.
What is it, Beatrice?
A clue has surfaced... as to the disappearance of our TV crew in Iceland.
What TV crew?
We sent them there two months ago... to investigate the legend of a monster said to exist... beneath an abandoned
U.S. missile silo... near an isolated northern village.
The local authorities searched for them but found nothing.
What turned up?
A tape from the sound recordist.
One of our envelopes. Look.
What's on it?
Someone claiming to have killed them.
Killed who?
Our crew.
Really?
Tell me more, Beatrice.
The cameraman was my fiance.
Really?
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Nevertheless, I think we should follow this up.
This has got potential.
We need to do these human interest pieces... from time to time.
Can it be me?
Can what be you?
Can I be the one to go investigate... the disappearance of the TV crew?
You?
God, Beatrice, I mean, who'll make the coffee in the morning?
I went to college.
I studied journalism.
Look, you're very young.
This could be dangerous.
Three young men have gone missing out there already.
Think of your family.
I don't have a family.
My mom died last year... and she was all that I had in that way... besides Jim.
Jim?
My fiance.
I see. Sorry.
Please.
"Dear Jim.
"It was real difficult to get a taxi to the airport...
"because some terrorists had threatened to blow up...
"the bridges leading out of Manhattan."
"So I tried to take the subway.
"But a religious group had set off nerve gas on the train...
"and we were evacuated before I even got ten blocks.
"Luckily, I was given a ride by two guys in a truck.
"They were demolition experts...
"and said they weren't afraid of terrorists...
"religious people, or anybody.
"They seemed happy and relaxed...
"and looked forward each day to destroying things...
"for a living."
"Waiting on line at the airport...
"I saw two men get caught trying to smuggle...
"radioactive materials out of the country.
"It's like my mom used to say...
"the world's a dangerous and uncertain place.
"A few moments here and there of selflessness and affection...
"are about as good as life gets."
I'm sorry, Miss, but your flight's been rerouted.
You'll have to fly to Brussels first... and make a connecting flight to Lisbon.
And from Lisbon... pending further notice... you'll be able to fly directly to Reykjavik, Iceland.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"I wish you could've known my mom, Jim.
"She would've thought the world of you."
Scott Andrews, please dial extension 3326.
"Still...
"I can't stop writing these letters to you.
"It keeps you alive somehow."
You need help, don't you?
Final boarding for flight 167 to Brussels.
Passengers traveling on flight 167 to Brussels... please proceed to gate 9A immediately.
Please have your boarding card and passport ready.
Once again, final boarding for flight one...
You've got to hurry up, miss.
They're holding the plane for you.
Go.
So what happened?
Airliner crashed into the Atlantic last night.
The boss wants an expose on the air by 6:00 this evening.
Did anyone survive?
I doubt it.
Come on, Judy.
It's got to be somebody's fault.
What's the airline saying?
They're withholding comment pending further investigation.
Fred, I want the names of everybody on that flight.
And I want a camera crew in the home of every parent... child, and relative you can get your hands on by lunch time.
Margaret, if you start crying, you're fired.
She was on that flight.
Pull yourself together,
Margaret.
This plane was headed to Brussels.
- We sent Beatrice to... where?
- Iceland.
Iceland. Yes, of course.
We sent Beatrice to Iceland.
It was rerouted.
Why didn't we know that?
Yes, I speak English.
Yes. Potemkin.
Coordinate 45-72 west...
38-50 north.
Yes. Have located survivor.
Request assistance now.
What is it?
They found someone.
She's sustained multiple fractures... three broken ribs, severe concussion.
Both her legs are broken.
She has much internal bleeding, extreme hypothermia... and severe damage to the spine.
It's a miracle she survived.
Jack, yeah, it's me.
Listen, regarding the Beatrice situation...
They say she'll be OK in time.
She might not walk again, though.
I'm sure we're gonna have an exclusive on the whole thing.
She's worked with me forever.
I can't remember.
A long time. How long?
- Five months.
- For five months. Really?
Well, anyway, you know, she's just a kid.
Yeah, she's pretty.
Pretty enough, anyhow.
You know, plain, well-adjusted... optimistic, completely out of touch.
She'll do whatever we want.
I don't want to talk to anyone.
The world needs to know.
- Why?
- What?
Why does the world need to know... what it was like to crash into the sea?
Prevention.
They need to know... all they can to prevent another crash.
I already told the people from the government... investigation team everything I can remember.
Technically, yes, but what about the experience?
What about the sensations, the drama?
Who were the cowards?
Who was brave?
The children, what were the children doing?
OK. We can talk more later.
They were people.
They were actual people.
All right.
Have it your own way.
You're on your own now, though.
You've got no one in this world, Beatrice.
Remember that.
A few weeks from now, this is all gonna blow over... and nobody anywhere is gonna give a damn... about the poor lonesome survivor of flight 167... and, for instance, her accumulating medical bills.
Just trying to help you out.
Thank you.
Beatrice, do you realize how rare an occurrence this is... how phenomenally slim the chances are of anyone... surviving a jumbo jet crashing into the sea?
You're a celebrity.
You're a media darling.
You're an institution just waiting to happen... a phenomenon.
It's no use.
We're going home.
Is it possible?
The operation has only been performed once before.
The pain and the effort of the surgery itself... will kill her.
It's not impossible.
Will it hurt?
Yes, it will hurt.
A lot?
Yes, it will hurt very much.
Good morning, Beatrice.
Are you comfortable?
I think so.
Can you understand me clearly?
Good.
Beatrice, in this procedure... we are going to need you to be as alert... and as communicative as possible.
We need you to help us.
Do you understand me?
Good.
During the first few hours of the operation... we will be administering a series of local anesthetics... at different parts of your body... calculated to wear off... as we proceed from one part of the operation to the next.
We know the parts of your body you have no sensation in... as well as those you do.
As we go on... you will begin feeling more and more.
And if we are having some success... we will reach the final stages of the operation... in which no anesthesia can be used... but at which time you will begin feeling more and more... of the work we are doing.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
OK, then... let's begin.
One, and stand by.
Program formatted.
One, and stand by.
Local anesthesia one.
Thirty-nine.
Anesthesia three... and pause.
Thirty-nine.
Local anesthesia three.
Pause... and lock.
Thirty-seven... and pause.
Thirty-seven.
Confirmed.
And ready.
Wait.
Now.
I think it's time for me to go.
What will you do?
I have to go look for Jim.
I have to find out what happened.
Your friends rented a car to take them as far as Bordheyri.
Beyond there, it's no use having a car.
They said they would return in a week.
They did not return.
Finally, after about a month... the police contacted me about one of my cars... which had been abandoned in that place.
Dr. Anna, do you believe in monsters?
A little.
Even you? A doctor?
A doctor sees all sorts of things... that are hard to explain.
Our job is to try to explain them, but sometimes we can't.
Maybe that's what people mean when they talk about miracles.
Like you, for example.
I was just lucky.
Or blessed.
He says they left the car at the garage... and hired a guide to take them by horseback to Heimsenda.
That's the village.
It's not possible to drive to Heimsenda.
There are no roads.
She says... even the horses will only go so far.
I'll be OK.
I know you will.
Where are we?
These stones, they keep the evil thing in the north.
Who lives in the village?
Only those who have to.
What kind of people are they?
You'll see.
He was standing right there... so close that he could feel the monster's breath... singeing the hair on his arms.
And he breathed fire at him, and his feet went up in flames.
He raised the house up off its foundation... and then he tore the door... off its hinges.
She says the monster has woken, and he's angry... and our offerings of whiskey are not enough.
We tried to tell your boyfriend and his crew to stay here... and to leave the monster in peace... but he wouldn't listen.
The Americans... tried to build a missile base out on the monster's rock.
I was a boy. I remember.
We tried to warn them, but they wouldn't listen either.
I was a child, yes.
I remember.
You could hear their screams for miles.
You could smell their blood on the wind.
Will you take me there?
We will take you just so far.
No further.
She says that you should spend the night with us... first.
What the fuck are you lookin' at?
Where am I?
Where are my clothes?
How did I get here?
Every once in a while, those maniacs down in the village... toss an unsuspecting piece of ass... up on the rocks down there.
A gift, I guess, for me.
What have you done with my friends?
I killed them, probably.
I don't believe you.
So what?
Are you going to kill me, too?
That depends.
On what?
On whether or not you're a complete fuckin' idiot.
What's wrong with you?
What do you mean, what's wrong with me?
Why are you like that?
Because I'm a monster.
There's no such thing as monsters.
I'm sure there's all sorts of reasons... why you are the way you are.
Genetic mutations, that sort of thing.
Science.
Are you a scientist?
No. I have a friend who's a doctor.
How did you do that?
How the hell am I supposed to know?
Now listen, sister, you gonna help me out here or what?
Help you?
What can I do to help you?
I don't even think I like you.
Yeah? Well, tough.
You're either gonna help me out here... or I'm gonna come down there, bite your head off... tear your heart out, and set the whole ugly mess on fire.
You don't scare me.
- What's your name?
- Beatrice.
Listen, Beatrice.
You'd like to see me dead, wouldn't you?
Not necessarily, no.
Of course you would.
I killed your friends.
If that's true, then I think you ought to be brought... to justice and punished so you can learn to understand... the wrong you've done.
The wrong I've done?
Yes. It's like my mother used to say.
Jesus had it all figured out right and proper.
One evil deed doesn't fix another.
You've gotta learn to love your enemies, too.
Jesus.
I can see this is gonna be a disaster.
Look, I'm gonna close my eyes, and you run away.
If you're not off the island by the time I count 1,500...
I'm gonna come, and I'll kill you.
Did you really kill Jim and his friends?
Who the fuck is Jim?
My fiance.
That's his video camera over there.
This is his PowerBook.
Come with me.
Where?
Just shut the fuck up and follow me, will ya?
So do you believe in monsters yet?
Leave me alone.
I'd love to, sister, but you gotta pull yourself together... and help destroy me first.
What do you mean?
That's the deal.
You come here and try and help kill me... and if you can't,
I get to dispose... of one more pain in the ass human being.
What the fuck is that?
It's loaded.
Of course.
OK, princess.
Take your best shot.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.
No, I can't.
Do it!
I'm not impressed by mercy.
You don't score points with me for bein' selfless, Beatrice.
Your life means nothin' to me at all.
Get over it and see the big picture.
You're just another human being.
Just another piece of the plague, so to speak.
I'd kill you just as easily as I'd kill a fly.
There would be no remorse... no pangs of conscience... no fascinating sensation of diabolic accomplishment.
It's nothin' personal.
You're just in my way.
I see extinction... in everything else around me.
The passing away.
Even the mountains pass away.
It's true. They do.
I've watched it happen.
But not me. No.
I'm changeless and eternal.
It's true.
I'm an alcoholic... and an insomniac, too, but then... who wouldn't be?
Doomed to endure humanity's victory over all things... without even the option of killing myself like they do... and for much smaller disappointments, too... in my opinion.
You're a kind person.
I can see that.
I don't know what good it's gonna do you, but...
I believe you have the presence of mind to see... the impossibility of my situation.
You want to be put out of your misery.
Don't pity me!
I hate that shit!
Are there others like you?
Are you sure?
You must get lonely.
There... there is a human being who can kill me.
He used to live in the house out there near the water.
Dr. Artaud. A scientist.
Mad as the day is long, but a genius all the same.
Where is he now?
He got to shootin' his mouth off... about his new invention, and the next thing you know... they took him away in a straitjacket.
You see...
Dr. Artaud... he believes in monsters.
So you want me to find him, is that it?
You will be doing you and your kind... the greatest of favors.
It can't go on like this forever.
If I don't find Artaud soon, well, then, I'll be forced... to go on a rampage and kill every human being I see.
Find him yourself.
I can't!
I get these fits!
What causes them?
People. Humanity. Civilization.
I don't know.
The more people there are, the worse it gets... and it's gettin' worse by the year.
Drinkin' helps.
What makes you think
I'll be able to find him?
'Cause you made it here alive.
Because you made it all the way here... without me tearing off your goddamn head.
I'm impressed, OK?
What do you want from me?
Promise me something.
Promises.
How you human beings love promises.
You can't kill anybody.
If nobody comes around,
I won't kill them.
It's easy.
But I want you to come with me.
Where?
To find Dr. Artaud.
You mean out there?
I can't go out there and be expected not to kill anybody.
Then I won't help you.
You're making this a lot more difficult than it needs to be.
Maybe.
You promised.
Are we connected yet?
It's ringing.
Beatrice, what's happening out there?
A monster? A real monster?
This isn't some sort of flash in the pan freak is it?
Right.
Artaud. Dr. Artaud.
But listen.
I want an exclusive on this.
Let us handle everything, OK?
Right.
We'll find this Artaud character.
If we can't find him, no one can.
But listen, I'm gonna need some interviews... a press conference maybe, certainly a photo spread.
Are you ready for that?
OK. Now hold on tight... because this is going to be very, very big.
I think we're gonna be famous.
Good morning, Miss Beatrice.
How was your flight?
I'll show you to your room.
Hello, Carlo.
Right this way.
I'm Carlo.
This is my friend.
All these people, they're my friends.
Hey, get out of here, friend.
Beatrice, what are you doing?
We've got a press conference in forty-five minutes.
- Who's this?
- This is Carlo.
- Fred, get him outta here.
- Bye, Carlo.
Come on.
What time is it?
It's early, but we've gotta strike while the iron is hot.
Margaret, where is that makeup girl?
- Wardrobe people are here.
- Great. You know the drill.
Cute, but sexy.
Maybe some sunglasses.
God, Beatrice.
What were you doing all night?
I was making love.
Aloha.
You must be... well, the monster, I guess.
You killed our TV crew, did you?
Tore them to pieces and threw their limbs to the vultures.
- I heard all about it.
- Where's Dr. Artaud?
We haven't found him yet.
Shit.
I can see this thing's goin' from bad to worse already.
It's rumored he was abducted by the U.S. Government... for research on top secret weapons development.
Wait. Listen.
Do you hear that?
Exactly.
Easy, gentlemen.
Matter is one.
Remember that.
The bar, of course.
Is that him?
U.S. Federal Marshal with ward of the state Dr. Artaud.
Margaret, sign for the delivery.
Thank you, gentlemen.
How are you, Doctor?
How was your trip?
My God.
I can see right through you.
Fritz, show me to the swimming pool.
No, wait. The patient.
He's upstairs.
I must talk to him at once.
Follow me.
No, not yet. We have the press conference first.
- Will there be food?
- Of course.
In that case, Fritz.
- Who is Fritz today?
- You are.
Right. Yes, doctor?
My notebook.
Get him out of here.
But...
But nothing.
If that asshole upstairs is a real monster...
I want him kept alive for as long as he's fashionable.
Move.
Hey, you. You in there?
Go away.
I want to talk to you.
Holy fuck.
Will you leave me alone?
Look, I want to apologize.
Apologize for what?
Listen, princess... you've just begun to make my life a living hell.
Look, I just feel awful about last night, you know?
All the noise we made, all the dancing and singing... and then... good lord.
The sex for hours and hours and...
You were over here all by yourself.
The only creature of your kind known to exist.
That was terribly inconsiderate of me.
I apologize.
OK. It's time to go.
Beatrice, why the publicity stunt?
Beatrice, does the monster obey your every command?
Is it true that a new line of cosmetics... is to feature your name and likeness?
Beatrice, are you and the monster lovers?
What's he really like beneath that tough-guy exterior?
Have you ever seen him kill anyone?
I have a question for the monster.
Let's get right down to the main issue here.
A monster in this day and age?
I mean, don't you just find that, like, irrelevant?
He breathes fire. I saw it.
He can't be killed with bullets, either.
Come on.
I remember... when you were young.
Pond scum.
Just another ooze on the edge of the local warm water.
I was there watching.
I saw you evolve.
Bored to tears,
I sighed and waited... as it took you millennia to turn into fish.
Cheering you on... jumping up and down, throwing rocks at you... as you crawled stupidly up onto the sand.
Pathetic.
I used to sneak down into your little villages at night... and grab some old person or a child... and I'd crack their skulls open on a rock.
Then I'd look... study... try and figure out how you work.
What made you morons so damned adaptable?
But there was nothing.
Blood, guts, and shit, same as everything else.
Pointless, absurd.
Just another fucking accident.
I used to stand on the cliffs at night... and howl at the stars, wondering what would become of me.
Was I gonna live forever?
I want to die, but I can't.
I'm indestructible.
I'm sorry.
It's not my fault.
It must be yours.
I know of no god who could be that cruel.
I know of no god... unless, of course, I am God... but then what difference would that make?
I'd still be fucked.
Round and round, the same old dead end.
Reasoning, logic.
Bored, finally, I'd... run down the mountain and terrorize the villagers.
That was just excellent.
Thank you very much.
Piss off, lady.
Where's Dr. Artaud?
These gentlemen are waiting to take you... to Dr. Artaud straight away.
Fred, where are they taking him?
He's on his way to Dr. Artaud.
Hey, watch it!
Where's Dr. Artaud?
I want to see the doctor!
Dr. Artaud's not far off.
Please be patient.
- Where's the girl?
- What girl?
- Oh, the girl.
- There's a girl?
Yes, of course there's a girl.
Get that goddamn thing away from me.
And who do you gotta sleep with around here, anyway... to get a fuckin' drink?
Matter is one.
Yes, of course. That's easy.
But, you see, are different densities.
Heavy and light.
It can interpenetrate.
- You see, it's proved.
- This proves it?
You doubt my methods.
It's OK.
The center needs a margin.
Have some wine.
Are you a scientist or something?
I'm on vacation... or lost, maybe.
We have to wait and see.
It's beautiful.
It is both an equation and an architectural schematic.
To know and to be.
This is not even a question.
There is no alternative.
You see, it's clear in the loneliest little avenues... between particles and waves... shunned even by the gregarious quark... unheard of by the various strands of time.
So large it cannot be seen... yet small enough to be immovable... lies the fabric of infinite reality... gripped in the tiny little concrete fist... of the all or nothing.
What do you call it?
The matter eradicator... invented to free a difficult friend... from eternal damnation.
You must be Dr. Artaud.
For what it's worth, alas, my name is mud.
They keep me locked in a room on the top floor... but I said rude things to the chambermaid... and she set me free.
I thought you were examining the monster.
Not yet. I've been left alone with my thoughts.
It is not so bad, really.
Come on.
We have to get out of here.
They've tricked us.
I'm so sorry.
Margaret, where is he?
It's so sad.
It's all over the news.
This beast, that has killed thousands... upon thousands remorselessly for hundreds of years... is now subjected to intense scientific experimentation... aimed at discovering his exact subcellular makeup.
Government researchers all agree this freak of nature... is as yet indestructible... impervious even to atomic radiation.
Sources close to the president claim the monster... is an invaluable strategic defense acquisition.
Remarkable.
He's beyond scientific analysis.
He's an unknown substance.
He's everything and nothing.
Professor, he has to be something.
Of course, but that something is something we cannot name yet... so we must not believe it exists.
But he is weaker than we thought.
He cannot stand information.
He's like an enormous satellite dish.
He feels passing physioelectronic... transmissions the way you and I would feel the ache... of a brain tumor.
He won't die, will he?
Oh, no. Quite impossible.
I assure you he's perfectly indestructible.
He can withstand this torture indefinitely.
I only hope that
I will be able to procure... the appropriate funding to continue my research.
We can help you with that.
I would appreciate anything you could do.
We have to get him out into the world, though.
But he's dangerous.
Yes, of course.
But he's made a promise to Beatrice.
A promise to a young girl.
What is it worth?
We'll have to wait and see.
Still, to let him at large and study him... under a multitude of circumstances... this could be extremely valuable.
My guess is people will be bored by the monster... sometime tomorrow afternoon.
It takes a lot more than the supernatural... to captivate the imagination of the demographic...
I have to deal with, Professor.
He'll fall from fashion.
He'll fall hard, and he'll fall fast.
He'll be ridiculed and abused.
This will make for very interesting observations.
Everything's set with the ship.
Be there at 6 a.m.
And ask for Vladimir.
Your flight leaves at 10:30.
You'll be met by friends of mine at the airport in Iceland.
I'll be there as soon as I can.
Don't talk to anyone.
Take care.
Kennedy Airport.
International departures, please.
Good. Very good.
It's just the right mix of pathetic and scary.
It's just a matter of time before he breaks his promise... and tears some punk to pieces.
Can we let that happen?
Look, we're not the police.
This is news.
We produce news.
Please hold.
Line two.
Beat it.
He's missing.
What have you done with him?
We haven't done anything with him.
The girl showed up and took him away.
Calm down. In the real world, we call that drama.
We've got it all here on tape.
It's fantastic.
Don't worry.
Dr. Artaud is gone, too.
- What?
- The Army has taken over.
I have been fired.
The shit has hit the fan, lady, and it's all your fault.
Artaud.
There you are.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- He's gone.
I know he's gone.
What happened?
He was spirited away by the ingenue.
Go find Margaret.
There's quite a hefty bar tab to be dealt with as well.
What is this?
Margaret kidnapped Artaud.
They hold me responsible.
It's a crisis situation.
The monster is gone as well, and Washington is afraid... someone else might get their hands on him first... not to mention Artaud.
The Chinese have already broken off diplomatic relations.
The Pentagon's declared a worldwide manhunt.
Special Forces have been mobilized.
The United Nations
Security Council... is meeting at noon.
Boss, don't worry.
It'll be all right.
- We'll call the network.
- They'll threaten somebody.
No. Don't you see?
This is perfect.
God, why didn't I think of this before?
The monster, Beatrice... they're old news.
This is just the twist
I've been looking for.
Sort of demonization of the media type of thing.
Don't worry. Get to work.
Keep me informed.
Gentlemen, I'm ready.
Take me away.
Yeah, me... whose voice in the wilderness... caused the birds to fall dead from the trees.
It was anger alone... that could turn the water at my feet suddenly ice.
Humanity shouldn't wait around for an apology from me.
Nope. Not the human beings, blindest of the blind.
The doers of all undoing.
The poison ivy of the universe.
The diaper rash of reality.
You noisy dumb bastards.
Listen. Come on, pull yourself together.
I'm tired.
I want to go to sleep.
So go to sleep.
See what I care.
I need you to keep a lookout.
The cook keeps trying to bother me.
About what?
You know.
What are you thinking about?
Nobody's scared of me anymore.
I'm scared of you.
I am.
They're coming!
But what will the world be like without monsters?
This monster is ourselves, our hope and our fear.
We created it, and it killed us in our sleep... and we saw that we were human.
It does not remember its beginning... because it began with us.
We formed him with a history.
We're so cruel, I think.
Not that we kill him, but that we put this responsibility... on his ugly shoulders in the first place.
He did not ask for it.
We're so good at this.
We talk things into reality... to convince ourselves that we exist.
And now the most vicious blow of all... to kill a creature by proving to him... that he's a figment of our own imagination.
Three minutes and counting to eradication of matter.
My friend, we meet again at last.
Is it true, Artaud?
Will it really work?
I think so.
- It's never been tried.
- But the numbers all add up.
We had to improvise.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Two minutes and counting to eradication of matter.
He'll never know what happened to him.
Beatrice, come away.
You can't be here.
One minute and counting... to eradication of matter.
Beatrice, please?
Man all stations and enter preliminary code red.
Program formatted.
Position one.
Stand by.
Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... four... three... two... one...
Code red.
Let me show you what I made today.
I can't wait.
I need to go upstairs and change... and then I'll start dinner.
Oh, yes, it's ladies night, and the feel--
Showtime.
Rough day at the office,
Mrs Dunleavy?
You'll feel better once you get out of those work clothes.
And into some sweats.
I wish you'd let me rub those feet.
Of course,
I wouldn't use my hands.
I think Victoria just told me her secret.
Deedly dee.
Are those things for me?
Mom, coming in.
Scottie Dunleavy?
What unfortunate timing.
Get out. Don't you know this is naughty time?
I'll get it.
Hello, Scottie. Why don't you be a good little boy... go downstairs and let your mother get comfy?
Who is this?
This is a big bird who wants to see the rest of Mommy.
Oh, my God, Scottie.
Is that a man up our tree?
No, no.
Tell her it's just a big bird.
Hey, pal, welcome.
Welcome to what? Where am l?
Aren't you that horny guy who was pretending to be a big bird?
Checking out that beautiful mom?
Yes, I am.
Now you'll see what a big horny bird actually looks like... in Hell!
I deserve this!
-Knock, knock.
-Hey, Jimmy.
-What are you doing, Nicky?
-Just jamming.
Your father wants you and your brothers in the throne room.
He's not retiring today, is he?
He wants to talk to you and Cassius and Adrian... about who'll rule Hell for the next 10,000 years.
Why do I need to go?
He won't pick me.
I happen to think you'd make a great Devil.
I'm not into evil and torture and all that stuff.
Plus, the Prince of Darkness should look distinguished... and let's face facts,
I'm no George Clooney.
You're not a bad-looking guy, Nicky.
Look at that picture.
I used to talk normal, too... before Cassius hit me in the face with a shovel.
That's me now, and I accept it.
Your brothers are two of the sickest guys I've ever seen.
For some reason, you're not.
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Their mothers were fire dragons and mine was a goat.
How do I compete with that?
Your mother was not a goat.
They're just playing with you.
If one of those psychos gets picked, I'm doomed.
I knew it, Adrian.
He's finally retiring.
Cassius, I've been waiting on this day for 10,000 years.
If the old man picks me to take over Hell...
I'll keep torture going 24-7.
No breaks.
Whoa, mama!
You got him right in the eye.
Hey! How's Daddy's little girl doing today?
I didn't see you guys.
What's up?
Shovel face, you want to mind-wrestle?
Nah, I'm all right.
I was thinking of chilling out by the throne for a bit.
I'm going to mind-wrestle you whether you like it or not.
I have to warn you,
I'm getting pretty good at it.
Then I guess
I can't make you do this.
Mercy. You win.
I give. Game over.
What are you boys doing?
Nothing, Dad. Just hitting the old punching bags.
Cassius... didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
I forgot.
Maybe this will help you remember.
Now, everybody come sit down.
-Hey, Dad.
-Yes, son?
I know you got a lot on your mind... but I almost finished that
Monsters of Metal compilation.
I really think it's turning into a masterpiece.
OK, kid.
We'll listen to it later.
Thanks.
A window.
Hello, Mr Devil.
I like your cape.
I deserve this!
Fellas, this, as some of you might know... is my 10,000th year as Prince of Darkness... so I think the time has come to discuss who will succeed me.
-Knock, knock.
-Yes, Jimmy?
Don't forget-- you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four p.m.
This was a very difficult decision... because I have three wonderful sons.
Adrian--so smart, so ruthless.
Wears makeup.
And Cassius-- so strong, so tough.
Don't forget clinically insane.
And Nicky... such a sweet boy.
But after much thought and careful consideration...
I've decided that the ruler for the next 10,000 years... is going to have to be... me.
-What?
-Hallelujah!
I mean, that sucks!
The important thing for the stability of our rule... is to maintain the balance between good and evil... and I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility.
Dad, this is bullshit!
I don't like that language.
Right. Send him in.
Sorry, boys.
I have to get back to work.
It was good hanging with you, Dad.
I'll check you later.
You're serious?
Off, off, off!
Damn!
Twenty thousand years ago,
Grandpa Lucifer said...
"It's better to rule in Hell than to serve in Heaven."
Well, I'm tired of serving in Hell.
We need somewhere where we can rule.
Bring it on, big man.
Let's see what you got.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
I am concentrating, man.
I'm sorry.
After careful consideration,
I must respectfully decline.
I can't stand retirement.
Just let me win one Super Bowl.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul?
You're much too nice a guy for that, Mr Marino.
You did it for Namath.
Joe was coming here anyways.
This sucks.
I'll go to the Super Bowl as an announcer... and win myself an Emmy!
That's the spirit.
You're a good Devil, Dad.
I also happen to be a Jets fan.
What do you think about Earth?
We could create our own Hell there.
Are you saying we go up there and kill everyone?
Eventually, Cassius... but first we'd have to corrupt as many souls as we can... so when we do destroy them...
Their damned souls will be ours.
It's our time, brother.
This is not good.
Whoa, whoa.
Fellas, what are you doing?
We're leaving.
You can't go through there!
The fire flows in, not out.
You really suck!
Your Evilness!
Cassius and Adrian have escaped from Hell.
They went out through the fire and froze it.
I tried to stop them, sir, but they overpowered me.
Calm down. Get off your knees.
Thank you for understanding,
Your Wickedness.
You're the man.
I've always said that.
Are there boobs on my head?
Yeah. Big ones.
What's going on, Dad?
I'm going to die, Nicky.
The gates are broken.
No new souls can get in, so I'll start to deteriorate.
What's with all those "hoo hoo" noises?
Everything's fine, Pop.
Everything's fine?
Who are you bullshitting?
Last time you said that, the Renaissance happened.
Please, Pop, go back to your room.
Can I take him with me?
Sure, Pop. Whatever you want.
Tit-head, go with my father.
Not a damn soul is going to get through that.
This fire is solid as rock.
We got to get this bad boy burning again.
To do that,
Cassius and Adrian... have to come back through the other way.
So go get them, Dad.
I'm too weak.
The process has already begun.
So go get them, Jimmy.
I'm just a demon.
No Devil blood in me.
I wouldn't last two minutes with your brothers.
Are you saying it's up to me?
You said no souls could get through that.
Nicky, are you a soul or the spawn of Satan?
I never been to Earth, Dad.
I never even slept over some other dude's house.
The worst thing that could happen is you get killed.
In which case, boom-- you end up back here.
So I need to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
No go. They left together at the exact same time.
They must come back together at the exact same time.
Here.
Get them to drink from this.
One sip, and they'll be trapped inside.
Once you've got both of them, bring it back through the gate.
Let me, sir.
Gross!
He's got less than a week.
Dad, I don't know if I can do this.
Son, you...
Try your best.
Earth.
It doesn't look too bad.
You were gone ten seconds.
What happened?
I got hit by this big light attached to a lot of metal.
That's a train, son.
Don't stand in front of them.
I'll have to take a mulligan on this one.
Please, Nicky, get back up there.
All right.
I'll get that for you, sir.
I'm Nicky.
That's terrific.
Now get off the track and come with me, handsome.
Welcome to Grand Central Station in New York City.
My name is Beefy.
I'm an old friend of your father's.
He asked me to help you out.
I just want to find my brothers and be on my way.
It's not going to be easy.
Your brothers can possess people... so they probably won't look like themselves.
You have to be suspicious of everyone.
All right, bro.
The jig is up, then.
Get in the flask.
It ain't me, moron.
Sorry.
There's this blind guy outside you might think is possessed... but he's just crazy.
Though I cannot see with these blind eyes...
I know the good Lord still loves me.
He loves all of his children.
-Why, he loves you...
-That's him.
...and he loves you.
Here he goes.
You make the Lord very nervous.
All right.
-I'm burning now.
-Take it easy.
Hellfire is burning me alive!
He's burning.
The Beast is alive!
He's among us!
Clear the streets!
The Devil is here!
Making friends already.
I don't know what that guy's problem was.
It's freezing up here.
You're in the human world now, kid.
You'll feel a lot of new things you never felt before.
Let's get you some warm clothes and hot food.
Put it in your mouth.
Now move your teeth up and down.
Up and down.
Good, numb nuts.
Now you got to swallow it.
Tilt your head back... and let the meat slide down your throat hole.
Easy. Don't choke.
Popeye's chicken is fucking awesome.
Now eat up.
You'll need your energy.
I got energy up the ying-yang.
Let's save Dad.
Adrian! Cassius!
Oh, boy.
So nice.
I like your brassiere.
Thank you.
Could you guys maybe not tell anyone about this?
You got it.
Do you mind maybe not telling anybody about this?
You got it.
Look, sidewalk equals safety.
Middle of the road equals death.
From now on, I'll just avoid all moving metal objects.
Great. Now, your father gave me some deposit money... for a nice pad on the Upper East Side... but I misplaced it.
I'm wasted!
So I found this other joint for you... but you're going to have a roommate.
There's only one thing better... than drinking an ice-cold whiskey sour... on a hot Alabama night... and that's telling the truth.
I know what you think about me, Grandma.
You think I'm worthless.
You think I'm a stumblebum... who ain't never going to amount to anything.
Well, old woman, you are wrong.
You are wrong.
Hello, friend.
My name is Nicky.
I understand you are seeking a roommate... as per your ad in the "Village Voice."
Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Don't you want to know what rent is?
Yes. What is rent?
It's 1,200, split down the middle.
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
I rehearse with my partner... so the living room's going to be off-limits.
Off-limits.
Aren't you boiling hot in that outfit?
It's 80 degrees in this hallway.
Where are you from, the South?
The Deep South.
-Why is that funny?
-I don't know.
OK. And sorry, guy, but no doggies allowed.
Go on. Big day tomorrow.
And don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Gotcha.
You're not my brother, are you?
I'm an only child.
You love acting.
I love pissing.
Oh, my God!
In today's Gospel... the Lord tells us how we should live... if we wish to attain the splendour of Heaven.
Or something like that.
Jesus this, Moses that.
Abraham hit me with a wiffle ball bat.
The Lord said a lot of hibbity jibbity bibbity swibbity.
But... has he ever really done anything for any of us?
Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway?
No.
I love that car.
Has the Lord given any of my enemies the herpes?
No.
The Lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs.
Ma'am, I know your son... and, believe me, he was better off on the drugs.
At least when he was smoking hashish... he used to make me laugh occasionally.
After we tried for many years... the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby.
Your best friend Fitzy helped your wife.
He helped her conceive it all night long.
How about you, Mayor?
Has the Lord ever done anything for you?
Well, you know, I wished
I could think of something... but, to be honest with you,
I can't.
I can't think of a damn thing he's ever done for me!
Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord... if there is ultimate punishment for our so-called sins.
Why don't we just have fun... and do whatever the Hell we want?
Let the sin begin!
Let the sin begin.
That was a good one.
This is so much fun!
I never want it to end.
Why should it end?
Who's going to stop us?
Come on. There's ten million people in this city... and the clock is ticking.
Let's rock and roll, then.
-Get in the flask.
-I'm not thirsty!
Cassius, I'll show you.
Cassius, get in the flask.
Get in the flask.
-May I help you?
-Get in the flask.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about an eight-piece. Let's go.
Look, it's OKfor me to shit in the street... but you got to use a toilet.
Nicky, where are you?
Aw, come on.
What's he doing now?
Just get in the flask.
I got to get Adrian.
Gary's so hairy.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
All that chasing and running around... is making me want to do the sleep thing again.
Kid, I like your enthusiasm, but we have to work on... narrowing down our list of suspects.
I'm going to check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Kid's got a lot of evil in him just begging to come out.
I will eat your heart.
There's our man.
Mr Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
What's with that guy?
It's got to be one of his disciples or something.
My man's into deep nocturnal shit.
I think that Devil guy just got ripped off.
-Should we wake him up?
-You do it.
Rise and shine, Devil guy.
Some dude stole your shit.
What? Where?
-Which way did he go?
-That way.
Thanks. Give me back my flask!
Did you check out the dragon mouth?
The Dark Prince is here.
Check out my stuff.
I got a comb only used twice.
I got a pepper shaker.
A silver doodad from Africa.
See something you like, my man?
I would like my flask back.
You calling me a thief?
I'm calling you the guy who has my flask.
How would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
-I don't know.
-Now you've done it.
You messed with my business, bitch.
I would appreciate it if you kept your voice down.
You going all crazy-eyed on me.
I'll show you some crazy eye.
Look at this.
Come on, let's get busy.
-Excuse me, sir.
-Who?
Does that flask belong to this man?
You calling me a thief, too?
Damn.
Look, the guy you ripped off walked by and busted you... so why don't you just give him his flask back?
You going to bite me with your snaggletooth if I don't?
No. But that policeman might have something to say.
Take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy.
Get your raggedy-ass clothes and find another corner... before I show you what crazy really is.
Fine. I will.
I'm a businessman.
I'll be seeing you in a few years.
Excuse me.
That was amazing.
I just wanted to thank you.
That's OK.
I get messed with all the time.
When I saw him do that to you,
I just lost it.
I hate when people take advantage of tourists.
What makes you think
I'm a tourist?
Your accent, maybe.
Well, where are you from?
-The South.
-Really?
The Deep South.
Why are we laughing?
I don't know, but I was enjoying it.
Your glasses are pretty.
They make your eyes look big and sparkly.
It's fun looking at them.
My dad's an optometrist.
My dad's in Hell, and he's falling apart.
I'm sorry.
It's really tough when your folks get older.
I don't know what I would do if I couldn't save him.
I'm sure a nice Southern boy like you... will figure something out.
You want some Popeye's?
No. I had my lunch already.
But I wouldn't mind getting a gelati.
Could I come with you to getting a gelati?
If you want to.
-Here you go, pal. Enjoy.
-Thank you.
It's freezing my hands.
-Even with those gloves on?
-It's cold.
-Let me wrap it.
-Please. Thank you.
Gelati.
Better?
Why are you taunting me with your darkness?
Your evil, it's stinking up our streets!
The end is near!
We are all going to die!
This town is really going to Hell lately.
What part of town do you live in?
I have an apartment.
I'm not sure where.
My dog knows, though.
You have a dog? What kind?
I don't know.
I'd ask him... but he's uptown meeting his contacts.
Say "Mr Beefy." Say it.
Mr Beefy.
And I love you!
You go to school?
What's that like?
I go to Parsons School of Design.
I knew growing up
I wasn't much to look at... so I concentrated on making things that are pretty.
You have a nice smell coming off you.
That's my perfume.
It's called
Comme de Sud Pacific.
I think that's French for "Coconuts."
That's better than the gelati.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies... flapping around in my stomach right now.
Is that normal?
Sometimes, sure.
Good, because I was concerned.
Why did they do this to me?
I was good to them.
I can hardly notice. Honest.
I sure hope Nicky's kicking some ass on Earth... or we are doomed.
I was the one who created Hell.
I know, Your Hatefulness.
Actually, the credit belongs to my first wife.
She was the inspiration.
Chewbacca, take it easy, will you?
You look like my first wife.
Only she had more hair.
In another startling announcement from City Hall...
Mayor Randolph has, effective immediately...
Iowered the legal drinking age from twenty-one to ten.
When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific.
But when a child goes...
That's why I'm in this business.
Little Nicky.
-Know what's nice about you?
-What?
I like the way you're happy just being yourself.
You don't try to act cool.
Thanks much, Valerie.
You know what's nice about you?
Your juicy heart-shaped heinie.
What was that?
I don't know why I said that.
I meant to say that...
I've always dreamt about having sex with a gross pig.
Can I wash my winky in your kitchen sinky?
You're a real jerk!
I didn't mean to be.
What the--Adrian!
Dad needs you to come back to Hell.
So he sent old Shovel Face to fetch me.
I'm not kidding.
He's in trouble.
So are you.
Hey, Valerie!
What is your problem?
I'm sorry!
Adrian, you froze the fire gate, and Dad is dying... so get your booty back home or else!
You can't talk tough, Nicky.
Even the voice inside your head has a speech impediment.
You're going back because I'm going to make you!
How about this?
I'll stay here... enjoying my pizza and my peppermint schnapps... and you go back.
Adrian, don't!
Cut the crap! This is serious!
Come on!
I was driving to work today... some bozo in a Cadillac cuts me off.
So I followed him.
When he got out of his car,
I run up behind him... and start bashing his brains in with this bat.
Did you ever see
"The Untouchables"?
I was De Niro!
What's happened to you, Regis?
The mayor's office today... along with the New York
Board of Tourism... unveiled its new motto to replace "I Love New York."
"I Love Hookers" will now be the city's catch phrase.
Your brothers are upsetting the balance... between good and evil.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
But those are my roommate's sodas.
"But those are my roommate's sodas."
Does that sound like a statement the son of the Devil would make?
All right. Take it easy.
You have the power to change the cola in that can... into any other liquid.
Engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss.
You just have to release the evil within.
Release the evil?
I'm just saying there's wickedness in you.
I can tell from your snores.
Really?
Release your evil.
Release the evil.
Come on, you can do it.
There it is.
You got it in you.
What are you doing?
I'm going to pretend I didn't see a dog on the couch... because my brain just can't process that right now.
But were you about to drink one of my Cokes?
No. I was just looking at it.
It's beautiful.
This Coke tastes like Pepsi.
You changed a Coke into a Pepsi?
That was your big transformation?
Come on, man, give it up a little.
It was pretty good for my first try.
Do you care that your brothers are killing your father?
Yes, I care!
And he is not going to die!
Atta-boy.
I'm freaked out.
My television just blew up.
You're damn right it did!
I mean, really?
I know this is your living room time... but could I finish watching the Globetrotters out here?
It's the craziest game
I've ever seen.
He's walking! Get him a bus!
This is the part I don't get.
Another terrible call.
There's no way that was travelling.
What's with all the calls?
We haven't lost in 53 years!
Guess what, cornrows?
Technical foul!
You're out of here!
Why's the referee being so mean to the Globetrotters, Daddy?
I've been watching these guys play since I was your age.
It's all part of the show, baby.
That guy in the striped shirt... snapped his fingers like somebody I know!
Normally the Globetrotters represent family entertainment.
Who gives a shit?
These kids came here to see the Globetrotters win!
Ten points off the Globetrotters on account of the bigmouth!
It's all part of the show, baby!
Hit the half-time buzzer.
I'm tired.
If the second half doesn't get any better than this... you can expect a full-scale riot.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is now time... for the Globetrotters' half-time half-court heave-ho throw!
If the contestant makes it... everyone here will get a free pizza pie!
I ain't taking the shot.
These people are crazy.
Excuse me. I'll take that shot.
What made you want to see the Globetrotters today, son?
I came for the beer and the bitches.
Look who's back from the dead.
Six-six-six! Pickup sticks!
Please welcome Miguel Sanchez from the Bronx, New York!
What's Nicky doing there?
Trying to capture his brother in a flask... and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
-Did you just talk?
-No.
-Are you Miguel from the Bronx?
-No. I'm Nicky from the South.
Hey, give me that!
You better win these people some free pizza... because it looks like they're about to kill each other.
All right.
Who's that man, Mommy?
I don't know, but he sure is butt-ugly.
Release the evil.
Too much evil.
I think that ball just blew up, and, yes, my hair is aflame.
I don't know what the Hell that was.
-Don't do it again, huh?
-All right.
I command you not to blow up and go into that metal circle.
Get that crap out of here!
I know you're having fun,
Cassius... but you really got to come back to Hell.
Look around you, Nicky.
We're in Hell. The new Hell.
Do it! Do it! Do it!
I was sent here to take you back... and that's what I'm going to do.
Don't make me take out the shovel again, Trick.
I think we're about to see a Devil showdown.
Dad got sick when you guys left.
I'm glad he's dying... because it's my turn now.
You're going to wish you never said that.
Take him to the hole, Nicky.
I mean, woof woof.
Come on, brother, come on!
Come on!
Daddy can't help you!
Enough!
This show gets better every year!
That was sick.
Who taught you that shit?
Sorry, Cassius.
It must be the Super Devil Juice
Dad gave me.
Super Devil Juice?
Give me that, little girl.
Don't drink out of it, please!
Now that was some straight-up
David Copperfield shit!
Damn you, Nicky!
There ain't no Super Devil Juice in here!
Hail, Nicky!
We are forever your slaves!
-So your father's the Devil.
-Sí, seòor.
You're a talking dog from Hell.
You guys are who?
A couple of big fans of Nicky and the work his dad does.
By the way, Nicky, check this out.
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
John, absolutely nothing.
The Blizzard always came straight with his messages.
But wrap your minds around this, gentlemen.
Chicago.
I love this song.
I command you in the name of Lucifer... to spread the blood of the innocent.
Oh, my God, Chicago kicks ass!
That was awesome.
You know, guys, this cake tastes a little funny.
I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix.
Thought I'd spice up the bash.
-Really?
-What's reefer?
About five hundred bucks an ounce.
Come on, Nicky, one more time.
I can't. It's starting to hurt.
Come on, you totally got to!
All right, all right. Last time.
Here he goes!
That's insane!
How do you do that?
I used to get messed up like this... with my first girlfriend
Heather.
We'd get so loopy, she would forget I was a dog.
-She was a human?
-No. A sewer rat.
Man, that pissed my parents off.
You know, I was in love once... but she said I wasn't financially reliable... and she needed that.
By "she," do you mean "he"?
-No.
-Busted!
Please.
How you feeling over there,
Satan Abdul-Jabbar?
A little strange.
I can't stop thinking about this girl Valerie.
Why? Did she hurt you?
Do you need to cry on my shoulder?
Easy, Liberace.
Would you grow up?
Liberace.
I was having the best day with her... until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped heinie.
Maybe you love her.
But what do I know?
I can't even see straight.
Me, too! We got to get going.
You guys can crash here.
I have an extra futon.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Ozzy starts in 30 minutes.
That'll cheer you up, Nicky.
Yeah, let's roll.
I can't give the Ozz man the full focus he deserves.
Sorry, fellas.
This chick must be the real deal, then.
-Later, bro.
-Good-bye, John.
-Good luck, Nicky.
-OK, Pete.
You better snap out of it soon, kid... because we're going after Adrian tomorrow... bright and early.
Night-night.
Yeah, I know.
Get some sleep thing, Mr Beefy.
That is the most horrifying thing I have ever seen.
Go to her.
All right.
I smell coconuts.
Coconuts.
That dude looks like a lady.
You want to come in?
Actually, I'm looking for a girl named Valerie.
Valerie Veran?
Two floors up, one window over.
Thanks much.
Good luck with the nipple rubbing.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
I can see that.
Oh, my God!
Nicky, is that you?
Stay right there.
I will.
What were you thinking coming here?
I don't know, but it didn't involve going blind.
Oh, my God! Nicky!
Please don't die!
What are you doing?
I think I'm floating.
Why would you be floating?
Maybe it was because of this cake I ate earlier.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now?
Because I am.
I'm freaked out, too.
The butterflies in my stomach are flapping around... in a way I've never felt before.
You got the wrong window again, man.
Oh, sorry, Nipples. Valerie!
-Nicky, over here.
-I'm coming.
Oh, my God, you made it.
Valerie, I can see again, and you look beautiful.
Just because you're floating... doesn't mean I'm going to forget you giving me the finger.
That wasn't me.
I was being possessed by my brother Adrian.
What do you mean, possessed?
Remember when I told you that my father was in Hell?
That's because he's the Devil... and he wants to keep his throne for another 10,000 years.
And that pissed off my brothers... so they broke the gates of Hell... which is making my father decompose.
I love my father very much, so I came to Earth to save him.
Now I get that Deep South joke.
I don't know if I should believe you.
You got to believe.
Believe in the butterflies.
Wait. OK. OK, OK, I believe.
Come on. Come back up.
Take my hand, Valerie.
Fly with me.
I can give you the power.
That's the Empire State Building.
There's Popeye's chicken-- right there.
The Hell Beast is above us... and I can smell an evil slut.
Whoa, Devil!
Did you do that?
Nobody calls my girl an evil slut.
Good morning, New York.
This is an "Action News" special report.
A shocking crime... results in a record fifty-million-dollar reward... for the capture of this man.
His name is unknown... but his actions have earned him the label "The Monster."
He should be considered armed and extremely dangerous.
The man who caused such a sensation... at the game yesterday is no hero.
He is, in fact, a mass murderer.
-This is real bad.
-Where the heck is Nicky?
I have authorized a reward... to the person who brings this man to me.
It's a setup.
Good morning, young lady.
That looks like it tastes great.
Look at that.
Mr Beefy would like you.
Oh, look.
There he is!
Wait. Wait.
What is happening?
There he is!
I'm not a monster.
Release the evil.
Beefy, I think I'm in trouble.
The shit has hit the fan, kid.
Take a look.
This videotape will show what he did... after he left the game.
Say hello to my little friend.
My name is Nicky... and I'm going to kill all you suckers for no reason.
That's not me! That's that cockroach Tony Montana!
-Difficult to watch, I know.
-This is Adrian's work.
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Which is probably DePalma's third best film.
I'm not Nicky.
Dude, it's us. Let us in.
-John! Pete!
-Nicky!
There's a total mob scene coming this way.
It looks like they're following a giant trail of bug shit.
What do we do now, Beefy?
I don't know. This is a little out of my league.
-What would your dad do, Nicky?
-That's a great idea!
I'll ask him. Kill me.
Are you serious?
Yes. We'll meet at Grand Central Station, noon.
Now I command you--do me.
All right!
That just hurt a lot.
Still alive, though.
I've always wanted to kill someone.
Can I give it a try?
Damn you, Kevin Spacey!
You take all my parts!
Hey, you lose--royal flush.
Off with the brassiere.
The last time I saw a pair of jugs that big... two hillbillies were blowing on them.
Oh, my God, Dad.
Nicky, I got no legs.
I got no hips.
I got one ear.
I got no ears.
Now he has no ears.
Are you happy, Nicky?
Adrian's got the whole city following me.
I can't hear you, Nicky!
Check one, two. Check one, two.
Put it back on my head!
You got until midnight tonight.
Get your ass back up there, and save your father. Go!
-I'm going to save you, Dad.
-Go, go, go!
-I'm going to save you!
-Go, then! Move it!
Go, Nicky, go!
Sure you're down with this?
A little nervous. Want to puke.
Hey, hey, fuzz.
We know where to find Nicky.
-Let's go.
-Get in.
What's up, Police Chief?
-You have what I want.
-You got what we want?
Fifty million bones, bro.
-Here's the money.
-Whoa, my God!
That's half of it. You get the rest when I get Nicky.
Thanks much.
I got to warn you, man.
He's kind of not human.
-Really?
-He might be the son of Satan.
I guess I'll have to be extra careful, then, aren't l?
Now, where is he?
Hey, come on, that was cool!
Do it again!
Out of the way!
Where is he? He's late.
He'll be here.
Just keep your skirt on.
That's where he comes out of.
Over there!
We've been ratted out.
We thought the son of Satan would understand such a move.
-Get these two out of here.
-All right, this way.
What is this?
A bulldog and his gay lover?
Oh, shut up.
It's true. It's true.
Judas.
Judas Priest, maybe.
I'm only an actor.
I don't know what's happening.
Take him to the holding area.
Seal off all the exits.
I'm only an actor!
You want to see something cool?
Definitely.
Pick me a winner.
Oh, sick!
Oh, my God, that was awesome!
So, what time's my brother expected back?
Noon. Ish.
Even though you're not really the chief... we still get the rest of the cash, right, bro?
You know what you'll get, boys?
An indescribably horrific torture... administered by demons for the rest of eternity.
And we get to keep the cash, too, right?
Sure.
Why not?
You're hurting me.
Shut up.
Applesauce every time.
Hey, boys!
You want a blizzard with my flip-flop?
No, thanks, but we'll take that bottle of booze.
Beat it, you freak.
Get out of here.
I'll be back with my flip-flop!
Schnapps.
Peppermint?
All right!
Want a hit?
Drink up.
Here's to fifty million clams.
To the defilement of Earth and corruption of its people.
OK, whatever.
Just drink it.
Cheers.
It's awfully hot down here.
How do you manage to stay so cool?
Beer lowers the body temperature.
I read that in a beer magazine.
This liquid will probably quench my thirst.
-Cool me off.
-Definitely.
Give you a pretty good buzz.
Or maybe it will trap me inside for all of eternity.
No, it won't?
Oh, Nicky.
I've missed you.
Come out and say hello!
I'm not Nicky.
I'm calling you out, brother!
Adrian, this is very painful.
-There you are.
-I told you he was sick.
Oh, hello, Cassius.
All right, Adrian! Let me out!
New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
You motherfu--
But Cassius could use some company for eternity.
So get in the flask.
Kick his ass, Nicky.
Sleep.
You got it.
Hey, hold up.
Someone's got to take a pee.
That dog's got smoke balls!
Run, Beefy! Run!
You can't make me drink, Adrian.
Of course I can.
Oh, it's Nicky's little ragamuffin.
Drink or she dies.
Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going.
Let go of her!
This is between you and me!
I hear a train a-coming!
Adrian, stop!
-Drink!
-All right! Don't hurt her!
Don't do it, Nicky!
I have to, Valerie.
Now, that hurt the both of us.
See you in Hell!
Hey, look at the bright side.
You can go for a swim.
You can play the harmonica, and you can choke someone.
Take me to my room.
I want to be alone!
In your weakened condition, if you vacate the throne... any of your sons can claim the seat of power for their own.
Horseshit.
Hey, good news.
Adrian's back.
I'm going to be all right?
Where's Nicky?
He came with you and Cassius, right?
I came through that gate alone.
Sorry, sir. False alarm.
Would everyone stop playing with me... and tell me what my brother's up to?
What is this?
Is it Dad's birthday?
There he is.
Hi! I can't believe you're here!
Welcome.
Up with the sign.
Can I just tell you
I am so excited right now?
-So excited!
-She really is.
If you could point me to the Black Palace...
I really got to check in with my dad.
Can I ask you something?
What do you know about your mom?
My mom.
My brothers tell me that she was a mountain goat... which would explain my chronic halitosis.
A mountain goat?
That's really sweet.
Jenna, chair.
Thanks.
My mother wasn't a goat?
Try an angel.
An angel?
I'm your mom.
If you're my mom, then how come you're not older?
Angels don't get any older, son.
I can't believe you just called him "son."
This is so wild!
Jenna, Christa.
Time for your mambo lesson.
Chubbs, I'm so sorry.
I totally spaced.
I have company.
This is my son Nicky.
Chubbs used to be a golf pro... but up here he's just the dopest dance instructor.
Ah, that's nice.
You mambo?
I don't think so.
It's all in the hips.
-Bye, Chubbs.
-All in the hips, yeah!
Nobody in this room will tell you a thing, Adrian.
Right!
Hey, let him go!
Perhaps a titty-twister will loosen your lips.
I'm getting turned on.
All I know is that if you sit on that throne... in your father's weakened condition--
Tit-head, no!
You can claim the seat of power for your own.
Really?
As the founder of Hell...
I command you to stay off that throne!
Even in Hell I get no respect.
Put me down!
So where did you meet Dad?
It was a long time ago at this Heaven-Hell mixer.
I remember that night.
You had, like, four daiquiris.
At first
I didn't really like him.
-He was really conceited.
-But he was funny.
And I hate to admit it, but he had a really hot body.
Puppy phone.
It's so cute.
Hi, Michelle.
Yeah, he's here right now.
I don't know if he's hot.
He's my son, you perv.
Can I call you back?
That was my friend Michelle.
She says hi.
Say hi back.
I'll just call her later.
We totally saw you save your girlfriend's life.
That was so cool.
That's why you came to Heaven instead of Hell.
Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here.
How did you see me?
We can see anything that's going on on Earth. Look.
Someone else is taking the internship.
That's "Felicity."
I love that show. Do you watch?
I haven't seen it, but I hear good things.
This is an "Action News" special report.
Moments ago, a large chunk of what appears to be Hell... began to rise from beneath Central Park.
Far from being terrified... many New Yorkers have begun flocking to the site... turning it into an unofficial party central.
And this just in...
I'm cheating on my husband with the weatherman.
Show him Central Park.
I love your legs.
That's my father's throne!
-Is Dad OK?
-Let's see.
I was a good Devil, wasn't l?
You were the best Devil, sir!
If we fall in there, we will die. Period.
My underwear is so far up my ass
I could taste it.
I hear that.
Welcome to the party!
It's so nice to see you all here.
I'm so proud of you.
You've taken to sin with such minimal prompting.
You're acting as if there is no Heaven or Hell.
Well, I've got news for you.
There is most definitely a Hell.
What?
And you're all going there when you die.
Which is in about fifteen minutes.
Holy shit, we really are going to die!
I'm really burning now!
What are we going to do?
I got to help her.
I got to help Dad.
I got to help everybody.
At the stroke of midnight... my father will be completely deteriorated... and all your souls will be mine.
Soon you will see things... more horrible than you can even imagine.
Well, maybe not that horrible, but still pretty bad.
So, while we wait... for your enjoyment...
I bring you a dear, sweet man--
Mr Henry Winkler.
Good evening.
Covered in bees!
How can I win?
Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Stronger, yes.
Smarter, definitely.
But you have something that he doesn't have.
A speech impediment?
The inner light, honey.
And you can totally use it.
-It's the best power of all.
-I do?
And God told me if you get in really bad trouble... you can use this.
What is it?
I'm not totally a hundred percent on that... but God said when the time came, you'd know what to do with it.
God's so smart.
Like "Jeopardy!" smart.
My little boy.
Mommy, get me to the Big Apple... because I'm going to rock that town like a hurricane.
You're already there.
Bye, Nicky.
Bye, Mom.
Bye, guys.
Release the good.
Yes, they're furry.
Bunny, bunny, bunny!
Release the awesome.
What you do is put it in your mouth... and let the meat slide down your throat hole.
Not you, not you!
Popeye's chicken is the shizzney!
You know, from this angle, you're kind of cute.
You think so?
Oh, my God.
He just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Little Nicky.
I knew you would make it!
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely.
Let my friends alone... and get in the flask.
Is this a joke?
No, it's the inner light... and with it, we can defeat whatever you got.
It's true!
It's not true!
Run, traitors, run!
OK, Adrian.
You've left me no choice.
Leave this to me.
Let's see what you've got.
Enough!
I'm going to kill you with my bare hands.
I'm ready for you.
I guess I wasn't ready.
-I totally had to do that.
-Hell, yeah!
-Good job!
-That's great!
Thanks, Mom !
I'm going to ask you nicely.
Get in the fla--
You want a pillow fight, do you?
Let's let the feathers fly.
Come on, now.
Come on.
I'm right here.
Where am I going with it, baby?
Here I am.
I'm sleeping.
Or am l?
Thanks, Mr Winkler.
I'm asking you one last time.
Get in the flask.
A little help here, please.
Please!
Don't do this! No!
Good-bye, Nicky.
Nice to see you, brothers.
Now I'm going to bust both of your heads wide open!
-Come on!
-Get 'em, Nicky!
Come on, Nicky!
You can do it, Nicky!
Kick him in his hairy balls!
Good idea.
One down, one to go, Adrian.
You've asked for this.
Time for the shovel!
Bring it on!
-Kill him, Adrian!
-Shut up!
-Get him, Nicky!
-Let go of me!
How did a nice Southern boy learn to fight like that?
I guess from my father's side of the family.
What? No tongue?
Catch me if you can!
That is wicked!
Not long now!
You got to fly out.
Soon it will all be mine!
Nicky! I know you can do it.
Run, run!
Do it for the butterflies.
Butterflies?
The power of good lets you fly out.
Well, you're too late, Nicky!
Behold your new Satan!
What's that?
What's with the ball?
-Ozzy?
-Holy shit.
No, no, no!
You can do it, Ozzy!
Bite his fricking head off!
Spit him in the flask!
Here you go, Ozzy.
-Grand Central, Nicky!
-Start running.
-You'll never make it.
-You've got to die.
I'll just go to Heaven.
Not if you do something bad right before you die.
You're right.
Hey, Nicky!
Cover Winkler in bees!
You can do it!
Sorry, Henry.
-Do me!
-With what?
I don't know.
Here. Kill him with this.
I'll never forget you, guys.
And we will never forget you, my friend.
I love you.
And I love you, Nicky.
I got them, Dad! I did it!
Unholiness, you're back!
You look great!
It's all in the hips
It's in the hips
You're all right!
You came through, Nicky.
I came through for you, Dad... and I came through for Mom and the butterflies.
You're back in Hell now, kid.
There are no butterflies here.
If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
What about you and Grandpa and everybody in Hell?
I let my butterflies die once upon a time... and it's never stopped hurting.
That's right!
You heard me, Holly.
What?
I'm still in love with you!
Oh, my God, he's talking about me.
And don't think I forgot about how crazy you get... after a few daiquiris.
That guy is still the biggest horndog.
Yeah, he is.
Listen, I got down low.
Your mom's got up high.
You take care of the middle.
OK, Dad.
But, in the words of Motley Crue... this will always be my home sweet home.
Don't be afraid to show your face.
You're such a handsome boy.
I hate to interrupt... but it's time for Hitler's punishment.
-I'll take that.
-Maybe they'll let us out.
Grandpa!
OK, kids.
Enjoy your new home!
Holy shnit!
Such a little angel.
Only a quarter, ma'am.
Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Sorry.
There are some fish that cannot be caught.
It's not that they're faster or stronger than other fish.
They're just touched by something extra.
One such fish was The Beast.
And by the time I was born he was already a legend.
He'd passed up more $ 100 lures than any fish in Alabama.
Some said that fish was the ghost of a thief...
...who'd drowned in that river
60 years before.
Others claimed he was a dinosaur left over from the "Cruaceous" Period.
I didn't put any stock into such speculation or superstition.
All I knew was I'd been trying to catch that fish...
...since I was a boy no bigger than you.
And on the day you were born...
Well, that was the day
I finally caught him.
Now, I'd tried everything on it:
Worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut butter and cheese.
But on that day I had a revelation:
If that fish was Henry Walls' ghost, then the usual bait wasn't gonna work.
I was gonna have to use something he truly desired.
- Your finger?
- Gold.
Now, I tied my ring onto the strongest line they made...
...strong enough to hold up a bridge, they said, if only for a few minutes.
And then I cast upriver.
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it before it even hit the water.
And just as fast, he snapped clean through that line.
Well, you can see my predicament.
My wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife...
...soon to be mother of my child...
- Make him stop.
...was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
What did you do?
I followed that fish upriver and downriver.
This fish, The Beast...
...the whole time we were calling it a him, when in fact it was a her.
It was fat with eggs it was gonna lay any day.
Now, I was in a situation.
I could gut that fish and get my wedding ring back...
...but in doing so I'd be killing the smartest catfish in the Ashton River.
Did I want to deprive my son the chance...
...to catch a fish like this of his own?
This ladyfish and I...
- Well, we had the same destiny.
- "We were part of the same equation."
Now, you may well ask...
Oh, darling, darling, it's still your night.
...why did it strike so quick on gold when nothing else would attract it?
That was the lesson
I learned that day...
...the day my son was born.
Sometimes the only way to catch an uncatchable woman...
...is to offer her a wedding ring.
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
I'm a footnote in that story, Dad...
...the context for your great adventure, which never happened, incidentally.
You were selling novelty products in Wichita when I was born.
Come on, Will.
Everyone loves that story!
They don't. I don't love that story. Not anymore. Not after a thousand times!
I know every punch line, Dad.
I can tell them as well as you can!
For one night, one night in your entire life...
...the universe did not revolve around Edward Bloom.
- How can you not understand that?
- I'm sorry to embarrass you.
You're embarrassing yourself, Dad.
You just don't see it.
After that night, I didn't speak to my father again for three years.
William Bloom, United Press
International. If I could just...
We communicated indirectly, I guess.
In her letters and Christmas cards, my mother wrote for both of them.
And when I'd call, she'd say Dad was out driving or swimming in the pool.
True to form, we never talked about not talking.
The truth is, I didn't see anything of myself in my father.
And I don't think he saw anything of himself in me.
We were like strangers who knew each other very well.
In telling the story of my father's life...
...it's impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth.
The best I can do is to tell it the way he told me.
It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened.
Give me back my ring!
Thank you!
But that's what kind of story this is.
His birth would set the pace for his unlikely life.
No longer than most men's, but larger.
And as strange as his stories got...
...the endings were always the most surprising of all.
Yes. Yes, he's here.
It's your mother.
And what does Dr. Bennett say?
No, sure, I'll talk to him.
Yeah, I'll wait.
It's bad?
Yeah, it's more than they thought.
They're gonna stop chemo.
- You need to go.
- Probably tonight.
- I'm going with you.
- No, no, no. You shouldn't.
I'm going with you.
Now, which one's it gonna be?
"Monkey in a Barn," or "Dog in the Road"?
The one about the witch.
- You get nightmares.
- But I'm not scared.
Well, neither was I, at first.
Now, this took place in the swamp outside of Ashton.
Children weren't allowed in the swamp on account of the snakes, spiders...
...and quicksand that would swallow you up before you could even scream.
There were five of us out there that night:
Me, Ruthie, Wilbur Freely...
...and the Price Brothers,
Don and Zacky.
And not one of us knew what was in store.
It's common knowledge that most towns of a certain size have a witch...
...if only to eat misbehaving children...
...and the occasional puppy who wanders into her yard.
Witches use those bones to cast spells and curses...
...and make the land infertile.
- Is it true she got a glass eye?
- I heard she got it from gypsies.
- What's a gypsy?
- Your momma's a gypsy.
Your momma's a bitch.
You shouldn't swear.
There's ladies present.
- Shit.
- Damn.
Screw.
Turn off your flashlights.
She'll see you!
Yet of all the witches in Alabama...
...there was one who was said to be the most feared.
For she had one glass eye which was said to contain mystical powers.
I heard if you look right at it, you'll see how you're gonna die.
That's bull-S-H-l-T, that is.
She's not even a real witch.
If you're so sure, go get that eye.
I heard she keeps it in a box on her night table. Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
- Then do it.
- Fine, I will.
- Fine, you do it.
- Fine, I'm doing it.
Edward, don't!
She'll make soap out of you.
That's what she does.
She makes soap out of people.
Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom...
...and there's some folks like to see your eye.
- You get The Eye?
- I brought it.
Let's see it.
Whoa, help!
I saw how I was gonna die.
I was old and I fell.
I wasn't old at all.
I was thinking about death and all.
About seeing how you're gonna die.
I mean, on one hand, if dying was all you thought about...
...it could kind of screw you up.
But it could kind of help you, couldn't it?
Because, everything else, you'd know you could survive.
I guess I'm saying I'd like to know.
That's how I go.
Hi, Mom.
- Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
- Yes. He's up with your father now.
- And how is he?
- Well... No, I got it.
He's impossible. He won't eat.
Because he doesn't eat, he's weaker.
Because he's weak, he doesn't want to eat.
- How much time does he have left?
- You don't talk about that.
Not yet.
Will.
Dr. Bennett. Oh, it's good to see you.
My wife, Josephine.
A pleasure.
- You're seven months.
- To the day!
It's a boy.
Try to get him to drink one of these.
He won't, but go ahead and try.
Dad?
You want some water?
- You are in for a surprise.
- Am I?
Having a kid changes everything.
There's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feeding.
- Did you do any of that?
- No.
But I hear it's terrible.
Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child...
...fill its head with nonsense, and still it turns out perfectly fine.
- You think I'm up for it?
- You learned from the best.
Drink half the can.
I'll tell Mom you drank it all.
Everyone wins.
People needn't worry so much.
It's not my time yet.
This is not how I go.
- Really?
- Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
- The old lady by the swamp?
- She was a witch.
No, she was old and probably senile.
I saw my death in that eye, and this isn't how it happens.
So how does it happen?
Surprise ending.
Wouldn't want to ruin it for you.
Your mother thought we wouldn't talk again.
Look at us. We're talking fine.
We're storytellers, both of us.
I speak mine out, you write yours down. Same thing.
Dad...
I hope to talk about some things while I'm here.
You mean while I'm here.
I just want to know the true versions of things:
Events. Stories.
You.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool.
- If you wanted to, you could fix it.
- Yeah, I will.
- You know where the chemicals are?
- I did it when you were gone.
I was never much for being at home, Will. Too confining.
And this here, being stuck in bed...
Dying is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
- I thought you said you weren't dying.
- I said this isn't how I go.
The last part is much more unusual.
Trust me on that.
Dr. Bennett said I have to stay at home for a week.
Oh, that's nothing. Once,
I had to stay in bed for three years.
- Did you have the chickenpox?
- I wish.
Truth is, no one quite knew what was wrong.
Most times a person grows up gradually...
...while I found myself in a hurry.
My muscles and my bones couldn't keep up with my body's ambition.
So I spent the better part of three years confined to my bed...
...with the encyclopedia being my only means of exploration.
I had made it all the way to the G's...
...hoping to find an answer to my "gigantificationism"...
...when I uncovered an article about the common goldfish.
"Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish will remain small.
With more space...
...the fish will grow double, triple, or quadruple its size."
It occurred to me then that perhaps the reason for my growth...
...was that I was intended for larger things.
After all, a giant man can't have an ordinary-sized life.
As soon as my bones had settled in their adult configuration...
...I set upon my plan to make a bigger place for myself in Ashton.
Tigers, go!
Edward Bloom!
Doggy! My doggy!
My doggy's trapped!
I was the biggest thing
Ashton had ever seen.
Until one day, a stranger arrived.
Calm down. Calm down, everybody.
Calm down. That's enough.
- Mr. Mayor, he ate an entire corn field.
- He ate my dog.
If you ain't gonna stop him, mayor, we will.
I won't have mob violence in this town.
Now, has someone tried talking to him?
- You can't reason with him.
- He's a monster.
I'll do it.
I'll talk to him.
See if I can get him to go.
That creature could crush you without trying.
Oh, trust me, he'll have to try.
Hello?
My name is Edward Bloom, and I wanna talk to you!
Go away!
Now, I'm not going anywhere until you show yourself!
I said, go away!
Armed with the foreknowledge of my own death...
...I knew the giant couldn't kill me.
All the same, I preferred to keep my bones unbroken.
Why are you here?
So you can eat me.
The town decided to send a human sacrifice and I volunteered.
My arms are a little stringy, but there's some good eating in my legs.
I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them myself.
So I guess, well...
If you'd just get it over with quick, because I'm not much for pain, really.
Oh, come on! I can't go back!
I'm a human sacrifice!
If I go back, they'll think I'm a coward.
I'd rather be dinner than a coward.
Here.
You can start with my hand.
It'll be an appetizer.
I don't want to eat you.
I don't want to eat anybody.
I just get so hungry.
I'm just too big.
Did you ever think that maybe you're not too big...
...but maybe this town is just too small?
I've heard in real cities there are buildings so tall...
...you can't even see the tops of them.
- Really?
- Oh, I wouldn't lie to you.
And all-you-can-eat buffets.
- Now, you can eat a lot, can't you?
- I can.
So why are you wasting your time in a small town?
You're a big man.
You should be in a big city.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you?
- What's your name, giant?
- Karl.
Well, mine's Edward.
And truthfully...
Well, I do want you to leave, Karl.
But I want to leave with you.
I mean, you think this town is too small for you?
Well, it's too small for a man of my ambition.
So, what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Okay.
Now, first, we gotta get you ready for the city.
Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton...
...it's with a heavy heart that we see you go.
But take with you this key to the city...
...and know that any time you want to come back...
...all our doors are open to you.
That afternoon as I left Ashton, everyone seemed to have advice.
Find yourself a nice girl, now!
Watch your pride, Edward Bloom!
But there was one person whose counsel I held above all others.
She said that the biggest fish in the river...
...gets that way by never being caught.
- What'd she say?
- Beats me.
There were two roads out of Ashton:
A new one which was paved and an older one that wasn't.
People didn't use the old one anymore...
...and it had developed a reputation for being haunted.
Well, since I had no intention of ever returning to Ashton...
...this seemed as good a time as any to find out what lay down that old one.
- You know anyone who's taken it?
- That poet, Norther Winslow, did.
He was going to Paris, France.
I guess he liked it.
No one ever heard from him again.
I'll tell you what.
You go the other way.
I'll cut through here, and I'll meet you on the far side.
You're just trying to run away, aren't you?
Here.
Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
Why, you son of a...
Now, there comes a point when a reasonable man...
...will swallow his pride and admit that he's made a terrible mistake.
The truth is,
I was never a reasonable man.
And what I recall of
Sunday school was that...
...the more difficult something is, the more rewarding it is in the end.
Friend! Welcome to you!
- What's your name?
- Edward Bloom.
- "Bloom" like a flower?
- Yes.
Oh, here! Here you are, right here.
"Edward Bloom."
We weren't expecting you yet.
- You were expecting me?
- Not yet.
- You must've taken a shortcut.
- Why, yes, I did. It almost killed me.
Life will do that to you.
And truthfully, the long way is easier.
- But it's longer.
- Much longer.
And you're here now, and that's what matters.
What is this place?
The town of Spectre.
Best-kept secret in Alabama!
Now, it says here you're from Ashton, right?
Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
The poet?
Whatever happened to him?
He's still here. Let me buy you a drink.
I'll tell you all about it.
Hell, I'll have him tell you!
I have to meet somebody, and I'm already running late.
Now, son, I already told you.
You're early.
Now, tell me if that isn't the best pie you ever ate.
It truly is.
Well, everything tastes better here.
Even the water is sweet.
Never gets too hot, too cold, too humid.
At night, the wind goes through the trees where you'd swear...
...there was a whole symphony out there playing just for you.
Hey! Jenny!
Come back here!
Jenny!
Hey, I need those.
- There is no softer ground than town.
- That almost rhymes.
He's our poet laureate. Come on.
I agreed to spend the afternoon, if only to understand...
...the mystery of how a place could feel so strange and yet so familiar.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really?
There's a lot of expectation.
I don't wanna disappoint my fans.
May I?
It's only three lines long.
This is why you should never show a work in progress.
I got him!
There's leeches in there.
- Did you see that woman?
- What did she look like?
- Well, she was...
- Was she naked?
Yes, she was.
It's not a woman. It's a fish.
No one ever catches her.
Fish looks different to different people.
My daddy said it looked like the coon dog he had when he was a kid...
...back from the dead.
Oh, darn.
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.
I'm 8. That means when I'm 18, you'll be 28.
- And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
- You're pretty good at arithmetic.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48.
That's not much difference at all.
Sure is a lot now, though, huh?
Hey, Edward!
I love Spectre...
Excuse me.
Jenny thinks you're quite a catch.
We all do.
What?
I said, you're quite a catch.
I have to leave.
Tonight.
Why?
This town is more than any man could ask for.
And if I were to end up here,
I would consider myself lucky.
But the truth is, I'm just not ready to end up anywhere.
But no one's ever left.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
Well, I suspect it will hurt. A lot.
Now, I'm sorry, but...
Well, goodbye.
- You won't find a better place.
- I don't expect to.
Promise me you'll come back.
I promise. Someday.
When I'm really supposed to.
That night,
I reached two conclusions.
The first was that a dangerous path is made much worse by darkness.
The second was that I was hopelessly and irrevocably lost.
These woods would become my graveyard.
As difficult as it was to reach Spectre,
I was fated to get there eventually.
After all, no man can avoid reaching the end of his life.
And then I realized this wasn't the end of my life.
This isn't how I die.
Friend.
- What happened to your shoes?
- They kind of got ahead of me.
I don't know if you saw it, but Josephine had some photos...
...in the most recent Newsweek.
Really?
That's just wonderful.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Oh. We'll have to pick up a copy.
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine...
...but African parrots, in their native
Congo, they speak only French.
Really?
You're lucky to get four words out of them in English.
But if you were to walk through the jungle...
...you'd hear them speaking the most elaborate French.
Those parrots talk about everything.
Politics, movies, fashion.
Everything but religion.
Why not religion, Dad?
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're gonna offend.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Oh, so you know.
Hello.
Hi. How are you feeling?
Oh, I was dreaming.
What were you dreaming about?
Oh, I don't usually remember...
...unless they're especially portentous.
Do you know what that word means?
It means when you dream about something that's gonna happen.
Like one night, I had a dream...
...where this crow came and said:
"Your aunt is gonna die."
I was so scared,
I woke up my parents...
...but they said it was just a dream and to get back to bed.
But the next morning, my Aunt Stacy was dead.
That's terrible.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power.
Wasn't three weeks later when the crow came back to me in a dream...
...and said, "Your daddy's gonna die."
I didn't know what to do.
I finally told my father, but he said:
"Oh, not to worry."
But I could see he was rattled.
The next morning, he wasn't himself.
Kept looking around, waiting for something to drop on his head.
Because the crow didn't say how it was gonna happen, just those words:
"Your daddy's gonna die."
Well, he left home early and was gone a long time.
When he finally came back, he looked terrible...
...like he was waiting for the ax to fall all day.
He said to my mother:
"I've just had the worst day of my life."
"You think you've had a bad day?"
She said.
"This morning, the milkman dropped dead on the porch."
Because, see, my mother was banging the milkman.
- Can I take your picture?
- Oh, you don't need a picture.
Just look up the word "handsome" in the dictionary.
Please?
All right.
I have photos of the wedding to show you.
There is a great one of you and my father.
I want to see pictures of your wedding.
I've never seen any.
That's because we didn't have a proper wedding.
Your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me.
- She was engaged to somebody else.
- I never knew.
Will never told you?
Probably just as well.
He would have told it wrong, anyway.
All the facts, none of the flavor.
Oh. So this is a tall tale.
Well, it's not a short one.
I'd just left Spectre and was on my way to discover my destiny.
I'd just left Spectre and was on my way to discover my destiny.
I'd just left Spectre and was on my way to discover my destiny.
Not knowing what that would be exactly...
...I explored every opportunity that presented itself.
Coco! Coco! There they are.
Ladies and gentlemen!
You may think you've seen the unusual.
You may think you've seen the bizarre.
But I've traveled to the five corners of the world...
...and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this!
When I met this man...
...he was picking oranges in Florida.
His fellow workers called him
El Penumbra. "The Shadow."
Because when you worked beside him...
...he blocked out the daylight!
Not to alarm you, ma'am, but if this man wanted to...
...he could crush your head between his toes...
...like a tiny walnut.
But he won't do it.
No. No, ladies and gentlemen...
...he will not hurt her...
...because he is our own gentle giant.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Colossus!
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...
...thank y'all for coming.
Drive home safely, everyone.
Thank you for coming.
It was on that night
Karl met his destiny.
And I met mine, almost.
They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops.
And that's true.
What they don't tell you is that once time starts again...
...it moves extra fast to catch up.
What's your name?
- It's Karl.
- Karl.
Tell me, Karl, have you ever heard the term "involuntary servitude"?
- No.
- "Unconscionable contract"?
- Nope.
- Great.
Here you go.
Here you are.
Mr. Soggybottom, come down this here...
...so he can use your back to sign on it.
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.
Hey, kid.
- Your friend just made himself a star.
- Oh, that's great.
- My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
- Good to meet you.
Pleased to meet you.
What's the matter? I haven't seen a customer so depressed...
...since the elephant sat on that farmer's wife.
"Depressed"?
See? The big guy likes it.
I just saw the woman I'm gonna marry.
I know it. But I lost her.
Oh, tough break.
Well, most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life looking for her. That or die alone.
Damn, kid.
Let me guess. Real pretty?
Reddish-blondish hair?
Blue dress?
Yeah!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
Who is she? Where does she live?
Forget it. Don't waste your time.
She's out of your league.
- What? You don't even know me.
- Sure I do.
You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat.
You don't have a plan or a job.
Nothing except the clothes on your back.
Well, I have a whole backpack full of clothes.
Oh, someone stole my backpack.
You were a big fish in a small pond, but this here is the ocean...
...and you're drowning.
Go back to Puddleville.
- You'll be happy there.
- You say I don't have a plan. I do.
I'll find that girl, marry her, and spend the rest of my life with her.
I don't have a job, but I would have a job if you gave me one.
And I may not have much...
...but I have more determination than any man you're likely to meet.
I'm sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
Come on, big boy.
Wait. Look, I'll work night and day for you...
...and you won't have to pay me.
You just have to tell me who she is.
Every month you work for me...
...I'll tell you one thing about her.
That's my final offer.
Let's get started.
From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked.
I'd go three days without stopping to eat.
And four days without sleeping.
What kept me going was the promise of meeting the girl...
...who would be my wife.
Stick together, that's the way it's gonna be.
- The way it was, and the way it will be.
- Mr. Calloway, sir?
It's been a month today.
This girl, the love of your life...
...her favorite flowers are daffodils.
- So get that stuff...
- Daffodils.
Daffodils.
Daffodils.
True to his word...
...every month Amos would tell me something new...
...about the woman of my dreams.
Enjoy yourselves, enjoy yourselves.
She's going to college.
College. She's going to college.
She likes music.
Music. She likes music.
Over the months, I learned a lot about the woman I would marry...
...but not her name, and not where to find her.
That time had come.
I couldn't wait any longer.
Mr. Calloway?
It's Edward Bloom.
I need to talk to you.
Mr. Calloway?
No. Wait!
That night, I discovered that most things you consider evil or wicked...
...are simply lonely and lacking in social niceties.
Didn't kill anything, did I?
A few rabbits. But I think one of them was already dead.
That would explain the indigestion.
Thank you.
I was wrong about you, kid.
You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of.
You could get any girl.
There's only one I want.
Her name...
...is Sandra Templeton.
She goes to Auburn.
Semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
Thank you. Thank you.
- Good luck, kid!
- Thank you, sir!
- Bye, now.
- Bye, Edward.
After saying my goodbyes,
I hopped three trains...
...to get to Auburn that afternoon.
You don't know me, but my name is Edward Bloom...
...and I love you.
I've spent the last three years working to find out who you are.
I've been shot, stabbed, and trampled a few times. I broke my ribs twice.
But it's all been worth it to see you here now...
...and to finally get to talk to you.
Because I'm destined to marry you.
I knew it when I saw you at the circus, and I know it now more than ever.
- I'm sorry.
- You don't have to apologize to me.
I'm the luckiest person you'll find today.
No, I'm sorry I'm engaged to be married.
But you're wrong. I do know you.
At least by reputation.
Edward Bloom from Ashton.
See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price.
He was a few years older than you.
Well...
Congratulations.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Stop it! It's not funny.
That poor boy.
Fate has a cruel way of circling around on you.
After all this work to leave Ashton...
...the girl I love was now engaged to one of its biggest jerks.
There's a time when a man needs to fight...
...and a time when he needs to accept that his destiny's lost...
...the ship has sailed, and that only a fool will continue.
Truth is, I've always been a fool.
Sandra Templeton, I love you, and I will marry you!
So as you can see, if we apply these rules to our everyday life...
...supply and demand makes much more sense.
Take a look at the next graph, and the import of this will be even stronger...
- for three hours.
Look!
- Daffodils!
- They're your favorite flower.
How did you get so many?
I called everywhere in five states.
I told them it was the only way to get my wife to marry me.
You don't even know me.
I have the rest of my life to find out.
Sandra!
It's Don. Promise you won't hurt him.
If that's what you want, I swear to it.
- Bloom?
- Don.
What the hell are you doing?
This is my girl. Mine!
I wasn't aware that she belonged to anyone.
What's the matter?
Are you too scared to fight back?
I promised I wouldn't.
Stop it!
Don, stop!
While I took the beating of a lifetime,
Don Price was ultimately defeated.
All the physical activity had worsened a congenital valve defect.
Put simply, his heart wasn't strong enough.
Don! I will never marry you.
What?
You mean, you love this guy?
He's almost a stranger, and I prefer him to you.
As it turned out, Sandra was able to keep her same date at the chapel.
Only the groom had changed.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
We were all set to, but there was a complication.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
Truth is,
I've been thirsty my whole life.
Never really known why.
There was a time when I was 11...
You were talking about your wedding.
I didn't forget.
I was just working on a tangent.
You see, most men, they'll tell you a story straight through.
It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting, either.
I like your stories.
And I like you.
And I like you.
Well, when you work for the circus, you don't have a regular address.
Well, when you work for the circus, you don't have a regular address.
So after three years, there was a lot of undelivered mail.
During the four weeks
I was in the hospital...
...the postmaster finally caught up with me.
And it seems that while my heart belonged to Sandra...
...the rest of my body belonged to the U.S. Government.
A hitch in the Army was up to three years at that point...
...and having waited three years just to meet Sandra...
...I knew I couldn't survive being away from her that long.
So I took every hazardous assignment I could find...
...with the hope of getting my time down to less than a year.
Go! Go!
When I was offered a secret mission...
...to steal the plans for the Wong Kai Tang power plant...
...I jumped at the chance to serve my country.
Go! Go!
Any of you got needs?
How could you miss your cue?
You make me look like a fool out there alone.
You weren't alone!
Who the hell are you?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Damn right you're not.
GUARD!
Tell your men not to bother us!
And close that curtain!
Please, I need your help.
What makes you think we'll help you?
Over the next hour, I described my love for Sandra K. Templeton...
...and the ordeal that brought me before them.
As it had always been, this love was my salvation.
It was destined to be.
We put together an elaborate plan for escape...
...involving a whaling ship to Russia...
...a barge to Cuba, and a small, dirty canoe to Miami.
We all knew it would be dangerous.
And what are we supposed to do when we get to America?
I can get you bookings.
I know the biggest man in show business.
Bob Hope?!
Bigger.
Ready?
And so the twins and I began our arduous journey...
...halfway around the world.
Unfortunately, there was no way to send a message back to America.
And so it was no surprise that the Army believed I was dead.
No, God!
After four months, Sandra had gotten over the worst of the nightmares.
When the phone rang, she didn't think it was somehow me calling her.
When a car drove past, she didn't get up to check out the window.
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
They met at Auburn.
What about the details?
How they fell in love.
The circus. The war.
You never told me any of that.
That's because most of it never happened.
But it's romantic.
- What?
- What, I know better...
...than to argue romance with a French woman.
Do you love your father?
Everyone loves my father.
He's a very likable guy.
Do you love him?
You have to understand.
When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was there.
And I started thinking maybe he's got this second life somewhere else.
Another family, another house.
And he leaves us and goes to them.
Or, or...
Or maybe there is no second family.
Maybe he never wanted a family.
Whatever it is, he likes his second life better and he tells his stories...
...because he can't stand this boring place.
- But it's not true.
- Well, what's true?
He's never told me a single true thing.
Look, hey...
I know why you like him.
I know why everyone likes him.
But I need you to tell me that I'm not crazy.
Oh, you're not.
And I think you should talk to him.
Larry Puckett's Chevrolet lets the customer do the talking.
Larry Puckett's GM-certified vehicles are under factory warranty.
And you can save up to 40 percent off the original MSRP.
- Did I ever tell you about...?
- Yes.
The maple tree and the Buick?
We've heard it.
I know someone who hasn't.
- The...
- Tree fell on the car, spilling the syrup.
Which attracted the flies, which got stuck to it...
...and flew off with the whole car.
But the real story is how I got the car.
- You see...
- Dad?
Son.
Can we talk?
I think I'll get started on these dishes.
I'll help you.
- You know about icebergs, Dad?
- Do I?
I saw an iceberg once.
They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water.
They didn't count on there being an elephant frozen inside.
- The woolly kind. A mammoth.
- Dad!
What?
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
Well, you shouldn't have started with a question...
...because people want to answer questions.
You should've started with,
"The thing about icebergs is..."
Okay, okay. The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent.
The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it.
And that's...
...what it is with you, Dad.
I am only seeing this little bit...
...that sticks above the water.
Oh, you're only seeing down to my nose? My chin? My...
Dad, I have no idea who you are...
...because you've never told me a single fact.
I've told you a thousand facts, Will.
That's what I do, I tell stories!
You tell... lies, Dad.
You tell amusing lies.
Stories are what you tell a 5-year-old at bedtime.
They're not elaborate mythologies that you maintain...
...when your son is 10 and 15 and 20 and 30.
And I believed you.
I believed your stories so much longer than I should have.
Then when I realized everything you said was impossible...
...I felt like a fool to have trusted you.
You're like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.
Just as charming and just as fake.
You think I'm fake.
Only on the surface, Dad.
But it's all I've ever seen.
Look.
I'm about to have...
...a kid of my own.
It would kill me if he went through his whole life...
...never understanding me.
It would kill you, huh?
What do you want, Will?
Who do you want me to be?
Just yourself.
Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.
I've been nothing but myself since the day I was born.
And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine!
Your father decided that he needed to have an office...
...and, of course, it wouldn't do to have it in the house.
So...
You'll know better than me what's important.
What is it?
It was during the war.
Your father went missing.
They thought he was dead.
Oh, that really happened?
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
I think I'll go check on him.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Okay, go.
After the war, the sons of Alabama returned home, looking for work.
Each had the advantage over me.
They were alive, while I was officially deceased.
With my prospects few...
...I took a job as a traveling salesman.
It suited me.
If there was one thing you can say about Edward Bloom...
...it's that I am a social person.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
I could be gone for weeks at a time.
But every other Friday,
I put all the money I made...
...into an account set aside for a proper house...
...with a white picket fence.
I'd like a moment of your time to tell you about my new product...
...the Handi-matic.
A few years later, I added other products and other cities...
...until my territory stretched from the coast to western Texas.
Edward?
Edward Bloom!
It's me, Norther Winslow.
I don't believe it.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre...
...all the way out in Texas.
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre, it opened my eyes.
There was a whole life out there that I was not living.
So I traveled.
I saw France, Africa, half of South America.
Every day, a new adventure.
That's my motto.
That's great, Norther.
I'm happy for you.
What are you doing now?
I'm robbing this place.
All right, everybody down!
Hey!
Just slide that over.
- Would you mind grabbing that?
- What?
The gun.
I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash drawers...
...and my associate here is gonna handle the vault.
All right, you!
You help my friend, okay?
Let's go!
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I am.
I really just don't want anyone to get hurt.
It's not that.
It's just...
There's no money.
We're completely bankrupt.
Don't tell anybody.
It turned out that the Savings & Loan had already been robbed...
...not by armed bandits, but by speculators in Texas real estate.
All right, let's go!
Norther!
Yeah! There's gotta be close to $400 here!
And that's just from the drawers.
Let's see what you got from the vault.
This is it? The whole vault?
I'm afraid so.
It's got your deposit slip on it.
Well, I just didn't want you leaving empty-handed.
There's something you should know.
The reason they don't have money...
I told Norther about the vagaries of Texas oil money...
...and its effect on real-estate prices...
...and how lax enforcement of fiduciary process...
...had made savings and loans particularly vulnerable.
Hearing this news,
Norther was left with one conclusion:
I should go to Wall Street.
That's where all the money is.
I knew then that while my days as a criminal were over...
Thanks for the hand!
...Norther's were just beginning.
When Norther made his first million dollars...
...he sent me a check for 10,000.
I protested, but he said it was my fee as his career advisor.
It was enough to buy my wife a proper house...
...with a white picket fence.
And for that, it was all the riches a man could ever want.
I was drying out.
I see.
I think we ought to get you a plant mister...
...so we can just spray you like a fern.
Come, now.
I don't think I'll ever dry out.
You carry on. I'll see...
Hello.
- Are you Jennifer Hill?
- I am.
And you're Will.
I've seen a picture of you.
That's how I recognize you.
Listen, Kenny, why don't we skip the lesson today?
We can go again next week.
Do I have to give it back to my mom?
Well, I won't tell her if you won't.
How did you know my father?
Well, this was on his sales route...
...so he was through here all the time, and everyone in town knew him.
Were you having an affair?
Wow. Wow, you just said it.
I was expecting to dance around this for another half-hour.
I've seen him with women.
He flirts. He always has.
And on some level,
I just presumed that he was...
...cheating on my mom.
I just never had proof.
Well, can I ask you a question?
If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Because he's dying.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this.
You have one image of your father...
...and it'd be wrong of me to change it...
...especially this late in the game.
My father talked about things he never did...
...and I'm sure he did a lot of things that he never talked about.
I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
The first thing you have to understand...
...is that your father never meant to end up here.
Yet he did.
Twice.
The first time, he was early.
The second time, he was late.
Those days, your father was working for himself.
If there's one thing you could say about Edward Bloom...
...it's that he was a social person, and people took a liking to him.
One night, he was returning from three weeks on the road...
...when he hit a thunderstorm unlike any in his life.
Fate has a way of circling back on a man...
...and taking him by surprise.
A man sees things differently at different times in his life.
This town didn't seem the same now that he was older.
A new road had brought the outside world to Spectre...
...and with it, banks, liens and debt.
Almost everywhere you looked, people were bankrupt.
The auction today is for the town of Spectre.
- The opening bid will be $ 10,000.
- So Edward Bloom...
...decided to buy the town.
- I couldn't believe my eyes...
- He was never a wealthy man...
...but he had made other men rich, and now he asked for their favors.
- I'm trying to save...
- Most of them hadn't seen Spectre.
They only had Edward's words to describe it.
That's all he needed.
He sold them on the dream.
So first he bought the farms.
Then he bought the houses.
And then he bought the stores.
Whatever he bought, the people were not asked to leave or pay rent.
They were just asked to keep doing as they were doing.
In that way, he could make sure the town would never die.
Within six months, his trust had purchased the entire town.
With one exception.
You must be Edward Bloom.
How do you know?
No one would come out here unless they had business.
And no one would have business with me except for you.
You're buying the town.
Apparently I overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that.
In order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it, in its entirety.
And so I've heard.
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you won't have to move.
Nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
Now, let me get this straight.
You buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay in it?
You'll own the house, but it'll still be mine?
I'll be here, and you'll come and go as you please to one place or another.
Do I have that right?
In so many words, yes.
Yeah, then I don't think so,
Mr. Bloom.
If nothing's gonna change,
I'd just as soon it not change...
...in the way things haven't been changing all this time.
It's not like you'll lose anything.
You can ask anyone in town.
Why are you buying this land,
Mr. Bloom?
Some sort of midlife crisis?
Instead of buying a convertible, you buy a town?
Helping people makes me happy.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
- I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
- No.
You did exactly what you promised.
You came back.
I was just expecting you sooner.
You're Beamen's daughter.
Your name's different.
Did you get married?
I was 18. He was 28.
Turns out that was a big difference.
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.
I see.
Well, thank you for your time.
- It's stuck.
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm so sorry! I...
- It's okay. Just leave it.
- No, I'll...
- Please! Just go.
- But...
- Go.
Most men in that situation would accept their failure and move on.
But Edward was not like most men.
Hold!
They both had completely different characters but...
...well, just one pair of legs.
As the months passed, he found more and more things to fix...
...until the shack no longer resembled itself.
Of course, the best part was coming up with the new material.
By the time the twins and I had got to Havana...
...we'd worked out a new routine, using only a ukulele and a harmonica.
- Well...
- You could leave it there.
No.
Now, don't.
Don't be embarrassed. I should never have let you think that...
I'm in love with my wife.
Yeah, I know.
And from the first day I saw her until the day I die...
...she's the only one.
Lucky girl.
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Wait! Edward.
One day, Edward Bloom left...
...and never returned to the town he'd saved.
As for the girl...
...the common belief was that she'd become a witch...
...and crazy at that.
She became something of a legend herself.
And the story ended where it began.
Logically, you couldn't be the witch, because she was...
...old when he was young.
Well, it's logical if you think like your father.
See, to him there's only two women:
Your mother...
...and everyone else.
And one day...
...I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back.
I was living in a fairy tale.
I'm not sure I should've told you any of this.
No, no, no, I wanted to know. I'm...
I'm glad I know.
I wanted to be as important to him as you were.
And I'm...
I was never gonna be.
I was make-believe.
And his other life, you...
You were real.
Mom?
Josephine?
Josephine?
Will!
What happened?
Your father had a stroke.
He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
Is he gonna be okay?
I don't suppose that I could...
...stay here with him.
I mean, in case...
In case he wakes up,
I really ought to be here.
I'll stay.
Why don't you go home with
Josephine. I'll stay tonight.
- Is that okay?
- Fine.
Will, you'll call if there's any...?
I will. I will. I'll call.
- Do you want some time with Dad?
- Yes. Thank you.
Glad to see you're not trying to have a heartfelt talk.
One of my greatest annoyances is when...
...people try to talk to those who can't hear them.
Well, we have an advantage.
My father and I never talk.
Your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
Yeah, a thousand times.
He caught an uncatchable fish.
Not that. The real story.
He ever tell you that?
No.
Well, your mother came in about
3 in the afternoon.
Her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was away on business...
...in Wichita.
You were born a week early, but there were no complications.
It was a perfect delivery.
Your father was sorry not to be there.
But it wasn't the custom then for men to be in the room for deliveries...
...so I can't see how it would've been much different had he been there.
And that's the real story of how you were born.
Not very exciting, is it?
And I suppose if I had to choose between the true version...
...and an elaborate one involving a fish and a wedding ring...
...I might choose the fancy version.
But, then that's just me.
I kind of liked your version.
Dad?
Hey, Dad? Hey, you want me to get the nurse?
What do you want? What can I do?
What can I get?
You want some water?
You want a bit of water?
The river.
The river?
Tell me how it happens.
How what happens?
How I go.
You mean what you saw in The Eye?
I don't know that story, Dad.
You never told me that one.
Okay. Hey, okay, I'll try.
I need your help.
Tell me how it starts.
Like this.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, so it's in the morning...
...and you and I are in the hospital, and I've fallen asleep. And I wake up...
...and I see you, and somehow you're better.
Dad?
You're different.
- Dad.
- Let's get out of here.
Then I say:
Dad, you're in no condition...
Get that wheelchair.
Hurry up! We haven't much time!
Once we get off this floor, we're in the clear.
And we get in the wheelchair...
- Faster!
...like we're escaping the hospital.
What are you doing?
We pass Dr. Bennett, who tries to slow us down.
- Stop them!
- We're flying down the hall.
Orderly after orderly is chasing us.
Mom and Josephine are at the end.
No time to explain! Stall them!
We come flying out over the curb...
...and your old red Charger is there.
But it's new. Brand-new.
And I pick you up...
...and somehow you hardly weigh anything. I can't explain it.
Leave it! We don't need it!
Water. I need water.
- Where are we going?
- The river.
And we have to take Glenville to avoid traffic...
...because the damn church people drive too slow.
And as we get close to the river...
He's here!
...we see that everybody is already there.
And I mean...
...everyone.
It's unbelievable.
The story of my life.
The strange thing is, there's not a sad face to be found.
Everyone is just so glad to see you...
...and send you off right.
Goodbye, everybody!
Farewell! Adieu!
My girl in the river.
You become what you always were.
A very big fish.
And that's how it happens.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Mom?
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not be in want.
He makes me to lie down in green pastures.
He leads me beside the quiet waters.
He restores my soul.
He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death...
...I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life.
Have you ever heard a joke so many times you've forgotten why it's funny?
And then you hear it again and suddenly it's new.
You remember why you loved it in the first place.
So he said he'll fight the giant who was 15 feet tall!
- No way!
- Dad! That's right, isn't it?
Pretty much.
See? So he was a giant.
That was my father's final joke,
I guess.
A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories.
They live on after him.
And in that way, he becomes immortal.
(narrator) Fairy tales tell, as their labels imply, stories of magic, of creatures that fly.
With giants and dragons and ogres and elves, and inanimate objects that speak for themselves.

There's romance and danger and plotting of schemes.
There's good guys and bad guys and some guys in between.
A fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth, the perils of choices we face in our youth.
But our story today is different in theme, for our hero had no choice, or so it would seem.
- (cat meows)
- ♪ Strange magic
It starts with a fairy bestowing a spell.
This one's for a baby named Ella of Frell.

Now, now, Ella. Mother's here.
There, now. Oh, dear Ella.
Oh, it's nothing a little burping won't cure.
- Up.
- There, now.
Come on. All the way. l gotta work on that.
Whoa!
Hello, ladies!
Lucinda!
- She gives the worst gifts.
- Not if she can't find the baby.
Whoa!
Ah!
Lucinda here. Fairy par excellence.
Now, where's the baby?
- Out walking.
- At her grandmother's.
- At her grandmother's.
- Out for a walk.
- She's walking, at her grandmother's.
- Either way, as you see, she's not here.
Oh, look. She's back.
All right.
What shall we give this beautiful little child today?
- What's her name again?
- Ella.
Ah.
Ella of Frell.
Not a very well-behaved little stinker, is she?
Quiet, please. l can't concentrate here.
Ella of Frell, l give you the gift of obedience.
Now, go to sleep.
Now, wake up.
- Isn't it wonderful?
- No, it's terrible.
It's a terrible gift to have to do what you're told. Take it back. l have a no-return policy.
And if you're going to be ungrateful, l can always turn her into a squirrel instead.
- A squirrel?
- No, obedience is a lovely gift.
Besides, you should thank me.
I've just given you the perfect child.
In spite of the spell,
Ella grew up strong of mind.
Her gift made her obedient, but her heart made her kind.
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
- Yeah.
- Areida. What a stupid name.
- Nobody wants you here.
- l do.
Bite me.
Did you just see what Ella did? l made your favorite, so dig in and stuff your face.
I'm gonna get forks.
Sweetie, stop. l always knew something was wrong with me.
Can't you take the spell back?
You're a fairy.
I'm only a household fairy, honey.
Besides, according to fairy guidelines, only the fairy who gave you the gift can take it back, and we've begged her.
Not only that, but she said she'd turn your mother into a squirrel and take away my eternal youth if we ever asked her again.
It's not fair. l know, darling. l know.
So Ella now knew why she'd always obeyed.
But she never stopped fighting to have things her way.
Ella! Come practice your mandolin.
Fine, but I'll take my own sweet time doing it.
Hurry up, now.
As she struggled to find a way out of her gift, she had no way of knowing something worse was adrift.
Please get well, Mother.
Listen to me.
Only Mandy and l know about the gift.
We've never even told your father.
And you must never tell anyone else.
- l don't want anyone using it against you.
- Mother, please.
Remember, no matter what anyone says or tells you to do, look to yourself, Ella.
What's inside you is stronger than any spell.
Take this, then I'll always be with you. d A strange magic d Strange magic d A strange magic
(Mandy) Ella.
Your father would like to speak to you.
- You're married?
- She has money, Ella.
And she's very fond of my title.
It was either get married or sell the house.
You'll adore Dame Olga, and her two daughters.
She'll make a wonderful mother.
Well, a mother like figure.
Look, I'm sure you'll all be the best of friends.
Whoa! ls this the right address?
There must be some mistake.
My dear, welcome.
And these must be your lovely daughters.
My precious Hattie and my special Olive.
Oh.
- And you must be Ella.
- Pleased to meet you.
Yes. The house looks delightful.
But l do seem to remember that at the noblemen's convention you said that you lived in a castle.
No, l said a man's home is his castle.
Hi. I'm Ella. Welcome to Frell.
What's with the prince pinups?
Hattie's president of the Prince Char fan club.
Char and his uncle are responsible for the segregation of the kingdom.
So? He's dreamy. ls this hutch meant to be a closet?
It's pathetic.
My clothes need more room than this.
- We'll have to use yours.
- Wha...?
Show it to us.
Oh.
It's so... quaint.
Almost like, well, it's just ugly, isn't it?
There's no room in here, either.
We're gonna have to throw out some of your gowns to make room.
- Wait. Get away from there!
- You get away.
Oh.
What's this? l do actually like this.
Please don't touch it. It was my mother's.
- Can l have it?
- No.
Oh.
It can be your welcome gift to me.
Come on, hand it over.
Oh.
Aren't you accommodating.
The second l sell the last of these,
I'll be back. l promise. l know it's not a great job, not even a good job -
OK, even a monkey could do it - but we need the money, Ella.
- I'll miss you, Father.
- I'll miss you, too.
(Hattie) Hey, Olive, we should call her
Ella the Smella from Frella.
Elves, giants, ogres and humans used to exist in harmony, but when King Florian was killed, allegedly by an ogre,
Sir Edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile all nonhuman creatures to the forest, keeping their land for himself.
Passionately put, Ella.
Give yourself a pat on the back.
(teacher) Hattie?
Oh.
What my unworthy opponent fails to realize is Sir Edgar has done a fantastic job.
He has driven the ogres out, and he has put giants and elves to work as laborers and entertainers.
Therefore, if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have today's thriving free-enterprise system.
It's only free because we've enslaved the poor creatures and they work for nothing.
Edgar is a monster, and l don't hold out much hope for his nephew, either.
Well, that shows what you know, aka nothing.
Prince Char will be the greatest king ever.
- Right, girls?
- (all) Yeah. l wonder if my opponent has based her opinion on the prince's politics or how cute she thinks his butt is.
Admit you're stupid and don't know what you're talking about.
I'm stupid and l don't know what I'm talking about.
(teacher) Ella?
Anyway, in conclusion...
Hold your tongue, Ella.
(teacher) Ella!
My tongue itches.
(teacher) If you're not going to take this seriously, l declare Hattie the winner.
Ya!
Uncle, do l have to go to this mall opening?
As heir to the throne, it's your royal responsibility, Char.
- You are a public figure, after all.
- Yes, but you're the one in charge.
Only for a little while longer.
Your coronation is next week.
You need to be out there with the people, Char.
Yes, shaking hands and kissing babies.
Exactly, Heston.
So the people can learn to trust us.
What's not to trust?
Nothing.
But while you've been away at school,
Char, the kingdom has been under siege.
In your absence, the ogres have become impossible.
He's right. Even the giants have become more and more treacherous.
But the giants have always been peaceful.
The ogres were peaceful too, until they ripped your father to shreds.
And l promised your father, should anything happen to him, l would take care of you and the kingdom.
And, well, I've kept my promise, haven't l?
Whoa!
Likewise, you must keep your promise to the people.
Now, let's put on a smile.
Remember, image is everything.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
It's wonderful to be here in your charming town of... Frell.
Prince Charmont and l...
We want Char! We want Char!
We want Char! We want Char!
We want Char!
Now it is my great pleasure to welcome my nephew, Prince Charmont.
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Stop the giant land grab!
- Say no to ogrecide!
- Ella! You are embarrassing us!
Go home now. l have to go. I'm sorry. l love you, Prince Char!
Hey! Prince Char!
- Are you a fast runner?
- Not particularly, no. Why?
Get him! d I'm walking on sunshine d Whoa-oh d I'm walking on sunshine d Whoa-oh
- Ow!
- Shush, shush, shush! d And don't it feel good?
- Prince Charmont.
- Please, call me... call me Char.
Sorry about that.
Occupational hazard.
- Allow me.
- l don't need your chivalry, thanks.
And I've no intention of curtsying, either, so forget it.
You can curtsy or not. That's your choice.
There's really nothing l can do about it.
Except have you beheaded, but that seems a bit extreme.
Charming. Why don't you do what your people usually do?
Steal my land and destroy my livelihood.
If you'll excuse me...
Wait a second. Come back here.
Hm?
What is your name?
Ella of Frell.
Well, Ella of Frell, you're the first maiden I've met who hasn't swooned at the sight of me.
Then maybe I've done you some good.
Look, I've never stolen anyone's land or livelihood. l want peace in the kingdom as much as anyone.
So you have a new plan once you take the crown?
Well...
Sort of. Of course, l couldn't reveal it to a subject.
That's what l thought.
You're all just the same.
You care more about your fan club and your next jousting tournament.
No, actually, I've never been comfortable with the whole adoring fan club thing.
Perhaps that's why l find your obvious disdain for me so refreshing.
Obvious? And l was trying so hard to hide it.
Where's my purse? It's back there.
Wait right there. l will get it.
Prince Charmont!
Prince Charmont!
Your Highness.
Are you crazy? Why didn't you move? l would have... were it not for your apparent fascination with knocking me to the ground.
That's the second time today, you realize.
I'll try and be more considerate next time I'm saving you.
Next time? What makes you think we'll see each other again?
Well, won't we?
No.
Ella of Frell, you are not like other girls.
You have no idea.
Ella, come here.
Shouldn't you be at home cleaning the fireplace, huh?
Stop flirting with him.
It's me he's going to have at his coronation.
Yeah, in the middle of the table with an apple in your mouth.
Go back to the mall with Olive.
- Ella.
- Oh.
Don't bother with her. Ugh.
I'm the one you want. l know everything about you.
I've got posters of you, and pictures.
And when we used to live in Lamia, l used to stand outside your castle and watch you turn your lights on and off.
Tell Ella I'll be in touch.
Right. I'll see to that.
- Where were you?
- Oh.
- l met the prince.
- You met the prince? l don't wanna talk about it.
Olive and Hattie were there.
Hattie. Why do you always do what Hattie tells you to do?
- l don't.
- Yes, you do.
- l don't.
- Tell the truth.
Oh, l do.
Olive, have you noticed anything strange about Ella?
No, not really.
Have you noticed it gets darker at night, then lighter when the sun comes up?
- That's because of Ella?
- Never mind.
- You've been acting odd, even for you.
- What do you mean?
- Oh... Don't let her see me.
- That's what l mean.
Aha.
- Areida, no!
- Ella, come here. l have to go.
- What?
- l need you to do me a little favor.
Take that.
Cool! Let me try! Take that.
And that potion bottle.
OK! OK, that's enough. l think that's for me to say, Ella.
We need one more thing.
Take those.
- Please don't make me do this.
- Well, since you said please...
No. Take them. Take them!
Run!
Stop that girl!
Buy a squirrel sandwich.
Get 'em while they're hot.
Here. Keep the change.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Coming through.
Try our new perfume.
Thanks.
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Ella, bravo!
Freeze!
Put your hands together.
You're under arrest.
A felon in my own family. l could die from embarrassment.
Promises, promises.
- You are a disgrace.
- Maybe she was put up to it.
Mandy's right, Mother. We were there.
It really wasn't poor Ella's fault at all.
She was forced to do it.
So, Ella, who put you up to it?
- (whispers) Tell her it was Areida.
- Ar...
I'm waiting. Tell me who's to blame.
Areida.
Areida! l might have guessed it.
- You are forbidden ever to see her again.
- What?
(Areida) Ella?
How dare she come here now?
Answer the door and tell her that you never want to see her again.
And tell her you could never be friends with an Ayorthian.
- Dame Olga, there must be some mistake.
- Please, Dame Olga.
Don't argue. Just do it.
Thank goodness you're all right.
What's wrong? l never wanna see you again.
Ha-ha. Very funny. l don't understand.
We're best friends. l could never be friends with an Ayorthian.
Just go.
I've done terrible things before, Mandy, but this is the worst thing the curse has ever made me do.
I've gotta do it. l have got to find Lucinda and get her to take back the curse.
You're right. l have something to show you.
This is gonna help you find her. l should have told you about this years ago.
- But l was a little embarrassed.
- Embarrassed? How?
Well, as you know,
I'm not the most talented fairy.
Anyway, this book... is my boyfriend, Benny.
Hey.
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet anyone, quite frankly.
You're the first introduction
I've had in 20 years.
- I've never seen anything like this.
- l know. No one has.
And l don't want them to, cos then they might take him away.
It was an accident. l was just trying a spell to trim his hair, and it went a little askew. l would have left her ages ago, except l love her so darn much.
Plus, l have no legs. l love you, too, my little Pooky Pages.
Not as much as l love you, Cuddlebuns.
- l love you more.
- OK.
Lots of love. Moving on.
Well, l want you to take him with you.
You mean I'm getting out of here?
Beyond these four walls?
There are so many places in my pages
I've been wanting to visit.
Wow. What is all this?
- He knows everything.
- Thanks, sweetie, but not everything.
If l did, I'd be a lot thicker.
Can he show me anything about Lucinda?
- Can l show you anything about Lucinda?
- Watch this.
Show me Lucinda.
Ta-da!
Cool trick.
Now, which Crockery Barn?
They're all over the kingdom.
Ah.
That's the glitch. He can't tell you where a person is. He can just show you pictures.
Like a crystal ball or a magic mirror.
Everything is so huge. ls that a wedding registry?
Duh! They're in Giantville.
Look, she's going to a wedding in Giantville.
- Benny, we're going to Giantville.
- How exciting.
( Olga) Ella, the girls and l need bouquets for our portrait sitting tomorrow.
Go and pick some.
♪ What you want, baby, I got it
♪ What you need, cos you know I got it
♪ All I'm asking is for a little respect when you get home, baby
Oh, my God!
So, as her step family scratched their newly found itches,
Ella was off, glad to be rid of the... witches.
Benny, can you show me a map of the Forest of Pim?
Of course.
Whoa.
According to this map, if we head due east towards Monster Rock, we can cut half a day off our journey.
- What was that?
- Probably something that wants to eat us.
Ouch!
- (man) Somebody help me!
- (man laughs)
- Wait a minute.
- (man) Sing soprano, little man!
Missed!
What do you think you're doing to that poor elf?
Oh.
Who's this who thinks she's so tough?
Look, l think it's only fair to warn you that
I'm practiced in the ancient art... of origami.
Paper folding? l was hoping you wouldn't know what that was.
Don't let him scare you, sweetheart!
Kick his butt!
Don't let her do that.
Now rabbit punch.
Combo. Kneel. Front-step kick.
Dragon-roundhouse kick.
This chick is nuts!
Let's get outta here. l think I'm gonna puke.
Let me help you with that. l am gonna need so much therapy after this.
Oh!
- Are you OK?
- No, l am not OK! l think l broke something, or dislocated it, or...
No, just a crick. Slannen of Pim.
Ella of Frell. Nice to meet you.
Well, if you're OK, then l have to be going, but good luck.
You're going? You can't walk in this wood on your own. How about a bite to eat?
That's very sweet, but I'm on a tight schedule.
Fine. Message received,
Miss ''l Think I'm All That''.
- That's not what l meant at all.
- l extend the hand of friendship...
- l am on a tight schedule. Were l not...
- Everybody's busy...
- ..l would love to have dinner with you.
- Great! I've got a coupon.
(whispers) Slannen.
If this is where you live, why are we sneaking around?
If they spot you, you'll be sorry.
You know how all elves are forced to sing and dance?
Yeah. So?

- Places, everyone.

What is this, anyway? Ella's secret diary.
Yes. Why don't you like music?
That's right. Because elves are supposed to be so happy and joyful all the time.
Singing and dancing for the man. l don't wanna be an entertainer. l wanna be a...
- What?
- Nothing.
- What were you gonna say?
- It's silly.
Please tell me. l wanna be a lawyer.
- l guess in small-claims court.
- What is that?
Nothing.
- Why can't you be a lawyer?
- Hello?
Elf. l forgot. The elfin restrictions
Sir Edgar passed.
No elf shall be engaged in any occupation other than singing, juggling and / or tomfoolery.
They're never gonna let me go to law school.
I'm never gonna get my day in court, never gonna stand in front of the judge and say
''You're out of order!
Permission to approach the bench?''
- ''l object!''
- No, l object.
- l heard it there. It's coming from the book.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
Great. l knew it. A talking book.
Good. Because for a minute there, l thought l was going crazy.
♪ Crazy
♪ I'm crazy for feeling so lonely
- What are you doing with Ella's things?
- Just a little tidying up.
- What's that?
- What? Nothing. It's personal.
A letter for Ella?
The prince's coronation ball.
He's invited that insolent little snip?
Girls, go and dust off your ball gowns and pack your bags. l think l may have found you another chance at your future husband.
Yes!
So you can really show me anything anywhere in the kingdom?
You're kind of like a walking, talking encyclopedia, except for the walking part.
- Come on.
- What?
What's going on?
Edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers to perform at the coronation.
Get in. And you.
Slannen, you've gotta go to Lamia and petition the prince.
- For what?
- To go to law school. You gotta stop this.
♪ The sun will shine
(Slannen) You want me to go to Lamia on my own?
We're going to Giantville.
It's on the way. Come with us.
The prince will never grant an audience with an elf. They think we're a joke. l have met Prince Charmont, and l think he might be different than his uncle.
- Why? Cos he's a hunk?
- No.
- What is he, about six foot?
- About.
Yeah, l hate the guy already.
I'm not wasting my time.
Lacking courage as well as height.
Count me in.
Elves aren't that short, you know.
That's just a myth created by that stupid
Elves and the Shoemaker story.
- Do l look small enough to fit in a shoe?
- No.
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
Are you sure he knows where he's going?
Hey, I'm right here. Just cos I'm a book doesn't mean l don't have ears.
Boys, if you can't play nice, you can't play together.
Oh, no. The rustling always comes before the screaming and the running. l knew this was gonna happen.
They'll just find pieces of us scattered across the forest floor.
Oh, a bunny. You know, the last known case of a bunny attack was, well, never.
It never hurts to be on your guard.
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
I've got this in hand.
Oi!
You! Thumper!
Out of the forest or no more carrots for you. l don't like carrots.
How do you feel about rabbits, cos one just went thataway. l am the ogre, Nish.
How do you like to be eaten?
Baked, boiled, shish-kebabbed?
How about free range?
Stop! No!
Ella of Frell. Hi, how are you doing? l think there's been a big mistake here.
See, I'm pro-ogre.
Pro-ogre?
Absolutely. l led a rally on your behalf the other day. Maybe you heard about it.
It'll only hurt for a moment, l promise.
I'm a fast eater.
Slannen, Slannen!
Please, l want to help.
Help? From a human?
Humans took everything from us. l was an ogre of leisure, with a simple life.
- Next thing you know...
- Now, not this again.
Nish, hurry up. I'm starving.
Right, you, into the pot.
Forget that.
- Who are you?
- l am the ogre, Nish.
We just did this. Didn't we just do this?
All right, that's enough fun and games.
Now, keep your mouth shut and don't move. ls it boiling yet?
It's not gonna boil if you stand there looking at it.
You couldn't show a picture of a big ogre heading our way?
- That would have been helpful.
- Oh! Oh! l think l see bubbles.
Let her go!
Untie yourself.
Truce! Truce!
Can't we just get along?
Are you one of the monsters who killed my father?
King Florian was a good man.
We lived in peace during his reign.
Why would we kill him?
I'll spare your lives where you didn't spare his.
You take your friends and find breakfast elsewhere.
We'll pick up something else on the way.
Anyway, you eat maiden, an hour later you're hungry again.
What are you doing here, with an elf for protection?
Do you get a kick out of near-death experiences?
No. l was fine. l had things well in hand. l could see that, as you were dangling over the boiling cauldron, no doubt lulling the ogres into a false sense of security.
Who's to say it wouldn't have worked if you hadn't come barging in? l see the score currently stands at chivalry two, gratitude zero.
Look...
You're right. I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- You're bleeding.
- Hm?
Oh, it's just a scratch.
You'd better let me help you with that.
- So, will l live?
- l think the odds are in your favor.
So... where were you headed?
The giants' village for a wedding.
I'm meeting my godmother.
That's on our way back to Lamia.
We'll accompany you.
That's not necessary.
It makes it so much easier rescuing you if l don't have to commute.
I'm so glad l was here for this interesting development.
- Look, l really appreciate the offer, but...
- Are you crazy? Tell him to come with us.
Come with us.
So, traveling with an elf?
Your boyfriend couldn't make it?
- No.
- Oh.
- Because l don't have one.
- Oh.
Your girlfriend doesn't mind being left alone?
- l don't have a girlfriend.
- Oh?
- l have many.
- Oh.
I'm kidding. Shouldn't believe everything you read in Medieval Teen.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Prince Charmont, permission to speak?
- Sure.
- You know the word coincidence?
It just so happens l was on my way to meet a certain royal someone in order to discuss some career options currently unavailable to...
Slannen wants to petition the kingdom for the right to become a lawyer.
- A lawyer?
- Why not?
There were no laws against it when your father was king.
That's not really my area of expertise.
My advice to you would be to talk to my uncle.
I'm sure if you make a good argument, he'll come round.
Well, thank you for your... advice.
- What?
- You're about to become king.
You'll have the power to make a difference in the world and you don't even care.
It's not like l asked to become king.
I've had no say in the matter.
Well, thanks to your uncle, there are a lot of people who have no say in the matter.
Nobody should be forced to do things they don't wanna do.
Take it from somebody who knows.
Ella! Ella!
You're not finished yet.
You work until sundown.
( Char) The giants have always been gentle. Why are they treated like slaves?
I'm sure my uncle doesn't know about this.
He couldn't.
(Ella) Maybe you can get to the bottom of this at the wedding.
( Char) Maybe you can find your godmother.
(Ella) Whoa.
They're not so bad. l thought they'd be all so big and scary.
Didn't hurt. l hope this is a good idea.
They must hate the royal family.
They'll respect your courage at showing up here.
Besides, they don't hold grudges.
They're bigger than that.
Prince Charmont.
What are you doing here?
No grudges, eh?
Well, l thought that maybe this would be a good time to possibly have a heart-to-heart.
But now I'm thinking l should come back when there's been a little less drinking.
He's here as a friend to hear your complaints.
Then welcome.
I'm looking for someone.
My godmother, Lucinda.
She was over there earlier.
Thank you. I'll be right back.
Excuse me. ls Lucinda Perriweather here?
Too late, sweetheart.
She left about an hour ago.
Do you know where l can find her?
Last l heard, she was somewhere living in Lamia.
Do you know where the bathroom is?
Benny, show me Lucinda.
Looks like she's getting an FWl.
- FWl?
- Flying while intoxicated.
- She could be anywhere.
- Ow!
Sorry.
Agh!
Ooh.
I'd no idea things were so bad. l promise, first thing after my coronation,
I'll help you buy your farms back.
I'll hold you to that.
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- No problem. We were done.
That's a fine young man you have here.
He's not fine. l mean, mine. He is fine...
Never mind.
So have you seen Slannen?
We have to leave.
My godmother's on some kind of bender.
You can't leave now.
It's the middle of the night.
You have to stay for the party.
OK, I'll stay. l appreciate your enthusiasm, but you don't have to stay. l don't wanna make you do anything you don't wanna do.
Thank you, Char. For everything.
So I'll see you around?
But l wish you would stay. l guess one more night wouldn't hurt.
Mmm. Yuck.
So you're looking for your godmother Lucinda?
She was supposed to be here, and now l have no idea where she is, and l need to find her as soon as possible bec...
Because l miss her.
OK.
- Did you think of trying the hall of records?
- No.
We have every year's census in the castle.
It's not open to everyone, but l could probably pull a few strings.
Char, l can't tell you what that would mean to me.
Well, then, it's settled.
You come with me to Lamia tomorrow.
OK.
- l gotta hide. They're after me.
- Who?
The giants.
They want me to sing. l don't sing!
There he is. There's our little entertainer.
Mr Koopooduk, l know you may find this hard to believe, but Slannen doesn't sing.
- Well, how about you, then?
- Me? Oh, no. l couldn't.
- Now, come on.
- Please don't.
Sing.

Really?
Because, you know, being an elf, l love to sing.
You know, l hope you don't mind me saying this, but you're much prettier than l would have expected.
Oh, l know. Giants are supposed to be big, ugly and mean.
It's because of stories like Jack and the Beanstalk.
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
I've seen weirder couples.
None that immediately come to mind, but still.
My stepsister Hattie would die if she knew l was here.
She's the president of your fan club, you know.
Oh, Hattie, yes. Thank you.
Now l know what name to put on the restraining order.
No, you're lucky. l wish l had brothers and sisters.
My mother passed away before she had any more children and...
My mother passed away, too.
Oh.
You know, she used to sing me to sleep every night.
My father used to sing to me, loudly and very off-key, but... l still miss him. l have Edgar, l guess.
He's not such a bad guy.
He risked his life to save my father.
And he brought me up as his own son. l know you don't like his politics much, but I'm sure when l tell him about the giants, he will correct the situation.
Yeah, or you could.
It took a lot of guts for you to come here.
Look at the way you smoothed things over.
You're a natural at this.
Wow, is that almost a compliment?
Almost. Now, don't go getting a big head.
Your crown won't fit.
You know what else?
Tomorrow I'm gonna go to my uncle and I'm gonna ask him to repeal the elfin restrictions.
Slannen will have his day in court, if l have anything to say about it. l think you're gonna be a great king someday.
Your father would have been proud.
Thanks. l think he would have really liked you.
Kiss me.
That wasn't an order, you know. l know. l want to look 25 at tonight's ball.
What do you suggest?
A time machine?
May l recommend our newest procedure?
Bat faeces and oxen blood.
Batox.
Works wonders, although l do caution you, some people have a temporarily bad reaction.
- Olga.
- Peter, what are you doing here?
I'm in town on business and heard you were here. l came to see Ella.
- ls Ella here?
- Of course. Where else would she be?
She's... she's... with Hattie and Olive, taking a tour of the castle.
Next we move into the castle lobby. l can't believe it.
Prince Char walked on this actual floor!
Ladies, ladies, ladies!
Stop tonguing the foyer.
- Show us where Char showers.
- (excited giggling) l bet he showers naked!
- Hold it, pipsqueak.
- I'm with the prince. And I'm not that short.
- Are you singing at the coronation?
- Heck, no.
No elves in the palace unless they're performing.
Discrimination. intentional infliction of...
Whoa!
..bodily harm.
These portraits were recently commissioned in honor of tomorrow's coronation.
Right, follow me.
What are they doing here? l don't mean to rush, but now l really need to find my godmother, and Slannen, too.
- Where is he?
- My uncle'll send the guards to find him.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't forget, you are with the future king.
- Char.
- Hello, Uncle.
I've been looking all over for you.
And who might this charming young lady be?
This is Ella. Ella of Frell.
Ella, this is my Uncle Edgar.
And this is his... Heston.
Hey.
So, l trust your journey was pleasant?
We had a little run-in with some ogres, but Char got the best of them.
You could have been killed.
Ah, well. One just has to grin and bear it, l always say. Grin and bear it.
So, Char, might l trouble you for a moment?
The crown maker needs to see you in your chambers for a fitting.
Sure. l just have to take Ella to the... to the hall of records.
Yes, well, hop to it, then, both of you.
You were right about that girl. Very odd.
And I'm afraid she's been filling our prince's head with dangerous new thoughts.
Here's the latest census. Names are listed first by location then species.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Sorry l couldn't be of more help, but l don't have a census. l mean, look at the size of that thing. l do have a restaurant guide.
Lucinda, l hope you're in here.
Ella has lots of interesting opinions about the kingdom, Uncle. You should hear them. l can't wait.
The giants' working conditions, for instance. They're unbelievable.
Luckily, I've talked to them and they're definitely open for negotiation.
The only negotiations between me and the giants will be over our vegetable deliveries.
Good one, sire.
This isn't a joke, Uncle Edgar.
We'll talk about it after your coronation, yes?
Fine, but we will talk.
Of course. l... I'm going to ask her to marry me.
Who? This... this Ella of Frell?
Yes. Tonight, at the ball.
At the same time and in the same place as my father proposed to my mother.
- (Hattie) Get off! Do you know who l am?
- (guard) Come with me.
- What now?
- (Hattie) Get off! Get off me!
- So, Ella of Frell is your sister.
- (Hattie drinks noisily through straw)
- Stepsister, actually.
- Really?
Tell me, what do you know about her?
What's in it for me?
How about that your eyeballs remain inside your head?
Now, now, Heston.
We like these girls. They're our friends. l can't find anything in any of these books.
Benny, show me Lucinda.
(Benny) No, still sacked out. l don't know where else to...
Dun Flyin Retirement Community for Faeries?
Why don't we just cut to the chase, hm? l might even be willing to throw Prince Char into the deal.
Let's see, now. After the coronation he'll need to take a queen, and shall we say... his hand in marriage?
Queen Olive.
For the eldest daughter, of course.
Ella does everything she's told. l don't know why, but she does.
She can't help it.
Lucinda Perriweather,
Dun Flyin Retirement Community for Faeries, Lamia Heights.
Benny! Benny, we got her.
Hello, Ella. l hope you've found everything to your satisfaction?
- Yes, thank you.
- Good, good.
Oh, dear. How clumsy of me. Pick it up.
Very good.
Now touch your toes.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes. And while you're about it, why don't you pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time?
Now jump up and down.
- Please stop.
- Wait.
Perhaps you know this one. d Put your left foot in, your left foot out d Put your left foot in and shake it all about d Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake d Shake your booty, shake your booty
This is fabulous!
Hate to be a party pooper, but, Edgar, evil plans, remember?
Yes, you're right. OK, stop.
As you know, tonight is the coronation ball.
At some point, amidst your frolicking and romancing,
Prince Char will sweep you away to the hall of mirrors.
Then, just before midnight, he will take you by the hand and ask you a question.
How do you know all this?
We know everything, my dear.
And the one thing we know with most certainty is that at the stroke of midnight you will take this dagger and plunge it through his heart and kill him.
No! No, l won't!
Oh, yes, you will.
You will, because l order you to.
Actually, it's lucky you're here, so l won't have to do it myself.
You'd kill your own nephew?
Why not? l killed my own brother.
What? Why?
- l want to be king.
- Duh!
Now go.
Wait.
There's one more thing.
You will tell no one of this plan.
- Can l help you?
- I'm looking for Lucinda Perriweather.
- It's kind of urgent.
- Sorry. She was kicked out last week.
- Do you know where l could find her?
- Nope.
You don't understand. If l don't find her, something terrible's going to happen.
Finding her would be something terrible.
(Ella) Dear Char.
This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do, and I hope you'll understand.
We can't be together.
I can't tell you why.
Please believe that this is the only solution.
I wish you the best.
I really do believe you're going to be a great king.
Goodbye for ever. Ella.
(narrator) Now, if she stayed clear of the prince until midnight had passed, then Char would be safe.
But how long could that last?
Slannen, where have you been?
What are you doing? Never mind.
This may sound strange, but there's something l need you to do.
You are one freaky chick. l need you to go back into the forest and rally all the elves and giants you can find.
- You want me to go back in there?
- You'll need all the help you can get.
Someone has to get into the castle, find
Benny and keep Char away from Edgar.
- Why? What's going on?
- l already told you, l can't tell you.
But if you don't, you might very well be stuck singing ''Kumbaya'' the rest of your life.
Fine! Into the forest of certain death walks Slannen.
- Thank you.
- Yeah, whatever.
Where's your little friend?
Yes. She should be here by now. l don't want to talk about her.
Agh! Oh!
- Oh! Oh!
- (tree creaks)
Slannen, please hurry.
Would you stop that?
When you steal from here, you are stealing from me now.
- What do you mean?
- This is my future home, isn't it?
- (clears throat)
- Oh.
Hi. l was just polishing...
Would you... would you care to dance?
Are you kidding?
That's all she ever talks about.
You wanted to look younger.
If you spent less time on your face and more on your maternal duties, we'd know where Ella was right now.
Ouch!
Whoa!
What the...?
This isn't the salad bar at Brelly's.
Lucinda. Lucinda! Lucinda!
Oh, my goodness. Do l know you, child?
Ella of Frell. You gave me a gift.
Oh, yes. l remember you.
- The obedient one.
- l am so happy to see you. l have been looking everywhere for you.
- l need you to take the gift back.
- Take it back? l don't think so.
It's not that I'm not grateful for the gift. l am, really.
But because of the gift,
I'm about to do something horrible to this guy l really like and might even love.
Girl, you out of your mind.
Everybody loves my gifts.
Lucinda! Lucinda, l am begging you. l will do anything you ask.
Please take it back.
You don't like my gift? Fine.
Get rid of it yourself.
Don't blame me for your problems.
- Did l chain your butt up to this tree, huh?
- Well...
- Huh?
- But you...
No.
And, in fact, just to prove what a gem l am... I'll unchain you.
What? No! No!
Aren't l fabulous?
Now, look at you. A pretty girl like you should be at the ball.
- What?
- Go get down with the prince.
- No, l can't go!
- Well, not dressed like that.
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
OK, that hurt.
Give, give, give.
You're welcome.
Tell me about your sister.
Olive? ldiot.
- No, Ella.
- Oh. l don't wanna talk about her.
She's so dreary.
- l just wanna talk about us.
- Us?
It sounds even more wonderful when you say it.
(Hattie) Ow!
Something tells me she just couldn't stay away.
- We need to talk.
- Char, please...
Please tell me you never wanna see me again. l will if you tell me that you don't love me.
- It's not that.
- Then why did you write me that letter?
Tell me how you really feel about me. l love you. But l am wrong for you, Char. l am wrong for the kingdom. ls that what this is about?
Ella, that's crazy.
Come with me.
The hall of mirrors?
When l was little, my father brought me in here.
He told me to look in the mirror and see myself as a great leader.
Somehow, l never could.
And then you come along.
Ella, what's wrong? l wish l could tell you. l wish l could tell you everything.
These last few days have been so perfect.
Well, except for the bit where we almost got eaten by ogres.
And you wrote me a letter that ripped my heart out.
And l had to dance with Hattie.
But none of these things matter.
We're together now.
And when we're together, it's like magic.
- l never want it to end.
- l know, l know.
- And l feel the same, but...
- That's why l brought you here.
- Char, please listen to me.
- Ella, l know. You're scared.
I'm scared, too.
This is... this is a big step.
Ella...
Ella of Frell, will you marry me?
No, no, no, no, no!
- No?
- No. l don't understand. What is it?
My politics? Your family?
Because those things aren't important.
What's important is what's in our hearts.
If our love is strong, we can conquer anything. l do love you, Char.
- (Hattie) Ella, come here.
- ( Olga) Don't argue. Just do it.
- ( Olive) Take that.
- Keep your mouth shut.
- (Hattie) Take those.
- (ogre) Don't move.
(Edgar) On the stroke of midnight you will take this dagger and plunge it through his heart and kill him.
What's inside you is stronger than any spell.
You will no longer be obedient.
You will no longer be obedient!
I'm free. l can't believe it. I'm free.
You tried to kill me.
Guards!
- No, Char...
- Take her away.
No, Char, please.
Please, Char, wait. No, Char!
Char, please, wait. l can explain! Please listen to me! Char!
No, please. No! No!
There's been a huge mistake.
Please.
Just listen. Please!
(Edgar) You realize, of course, she'll have to be put to death immediately. l just don't understand.
Maybe l should go and talk to her.
No. No, l forbid you to go down there.
Your Highness, your uncle didn't want to frighten you, but the secret police informed us of a possible uprising.
Those ogres in the forest, they were after you.
The girl was obviously part of the scheme.
The ogres never planned to hurt her.
She was just toying with your emotions, Char, so she could get close to you and commit the murder herself. l... l just don't believe it.
Yes. Yes, it does seem quite fantastic.
You let me worry about all this, hm?
You just concentrate on tomorrow's coronation.
Sire, you know I've been working with the Red Guard.
Why not call them in now and take over the whole kingdom like we planned?
First we must find a way to get rid of the prince.
And l think l have a pretty good idea how to do it.
All right. We just have to find a way to get past those guards.
(Benny) Help! Please, somebody get me out of here!
Benny? What's he doing here?
Ugh!
- Slannen, you've saved my life.
- Are you OK?
- l could kiss you.
- l think a nice thank-you note is enough. l think Ella's in trouble.
Something to do with Edgar.
We have to find her.
Show me Ella.
Edgar's done this?
We've gotta go in there and stop him.
It'll take courage, bravery... l was gonna ask you how you'd like to be eaten, but if it's Edgar you're after... count us in.
Welcome aboard.
Executioner coming through.
Enter.
- Help.
- l wouldn't do that if l were you.
Open up. I'm Miss Frell's legal representation.
- Her what?
- Her lawyer, numskull.
If the gauntlet doesn't fit, you must acquit.
Now, open this door before l sue you for everything you own.
Now, move it! Come on! Come on!
Thank you. Slannen of Pim is not an elf easily drawn into a legal battle, but when faced with a challenge to equality, freedom and civil liberties, this elf will draw the sword of justice.
And, furthermore...
Excuse me, what is going on here?
- Well, can we at least take him to go?
- Put the nice man down.
- (Ella) Slannen?
- Ella?
Ella!
- Slannen!
- Oh, Ella!
- Benny!
- Are you OK?
I'm fine, but Char might not be.
Show me Edgar.
- (Slannen) That's Char's crown.
- (Ella) He's poisoned it.
We gotta go. Come on. Come on, guys.
We got a coronation to crash.
People of Lamia.
Today is a very special day for our kingdom.
For today you are here to witness the crowning of a king.
Bring in the crown.
Drop that crown!
- ( Char) Ella?
- Seize them!
It's payback time.
Charge!
Char!
Kill them, and anyone who gets in your way.
Oh, my God!
No! No, no, no, no! l can't believe I'm saving you, after you tried to kill me. l didn't try to kill you.
You get away from her!
- Take this!
- (Benny) Hey!
That dagger you were about to plunge into my back was an early wedding present?
Hello! Help!
Mandy! Help!
Fairies in kingdoms across the land, please help me turn Benny back into a man.
A pumpkin?
OK, maybe l did try to kill you, but that wasn't me.
- What?
- Maybe it was me, but it wasn't my fault.
Then Edgar found out about the curse and he ordered me to kill you.
So l had to break up with you, even though I'm pretty sure that you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
That crown he's about to put on your head, it's poisoned.
Duck.
Whoa.
- Edgar's trying to kill me?
- Yes. Hold on.
How vulgar!
Excuse me. Thank you.
Char, there's one more thing.
He killed your father.
What? That can't be true.
Well, of course it's not true.
Who are you gonna believe? This lying little twit, or the man who raised you?
- He tried to kill Char!
- Get him!
Uh-oh.
Well, l guess that answers that question.
You vile little girl. l should have disposed of you when l had the chance.
You almost destroyed this kingdom.
You killed my father, your own brother.
How could you?
How could l? l wanted something, he was in my way, l got rid of him.
He wasn't fit to wear this crown, and you're not fit to wear this crown.
This crown is mine.
This kingdom is...
Oops.
We won't be needing that.
You saved my life.
Then we're even.
Ella! Ella, stop kissing him!
You are never to kiss him again.
You wanna bet?
Marry me?
- Now, that I'll do.
- (all) Ah! l now pronounce you husband and wife.
To a nation of equals.
To my good friends.
And to my true love, Ella.
So, such is the story of Ella of Frell, a spunky young woman once under a spell.
If there's one thing to learn, it's you just can't go wrong if you follow your heart and end with a song.

NARRATOR: This is a story of the past... and the future.
We will come to the future, but first, the past.
NARRATOR:
Here we have the Earl of Warwick.
We can see by his petulantly arched brow... that he is not en route to a good deed.
WITCH: Mmm.
Obey!
Enchanted...
Do you wish to live, old witch?
You have committed grave crimes against God and your king, have you not?
- Have mercy, my lord.
- Silence.
The Frenchman Count Thibault of Malfete... shall wed Lady Rosalind, the daughter of our king.
I desire that woman.
Hmm.
I alone am fit to take her hand.
WITCH: And her castle, lands, the riches that are her dowry.
Thou art not as stupid as thou art hideous, old hag.
Tomorrow night... the king shall feast the arrival of the count.
I want the count dead before the feast is over.
EARL: A small fortune in gold... awaits the sorceress who doth my bidding.
Not so fast.
How shall I know thy magic is sufficient to the task?
WITCH:
Does thou find proof enough in this?
EARL: Aah!
That will do!
Take it, witch!
Was that proof enough, my lord?
Come to the king's castle tomorrow night... and carry out my plan.
If you fail... you will be burned.
Ohh!
NARRATOR:
Our hero, of course, knew none of this.
He was safely in his entourage... traveling, he thought, to his wedding.
Here he is... the Count of Malfete.
He is also a duke, a baron, and a lord.
A nobleman, plagued by only those small things... which inconvenience a knight... the permanent presence of his sisters... his mother and father... and, as all knights must endure... an idiot servant, Andre... whose smell made people faint... a considerable achievement... among a population who never bathed.
FATHER: Down, peasant!
NARRATOR: The duke, or Thibault... as his subjects were not allowed to call him... was joyous.
The long-awaited day of his marriage had come at last.
WOMAN: What have we got here?
Another lot of bloody royal bastards?
MAN: Must be that French duke come to marry the king's daughter.
Mind the forest!
There be dragons who'll make dinner from your bones in there!
NARRATOR:
Andre loved and protected his master.
Master! Master!
The forest... it is haunted!
NARRATOR: Thibault responded.
ANDRE: Thank you, master.
NARRATOR: With every step... he came closer to the castle of his beloved.
He hoped he would be with her soon... for rare was the journey in which Thibault... did not have to stop and rescue someone.
NARRATOR: This was no exception...
For like his ancestors... he lived by an ancient family rule...
ANDRE: A woman in distress!
NARRATOR: The only one he knew.
WOMAN: Aah! Aah!
Beware, sire.
NARRATOR: Courage was more than a duty.
Courage was his creed.
Aah!
MOTHER: Andre! Join your master!
FATHER: I'm talking to you!
Go, go! Stupid peasant!
Sire! Behind you!
Ohh!
NARRATOR: Naturally...
THIBAULT: Courage is our creed!
NARRATOR: He was invincible.
NARRATOR: Except he was not invincible... against witchcraft.
For this would be his last victory... in this millennium.
MAN: Afternoon, sir.
ROSALIND: I hear a rumor... thou art marrying tomorrow, my lord.
I have heard this rumor.
I have also heard... the bride is the most beautiful in all of England.
But it is not true.
- It is not?
- No.
Am I not the most beautiful bride... in all of England?
THIBAULT: No. Wait.
The most beautiful bride... in all the world.
Wear this for me, Thibault.
Wear it against thine heart.
Thou shalt always be true.
WOMAN: Lady Rosalind.
Thou shalt not disgrace thyself... before the wedding.
ROSALIND:
I must hide and dress for the banquet.
Ooh ooh ohh!
Sire, your bride looks like a gorgeous sparrow.
Silence, you impudent peasant.
Show respect to your future mistress.
ANDRE: Yes, master.
Ah! Thank you, my lord.
Quite so, Your Majesty.
When our lady drinks her wine... her eyes will fill with hellish visions.
WITCH:
The count will appear as a hideous beast.
Then my magic will compel her to kill him. Ha ha ha.
KING: My dear friends and noble guests.
Thibault, Count of
Malfete and Papincourt...
I hereby declare this castle a wedding present.
THIBAULT: Hear ye!
Your Majesty, in every way that I am able...
I will serve my beautiful lady... and do honor to thy kingdom.
Drink of my cup... and you will know my thoughts.
ROSALIND: And thou wilt know mine.
(GURGLING) Ah!
My lord?
- Ah!
- Thibault!
ROSALIND: My lord!
Ohh!
THIBAULT: Ohh!
Aah!
What is it, Thibault?
FATHER:
This is not the kind of behavior...
What is happening to you, my son?
Are you crazy? Drunk?
Count Thibault, this is no way to behave... in an English court!
Beasts from Hell!
ROSALIND: Ohh! That is my mother!
Thibault, that is my mother!
Demon!
Oh, no!
THIBAULT: No! What have I done?
It is not me. It is witchcraft!
THIBAULT: Andre, find me a wizard!
France must pay for this treachery.
THIBAULT: Find me a wizard!
PRIEST: Have pity on a poor condemned man.
ANDRE: We are here for the last rites.
ANDRE: My lord! We have to hurry.
What wizard is this?
He's English, my lord.
But his magic is very good.
Your bloody Earl of Warwick did this to me.
Indeed he did.
And he'd have me, too, if he knew that I was here.
I beg you, my sire. Let him save you.
Can you bring my lady back from the dead?
I can reanimate her corpse... but I don't think that my lord... would like the way she looks... or smells.
There is another way.
Time is like a mountain.
Riddled with tunnels.
I can open one of these tunnels for thee... and return thee to the moment before the murder.
If thy will is strong enough.
Don't you think this priest has had enough time?
Hurry up, Father.
GUARD: Unlock this door! Now!
Drink this potion, my lord... and thou shalt descend into the Mountain of Time.
Ohh! It smells awful.
You should not drink that.
What if you become a frog, or goat's feet?
You are right.
Drink first, bastard.
THIBAULT:
And if you die, I will avenge your death.
GUARD: What are you doing in there?
GUARD: Open this door!
Open this door!
It tastes like the shit of the pork.
And he should know.
Ohh.
Per Horus et per Ra...
WIZARD: Et per Salem... invictus...
Ducere!
I forgot the grouse eggs.
Oh, it's a disaster.
I've lost them in the corridors of Time.
GUARD: Open this door! Open this door!
BOY: Wow. Cool!
GIRL: This is cool.
This is pretty cool, yeah. Look at them!
TEACHER: Shh.
See the peasant sleeping on the floor?
In those days, people didn't think... that peasants deserved any better than that... and they were considered the property of their masters.
Now, the boss of this peasant is the knight.
TEACHER: See how beautiful the knight's clothing is?
Miss Rodett, that one is hot, and it just snorted!
(CHUCKLES) Now, Tammy, that's impossible... because they're just mannequins... and mannequins don't snort.
TAMMY: Well, that one just did.
No, because they're not real.
They're just like... dolls.
TEACHER: Ah! Oh, shit!
What are you doing in my chamber?
Aah!
ANDRE: Your chamber... has been cleaved in half, my lord.
This is not the castle!
THIBAULT: What?
ANDRE: Oh, look at this, my sire!
It is Satanic!
Ohh.
THIBAULT:
This is Hell, and we are condemned souls.
Come. We shall find the prince of this netherworld... and beg his mercy.
ANDRE: Wait for me, my lord!
Dr. Brady, come quick.
GUARD: Two guys with swords and armor...
Miller, you're always overreacting.
BRADY: Now, relax.
There's absolutely no need to...
MILLER: Police are on their way.
Peasant, please.
Show me the way out of this prince castle!
Yes!
- Pee-yoo!
- Out this way.
- They stink!
- Have a nice day.
- Bye. Good luck.
- Wait!
Peasant! Wait! Stop!
THIBAULT: What is this? The Gates of Hell!
ANDRE: Look at its eyes of fire!
ANDRE: Dragon! It's a red dragon!
THIBAULT: Attack!
What the hell are you doing?
ANDRE: Take that, beast!
ANDRE: We have killed it!
THIBAULT:
Ah, yes. It is no longer breathing.
God is punishing us for practicing the Black Arts.
Let us pray for forgiveness.
Heavenly Father, forgive us our sins.
ANDRE:
We are so, so, so, so, so... so sorry.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Dr. Brady?
Ah, Julia. This is Julia Malfete... who heads up the Medieval Art department.
She donated the famous
12th century castle exhibit.
Julia designed the exhibit where we found the two men.
That stuff right there is the result of the body search.
The big guy had the gold coins... the sword, the shield, and that ring.
The little guy had the salt pork... the sausage, the dagger... a molar.
And that box... which he probably stole.
Not from us.
JULIA: Most thieves take valuable things.
They usually don't bring them.
This is a Gothic pixis... the kind of design they were making in Canterbury... at the end of the 12th century.
It has emeralds and rubies.
BRADY: Why did the two men sleep here?
They could've booked a suite at the Ritz.
So, you said that you got these out of their pockets?
OFFICER: That's right.
Except the sausage.
- (FLIES BUZZING)
- Hmm. Mm-hmm.
JULIA: This stamp ring is fantastic.
My family's coat of arms.
Sergeant, can I meet these thieves?
ANDRE: Master, I'm hungry.
My tummy rumbles like a beast.
How can you think of food after such tragedy?
Yes.
What I would not give to see once more my precious...
ANDRE: My lord! Look, she's alive!
THIBAULT: Rosalind. My fair Rosalind.
My bride. My ravishing flower.
Mistress! My mistress!
What are you doing?
THIBAULT: It is a miracle. A miracle.
Do I know you?
Do you not recognize me, my lady?
I am the Count of
Malfete and Papincourt... the Duke of Anjou.
I am your faithful Thibault.
You're who?
And I am Andre le Pate, valet of the count.
Please, forgive me for what I did to you... my dear Rosalind.
My name isn't Rosalind. It's Julia.
No! You are my Rosalind.
The lock of hair you gave me on our wedding day.
I carry it over my heart.
Please, my love, see for yourself.
You see?
It is the color of wheat on a summer's day.
The color of candlelight.
THIBAULT: It is your own.
BRADY: Stop this!
- That's enough!
- Rosalind!
You'll be safer outside!
THIBAULT:
Do not leave me! Do not be afraid!
- BRADY: You don't want to see this.
- (YELLING AND FIGHTING)
THIBAULT: Courage is our creed!
Courage is our creed!
Wait, stop! I know this man!
"Courage is our creed."
JULIA: That's our family motto.
This man is my cousin.
It's in here.
You see, I thought he was dead.
He disappeared when a storm... capsized his yacht during the Admiral's Cup.
They never recovered his body... so, of course, declared him dead.
He was a very distant
French cousin of mine... but as the last living Malfete,
I inherited his estate.
OFFICER: If he's your cousin, what do you want me to do with him?
ANDRE: Sire...
Why does Lady Rosalind call herself Julia... and allow us to be beaten and chained?
Peasant... this is not our time.
THIBAULT:
The wizard did not send us into the past.
He sent us into the next millennium.
We are thirty generations removed from Malfete.
Julia is not my beloved.
She's my descendant.
Descendant?
Amber, it's Julia.
Could you get me Hunter? It's important.
AMBER: That rabbit of yours is on the phone again.
HUNTER: Hey, bunny. What's up?
JULIA: Thibault Malfete just showed up at the museum.
HUNTER: Thibault Malfete?
That's impossible.
Isn't he supposed to be...
- I know.
- Are you sure it's him?
He looks exactly like his photos.
JULIA: Hunter, he quoted the family motto.
Does he know yet that we're selling his entire estate?
JULIA:
Well, it's hard to say what he knows.
He's a little strange.
Hunter, this is terrible.
I mean, it's wonderful that he's alive... but it's terrible that we started to sell the estate.
Oh, God, I feel awful.
HUNTER:
The English courts declared him dead.
We're well within our legal rights.
How were we supposed to know he was still alive?
Has he mentioned anything about money?
JULIA: Money?
How can you worry about money at a time like this?
No, I'm just worrying about you.
You don't handle surprises well.
Where is your cousin now?
He and this friend of his are downstairs with security.
Why don't we bring them home with us tonight?
He's family after all.
We want to be hospitable.
You're wonderful.
I'll pick you all up in about five minutes.
Love ya. Bye, bunny.
Bye, big bear.
Oh, my God.
Thibault Malfete's still alive.
This is a disaster.
Blah, blah, blah.
You're pouting.
I hate it when you call her bunny.
You, my dear, are so much hotter than a bunny.
My God, look at yourself.
You're a tigress.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Aah!
THIBAULT: Lady Julia, there has been a terrible mistake.
I'm so sorry. We thought you were dead.
Dead? No, the wizard was a fool, but not a killer.
THIBAULT: He only sent us the wrong way.
Excuse me?
We fell into the Mountain of Time.
Wow.
THIBAULT:
I must return to my time to prevent... a great tragedy to our family.
THIBAULT: I ask for your assistance.
I'll do whatever I can.
(SIRENS, HORNS,
AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT)
Ohh!
- Awful.
- Ohh.
Whoa!
ANDRE: We must not go out!
What... what are you doing?
What are you doing?
No, we have to wait outside.
Hunter can't park here.
We have to wait for him.
Oh, my God.
Bloody coward.
JULIA: We have to...
Those boys are lost.
I must go and retrieve them.
Ah!
Aah!
This is England?
- No...
- Meat!
This is Chicago.
Meat, meat, meat!
This is the United States.
ANDRE: Meat!
The last I remember was in Sussex, England... in my castle chambers.
You don't remember anything since then?
No.
Do you think maybe you've suffered... some sort of memory loss from the accident?
Yes! After I drank the potion,
I remember nothing.
- Onions?
- All of them!
All right. You like to eat hot dogs, huh?
I like to eat every kind of dog.
VENDER: Now, what are you doing?
- Aargh!
- Leave the dogs!
JULIA: No, no, no. Stop it!
Please, stop.
I'm sorry, I'm so very sorry.
JULIA: He's French.
Yeah. Very.
Hi, honey.
The situation's much worse than I thought.
What are you talking about?
Bonjour.
Holy shit.
JULIA: Hunter, this is Thibault Malfete.
Thibault, this is my fiancé, Hunter.
HUNTER: Pleased to meet you.
- Are you noble?
- No. Sorry.
But I can certainly tell that you are.
JULIA:
And this is Andre, Thibault's assistant.
Hello, big nose.
THIBAULT: Run behind the chariot, peasant.
Yes, master!
JULIA: He can't run behind the car.
- THIBAULT: He cannot ride. He's not noble.
- JULIA: Yes, but he has to ride in the car.
- He's very fast.
- We're taking the freeway.
- You can run 70 miles an hour?
- I have good boots.
JULIA:
No. You must sit in the car, please.
- I am fast.
- I'm sure you are.
I'd love to see you run sometime.
- Obey.
- Yes, my lord.
Do you want some dog?
Too fast.
Are you OK, Mr. Pate?
THIBAULT: Ohh. Too fast!
Honey, could you slow down just a little bit?
HUNTER: I'm going 22 miles an hour.
Yes, I know. Could you try going 21?
DRIVER: Hey, what's the matter with you?
You don't know how to drive?
HUNTER: Go.
What?
It's gonna be fine.
Oh, dear. (CLEARS THROAT)
HUNTER: Get in and open the door.
Let's go inside.
Hi, sweetie. Hello, Churchill.
Hello. Come here. Give Mom a high-five.
All right. That's my boy.
Let's go.
ANGELIQUE: Like the hat.
WOMAN: Angelique! I need you now!
Come here, peasant.
- Come now!
- OK, I'm coming.
WOMAN: Hurry up.
THIBAULT: Ahh.
THIBAULT: How did you do that?
THIBAULT: Night.
(CHUCKLES) Day.
THIBAULT: Night. Day!
I do not have this invention in my castle.
JULIA: You don't have power?
I have the power to judge and condemn to death... any villain on my land.
Oh. Really?
Hunter will be so jealous.
I'm gonna get you two something to drink.
Make Hunter one of his power-dude smoothie things.
I'd offer you one... but nobody seems to like them but him.
Andre, could you please stop that?
I'm just starting to feel like I'm in a disco.
THIBAULT: My dear lady... you said you would offer me your assistance.
JULIA:
Oh, yes. Anything. What do you need?
I need to find a wizard.
ANDRE: Aah! Sorry, master. Sorry!
- Sorry!
- Idiot!
Apologize to the lady!
Oops.
ANDRE: Sorry, master. I ask for mercy.
Forgive him, milady.
JULIA: It's OK. The floor needed to be cleaned anyway.
So, you were saying something about what... should we say a wizard?
I need to go back into the tunnels of Time.
Of course.
I need to just understand what has happened to you.
Now, your yacht went down in a storm?
No. You must listen.
I am from the time of Thibault VI... and I have come to the future.
OK. Tunnels of Time. Wizards. Thibault VI.
JULIA: Oops!
Are you OK?
Yes, lady.
THIBAULT: Lovely flower,
I see you do not believe me.
It is a pity, but please... try.
ANDRE: Oh.
Yes. Of course I'll try.
ANDRE: She's green.
I never really did like the taste of this.
Oh, my God. What happened?
JULIA: Nothing.
I'm eating this very good meat... with vegetables in a fine sauce.
I will shit easy tomorrow.
JULIA: It's jet lag.
All right, I'm sure you would like to wash your hands and whatever else.
Why don't you come with me?
All right. Here you go.
Just gonna take this.
Julia! Can I talk to you for a moment, please?
Don't be bashful with the soap.
What is it, master? A throne?
THIBAULT: It could be.
HUNTER: They're crazy!
JULIA:
They have been through a terrible ordeal.
They have amnesia.
Amnesia? They're wacked!
They're completely retarded.
They're... Woo! You know?
- Clean water.
- Ha ha!
The long towel has a good fragrance.
Thibault is my cousin, Hunter.
He's my family.
Yeah? I'm not so sure.
He doesn't strike me as being particularly noble.
Julia, come down here! It's an emergency.
- Very good fountain.
- Yes.
Your French relatives are bathing in the toilet.
Oh, my God.
Toothbrushes.
I'll just leave them right here.
JULIA: I'll be right back.
JULIA: I'm going to take a shower... then go tackle that kitchen.
HUNTER:
Hurry. Our dinner reservation's at 8:00.
JULIA: Oh! Where are we going?
Latour.
Isn't that just a little formal for our guests?
First you tell me your cousin's nobility then you get mad at me when I suggest... that just maybe, he's not.
Now you're upset because I pick the best restaurant in town.
You make it impossible for me to do the right thing.
No. You're right. Latour's gonna be great.
Thank you, big bear.
- I'll be in the shower.
- All right.
ANDRE: Ah. Very good flavor.
This is not wine, ignorant peasant.
THIBAULT: It is oil for the bath.
Mmm. Very good perfume.
ANDRE: Very creamy.
THIBAULT: Bathe, servant.
No, my sire. I have taken a bath at Christmas.
- Bathe!
- No, no!
I'm afraid! I don't want to catch cold and die!
THIBAULT: Be silent, peasant!
Ahh.
Do you have another bottle of this bathing oil for Andre?
HUNTER: Do you realize the bath you just took cost over $2,000?
That's American dollars.
Is that a lot?
HUNTER: Yes, it is.
Then I will repay you with one of my swans.
HUNTER: Oh, well. That sounds fair.
THIBAULT:
My family tree. So many descendants.
- Hello?
- Mr. Cassidy, please.
Yeah. Hold on one second. Hunter?
HUNTER: Yeah, bunny?
Honey, it's your office.
Do you want to take it?
- I'll take it upstairs.
- Oh, OK.
AMBER: Hello? Hello?
ANDRE: Hello.
AMBER: Hello?
Hello.
Who is this?
I'm Andre le Pate. I have big balls... and my ass breathes fire.
Wow. That must hurt.
- Hello.
- Hello?
HUNTER: I told you never to call me here.
Well, I forgot.
- Hello! Enter!
- Somebody there with you?
- Aah!
- Jesus!
HUNTER: Hang up the damn phone, or I'll call the police!
I think he hung up the phone.
It was Thibault's little retarded homuncular assistant.
Look, this is dangerous.
I'll call you back after Julia goes to bed, OK?
THIBAULT: Lady Julia.
You are more than a rose.
You are love's own flower.
Come on. That's ridiculous.
No, I just... This old thing,
I threw it on.
I haven't worn it in a couple of years... but I guess I should learn how to take a compliment.
Thank you.
Almost.
Thank you.
Much better.
Kissing cousins.
Ooh la la.
I don't think that I've ever seen anyone... eat a steak in two bites before.
Ah.
ANDRE: Thank you, master!
ANDRE: Be blessed!
MAN: I can assure you...
ANDRE: Thank you!
Like some more truffle sauce with that?
MAN: Excuse me, but the gentleman... can't eat off the floor.
He's not a gentleman. He's my servant... and he's not worthy of our company.
Thank you.
I'm truly sorry, sir.
Andre, would you please...
ANDRE: No, no, milady. It is not possible.
JULIA: Please.
Thibault, please, will you let him sit at the table?
For me?
I will please you, lovely one.
Obey, foolish wart.
MAN: Thank you.
HUNTER: And you were worried they wouldn't be comfortable.
Actually, the floor wasn't such a bad place for him.
Easier to hose down.
ANDRE: Cheese! Very good cheese!
HUNTER: Andre, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Andre? No, no!
- Andre, no.
- No. Bad!
HUNTER: Hey. Sit down. Eat this.
JULIA: Hunter, could you...
No. This is for dessert. All right?
WAITER: Please, sir, please.
HUNTER: I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.
Just add it to the check.
All right? Thank you.
You eat this after dinner. All right?
No, it's all right. I'm terribly sorry.
Just add it to the bill. Thank you.
WAITER: All right.
Do I have something on my face?
You remind me of the daughter of a king.
Thank you.
HUNTER: On the subject of Julia's noble ancestry... you do understand why she was granted control of the estate?
Julia is a Malfete.
Everything I have is hers.
So you have no objection if she retains control?
- No.
- Wonderful.
I'm sure you'll be very pleased with our plans.
HUNTER: They're going to make us...
I mean you and Julia... very wealthy.
I am already wealthy.
I own hundreds of horses... ten chests of pepper, four hundred bags of wool... and fifty barrels of Spanish olives.
And you own me, sire.
Yes, but you have no value.
That is true.
Excuse you.
THIBAULT: Leave nothing for the devil!
- Did you hear that?
- Yes, I did, sweetheart.
They're not in very good health, all right?
So, just try to ignore it, if you can.
- Sire.
- What?
ANDRE: I want to make pee-pee.
- Ah! You want to pee?
- Yes.
Outside!
Outside? But, sire...
I could be eaten by the wolves.
THIBAULT: Find a torch! Idiot.
ANDRE: Find a torch.
Andre has such simple needs.
I think that's great.
Need some help, sir?
Oh, it is beautiful.
The water comes out by itself. Ha!
It is a magic fountain.
Look at this! Mmm.
It smells just like the forest.
ANDRE:
All the forest is in the small wheel.
Mmm. Smell it!
No. No, thank you.
You don't want to smell it?
Enjoy yourself.
The castle's a wreck.
HUNTER:
So I'm helping her divide the estate up... into more manageable, profitable chunks.
We're selling the art and various high-end pieces... through an outlet here.
Essentially, I'm protecting her.
I see that as my role.
And the land?
I decided we should sell that, too.
THIBAULT: It is not for you to decide.
Only Lady Julia can say what will be done.
I speak for both Julia and myself.
THIBAULT:
You cannot possibly speak for a Malfete.
What are your wishes, milady?
Well, um...
I guess I'd like to think about it... a little bit more, actually.
Julia?
THIBAULT: The lady has spoken!
WOMAN: Chicken salad, now!
MAN: I want that cake. Come on now.
Don't take all night.
Greasy chicken.
HOST:
What on earth do you think you're doing?
JULIA: Hi, Andre.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to add an order... of chicken a la umbrella to your bill.
Smell the forest.
Yes, it's minty.
ANDRE: It's from the blue fountain.
JULIA: Nice. Yeah. Oh, all right.
Honey, would you like a mint?
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.
- Thibault?
- Master.
Those are good. Give me another one.
ANDRE: Yes. Very minty.
Ow!
WIZARD: Ah...
Good evening, fine sir.
WIZARD: I'm seeking Thibault of Malfete... the Duke of Anjou. The great chevalier?
THIBAULT: Andre does not need a bed.
He will be happy with some straw.
- Yes.
- We're out of straw.
My bed is soft.
ANNOUNCER:
It's time for the "Family Feud."
THIBAULT: Aah!
ANDRE: Oh! Poor little people.
They're trapped inside!
Oh!
God have mercy. What are we going to do, my sire?
Free them.
ANNOUNCER:
Chuck, Marilyn, Norma, Terry, and Linda.
Now let's start the "Family Feud"!
Bunny? You really think these guys have amnesia?
JULIA: I don't know.
ANDRE: We are coming!
So you admit they're clinically insane?
I didn't say that.
HUNTER: Oh, come on!
Where did they go, my lord?
They were inside. We could not save them.
It is tragic.
Well, we never really used this room anyway.
ANDRE: It's a pity.
Aah!
I need to find a wizard now.
Um...
Do you mind if I get some coffee first?
Hi.
Jesus Christ!
I've told you not to leave this stuff... in the middle of the driveway!
What are you trying to do?
You just about broke my goddamn neck!
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
Do you actually do any gardening around here... or do you just sing out of tune?
MAN: Just clean it up!
Aah!
Oh! Hey, big belly!
You dare to touch a lady?
MAN: Who the hell are you?
ANDRE: I'm Andre, and I piss on you.
Yeah, well, you get the hell out of here or I'm gonna call the cops.
Apologize to the lady.
Lady? You're calling her a...
Lady. Right.
I'm sorry.
ANDRE: Kiss her feet.
- Do what?
- Kiss her feet!
Oh, Jesus!
JULIA: Instead of a wizard...
I think what we really need to find you is a good doctor.
Wizards are the best doctors.
What in the world is that?
JULIA: What are you doing?
MAN: Call 911!
THIBAULT: What is going on here?
ANDRE: He was very rude to the lady.
Look, fool. A coat of arms.
He is a nobleman.
I did not know. (KISSING)
Stupid peasant.
- Who are these guys?
- Visitors.
THIBAULT: Do you own this woman?
She works for me.
Then I will hang my valet by his feet on your behalf.
No, please, my lord.
Not by the feet! I prefer the thumbs.
I got a meeting to catch.
THIBAULT: Rise, idiot.
I give him to you for the day.
You may beat him if you like.
Thanks, but we just met.
ANDRE:
Thank you, my great and merciful master.
Thank you, milord! Thank you!
THIBAULT:
Let us go. We have a wizard to find.
ANGELIQUE: A wizard?
- Are you French?
- Yes.
- Do you like it here?
- It is very strange.
It smells bad, and the food is too little... but the ladies are wonderful.
I wish my boss thought like that.
Boss. Ha ha. Boss. What is boss?
The guy you work for. The big guy.
I can have his bones when he's eating.
That is so disgusting.
That's so gross.
You have to figure out a way to get away from him.
He's my master. I don't want to be hung.
Hung!
You're not gonna be hung!
That's completely against the law, OK?
OK. OK!
Yay!
ANGELIQUE: Does he pay a lot of money?
ANDRE: Once every month he permits me to hunt pheasants on his lands.
So you make no money?
I have a treasure.
THIBAULT: What do you call that again?
JULIA: The "L".
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Before we get downstairs to the crowd...
I've got this for you.
Here's my phone number.
I want you to wear this just in case you get lost.
THIBAULT: I will not get lost.
THIBAULT: You can only be lost if you have no purpose... and I have purpose, which is to find a...
A wizard. Right.
JULIA: I don't even know where to start with that one.
I mean, I have never met a wizard.
I don't even think they make wizards anymore.
Oh! My purse! Wait, Thibault! Wait!
JULIA: Wait! No!
- Take the purse!
- No! No!
He's a thief. I have to cut his hand.
No, no, no!
Please, just take it.
OK. Everything's fine now.
Hang him in the public square.
- Aah!
- Silence, old woman!
You're not helping.
THIBAULT: Witch! Old witch! Wait!
I am sorry. I thought you were an old hag.
WOMAN: I've been called worse.
Thibault, why don't you come and tell her...
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Ah, would you happen to know a wizard?
Can you tell me where to find a wizard?
A wizard.
Well.
THIBAULT: Peasants, which one of you can show me to a wizard?
There will be a reward.
Sir Lancelot here's looking for a wizard.
Aren't we all? Ha ha ha!
THIBAULT: I am not Lancelot.
I am Thibault, Count of Malfete...
Duke of Anjou, Baron of Orleans...
Lord of Libourne.
MAN: Yeah? Well, I'm Sid from Cicero...
Duke of Hazzard, Baron of Billiards... and Lord of Lord-knows-what... and I challenge you to a duel.
En garde!
Do not make me kill you.
En garde, I say. You watching this, honey?
THIBAULT: I should kill you for your insolence but I am too thirsty... so instead, I will quench my thirst... and yours and yours.
Drink up!
BRADY: Hey.
You're not gonna believe a word of this.
Not a word of it. Guess whose exhibit... had another visitor last night?
There was sparks flying... and all sorts of weird noises.
Then there was this poof.
BRADY: Poof.
And a green flash, and then bang, he was there.
Who was there?
- The wizard-looking dude.
- Wizard.
MITCHELL: Look.
He burnt the bedspread where he came in.
BRADY: Absolutely shocking.
Wait a minute.
This wasn't here before.
He says he's Julia's cousin.
HUNTER: I say he's a fake.
I want an answer in 24 hours.
See, tiger?
Daddy's gonna take care of this business.
You gonna be nice to me again?
HUNTER: Hello?
- Hunter, you're not gonna believe this.
- Bunny, I'm right here.
I lost Thibault because he was looking for a wizard.
And then he just freaked out...
Nobody just loses a guy dressed like a medieval knight in Chicago.
JULIA: Well, I did. Wait.
Hold on a second. Hello?
Yeah, does anybody there know the Count of whoop-de-do, the Baron of blah...
Yes, I do.
JULIA: Wonderful. Thank you.
All right, I found him. I gotta go.
- I'm so relieved.
- Love you. Bye.
(SIGHS) So he's back, huh?
Yeah. I was hoping he'd tripped on his cape... and swan-dived into the Chicago River.
- THIBAULT: Ha ha ha ha!
- (CROWD SINGING IN FRENCH)
JULIA: Thibault!
Thibault!
THIBAULT: Everybody, everybody!
This is my great, great, great, great... great-granddaughter.
Actually, grand, grand, grand, grand, grandpa and I must go.
CROWD: No!
MAN: You have to sing first!
No, I don't...
Yes. You must sing first.
(SINGING) Oui, oui, oui
Have to go, now, now, now
WOMAN: Why?
Yeah. You have to give us a good reason.
I found a wizard.
MAN: Well, bring him along!
No, we have to go.
I knew it!
I must leave you now.
MAN: Oh, no, no, no.
So long, Lancelot.
I am not Lancelot.
I am Thibault, Count of Malfete.
Of course it is that bloody English wizard.
He has followed me through time.
Great. Great. I mean, he probably... just whipped up some eye of newt potion thingie... and he waved his hands over it a few times... and said some words in Latin, and voila!
JULIA: Thibault?
I'm starting to believe you.
I'm starting to believe everything... and that is a really big leap for a 21st century girl.
I just want you to appreciate that.
OK?
Mm-hmm.
There it is.
Oh, my God.
All right. What now?
- Ohh.
- Treacherous old fool!
What is this?
WIZARD: I thought you smote her dead.
She's not my Rosalind.
I'm Julia Malfete. Hi.
Oh. Malfete!
She's a descendant!
Ah! All is not lost, my lord.
How long until your magic is ready... to return me to my rightful time?
Before the sun is set.
THIBAULT: Then let us go now and fetch my faithful servant.
Eww.
Never smelled like this before.
Ohh.
Bloody English wizards.
They cannot do anything right.
(SINGING) Woo woo
Ah, here we go
Woo woo
- I like your chariot.
- Thank you.
That's my lipstick.
Ohh, no, Andre. That's so gross.
Hurry up. Spit it out the window.
(SINGING) To business give them down and pay
(ANGELIQUE GRUNTS) One ruby.
That should do it.
Hmm.
Woo-hoo!
MAN: What is all this horrible noise?
ANGELIQUE: We would love to go shopping.
ANDRE: Oh, big swans!
Oh! Very small chariots!
ANGELIQUE: Like little Matchbox cars.
- Agh!
- Hey!
Say cheese.
Oh, ohh!
ANDRE: I love these wheel cakes.
ANGELIQUE: Ha! We call them doughnuts.
Andre, you can have as many doughnuts as you want now.
Mmm. Yes.
You can have all of this, Andre.
You could go out and get a really big house.
And you can have a swimming pool.
You can have everything, Andre.
I can only have what my master allows.
That is not true!
This is a democracy. This is America.
You are a free man.
JULIA: Thank you.
There are a lot of good things about living in this time.
You'll be OK here.
I'll make sure of it.
You are lionhearted, Julia... like the women of your lineage.
You have courage.
Lionhearted. No.
No, I don't think so.
Bunnyhearted maybe, but no.
Come outside.
THIBAULT:
You will learn to protect yourself.
What are you doing?
Look at me.
Take it like this.
Power in your arm.
- Very impressive.
- Take it.
JULIA: Power in my arm.
My arm!
I can't do it. It's too heavy.
Try again.
(SIGHS) I am getting so tired of this.
Sneaking around and lying all the time.
Hey...
Hang in there with me, babe.
We are so close.
Take me dancing.
(SINGING) Baby
MAN: Hey, watch it! Ah!
I'm sorry.
Look what you've done. Let's go, Kelly.
Come on.
Sorry about that. I'm sorry.
(SINGING) Don't panic
Sorry, ma'am.
Don't help me. My boss will kill me.
ANDRE: You're a free woman.
Tonight... we dance!
(SINGING) Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
Till the break of dawn
Hey
I dance the rumba
The salsa, the cha-cha, the limbo
The fox trot and even the tango
With ladies and girlies
With mommies and babies
And DJs gonna play this
'Cause it's on their playlist
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
The babes are all around me
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
Till the break of dawn
Mambo, mambo, eh, eh
The babes are all around me
Oh, Hunter!
- Angelique.
- Where's Julia?
ANDRE: Hunter! Get your groovin'!
Yah!
Who are you?
Who is she?
- She's my sister.
- I am not!
She's very tired now, and she's gotta go home!
Sire Hunter!
Tonight was so great.
Greatest night ever in the world.
You make me feel like a lady.
But you are. A great lady.
And you are a great man.
Really?
And if you got a decent haircut... and learned not to put everything you see... in your mouth...
I think you'd be a terrific man.
Milady, thank you.
Andre... what do you say that we quit our lousy jobs and go travel around the world?
- Quit?
- We could be so happy.
Tonight, just tell your boss that you quit, OK?
ANDRE: OK.
- Be free.
- Free!
Because I am a free man!
You've got that right, baby!
ANDRE: Master. You are worried.
What is wrong?
The wizard... he exploded.
JULIA: Yes. It wasn't a very pretty sight.
ANGELIQUE: The wizard exploded?
Well, I don't know about you guys... but good night.
ANGELIQUE: But first...
Andre has something to say to Thibault.
What is it, peasant?
Well, speak.
ANGELIQUE: Nothing. I guess I was wrong.
JULIA:
Thibault, he was standing by the river.
The saddest, most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
Hmm. Well... that Thibault really is a special guy.
Yes. Yes, he is.
That's why I've decided to give the entire estate back to him.
You what?
Honey, did you know that the women of my lineage... are all lionhearted?
They still haven't brought the stiff down?
I heard somebody say the old geezer's body parts... are sticking to the ground.
Best I pull myself together.
WIZARD: Come on, my little ones.
Well, that feels better.
- (KNOCKS)
- Can I come in?
HUNTER: What do you got?
INVESTIGATOR: Fingerprints don't match.
Whoever your friend is, he's not this Thibault Malfete... that died in that sailing accident three years ago.
I knew it.
This is how we're gonna sell it to the cops.
OK, OK.
- Ah, hello.
- Oh, my...
WIZARD: Well, don't look so astonished.
It's magic.
WIZARD: All I did was cast a little...
Oh. Good day, my lord.
I do apologize...
Damn wizard. This way.
WIZARD: The trick with pork penis... is to chop it very fine.
Oh.
(SNIFFS) Mmm.
JULIA: Ohh.
Be careful.
WIZARD: If you get that on you... you'll grow fur.
THIBAULT: Peasant!
Peasant!
Get our things ready to go.
THIBAULT: Soon, we will be back in our beloved homes.
Master, my father is a drunkard.
My mother is a hunchback.
My brother is a dwarf, and my sister is a whore.
I do not have any beloved home.
I don't want to go back with you.
I don't want anymore to run behind your horse.
I want to eat wheel cakes and doughnuts.
And I want to have a chariot in iron.
And exciting men's fashions... direct from Europe at rock-bottom prices.
And I want to... and... and I want... and I want to stay here with Lady Angelique.
There you go.
And I want to be free!
I want to be cool and OK!
You are my property.
THIBAULT:
You will go back with me dead or alive.
Choose quickly.
JULIA: Thibault...
He only wants what we all want.
He belongs to me.
I decide his fate.
No, master.
I mean, no way, Jose.
JULIA:
Please, Thibault. It's the noble thing to do.
Thank you, Thibault.
Long life to your family.
Yes. Lady Julia...
If you'll allow me...
Sire Hunter's sister left this last night... in the house of the troubadour.
Sister? He d...
Hunter doesn't have a sister.
Thank you, Andre.
Angelique!
I'm coming!
HUNTER: Hey! Who are you?
Stay here. I will go kill him for you.
No. I want to handle this myself.
What are you doing in here?
What's this?
A 12th century English wizard.
JULIA: Can I talk to you in the other room, please?
Don't touch anything.
JULIA: What's this?
You offended the lady's honor.
Prepare to die.
Did you hear that? He threatened me!
And you're a witness.
HUNTER: You see? He's a violent criminal.
Thank God I called the police.
You called the police?
HUNTER: Julia, this man's a fraud.
All he wants is the money.
No, Hunter, all you want is the money.
It's over.
What?
You couldn't make it through one day without me.
HUNTER: Ah, come on.
You're my little bunny.
Bunny?
Do I look like a bunny to you?
No.
Do I look like a bunny to you?
Nay.
You know what, Hunter?
I don't look like a bunny.
I don't act like a bunny.
I don't think like a bunny.
JULIA: And if you loved me... you wouldn't have made me try to feel like a bunny.
I am strong, and I am smart... and I don't need you to take care of me.
Oh, really?
Courage is my creed.
Are you insane?
No.
Put that thing away.
You're right. I should.
(SQUEAKING) Ow!
Aah!
And stay out!
WIZARD: My lord. Remind you of anyone?
POLICE RADIO: All units, be on the lookout for a heavily-armed dangerous male... with kidnap victim female.
Use extreme caution.
Go, gentlemen.
Don't be afraid to use your guns.
We should check the kitchen.
JULIA: Taxi? Museum of Fine Arts, please.
And quickly, or off with your head.
OFFICER: Hey! They're getting away!
Chief...
OFFICER: I'm going after 'em!
Where are y'all from?
THIBAULT: The lady's from here.
The wizard and I are from the 12th century.
CHIEF: Don't lose 'em, O'Malley.
We're right behind you! You stay here.
JULIA: If we get caught,
I will verify to the police... that you are a hostage, OK?
DRIVER:
All right. Now we talkin'. Hold on.
THIBAULT:
Can we go back in time from here?
We have to go through the same chamber from whence we came.
(SIGHS) Good going, O'Malley.
- Unh!
- Hey!
Damn.
COP: Roadblocks established,
State and Michigan.
He's getting away!
I've never ridden the "L" quite like this before.
COP:
A big guy in a metal hat with a blonde?
Oh, man, they're already out of here.
PILOT: Aerial unit 2.
Suspects headed south on Michigan.
Suspects entering museum.
TEACHER: Look, the knight is in his home.
Welcome, knight.
Say hello to the knight.
CHILDREN: Hello, knight.
Please, wait, one second.
I'm sorry, folks, but this exhibit is closed for today... so you'll have to move on.
Thank you. Thank you.
Shh.
What am I gonna do without you?
JULIA: You're my knight in shining armor.
THIBAULT: Soon you will find a wonderful man to marry.
You will make a long life together.
I had the vision of this.
You are so charming.
I am so proud of you.
And... when your children are big enough to understand...
I want you to tell them about an old ancestor... because I am a part of you, and one day...
I will be a part of your children.
THIBAULT: Here.
A present from your great, great, great, great-grandmother.
Wait.
Here.
Will you give this to her for me?
I will.
I promise she'll be the only girl... with anything like this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Your Grace...
Aah.
What are they doing?
TEACHER:
They're drinking vitamins, obviously.
WIZARD: Per Horus...
Invictus ducere!
COP:
Where is he? The guy with all the armor?
He's gone.
- Where?
- Home.
THIBAULT: One moment!
Please.
My dear Earl of Warwick... in celebration of this happy occasion...
I want to dismiss forever our disagreements.
Please, drink of our wine.
You shall accept this peace offering, Warwick.
I command you.
Wait!
Ah!
What in heaven's wrong with Warwick?
He did not like the wine.
If he preferred white, he should have said so.
It has been so long since I saw you...
When have we been apart, my lord?
When I was with the Lady Julia.
Lady Julia.
She bade me to deliver you this... wedding gift.
Here.
It is an odd piece, isn't it?
THIBAULT: It is before its time.
That's what I'm saying. Literally, she threw me out of the house... and took off with the idiots. Animals.
HUNTER: Ugh.
They poisoned my shake!
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They left some kind of note here.
- Some old French parchment.
- AMBER: Well, what does it say?
I don't know, Amber. I don't speak French.
HUNTER: Per Horus et per Ra... invictus ducere.
Ah!
Oh, my God. Hunter? Are you OK?
Oh!
AMBER: Hunter?
Hunter, Hunter, OK, talk to me! Hunter!
- Stay away from me!
- Aah!
Who are you people? Don't touch me!
Ohh!
HUNTER:
I am a close and personal friend... of the chief of police.
I am the chief of police!
You'll make a great servant for the count.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
HUNTER: Ow!
MAN: I must tell you that all of us at the firm... are delighted with your decision to keep the estate intact.
I can't wait to get really acquainted with this place.
MAN: We'll go over everything.
I can even show you the dungeon.
Unless you're afraid.
She's not afraid.
YOUNG MAN: Courage is her creed.
How do you know my family's creed?
I know a lot about your family.
MAN:
Miss Malfete, this is Francois le Combier.
He's the attorney handling the French interest... in the estate.
He knows the history of the castle even better than I do.
Francois, perhaps you would like... to be Miss Malfete's guide today?
FRANCOIS: It will be my great pleasure.
Mademoiselle.
Merci.
CHER SINGING:
So let them say your hair's too long
'Cause I don't care
With you I can't go wrong...
I have one small worry.
What's that?
Who's going to protect me from the devil?
Ha ha ha!
You got me, don't ya?
Yes! I got you, babe.
You got me, babe.
Yeah. I got you, babe!

And have you been a slave to the rhythm?
You've been abused, forgotten, and used
Made quite a few bad decisions
Don't let this happen to you, baby

Waiting to greet you, longing to meet you
Don't worry, your time has come
I'll go the distance with you
Only one thing I'm asking
One little task that I want you to do
It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true, it's true
Just keep on singin'
La di da di da

The band keeps playin'

Again, just hold your head up
Yeah, what's done is done
Yeah, yeah
The hands are turnin'
I know somehow, some way
Your time will come
La di da di da
Some way, your time will come
Your time will come, yeah
The war had all but ground to a halt in the blink of an eye.
Lucian, the most feared and ruthless leader ever to rule the Lycan clan had finally been killed.
The Lycan horde scattered to the wind in a single evening of flame and retribution.
Victory, it seemed, was in our grasp, the very birthright of the Vampires.
Nearly six centuries had passed since that night.
Yet the ancient feud proved unwilling to follow Lucian to the grave.
Though Lycans were fewer in number, the war itself had become more perilous for the moon no longer held her sway.
Older, more powerful Lycans were now able to change at will.
The weapons had evolved, but our orders remained the same:
Hunt them down and kill them off, one by one.
A most successful campaign.
Perhaps too successful.
For those like me, a Death Dealer, this signaled the end of an era.
Like the weapons of the previous century, we too would become obsolete.
Pity, because I lived for it.
Hey!
Bloods!
It's all right. It's all right.
You're gonna be okay.
You're acting like a pack of rabid dogs!
And that, gentlemen, simply will not do.
Not if you expect to defeat the Vampires on their own ground.
Not if you expect to survive at all.
Pierce! Taylor!
Put some clothes on, will you?
We have a serious problem.
I'll have to run a few tests.
It's definitely an irradiated fluid of some sort.
Ultraviolet ammunition.
Daylight, harnessed as a weapon.
You expect me to believe that a mangy animal came up with a bullet specifically engineered to kill Vampires?
No, I'm betting it's military.
Something they stole.
Some sort of high-tech tracer round.
I don't care where they got these things.
Rigel is dead, and Nathaniel could still be out there.
We should gather the Death Dealers and go back down there in force.
Absolutely not. Not now.
Not for a random incursion.
The Awakening is a few days off, and this house is in unrest as it is.
Random? They opened fire on us in full view of the public.
And from the commotion I heard down in that tunnel-
You said yourself you actually didn't see anything.
Look, I know what I heard, and I know what my gut tells me, and I am telling you there could be dozens of Lycans down there.
Who knows, maybe more.
Hundreds.
We've hunted them to the brink of extinction.
Kraven's right, Selene.
There's not been a den of that magnitude for centuries, not since the days of Lucian.
I know that, Kahn.
But I'd rather have you prove me wrong by checking it out.
Very well, have your men tighten things up.
I'll have Soren assemble a search team.
No, I want to lead the team myself.
Absolutely not!
Soren will handle it.
Hundreds, really?
Viktor would believe me.
I'd never dream of treating you like that.
Of course you wouldn't.
Now run along and make sure she's dressed and ready for the arrival of her guests.
It's a waste of time, you know.
What is?
Well, I seriously doubt Viktor would want you freezing to death in here, staring at his tomb for hours on end.
No, he'd want the Death Dealers out there right now, scouring every inch of the city.
Kraven. I'll never understand why Viktor left him in charge.
He's a bureaucrat, not a warrior.
Come on, we need to get you ready.
For what?
The party.
Amelia's envoy will be here any minute.
Oh, yes.
You should definitely wear this one.
It's perfect.
They were after you.
He's attractive.
For a human.
Who's attractive?
You know I was planning to have you at my side this evening.
Take Erika.
She's dying to be at your side.
If you ask me, you take this warrior business far too seriously.
You can't undo the past, no matter how many you kill.
And besides... what's the point in being immortal if you deny yourself the simple pleasures in life?
Do you see this human?
What of him?
I can't be positive, but I'm beginning to think the Lycans-
Blast.
Put on something elegant and be quick about it.
Kraven, I'm serious.
I think they were following him.
Other than food, why would Lycans stalk a human?
Any progress?
Let's find out.
Negative.
You heading home?
Yeah, Nicholas gave me a couple hours off.
By the way... he said you did a terrific job tonight with the surgery.
Yeah.
Take it easy.
We were ambushed.
Death Dealers, three of them.
And the candidate?
We lost him.
You lost him.
Look at this mess.
Ag rounds. High content.
Prevented him from making the change.
No use in digging out the rest.
Silver's penetrated his organs.
Regeneration's impossible at this point.
Let's take these out.
Relax.
The Vampires didn't realize you were following a human.
Did they, Raze?
No.
I mean...
I don't think so.
You don't think, or you don't know?
I'm not sure.
Negative.
I really must have a look at this Michael.
Must I do everything myself?
Our noble houses may be separated by a great ocean, but we are equally committed to the survival of the bloodlines.
And when Amelia arrives to awaken Marcus in just two days' time, we shall once again be united as a single coven!
We want to thank our hosts for their generous hospitality.
He comes in, he does his job, and then he goes home.
Other than that,
I really don't know what to tell you.
Interns pretty much work around the clock.
We don't have much of a life.
You know where we can find him?
No. Um...
You can try him at home, or you'll have to wait till he gets back.
He's not in some kind of trouble, is he?
This is Michael. I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.
Michael, it's Adam. The police were just in the hospital looking for you.
They were convinced you were involved with a shootout.
I told them there's no way you'd be involved with something like that, but they're looking for you.
Right now.
Why are they after you?
Shit!
Hello, Michael.
What the fuck is going on?
Stop the car.
Stop the car!
Back off!
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
But you've lost a lot of blood.
If you don't stop the car, you're gonna get us both killed.
I'm not screwing around!
Neither am I.
Now shut up and hold on.
I'll be fine.
Shit!
A second escape. Impressive.
Perhaps Raze wasn't overstating matters.
Raze didn't bring back this.
If Michael is indeed The Carrier, the Vampires could-
Relax, old friend.
I've tasted his flesh.
Just two days till full moon.
Soon, he will be a Lycan.
Soon, he will come looking for us.
It's a shame we don't have more.
Positive.
Lay still. Your skull's taken a good knock.
You've been unconscious for a while.
Do you have any idea why those men were after you?
Where am I?
You're safe.
I'm Selene.
So for once, the rumors were true.
The whole house has been absolutely buzzing about your new pet.
You're going to try to turn him, aren't you?
Of course not.
So why did you bring him here?
He saved my life.
Why are you here?
Kraven sent me.
He wants to see you. Now.
This is completely unacceptable!
You go against my orders and spend the night away from the mansion with a human? A human you've since brought back to my house.
As far as I'm concerned, this is still Viktor's house.
Look, I don't want to argue.
I just you to understand that Michael is somehow important to the Lycans-
Oh, so now it's "Michael"!
Kraven, would you just hear me out?
It's just beyond me why you're so obsessed over this ridiculous theory.
Lucian wouldn't be the slightest bit interested in a human,
Michael or otherwise.
Wait a minute.
You're infatuated with him, aren't you?
Now, that's a ridiculous theory.
Is it?
Leave us!
I sure hope you never get pissed off with me.
Hold on.
Check this out.
Go ahead. Squeeze off a few.
Eject the mag.
You've copied the Lycan rounds.
Silver nitrate.
A lethal dose.
They won't dig these out, like they do with our usual rounds.
Straight into the bloodstream.
Ain't nothing to dig out.
Tell me, Kahn.
Do you believe Lucian died the way they say he did?
Kraven been telling war stories again, is he?
That's my point.
It's nothing but an ancient story.
His story.
There's not a shred of proof he killed Lucian, only his word.
I've never underestimated
Kraven's lust for advancement, but Viktor believed him, and that's all that matters.
Now, where you going with this anyway?
Nowhere.
Engaging Death Dealers in public and chasing after some human was not what I had in mind.
You were told to set up shop and lay low!
Calm yourself, Kraven!
The human doesn't concern you.
And besides, I've laid low for quite long enough.
Just keep your men at bay, Lucian.
At least for the time being.
Don't force me to regret our arrangement.
You just concentrate on your part.
Remember, I've bled for you once already.
Without me, you'd have nothing.
You'd be nothing.
Of the scores of brave souls who entered Lucian's fortress a single Vampire survived:
Kraven, who was richly rewarded for not only setting the great blaze, but for returning with evidence of the Lycan master's demise, the branded skin, cut from Lucian's very arm.
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Not now.
He's been bitten.
Your human, he's been marked by a Lycan.
Did Kraven put you up to this?
No.
I saw the wound with my own eyes,
I swear it.
But what about the Covenant?
You know it's forbidden!
And ever since he bit me,
I've been-
I've been having these hallucinations and... And these delusions.
All I know is, it feels like my skull is splitting in half.
Okay, so a full-grown man bit you?
Jesus.
Are you sure this wasn't a dog?
I said, it was a man.
It was a man. Okay. Okay.
Okay, I got it.
He was after me.
And that woman from the subway-
What woman?
Haven't you been listening to me?
She took me hostage!
All right. Just- Please.
I'll help you get this all sorted out, all right? I'll be right back.
Let go, Michael.
Let go.
Just calm down, okay?
I'm gonna be back in a minute.
That's a promise. All right?
All right.
Hey!
Hey!
Please forgive me... but I desperately need your guidance.
Kahn wants to see you.
To my knowledge, an Awakening has never been attempted by one such as myself.
The elders hold the power to organize their memories and thoughts into a single, cohesive vision, a detailed record of their reign.
I can only hope Viktor will hear my plea.
Please forgive me, but I desperately need your guidance.
I apologize for breaking the chain and awakening you ahead of schedule, but I fear we may all be in grave danger.
Especially you, my lord, if left in your weakened state.
For I believe that Lucian is alive and well.
Here. Now. In this very city, preparing to hit us during the Awakening ceremony.
Even more disturbing... is that if I'm correct... it would mean that Kraven is in league with him.
What's so pressing?
Take a look.
Selene!
I want to speak with Selene!
Is that Michael?
Is it Michael?
What the hell is going on?
What's happening to me?
I'm coming out.
If you go to him, you'll never be welcome in this house again.
Now that Viktor's awake, we'll see what he has to say about that.
Get in.
Look, I warned her. I warned her, but she didn't listen.
She never listens.
I should've told you sooner.
Told me what?
Her human, Michael... he's not a human at all.
He's a Lycan.
What?!
What's this ruckus?
You can never come here again.
They'll kill you. Do you understand?
Why? Who are you people?
Leave us.
Whether you like it or not, you're in the middle of a war that's been raging for the better part of 1000 years.
A blood feud between
Vampires and Lycans.
Werewolves.
Consider yourself lucky.
Most humans die within an hour of being bitten by an immortal.
The viruses we transmit are deadly.
And if you bit me, what,
I'd become a Vampire instead?
No, you'd die.
No one's ever survived a bite from both species.
By rights, I'd stop the car and kill you myself-
Then why are you helping me?
I'm not!
I track down and kill your kind.
My only interest is finding out why Lucian wants you so badly.
Do you know why I've been awakened, servant?
No, my lord.
But I'll soon find out.
You mean when you find her.
Yes, my lord.
You must let her come to me.
We have much to discuss,
Selene and I.
She has shown me a great many disturbing things.
Things that will be dealt with soon enough.
This coven has grown weak, decadent.
Perhaps I should have left someone else in charge of my affairs.
Still... her memories... are chaotic.
There's no sense of time.
Please, my lord, let me summon assistance.
You're in need of rest.
I've rested enough.
What you will do is summon Marcus.
But he still slumbers, my lord.
Amelia and the Council members are arriving tomorrow night to awaken Marcus.
Not you, my lord.
You've been awakened a full century ahead of schedule.
That bitch has betrayed me.
Now he knows everything she's been obsessing about.
Wait.
Are you to be trusted?
Of course.
Meet me in my quarters in 20 minutes.
It's time I filled you in on a few things.
I'm seeing these things, these hallucinations.
They're not hallucinations, they're memories.
You've been bitten. His memories have been passed to you.
This is one of the places we use for interrogations. It should be safe.
Ziodex Industries.
We own it.
First there was synthetic plasma, now this.
Once it's approved, it should be our newest cash crop.
It's cloned blood.
What are these for?
Lycans are allergic to silver.
If we don't get our bullets out quickly, they die during questioning.
What do you do with them after?
We put the bullets back in.
How are things progressing?
We're ready.
Why do you hate them so much?
I've already told you, we're at war.
So you're just following orders?
Why can't you just answer the question?
Fine.
Something was in the stable... tearing our horses to pieces.
I couldn't have saved my mother.
Or my sister.
Their screams woke me.
My father died outside, trying to fend them off.
I stood at my door... about to run to my nieces' room when.
Twin girls.
Barely 6 years old.
Butchered like animals.
Jesus Christ.
The next thing I knew,
I was in his arms.
The war had spilled into our house.
He'd been tracking the Lycans for days.
He drove them off and saved me.
Who?
Viktor.
The oldest and strongest of us.
That night, he made me a Vampire.
He gave me the strength to avenge my family.
Since then,
I've never looked back.
I saw your pictures.
Who is the woman, your wife?
It may be wise to keep a closer eye on our cousins.
I'll have Raze see to it immediately.
I'm afraid that I'm going to have to place my faith in you, my friend.
Time is running short.
I tried to swerve, but he hit us anyway.
He sent us right into the oncoming lane.
When I came to, I...
I realized that part of the engine was in the front seat.
And she was pinned there,
6 inches from me... in this horrible position.
I think she was in shock because she just kept asking me over and over again if I was all right.
She was more worried about me.
You know, if I knew then what
I know now, I could have saved her.
There's no doubt in my mind about that.
But instead she died right there... about two minutes before the ambulance arrived.
After that, I didn't see any reason to stick around.
I spent a summer here with my grandfather when I was a kid so...
After I got my degree, I just-
I took off.
I came over here to move on, to forget.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
And have you?
Moved on?
Have you?
I need you to keep what I'm about to tell you under the strictest confidence.
It can wait.
Who started the war?
They did.
Or at least that's what we've been led to believe.
Digging into the past is forbidden.
I should be heading back.
What about me?
Viktor will know what to do.
I'll come back tomorrow night.
I'm not staying here alone.
You will if you want to live.
No, I want to go with you.
What are you doing?
When the full moon rises tomorrow night, you will change, you will kill, and you will feed.
It's unavoidable.
I can't leave you free to roam around. I'm sorry.
A single round won't kill you, but the silver prevents transformation.
At least for a few hours.
If I don't return in time, do yourself a favor.
Use it.
Yeah?
My lord. She's here.
How could you do this to me?
Embarrass me like this?
The entire coven knows that I had plans for us.
There is no us!
You'll go before Viktor... and tell him exactly what I tell you to!
From here on out, you'll do as I say.
Is that in any way unclear?
Come closer, my child.
Outside.
Come on, move it.
I've been lost without you, my lord.
Constantly hounded by Kraven and his never-ending infatuation.
It is the oldest story in the book.
He desires the one thing he cannot have.
Now, tell me... why have you come to believe that Lucian still lives?
Yeah.
But I've given you all the proof you need.
Incoherent thoughts and images, nothing more.
Which is precisely why the Awakening is performed by an elder.
You do not possess the necessary skills.
But I did see Lucian. I shot him.
You must believe me.
The chain has never been broken.
Not once.
Not in 14 centuries.
Not since we elders first began to leapfrog through time.
One awake, two asleep.
That's the way of it.
It is Marcus' turn to reign, not mine.
There's been a complication.
But I had no choice.
The coven is in danger, and Michael is the key-
Ah, yes.
The Lycan.
Please.
Give me the chance to get proof you require.
Fine.
I will leave it to
Kraven to collect the proof... if there is any.
How could you trust him over me?
Because he is not the one who has been tainted by an animal.
I love you... like a daughter, but you leave me with no choice.
These rules are in place for a good reason, and they are the only reason we have survived this long.
You will not be shown an ounce of leniency.
When Amelia arrives, the Council will convene and decide your fate.
You have broken the chain and the Covenant!
You must be judged!
You should've listened to me and stayed out of this.
Now you'll be lucky if I can convince the Council to spare your life.
Tell me.
Did you have the nerve to cut the skin from his arm, or did Lucian do it for you?
Mark my words.
Soon, you'll be seeing things my way.
No one opens this door.
Understood?
I can't afford to have my future queen run off with that Lycan again.
Shit.
Change of plans. Amelia will be picked up by Soren and his team.
That's our job.
Not anymore.
Why are you helping me?
I'm not. I'm helping me.
What's going on?
The perimeter sensor's been tripped.
We're locking down the mansion.
It's Selene. She's escaped, to go to him, to Michael.
I want that Lycan's head on a plate.
We need to go.
Get down!
Go. Go.
Jump.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Any luck?
False alarm.
The dogs would've been all over it if anything had gotten near that fence.
Amelia should have arrived by now.
Yes.
Look, I want you to slip off the property and find out what's keeping her.
You've got it.
Maybe we should pull over and dose him.
Fuck him. He'll be all right.
We're almost there.
Oh, shit. He's not gonna make it.
Pull over. Pull over!
Get the kit.
Stick him. Stick him.
My lord.
Viktor wants to speak with you.
My lord.
I sent for Selene... not you.
She's defied your orders and... fled the mansion, my lord.
Your incompetence is becoming most taxing.
It's not my fault.
She's become obsessed, thinks that I'm at the core of some ridiculous conspiracy.
And here's my proof.
Now, I want you to tell them exactly what you told me.
All right, all right.
We've been searching for someone with a special trait.
A direct descendant of Alexander Corvinus...
Hungarian... a warlord... who came to power in the early seasons of the fifth century.
Just in time to watch a plague ravage his village.
He alone survived.
Somehow, his body was able to change the disease, mold it to his benefit.
He became the first true immortal.
And years later, he fathered at least two children who inherited this same trait.
The sons of the Corvinus clan.
One bitten by bat, one by wolf, one to walk the lonely road of mortality as a human.
It's a ridiculous legend. Nothing!
That may be... but our species do have a common ancestor.
A mutation of the original virus is directly linked to his bloodline.
There is a descendant of Corvinus lying there... not three feet from you.
Yes.
But he's already a Vampire.
We needed a pure source.
Untainted. An exact duplicate of the original virus... which we learned was hidden away in the genetic code of his human descendants and passed along in its latent form... down through the ages... all the way to Michael Corvin.
For years, we tried to combine their bloodlines.
And for years we failed.
It was useless.
Even at the cellular level, our species seemed destined to destroy each other.
That is, until we found Michael.
The Corvinus strain allows for a perfect union.
A triple-celled platelet... which holds unspeakable power.
There can be no such union.
And to speak of it is heresy.
We'll see.
Once Lucian has injected himself with Michael's blood.
Lucian is dead.
According to whom?
I need you to do something for me.
I can assure you, my child
Kraven will pay with his life.
Soon, this house will lie in ruins.
Not before you.
No, no, no, wait. Wait!
You and you alone will know the truth of this.
If Lucian was able to get his hands on the blood of a Pure-Born, a powerful elder like Amelia... or yourself... and inject it along with Michael's blood.
Abomination.
Half-Vampire, half-Lycan, but stronger than both.
I need to speak with Kahn.
My lord.
The Council members have been assassinated.
What of Amelia?
They bled her dry.
It has already begun, huh?
I'm sorry I doubted you.
Fear not, my child, absolution will be yours... the moment you kill the descendant of Corvinus, this...
Michael.
You've been given an enzyme to stop the change.
It may take a little time for the grogginess to dissipate.
That's enough!
Just... go and see what's keeping Raze, will you?
I really must apologize.
He's in desperate need of a lesson in manners.
Speaking of manners, where are mine? Forgive me.
I'm Lucian.
I need to go.
I need to get back.
There's no going back.
There's no going anywhere.
The Vampires will kill you on sight.
Just for being what you are.
One of us.
You are one of us.
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Bringing an end to this conflict.
Your war, it has nothing to do with me.
My war?
No!
No!
No!
No!
No! No!
Sonja!
They forced you to watch her die.
Sonja.
That's what started the war.
I saw it happen as if I were there.
We were slaves once.
The daylight guardians of the Vampires.
I was born in servitude... yet I harbored them no ill will.
I even took a Vampire for my bride.
It was forbidden... our union.
Viktor feared a blending of the species.
Feared it so much... he killed her.
His own daughter... burnt alive... for loving me.
This is his war...
Viktor's... and he's spent the last 600 years exterminating my species.
What are they gonna do to Selene?
We have company.
I thought we had a deal.
Patience.
Kraven.
These are matters to be discussed in private.
Please escort our guests downstairs.
The Council has been destroyed.
Soon, you will have it all.
Both great covens and an ironclad peace treaty with the Lycans.
Who I trust will not be forgotten when the spoils are tabulated.
How do you expect me to assume control now that Viktor's been awakened?
There's no defeating him.
He grows stronger as we speak.
And that is precisely why
I need Michael.
If Viktor were so easy to dispatch... you'd have done it yourself centuries ago.
Exit shaft! Move it!
Son of a bitch!
Oh, shit!
It's Viktor.
Yes.
And if you had done your job, he'd still be in hibernation.
Where the hell is Raze?
Is there another way out?
I guess it never occurred to you that you might actually have to bleed to pull off this coup.
Don't even think about leaving.
Silver nitrate.
Bet you weren't expecting that.
Come on! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Move!
Lucian.
Selene!
Selene!
Not yet.
I have to get you out.
Viktor's on his way.
And he won't be satisfied until every Lycan's dead.
They'll kill you too, just for helping me.
I know.
I know what started the war.
That's enough.
You're coming with me!
I hope I live long enough to see
Viktor choke the life from you!
I bet you do.
But let me tell you a little something about your beloved dark father.
He's the one who killed your family.
Not the Lycans.
Never could follow his own rules.
Said he couldn't abide the taste of livestock.
So every once in a while, he went out and gorged himself on human blood.
I kept his secrets... cleaned up the mess.
But it was he... who crept room to room dispatching everyone close to your heart.
But when he got to you, he just couldn't bear the thought of draining you dry.
You, who reminded him so much of his precious Sonja... the daughter he condemned to death.
Lies.
Believe what you want.
Now come on.
Your place is by my side.
So be it.
Bite him!
Half-Vampire... half-Lycan... but stronger than both.
What the hell are you doing?
You may have killed me... cousin.
But my will... is done regardless.
Where is he?
Where's Kraven?
Forgive me, my child.
It wasn't the Lycans.
It was you.
Leave us.
How could you bear my trust knowing that you'd killed my family?
Yes.
I have taken from you.
But I have given so much more.
Is it not a fair trade, the life I have granted you? The gift of immortality?
And the life of your daughter?
Your own flesh and blood?
I loved my daughter!
But the abomination growing in her womb was a betrayal of me and of the coven!
I did what was necessary to protect the species, as I am forced to do yet again.
No!
Time to die.
Though I cannot predict the future, the consequences of tonight will reverberate through the halls of both great covens for many years to come.
Two Vampire elders have been slain, one by my own hand.
Soon, Marcus will take the throne.
And a tide of anger and retribution will spill out into the night.
Differences will be set aside.
Allegiances will be made.
And soon...
I will become the hunted.
Once upon a time there was a lovely princess.
But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be broken by Love's first kiss.
She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon.
Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.
She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.
Like that's ever going to happen.
What a loony.
Shrek
Beware
Stay out
I think he's in here.
All right. Lets get it!
Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?
Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for his brains.
Well actually that would be a giant.
Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse.
They'll make a soup from your freshly peeled skin.
They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes.
Actually, it's quite good on toast.
Back, back beast, back!
I warned you!
Right.
This is the part, where you run away.
Yeah!
And stay out.
Wanted. Fairytale creatures.
Right, this one is full. Take it away.
Give me that.
Your fine days are over. -25 pieces of silver for the witch.
Next. -Come on.
Sit down there! And be quiet!
This cage is so small.
You wouldn't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change.
Please, give me another chance.
Oh, shut up!
Next.
What do we got?
This little wooden puppet.
I'm not a puppet, I'm a real boy.
Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.
No! Please, don't let them do it!
Next. What do you got?
Well, I've got a talking donkey!
Right.
Well that's good for ten schillings, if you can prove it.
Oh, go ahead fella.
Well?
He's just a li..., just a little nervous.
He's really quite a chatterbox.
You boneheaded donkey!
That's it. I have heard enough. Guards!
No, no, he talks, he does!
I can talk. I love to talk.
I've talked to...
Get her out of my sight! -No, no, I swear!
Hey, I can fly. -He can fly! -He can fly!
He can talk! -That's right, fool!
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey!
You might have seen house fly, maybe even a superfly.
But I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly!
Seize him!
Get him! This way! Hurry!
You there. Ogre. -I.
By the order of lord Farquaad.
I am authorized to place you both under arrest.
And transport you to designated resettlement facility.
Oh really?
You and what army?
Can I say something to you?
Listen, you were really, really something, back there. Incredible.
Are you talking to...
...me?
Yes, I was talking to you.
Can I just tell you that you were really great back there with those guards.
They thought that was all over there.
And then you showed up and BAM. There was tripping on over themselves like babes in the woods.
That really made me feel good to see that.
Oh, that's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.
Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends?
But I...
I don't have any friends.
And I'm not going out there by myself.
Hey wait a minute.
I have a great idea...
I'll stick with you.
You and me in green fighting machine.
Together we'll scare the spin if anybody crosses us.
Oh, a, that was really scary.
Maybe you don't mine me saying. If that don't work, your breath will certainly do the job done, 'cause... you definitively need some tic-tac or something,
'cause your breath stinks!
Man you've? my note!
Just like the time...
...and then I ate some rotten berries.
Man I had some strong gases leaking out of my but that day.
Why are you following me?
I'll tell you why.
'Cause I'm all alone, there is no one here, beside me.
My problems have all gone.
There's no one to derive me.
But you got to have free... -Stop singing!
Well, it's no wonder, you don't have any friends.
Wow! Only a true friend would be that truly honest.
Listen! Little donkey.
Take a look at me! What am I?
A...
...really tall?
No! I'm an Ogre. You know, grab your torch and pitchforks.
Doesn't that bother you?
Nope.
Really? -Really really.
Oh?
Man, I like you. What's your name?
A..., Shrek.
Shrek?!
But do you know, what
I like about you, Shrek?
You've got that kind of: "I don't care what nobody thinks of me" thing.
I like that, I respect that,
Shrek. You're all right.
Uh, look at that.
Who would wanna live in a place like that?
That would be my home.
Oh, it is lovely. Just beautiful.
You know you're quite a decorator.
It's amazing what you did with such a modest budget.
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.
I guess, you don't entertain much, do you?
I like my privacy.
You know I do to. That's another thing, we have in common.
Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face.
You try to give them a hint and they won't leave.
And then there's that big occurred silence, you know?
Can I stay with you? -What?
Can I stay with you, please.
Of course! -Really?
No. -Please! I don't want to go back there.
You don't how is like to be concerned like a freak.
Well..., maybe you do. But that's why we have to stick together!
You got to let me stay! Please! Please!
OK, OK.
- But one night only.
- Huh, thank you!
A, what are you do... No!
This is going to be fun. We can stay up late, swap the manly stories.
And in the morning...
I'm making waffles.
Where do I sleep?
Outside!
Oh, a, I guess that's cool. You know,
I don't know you and you don't know me...
...so I guess, outside is best for me.
Here I go.
Good night.
I do like that half door. I'm a donkey all alone outside.
Sit by myself outside, I guess.
I'm all alone, there's no one here beside me.
- I thought, I told you to stay outside.
- I am outside.
Well James. This is far from the farm, but what choice do we have?
It's not...
What a lovely bed. -Got you!
I found some cheese. Awful stuff.
- Is that you Gordon?
- How did you know?
Enough! What are you doing in my house?
Oh, no, no, no... Death prods off the table!
Where would we supposed to put her. The bed's taken.
What?
I live in a swamp. I've put up signs. I'm a terrifying Ogre!
What do I have to do, to get a little privacy?
Oh, no! No, no!
What are you doing in my swamp?
All right, get out of here. All of you. Move it! Come on, let's go.
And hurry up, hurry up.
No, no, not there. Not there!
Hey don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.
Oh gosh, no one invited us. -What?
We were forced to come here. -By who?
Lord Farquaad. He?
All right.
Who knows where this Farquaad guy is?
Oh I do. I know where he is.
Does anyone else know where to find him?
- Anyone at all?
- Me. -Anyone?
Oh pick me, I know! Me, me.
Ok, fine.
Attention all fairy tale things!
Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially warned up.
In fact. I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get all off my land and back where you came from.
You. You're coming with me.
All right. That's what
I like to hear, man.
Shrek and Donkey, two stubborn friends off on a world and big city adventure. I love it.
I'm on road again. Sing with me Shrek! I'm on road again...
What did I say about singing?
- Can I whistle?
- No.
- Well, can I hummer?
- All right.
That's enough. He's ready to talk.
Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man.
You monster.
I'm not a monster here. You are.
You and the rest of that fairytale trash, poisoning my perfect world.
- Now tell me! Where are the others?
- Eat me.
I've tried to be fair to you, creatures.
Now my patience has reached its end!
- Tell me! Or I'll...
- No, no, not the buttons.
Not gumdrop buttons.
All right! Who's hiding them?
Ok, I'll tell you.
- Do you know the muffin-man? -The muffin-man?
- The muffin-man. -Yes,
I know the muffin-man.
Who lives on Proully lane?
- Well, she's married to the muffin-man. -The muffin-man!
- The muffin-man! -She's married to the muffin-man.
My lord! We found it.
Well then, what are you waiting for? Bring it in.
Magic mirror.
Don't tell him anything!
Evening.
Mirror, mirror on the wall. Is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?
Well, technically, you're not a king.
A..., felonious.
- You were saying.
- What I mean is a...
...you're not a king, yet.
But you can become one. All you have to do, is marry a princess.
Go on.
So, just sit back and relax my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.
And here they are.
Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shading from a kingdom far, far away.
She likes sushi and hottubbing anytime.
Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for two evil sisters.
Please welcome... Cinderella.
Bachelorette number two is a kemp wearing girl from a land of fantasy.
Although she lives with seven other man, she is not easy.
Just kiss hers dead frozen lips and find out what a live wife she is.
Come on. Give it up for... Show-white.
And last but certainly not least.
Bachelorette number three is a fire-breathing?, dragon guarded castle, surrounded by a hot boiling lava. But don't let that cool you off.
She's a loaded pistol who likes Pina
Coladas and getting cut in the rain.
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona.
So will it be, bachelorette number one? Bachelorette number two?
Or bachelorette number three?
- Two...
- Three! -Two!
One. No, no, no.
Three. Pick number three my lord.
Ok, ok. Number three.
Lord Farquaad. You've chosen... princess Fiona.
She's nice. Fiona. She's perfect.
All I have to do is just find someone...
But I probably should mention little thing that happens at night...
- I'll do it!
- Yes, but after sunset...
Silence!
I will make this princess Fiona my queen.
And Duloc will finally have the perfect king!
Captain! Assemble your finest man.
We're going to have a tournament!
That's it, that's, right there, that's Duloc.
I've told you I'll find it.
So. That must be lord Farquaad's castle.
Aha, that's the place.
Do you think maybe he's compensating for something.
Hey, hey wait up Shrek!
- Hey, you!
- No, no!
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just...
It's quiet.
Too quiet.
Where is everybody?
Hey look at this.
Wow!
- Let's do that again.
- No. no.
All right. You're going the right way for smack bottom.
Sorry about that.
That champion should have the honor, no, no...
...the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely princess Fiona from the fireing keep of the dragon.
If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner up will take his place.
And so on, and so forth.
Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
Applause.
Let the tournament begin.
What is that?
Ugh, it's hideous.
Oh, that's not very nice.
It's just a donkey.
Indeed.
Knights! New plan. The one, who kills the Ogre, will be named champion.
How about him.
Oh, hey. Now, come on.
Can't we just settle this over a pint?
No?
All right then.
Come on.
Hey Shrek! Let me, let me!
The chair! Give him the chair!
Thank you. Thank you, very much.
I'm here until Thursday. Try the wheel!
Shall I give the order sir?
No. I have a better idea.
People of Duloc. I give you our champion!
What?
Congratulation, Ogre.
You've won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.
Quest? I'm already on a quest.
A quest to get my swamp back!
- Your swamp?
- Yeah, my swamp!
Where you dumped those fairytale creatures.
Indeed.
All right Ogre, I'll make you a deal.
Go on this quest for me and
I'll give you your swamp back.
Exactly the way it was?
Down to the last slime covered toast tool.
- And the squatters?
- As good as gone.
What kind of quest?
Ok, let me get this straight!
We gonna go find the dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back the swamp, which you only don't have, 'cause he filled it with full of freaks on the first place.
- Is that about right?
- You know what?
Maybe there is a good reason, donkeys shouldn't talk.
I don't get it Shrek. Why didn't you just pull some old Ogre stuff on them?
You know,?. Grab his bones to make you brave. You know the whole Ogre trick.
Oh, you know what. Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate.
Got a knife, cut open their spleens and drink their fluids.
Does that sound good to you?
A, no, not really, no.
For your information, there is a lot more to Ogres than people think.
- Example.
- Example?
OK, A-a-m, Ogres are like onions.
- They stink?
- Yes, no.
- O, they make you cry.
- No.
Oh, you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start? little wild hairs?
No! Layers! Onions have layers.
Ogres have layers. Onions have layers.
You get it? We both have layers.
O, you both have layers.
You know not everybody likes onions.
Cake! Everybody loves cakes. Cakes have layers.
I don't care what everyone likes.
Ogres are not like cakes.
You know what else everyone likes? Paffe.
Have you ever met a person and you say: "Hey, let's get some paffe" and they say I don't like paffe. Paffe is delicious.
No! You tensed, irritating, miniature peace of barden.
Ogres are like onions. End of story.
Bye, bye. See you lather.
Paffe is maybe the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.
You know I think I've preferred your humming.
Do you have a tissue or something,
'cause I'm making a mess.
Just the word paffe has made me start slimying
Why, Shrek, did you do that?
Man you got to warn somebody before you just crack one off.
My mouth was opened and everything.
Believe me donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead.
It's brimstone. We must be getting close.
Yeah, right, brimstone.
Don't be talking? brimstone. I know what I smell and? no brimstone.
And they don't come of stone neither.
Sure it's big enough, but look at the location.
Oh, Shrek, remember when you said that Ogres have layers?
Oh, yeah.
Well, I have a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers.
We wear? sleeves.
Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.
- Oh, you can't tell me you're afraid of highs.
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava!
Come on donkey, I'm right here beside you. Ok?
For emotional support.
We'll just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time.
- Really?
- Really really.
Ok. That makes me feel so much better.
Just keep moving and don't look down.
Don't look down, don't look down.
Shrek! I'm looking down!
I can't do this. Just let me off right now, please.
- But you're already half way.
- Yeah, but I know that half is safe.
Ok, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.
Shrek, no, wait.
Don't do that!
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?
- Oh. This?
- Yes, that!
Yes, yes. Do it. OK.
- No, Shrek!
- I'm doing it.
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die.
That will do Donkey, that will do.
Cool.
So where is this fire breathing pain in the neck anyway?
Inside. Waiting for us to rescue her.
I was talking about the dragon Shrek.
- Are you afraid?
- No, but shhhhh.
Oh, good. Me neither.
Because there's nothing wrong with being afraid.
Here's a..., something responsible of the situation.
Not to mention dangerous situation.
And there's dragon that breathes fire.
I'm sure he's meaner than a cow or anything, but they're scare. You know what I mean.
I'm sure he's heavier than a cow...
Donkey. Two things. Ok?
Shut, up.
Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs.
Stairs? I thought we were looking for the princess.
The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.
What makes you think she'll be there?
I read it in a book once.
Cool. You handle the dragon,
I'll handle the stairs.
Oh, I'll find those stairs.
I'll?. That's right.
Those stairs won't know which way they go.
The drafting stairs,?
Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I'm master of the stairs.
I wish I had a stair right here right here now, I'd step all over it.
Well, at least we know where the princess is.
- But where is the...
- Dragon!
Donkey, look out!
Got you.
Oh, what large teeth you have.
I mean, white sparkling teeth.
You probably hear this all the time from your food, but you must bleach yourself, because that is one dashing smile you got there.
And do I detect the hint of minty freshness?
And you know what else?
You're a girl dragon. Oh, sure. I mean 'course you're a girl dragon,
'cause you're just ricking the feminine beauty out.
What's the matter with you? Do you have something in your eye?
Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know I'm a asthmatic and
I don't know if we would worked out.
You'd be blowing smoke and stuff.
Shrek!
No, Shrek! Shrek!
- Wake up!
- What?
Are you princess Fiona?
I am.
Awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.
Oh, that's nice. Now let's go.
But wait, sir knight.
This be our first meeting.
Should not be wonderful, romantic moment?
Yeah. Sorry lady there's no time.
Hey, what are you doing? You know, you should sweep me out of my feet.
Out through the window and down the rope by to your valued steed.
You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?
Uh-um.
But we have to sing through this moment.
You can residing of a poem to me.
A ballad, a sonnet, a libretti. Or something.
I don't think so.
Well, can I at least know a name of my champion?
Shrek.
So, Shrek.
I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
Thanks.
- You didn't slay the dragon?
- It's not my job to do this. Now, come on!
But this isn't right.?
That's what all the other knights did.
Yeah. Right before they burst in the flame.
That's not the point.
Wait. Where are you going? Exit is over there.
Well, I have to save my ass.
What kind of knight are you?
One of a kind.
...rush into a physical relationship.
I'm not that emotionally ready for commitment of a this magnitude.
That was the word I was looking for. Magnitude.
Hey, that is unwanted physical contact.
Hey, what are you doing?
Ok, ok, let's just back up a little and take this one step at the time.
I mean, we really should get to know each other first, you know what am I saying.
As friends, maybe even as?
Hey don't do that. That's my tail. That's ma personal tail.
And you're going to tear it off...
Oh, no. No!
- It talks?!
- Yeah. It's getting to shut up, that's a trick.
Ok, you two. Head for the exit.
I'll take care of the dragon.
Ruuuuun!
You did it. You rescued me.
Amizing, you're wonderful. You're a...
...a little unorthodox I admit, but by deed is great and by heart is pure. I'm entirely in your debt.
And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed.
I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed.
She thinks I'm a steed.
The battle is won. You may remove your helmet good sir knight.
- Aah, no.
- Why not?
I have helmet hair.
Please. I wouldst look upon the face of my rescuer.
Oh, no, you wouldn't, dust.
But, how will you kiss me?
What? That wasn't in a job description.
- Maybe it's a perk?
- No. It's destiny.
You must know how it goes.
A princess locked in a tower and besieged by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight.
And then they share true love's first kiss.
With Shrek? You think, wait...
...you think Shrek is your true love?
Well, yes.
You think that Shrek is your true love.
What is so funny?
Let's just say, I'm not your type, ok?
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.
Now, now remove your helmet.
Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.
- Take it off!
- No!
- Now!
- Ok, easy.
As you command your highness.
You're an Ogre.
Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
Well, yes, actually.
Oh no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an Ogre.
Princess, I was sent to rescue you by lord Farquaad, ok?
He's the one, who wants to marry you.
Well, then why didn't he come to rescue me?
Good question. You should ask him that, when we get there.
But I have to be rescued by my true love.
Not by some Ogre and his pet.
Well so much for noble steed.
Look princess. You're not making my job any easier.
Well I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.
You can tell lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly,
I'll be waiting for him right here.
Hey, I'm no ones messenger boy, all right?
- I'm a delivery boy.
- You wouldn't dare.
- You coming donkey?
- Put me down!
Yeah, I'm right behind you.
Put me down or you will suffer the consequences.
This is not dignified. Put me down.
Ok, here's another question. Let's say that a woman 'digged' you, but you don't really like her, that way. Now, how you let her down real easy, so her feelings aren't hurt?
But you don't get burned to a crisp neither. How do you do this?
Just tell her, she's not your true love.
Everyone knows it what happens when you find...
Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc, the better.
Oh, yeah. You gonna love it there princess. It's beautiful.
And what of my groom to be, lord Farquaad. What's he like?
Well, let me put it this way, princess.
Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.
Oh no, Shrek. There are those who think little of him.
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.
You know, you're just jealous that you can never measure up to a great ruler like lord Farquaad.
Yeah. Well maybe you're right princess. But I'd like you do that measuring when you see him tomorrow
Tomorrow?
It will take that long?
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No. That would take longer.
We can keep going.
But there are robbers in the woods.
Whoa, time out Shrek. Camp is definitely something that sounds good.
Hey. Come on. I'm scarier than anything we're gonna see in this forest.
I need to find somewhere to camp, now!
Hey, over here.
Shrek, we can do better than that. Now,
I don't think this is decent for princess.
No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.
Homey touches? Like what?
A door.
Well, gentleman I'll be d..., good night.
Do you want me to come in and read you a bedtime story, 'cause I will...
I said good night!
Shrek! What are you doing?
I just..., you know...
Oh, come on, I was just kidding.
And that one, that's Throwback.
The only Ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.
Right. Yeah.
Hey, can you tell my future form these stars?
Well, the stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories. Look.
There's Blodna, the "Flatulent"
You can guess what he is famous for.
All right. Now I know you're making this up.
No. Look. There he is and there's the group of hunters running away from his stag.
Man, there ain't nothing, but a bunch of little dots.
You know donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear.
Forget it.
Hey Shrek. What are you gonna do when we get our swamp back, anyway?
- Our swamp?
- You know. When we're through rescuing the princess and all that stuff.
We? Donkey, there is no we. There's no our.
There's just me and my swamp.
And the first thing I'm gonna do, is build a ten foot wall around my land.
You cut me deep Shrek, you cut me real deep just now.
You know, what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.
No, do you think?
- Are you hiding something?
- Never mind Donkey.
Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?
No. This is one of those drop it and leave it alone things.
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to talk about it?
- Oh, Why you block? -I'm not blocking. -Oh yes you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.
- Who are you trying to keep out? Just tell me that Shrek. Who?
Everyone, ok?
- Oh, now we're getting somewhere.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
Hey, what's your problem Shrek? What do you got against the whole world anyway?
Look. I'm not the one with the problem, ok?
It's the world that seems to have a problem with me.
People take one look at me and go: AAA... Help! Run!
A big stupid ugly Ogre.
They judge me, before they even know me.
That's why I'm better off alone.
You know what? When we met, I didn't think you're just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Yeah, I know.
So, a... Are there any donkeys up there?
Well, there's a Cabby.
The small and annoying.
Ok, ok. I see him, now. Big shining one, right there. That one, over there?
That's the moon.
Again. Show me again.
Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess.
Perfect.
Yeah. You know I like like that. Oh come on baby...
- Donkey. Wake up.
- What? -Wake up.
Morning. How do you like your eggs?
- Good morning princess.
- What's all this about?
You know, we kind of got of to a bad start yesterday and I wanted to make it up to you.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.
Thanks.
Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us.
- Shrek!
- What? It's a compliment.
Better out than in I always say.
But that's no way to behave in front of a princess.
- Thanks.
- She's as nasty as you are.
You know. You're not exactly what I've expected.
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.
Princess!
What are you doing?
?mon shery, for I am your saviour. And
I am rescuing you from this green... beast.
Hey! That's my princess.
Go find your own.
Please, monster. Can't you see I'm a little busy here?
Look, pal. I don't know who you think you are.
Oh, of course. How rude that was.
Please, let me introduce myself. Oh marry men!
Man, that was annoying.
Oh, you little...
Shall we?
?all the forin?
Whoa, hold on, now.
Where did that come from?
- What?
- That. Back there. That was amazing.
Where did you learn that?
Well, when one lives alone one has to learn these things in case there's a...
There is an arrow in your butt.
What? Oh, would you look at that.
Oh, no... This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.
- What's wrong? -Shrek's hurt.
- Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt!
- Oh, no. Shrek's going to die.
- Donkey, I'm ok.
You can't do this to me Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head?.
- Does anyone know how to handle...
- Donkey! Calm down.
If you want to help Shrek, run into woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns. Ok, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
Don't die Shrek. And if you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!
- Donkey!
- Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
- What are the flowers for?
- For getting rid of the Donkey.
Now, you hold still and
I'll yank this thing out.
- Hey! Easy with the yanking.
- I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
No, no. It's tender. What you're doing here is the opposite...
- Don't move. -Ok, look.
Time out. -Would you... Ok.
What do you propose we do?
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.
This would be so much easier if I wasn't colorblind.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.
Hold on, Shrek. I'm coming!
Not good.
Ok, ok, I can lose it. It's just about it.
Nothing happened.
We were just a...
Look if you want to be alone, all you had to do is ask, ok?
Oh, come on. That's the last thing on my mind.
The princess here was just... Au!
Hey, what's that? Is that...
There it is, princess.
- Your future awaits you.
- That's Duloc?
Yeah. I know. You'll shrink things lord Farquaad is compensating for something, which I think needs, he has a
I guess we better move on.
Sure, but Shrek...
- I'm worried about Donkey.
- What?
I mean. Look at him.
He doesn't look so good.
- What are you talking about? I'm fine.
- Well, that's what they always say.
And the next thing you know you're on your back.
- Dead!
- You know she's right. You look awful.
- Do you want to sit down?
- You know, I'll make you up some tea.
Well, I won't say nothing, but
I've got this twinge in my neck. And if
I turn my neck like this, look. Au, see?
- He's hungry. I'll find us some dinner.
- I'll get the firewood.
Hey, where are you going? Oh man, I can't feel my thumbs. I don't have any thumbs!
I think I need a hug.
This is good. This is really good.
- What is this?
- Wheat rat.
- Rotisserie style.
- No kidding.
- Oh, this is delicious.
- Well, they also great in stews.
Now, I don't mean to brag, but
I make a mean wheat rat stew.
I guess I'll be dining a little different late tomorrow night.
Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime.
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.
Swamp toast, soup fish, eye tartar. You name it.
I'd like that.
- Ah..., princess?
- Yes, Shrek?
I'm a... I was wondering.
Are you... a...
Are you gonna eat that?
Man, isn't this romantic.
Just look at that sunset.
Sunset?! Oh, no. It's late. It's very late.
- What?
- Wait a minute. I see what's going on here.
You're afraid of the dark. Aren't you?
Yes, yes. That's it. That's, I'm terrified. You know I'll better go inside.
But don't feel bad, princess. I used to be afraid of the dark too.
Until... Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Ahh. Now I really see what's going on here.
Oh, what are you talking about.
Hey I don't wanna even hear. Look,
I'm an animal and I got instincts.
And I know that you two are digging on each other. I can feel it.
Oh, you're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.
Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the fairemones.
Just go in there and tell her how you feel.
There's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that... well you know.
I'm not saying that
I do, 'cause I don't.
She's a princess and I'm...
...an Ogre.
Yeah, an Ogre.
- Hey, where are you going?
- To get more firewood.
Princess. Princess Fiona?
Princess, where are you?
Princess?
It's very spooky in here and are we playing little games.
- No, no.
- Help! Shrek! Shrek!
- No. -Shrek!
- It's ok. It's ok.
- What did you do with the princess?
- Donkey, shhh. I'm the princess.
- It's me, in this body.
- Oh my god. You ate the princess.
- Can you hear me?
- Donkey!
Listen, keep breathing.
I'll get you out of there!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
This is me.
Princess? What happened to you?
You're a... different.
- I'm ugly, ok?
- Yeah.
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats were a bad idea.
- You are what you eat, I say.
- No. I've been this way as long as I can remember.
What do you mean? Look, I've never seen you like this before.
It only happens when the sun goes down.
By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm until you find true love's first kiss.
Then, take love's true form...
- Oh, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.
- It's the spell.
When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me.
Every night I become this.
This horrible ugly beast.
I was placed in a tower to await the day when my true love would rescue me.
That's why I have to marry lord Farquaad tomorrow, before the sun sets and he sees me, like this?
All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly.
Wait, wait, I'll not lie, you are ugly.
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24/7.
But Donkey, I'm a princess. And this is not how a princess is meant to look.
Princess. How about if you don't marry Farquaad?
I have to. Only my true love's kiss can brake the spell.
But you know, you're kind of an Ogre.
And Shrek... Well you've got a lot in common.
Shrek?
Princess, I... How is it going first of all? Good? Good for me to. I'm ok.
I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty.
And, well, I don't really like it, but I thought you may like it, because you're pretty.
But I like you anyway. A...
I'm in trouble. Ok, here we go.
Who could ever love a piece so hideous and ugly? Princess and ugly don't go together.
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek, but only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.
Don't you see, Donkey?
That's just how it has to be.
It's the only way to break the spell.
Well, at least you've got tell Shrek the truth.
No, no. You can't breathe the word. No one must ever know.
What's the point of being unable to talk? You got to keep secrets.
Promise you won't tell. Promise!
All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.
You know, before this is over, I'm going to need whole lot of serious therapies.
Look at my eye twitching.
I tell him, I tell him not.
I tell him. I tell him not.
I tell him!
Shrek! Shrek! There's something I want...
Shrek. Are you all right?
Perfect. Never been better.
I... There's something
I have to tell you.
You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night.
- You've heard what I said?
- Every word.
I thought you'd understand?
Oh, I understand! Like you said, who could love a hideous, ugly beast!
- I thought that wouldn't matter to you.
- Yeah, well, it does.
Ah, right on time. Princess. I brought you a little something.
What I missed? What I missed?
- Princess Fiona.
- As promised. Now hand it over.
Very well, Ogre. The deed to your swamp.
Cleared out as agreed. Take it and go.
Before I change my mind.
Forgive me princess for startling you, but you startled me.
For I've never seen such a radiant beauty before.
- I am lord Farquaad.
- Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no... forgive me my lord for
I was just saying short... farewell.
Oh. That is so sweet. You don't have to raise good manners on the Ogre.
- It's not like it has feelings.
- No. You're right. It doesn't.
Princess Fiona, beautiful fair flawless Fiona,
I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...
Excellent! I'll start the plans for tomorrow we wedd...
No! I mean I... Why wait?
Let's get married today. Before sunset.
Oh, anxious are we? You're right. The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do.
There is the camera, the cake, the band, the guests... Captain! Round up some guests.
Farewell Ogre.
Shrek, what are you doing?
You let her get away.
- Yeah, so what.
- Shrek. There's something about her that you don't know.
- I talked to her last night. She's...
- Yeah I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pal, aren't you? Now, if you two are such good friend, why didn't you follow her home?
- Shrek. I want to go with you.
- I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me. I live alone. My swamp, me and nobody else!
Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!
- But. I thought...
- Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong.
Shrek.
Donkey?
What are you doing?
I was thinking of all the people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.
Well, yeah. But the wall supposed to go around my swamp. Not through it.
It is around your half. See? That's your half and this is my half.
Oh, your half?
Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess.
I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head
- Back off!
- No. You back off!
- This is my swamp.
- Our swamp.
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go!
- Stubborn jackass.
- Smelly Ogre.
Fine!
Hey, hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you, yet.
- Well, I'm through with you!
- Well, you know. You were always me, me, me.
Well, guess what? Now it's my turn!
So you just shut up and pay attention!
You are mean to me, you insult me, you don't appreciate anything that I do!
You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?
Because that's what friend do. They forgive each other!
Oh, yeah. You're right Donkey. I forgive you for stabbing me in the back!
You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy. You're afraid of your own feelings.
- Go away.
- See? There you are, doing it again. Just like you did it to Fiona.
And all she ever do, was like you. Maybe even love you.
Love me? She said I was ugly! A hideous creature.
- I heard that you two were talking.
- She wasn't talking about you. She was talking about...
...somebody else.
She wasn't talking about me? Well then, who was she talking about?
No way, I'm not saying anything.
You won't listen to me, right? Right?
- Donkey.
- No!
Ok, look. I'm sorry, all right?
I'm sorry.
I guess I am just a big stupid, ugly Ogre.
Can you forgive me?
- Hey, that's the friends are for, right?
- Right.
- Friends?
- Friends.
So? What did Fiona said about me?
Why are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her.
The wedding! We'll never make it in time!
Never fear! For where there is a will, there is a way.
And I have I way.
Donkey?
- I guess this is just my act of magnetism.
- Oh, come here, you.
All right. All right. Don't get all started. No one likes kissass.
All right, hop on. Hold on tight.
I hadn't have a chance to install seat belts, yet.
People of Duloc. We gather here today to bear witness to reunion of our new king...
Excuse me. Could you just skip ahead to "I do's"?
Go on.
Go ahead and have some fun, if we need you, I'll whistle. How about that?
Shrek, wait, wait a minute. You want to do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?
- It's the line, it's the line you got to wait for.
The priest is going to say: "Speak now or forever hold your peace".
And that's where you say: "I object".
- I don't have time for this.
- Wait, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me!
Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.
- You want to hold her!
- Yes. -Please her! -Yes!
Then you got to, got to try a little tender love.
- The chicks love that romantic crap.
- All right. Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?
We got to check it out.
And as so by the power of these two...
What do you see?
- I now pronounce you...
- There they go!
- ... he all ready said it.
- Oh, for 'the love of pit'.
I object!
Shrek?
Oh, now what does he want?
Hi, everyone. Having a good time, aren't you?
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.
- What are you doing here?
- Really, it's rude enough being alive, when no one wants you.
But showing up uninvited to a wedding...
- Fiona! I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?
Well it's a little late for that. So if you'll excuse me.
- But you can't marry him!
- And why not?
Because, because he's just marrying you so he can be king.
- Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.
- He's not your true love.
- What do you know about true love?
- Well, I... I'm in...
Oh, this is precious.
The Ogre has fallen in love with the princess.
Laugh.
Shrek. Is this true?
Who cares. It's preposterious. Fiona, my love, we gonna kiss away for our happily ever after. Now kiss me!
By night one way, by day another.
I wanted to show you before.
Well. That explains a lot.
Oh. It's disgusting. Guards, guards. I order you to get them out of my sight.
- Now! Get them! Get them, both!
- No!
This marriage is minding, and that makes me king. See? See?
- Shrek!
- No.
- Don't just stand there, you dogs.
- Get out of my way.
No! Shrek!
- And as for you my wife.
- Fiona!
I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days!
I will have order. I will have potential. I will have...
All right, nobody move! I got a dragon here and I'm not afraid to use it.
I'm a donkey on the edge!
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?
Go ahead Shrek.
- Fiona?
- Yes, Shrek?
I love you.
Really?
Really, really.
I love you too.
A time for true love's first kiss...
Fiona?
Fiona? Are you all right?
Yes. But I don't understand.
I'm supposed to be beautiful.
But you are beautiful.
I was hoping this would be a happy ending.
God bless us, everyone.
The End.
Oh, hello.
You're, uh, you're probably here
About the, Uh, the story.
Elves love to tell stories.
I- I'll bet you didn't know that about elves.
There's, uh, probably a lot of things
You... you didn't know about elves.
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism
Uh, there are only three jobs available to an elf.
The first is making shoes at night
While, you know, while the old...
The old cobbler sleeps.
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.
You can bake cookies
In a tree. Hey!
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven
In an oak tree during the dry season.
I wanna make shoes!
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.
Only two weeks left till Christmas!
I- It's a job only an elf can do.
Our... our nimble fingers,
Natural cheer and active minds
Are perfect for toy-building.
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,
But the gnomes drank too much...
...and the trolls weren't toilet trained.
No human being has ever set... set foot in Santa's workshop.
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,
And, as you may have guessed,
That's where our story begins.
Wow!
Whoa!
Ooh!
Wow!
Wow!
Ow! Ow!
Whoa!
Are you sleepy?
Here we are.
We're just going to make you feel so comfortable.
Here we are.
There you are.
It's time to go to sleep.
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.
Merry Christmas, my ángel.
Mmm...
All right, all right.
We've had another very successful year.
So, after all that hard work,
It's time to start preparations
For next Christmas!
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?
Wow...
A baby...
"little buddy diapers."
His name is buddy. He must've...
Snuck into your sack at the orphanage.
What do we do?
So, Santa had a
Decision to make,
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,
Santa's a... a pushover.
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf
Who had always wanted a child?
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.
Santa.
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.
I was his adopted father.
Though buddy grew twice as fast,
He... he wasn't any different from the other children.
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.
I mean, not... not really.
Before we learn how to build
The latest
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"
Shall we?
Number one.
"Treat every day like Christmas."
Number two.
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."
Number three.
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer
Is singing loud for all to hear."
And one day, when buddy was old enough,
I made him my own personal apprentice.
I've never been in this room before.
Well, I think it's time you start
Your tinker training.
Santa's sleigh.
You're gonna help me make it fly.
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.
And where do the reindeer get their magic from?
Christmas spirit. Everybody knows that.
Well, silly as it sounds,
A lot of people down south
Don't believe in Santa Claus.
What?!
Well, who do they think puts all? their toys under the tree?
Well, there's a rumor floating around
That, uh, that the parents do it.
That's... that's ridiculous.
I mean, parents couldn't do that all in one night.
What about Santa's cookies?
I suppose parents eat them, too?
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,
Uh, and every earless and less
People
Believe in Santa Claus.
I mean, we have a real energy crisis on our hands.
Oh.
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.
That's shocking.
That's why I came up
With this little beauty in the '60s.
WH-what is it?
It's a cringle 3000...
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine engine.
Without it, the sleigh couldn't
Get more than, uh, a few feet off the ground.
Well, it looks like we got
A short in the thermo coupler.
You wanna give mea hand with that?
You want me to help?
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted
By his family and friends,
There were a few drawbacks
To being, uh, a human in, uh an elf's world.
Hey, Ming Ming.
Um...
I'm gonna be a little bit short on today's quota.
It's all right, buddy.
Just how many etch-a-sketches
Did you get finished?
Come on, buddy. How many?
I made, uh... 85.
Eighty-five?
That puts you...
915 off the pace.
Ooh... that's bad.
Why don't you just say it?
I'm the worst toy maker in the world.
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.
No, buddy, you're not cotton- headed ninny-muggins.
We all just have different talents
That's all.
Seems like everyone else
Have the same talents except for me.
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...
Special talents?
You changed the batteries in the smoke detector.
You sure did... aaa's.
And in six months, you'll have to check 'em again...
Won't he?
And you're the only baritone in the elf choir.
You bring us down whole octave.
In a good way.
See, buddy?
You're not a cotton-headed ninny- muggings.
You're just... special.
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.
Aah!
Ah!
Hey, foom foom...
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could
Help me pick up the slack on those etch-a-sketches?
No problem. I appreciate it.
Buddy is killing me.
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.
That was quick thinking yesterday
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.
I feel bad for the guy.
I just hope he doesn't get wise.
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,
I don't think he ever will.
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human
By now, I don't think he ever will.
I think they're too small.
You're just... special.
You don't look so good, buddy.
Are you okay?
I'll be okay, I just need a glass of water.
Aah!
Buddy...
Unh! Aah!
Buddy, are you okay?
I'm sorry, papa.
I just need some alone time.
Buddy, I... I think we... we have to talk.
Buddy, uh, I think there's something
I... I probably should tell you.
You probably should have found out a long...
A long time ago.
I then proceeded to tell buddy of how his father
Had fallen in love when he was very young
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,
And how buddy was born
And put up for adoption by his mother,
And how she had later passed away.
I... I told him his father
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,
And most importantly,
I told him where his father was...
Uh, in a magical land called new York City.
My dad works there?
Empire state building.
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some snow berries?
Not now, arctic puffin.
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.
Why the long face, partner?
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"
And had a beard since you were 15.
Papa says my real father
Lives in a magical place far away.
I don't know what to do.
At least you have a daddy.
I was just rolled up one day and left out here in the cold.
But the thing is, I've never even left the North Pole.
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times
When I was a young cumulus nimbus cloud.
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...
Except dogs.
Oh, by the way, don't eat the yellow snow.
Oh, I know that.
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity
To find out whom you really are.
So, I hear you're going
On a little journey to the big city.
Yup. Ahh.
I'm kind a nervous.
Leon says New York is pretty different.
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.
I've been to New York thousands of times.
Really? Mm-hmm.
What's it like?
Well, there are some things you should know.
First off, you see gum on
The street,
Leave it there. It's not free candy.
Oh. Second,
There are, like, 30 ray's pizzas.
They all claim to be the
Original,
But the real one' son 11th.
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you
Look at presents before Christmas.
Can't wait to see my dad...
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.
Yeah, that's the other thing
I wanted to talk to you about.
You know, buddy...
Your father...
Well... he's on the naughty list.
No!
You're taking the books back?
See, I... I see what you're trying to do here.
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,
When, in actuality, you're the one
That missed the payments.
But the children love the books.
I know that, uh...
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,
But I like hearing that.
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight
Of what's important in life.
That doesn't mean they can't find their way again, huh?
Maybe all they need
Is just a little Christmas spirit.
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.
I know you are.
And I'll...
I'll always, uh,
I'll always be here for you.
Now, uh...
Go... uh, get.
Bye, guys.
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, buddy.
There, there.
Huh?
Oh! Ohh!
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.
Bye.
Hey! What's your name?
My name's buddy.
Ohh!
Does someone need a hug? aah, aah! That's not cool!
I just wanted a hug!
Hi.
Hello.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You did it! Congratulations!
"World's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.
It's great to meet you.
Hi.
Santa, san... uh, nope.
Not Santa.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.
No, all right? Thank you.
Get outta here, get outta here.
Hello. Hi.
Ooh...
Beautiful.
Looks like a Christmas tree.
A reprint?
You know how much that's gonna cost?
Two whole pages are missing.
The story doesn't make any sense.
What, you think some kid's gonna notice two pages?
I mean, they... all they do is look at pictures.
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never
Declared kittens before.
How many?
Eight?
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.
I have to go. Excuse me.
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs
You look hilarious! Who sent you?
Papa elf. Papa elf?
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.
From the North Pole? Yes.
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath
So some kid can understand
What happened?
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon ship 'em.
Yeah.
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.
Go ahead.
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.
Dad!
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.
I walked all day and night to
Find you.
Uh, you look like you came from the North Pole.
That's exactly where I came from.
Santa must've called you!
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...
Just got off the cell phone with me.
You did?!
So, go on. Go on with what?
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,
Or can I just go back to work?
A song? Uh...
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad
And we never met
And he wants me to sing
Him a song
And, um, I was adopted
But you didn't know I was born
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy
And, guess what? I love you
I love you I love you!
Wow, that was weird.
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,
Put my name into jingle bells or something.
It's me, your son.
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,
And, and, and, but now I'm here...
It's me buddy.
Susan wells.
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.
Who sent this Christmas-gram?
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.

Yes. Can you sign this for me?
Ohh! Hi.
Are you enjoying the view?
You are very good at decorating that tree.
Why are you messing with me?
Did krumpet put you up to this?
I'm not messing with you.
It's just nice to meet
Another human
Who shares my affinity for? elf culture.
I'm just trying to get through the holidays.
Get through?
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!
Please stop talking to me.
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.
Go away.
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer
Is singing loud for all to hear.
Thanks, but I don't sing.
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...
Except louder and longer
And you move your voice up
And down.
I can sing, but I just choose not to sing.
Especially in front of other people.
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing
In front of other people. There's no difference.
Actually, there's a big difference.
No, there... no, there isn't.
Wait.
I'm singing
I'm in a store, and I'm singing
I'm in a store, and I'm singing
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.
Yes, there is.
No, there's not.
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.
Especially when we make toys.
See?
Attention, all gimbel's shoppers,
Please make your final purchases.
We'll be closing in ten minutes.
Well, it's time for me to go home.
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.
Yeah, um... laughs
I'll see you tomorrow...
Buddy. Jovie.
Hi. Hi.
Jovie.
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the bedroom, okay?
I, uh, I got
A bunch of stuff to go over.
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind
On a bunch of stuff.
Okay.
Can I eat in my room?
No. Why not?
Dad's eating in his room.
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,
And I'm way behind on a bunch of stuff.
You're eating here.
I really can't stay
I've got to go 'way
This evening has been
So very nice
My mother will start to worry
And father will be pacing'
The floor
So, really, I'd better scurry
Well, may be just a half a drink
More
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried
What's the sense of hurting? my pride?
I really can't stay
Ah, but it's cold outside baby, it's cold outside!
Get out! Don't look at me!
Get out!
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling
Ring-ting-tingling, too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together

And friends are calling yoo-hoo

Come on, its lovely weather dad.
Dad, hi! It's me! For a sleigh
Ride together with you

Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow
Hey! It's okay,
I just have a gift for my dad.
Okay, I'll take this.
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?
Okay. And that I love him so much,
And that I think he's the greatest dad in the world.
You guys are so strong.
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather
Would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together
With you
Hey, you. Me?
Come here. I wanna talk to you.
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?
How come you were
In the women's locker room these morning?
I heard you singing.
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact
That I was naked in the shower?
I didn't know you were naked.
Why were you here so early?
They shut my water off.
What were you doing here so early?
Building this.
You built this? Mm-hmm.
They're kind a pissed about this.
Really?
Hey, guys.
Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.
It's pretty good. It's a little too good.
Corporate must have sent in a professional.
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?
'Cause if I go, we all go.
If you get wind of anything,
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"
Okay?
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.
That's impossible. Six... inches.
By the way... I think you have
The most beautiful singing voice
In the whole wide world.
Santa...
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!
Yeah!
Santa, it's me buddy!
It's me! Hey, buddy,
How you doing?
It's me!
Are you ready to see Santa?
Who the heck are you?
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.
No, you're not.
Uh, WH-why, of course I am!
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Well, if you're Santa...
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?
Uh, happy birthday of course!
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Uh, so, how old are you, son?
Four.
You're a big boy, what's your name?
Paul. And, uh, what can I get you for Christmas?
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.
You sit on a throne of lies.
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.
I'm a fake? Yes.
How'd you like to be dead, huh?
Fake. No, he's kidding.
You stink.
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?
You smell like beef and cheese.
You don't smell like Santa.
Okay.
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!
I saw!
He's a fake!
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?
Ohh! Ohh!
No!
He's not Santa Claus!
He's not Santa!
"To someone special."
What's that? Intercom.
All right.
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.
Police. Hello?
Dad!
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.
Officer tom, this is my dad.
This is Walter... he came.
He bailed me out.
They gave me one phone call.
They gave me one phone call,
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...
Walter Hobbs."
And sure enough, you showed up.
You did, they said you weren't goanna show up.
They told me so many times... shh shh shh shh shh.
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?
I- I'm buddy, I'm your son.
Wait, um...
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...
Where'd you get this picture?
Papa elf gave it to me.
Listen... is this some kind a game?
What do you want, some money?
No! I just wanted to meet you,
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...
And maybe even hold hands.
Uh-huh.
Come with me. Okay.
Okay. What have we got here?
Buddy, don't eat those.
Ohh!
We got to really hurry up, Walter,
'cause I'm double booked the rest of the afternoon.
Am I sick?
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.
We're hereto do a test, come on.
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?
Because it's sanitary for the other patients.
Now, sit still so I can do the finger prick.
Finger prick!
Ohh! It's cold.
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?
Okay, can I listen to your necklace?
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...
Why is there a skeleton? over there?
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?
If I squint it looks like a pirate flag.
Could you please have him?
Sit still?
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.
I have a lot of patients waiting.
Would you please it still?
Please.
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can
Get this mess over with.
Okay. Then can we eat sugar plums?
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.
Ow! Ohh...
My finger has a heartbeat.
It won't hurt so much after a little.
What's your name?
Buddy.
I'm Carolyn.
Hi.
What do you want for Christmas?
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.
I'll put in a good word with the big man.
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.
Well, technically, I'm a human,
But I was raised by elves.
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.
Hmm. Cool.
So?
It's a boy... buddy's your son.
That's very impossible.
You... you saw that guy out there.
He's... he's certifiably insane.
He's probably just reverting
To a state of childlike dependency.
An elf?
What he needs is to be nurtured.
Oh, I see.
So, um, uh...
You'd like me to breastfeed him?
Walter, just bring him home.
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...
This is wonderful,
You... you have another son.
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...
I guess I never really thought of it that way.
This is incredible, I...
You know, it's a little complicated,
But it's nothing that we can't handle.
Honey? What?
He thinks he's an elf.
I'm sorry, what?
He think she's a Christmas elf.
Oh, come on, Walter,
I'm sure he doesn't actually think he's an elf.
And then, I traveled through the seven levels
Of the candy cane forest,
Past the sea of swirly-twirly gumdrops,
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.
Ahh.
So, where were you for the last 30 years?
The north pole.
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?
I... I didn't put... it's spaghetti.
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.
Yes.
You like sugar, huh?
Is there sugar in syrup?
Yes.
Then yes.
We elves try to stick to the four main food groups
Candy, candy canes, candy corns, and syrup.
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?
You mean I can stay?
Of course you can. Emily.
How... how long do you think you'll be with us?
I... I hadn't really planned it out,
But I was thinking, like... forever.
Emily? Can I just speak to you for a minute in the, uh, kitchen, please?
Are you crazy? He cannot stay here.
Clearly he has some serious issues.
We can't just throw him out in the snow.
Why not? He loves the snow.
He's told me 15 times.
Walter, he's your son.
Did you hear that?
You are so weird.
Dad?
Dad?
Dad!
What?
What?
I am not gonna tuck you in.
I... I promise I'll go right to sleep.
Fine.
Tickle fight, tickle fight! buddy, stop.
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop stop, stop.
Sorry.
It's all right.
Hey, uh...
You just lay there and go to sleep.
Okay.
Okay.
Dad? Hmm?
I love you.
Okay. Go to sleep now.
Well, this is really something.
I'm usually the one making breakfast.
That's good, that's good.
Okay.
Oh, that's good.
Good? Good.
Good.
So, did you, um...
Did you sleep okay last night?
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.
And I had time to build that rocking horse.
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually made that?
Where did you get all the wood?
Good morning, honey. Good morning, dad.
Walter, buddy has made us breakfast.
Isn't that nice?
And lunch.
And lunch.
Bye.
So, dad, how many scoops?
I'll stick with the coffee now, thanks.
So, dad...
I planned out our whole day.
First, we'll make snow angels for two hours,
And then we'll go ice skating and then we'll eat a whole roll
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast as we can,
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.
I've got to go to work, buddy.
Oh, and another thing...
If you're going to be staying here,
You should think about, you know,
Getting rid of the costume.
But I've worn this my whole life.
You're not in the North Pole any longer.
You wanna make me happy, don't you?
More than anything.
Then, lose the tights. I mean, as soon as possible.
As soon as possible?
As soon as possible.
Okay.
I almost forgot...
Aah! Aah!
Good morning.
Walter here.
It worked, it's you.
How'd you get this number?
Emily left an emergency list.
I see.
And, uh, is this an emergency?
There's a horrible noise
Coming from the evil box underneath the window.
It sounds like this...
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil, buddy,
It's, uh, it's a radiator,
And the heat makes noise when it comes on.
No, it doesn't. It... It's very evil.
It's scary to look at. It's... okay...
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.
Everything's fine.
You were right.
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang up now.
I love you.
I'll call you in five minutes.
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...
You... you don't have to call me, okay?
Good idea, you call me.
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.
I painted a picture of a butterfly.
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.
I tuned the piano.
Okay, I love you. Bye.
Mmm...
Mmm... Mmm.
Mmm.
Hobbs. Hey!
How you doing? Please, sit down.
I haven't seen you since the retreat.
You're looking good.
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.
To what do I owe the, uh, pleasure?
Well, to be honest, I got a call from my niece.
She wants to know
How a certain puppy and a certain pigeon
Escape the clutches of a certain evil witch.
Believe me, uh,
We're already looking for new printers.
This one has obviously gotten a little sloppy.
Maybe it isn't the printer who's gotten sloppy.
That's your signature, right?
You know, we could sit here and point fingers all day.
I've got news for you...
Even if those two pages were in there,
The book still would have sucked.
Have you seen the numbers for this quarter?
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh, they're in.
That frigging puppy and pigeon
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.
My people estimate we're gonna post
A minus eight for this quarter.
A minus eight! That does not happen!
You know, we'll... we'll bounce back, we...
No, no, no. No? Well...
We're gonna ship a new book
The first quarter.
First quarter?
I'm gonna be back in town on the 24th.
At that time, I would love to hear
In exact detail
What your plans are for this new book.
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh the 24th, that's Christmas eve.
And?
And, uh...
No problem. Be great to have you in the loop.
All right, I got every weapon in the game.
I got full health, I got full armor.
Michael!
I got full...
Michael!
It's me buddy!
You know that guy?
No, I've never seen him before.
It's me buddy! Your brother!
Oh, man.
No, Michael! Wait! It's your brother bud...
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks
Michael! Michael!
Michael!
Michael, wait up!
Michael! Michael!
Wow, you're fast.
I'm gladi caught up with you.
I waited five hours for you.
Why is your coat so big?
So, good news... I saw a dog today.
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.
How was school? Was it fun?
Did you get a lot of homework, huh?
Do you have any friends?
Do you have a best friend?
Does he have a big coat, too?
Go away!
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!
Run!
Get him! Get the green guy!
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.
We better get outta here.
You know what? We can take 'em.
Okay, just start making as many snowballs as you can.
You ready?
Let's go. Aah! Ow.
Ow!
Run!
Oh, man. One got away.
Snowball.
Unh!
Wow.
Where did you say you were from?
Oh, yeah
Candles burning low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols right outside my door
All these things and more
I wish dad were here.
Why?
'Cause he's the greatest dad in the whole wide world.
Are you kidding?
He's the worst dad in the world.
What do you mean?
All he does is work.
Working's fun.
Not the way he does it.
All he cares about is money.
He doesn't care about you, or me, or anybody.
Well, he is on the naughty list.
You like her?
Like who?
The girl you're staring at.
Oh, uh...
Yeah.
Why don't you ask her out?
Out?
You know, on a date... to eat food.
Food?
Yes, real food, not candy.
And if she says yes, you're in.
It's like a secret code girls have.
Well, look who it is.
Hi, Jovie. Hi.
Oh, uh, this is Michael.
I'm his brother.
Hi.
So, what are you doing here?
Did gimbel's give you your job back?
No. But things worked out pretty good.
They gave mea restraining order.
Well, um, you should probably get outta here.
Ho ho ho!
But... I really wanted to see you,
And... and I think you're beautiful, and I, um...
I feel really warm when I am around you,
And, um, my tongue swells up.
So...
Do you wanna go eat food?
Do I... do I wanna eat food?
Mm-hmm.
You know, uh, the code... food.
Well, I just had my lunch break.
Oh, okay. I understand.
But I'm free on Thursday.
Thursday! Thursday!
Come on. That'd be great.
All right.
Was that okay?
You did great, man.
What should we put on it first?
Lights! Oh, good.
And then, after that?
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.
What the hell's that?
A Christmas tree.
A Christmas tree?
Buddy chopped it down in the park.
Emily.
I don't know what you're making such a big deal about.
They were just having a little fun.
Oh, fun? So felonies are fun now?
I thought, see, felonies were felonies.
Okay, the tree thing was bad.
I'll get him to plant another one.
But at least Michael is happy for once.
What, uh, what's that supposed to mean?
Well, I don't think it's any secret, Walter,
That you haven't exactly been there for him.
I'll tell you what, why don't we just
Pull him outta school and let the, uh,
Deranged elf man raise him?
Then they can have lots of fun committing felonies.
How are we gonna get the star on top?
I got it.
I mean, what are we gonna do?
We can't... we can't leave him alone here.
He's gonna destroy the place.
Why don't you, um...
Why don't you take off tomorrow?
You know, and you could stay home and watch him?
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home tomorrow,
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.
Well, honey, I can't take off,
I'm one... one bad pitch away
From getting fired... one.
Well, I tell you what, I have an idea then.
Why don't you take buddy to work with you?
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.
Morning, jack.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.
Good morning, Sarah. Good morning, Sarah.
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."
Hi! Hi.
Do you remember me?
I do. I didn't recognize you.
I know, I'm in work clothes.
Thank you, Deborah.
Thanks, deb.
Deb, you have such a pretty face.
You should be on a Christmas card.
You just made my day.
Eww.
Buddy. Hmm?
You don't have to drink that.
Thank you.
Francisco.
Francisco.
Francisco.
Francisco.
Buddy?
Just... just a little.
Yes, bud?
Why is your name on the desk?
I bought the desk.
My name's there so no one steals it.
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.
So, what are we gonna build?
No, uh, we don't do
That kind of work here, pal.
Buddy the elf, what's your favorite color?
Put that down. Hello?
Hello? Dial tone
Please, don't touch anything.
Sorry.
Hey...
Bud, have you... have you...
Have you ever seen a mailroom?
A mailroom? No.
No? No.
Oh, I mean, wow.
Wow... listen, it's a place where mail
From all over the world comes,
Uh-huh. And they sort it out there, see?
And you can touch it all,
And they put it in these shiny bins.
Shiny bins? Right.
What do ya think? It sounds great.
Good.
Can we go there?
Well, um...
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe you can work there.
Okay, I'll work there.
Oh, I don't think this is the place
My dad was talking about.
Is there a different mailroom?
No. This is the only one.
It's not very shiny.
Now... over here's the trench.
All the mail comes out that shooter.
Scan and find the floor each piece is moving to.
Put it in a canister
And shove it up the tube with the same number.
You got that?
I think so.
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.
Except it smells like mushrooms,
And everyone looks like they wanna hurt me.
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,
So, what... what do we got?
Well, Morris and I have been brainstorming,
And we've come up with what I think
Is a pretty big idea.
Great, what?
You're gonna love it, it's fantastic.
What?
Okay, picture this...
We bring in miles finch.
The miles finch?
The golden ghost.
We bring him in!
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.
I tain't gonna be easy,
But I think it's worth a shot.
My two top writers, my crack team, my fun squad...
You came in here pitching me
The idea of hiring another writer?
Yeah.
Miles finch.
I like it. Chuckles
I like it.
Then I traveled through the seven levels
Of the candy cane forest
And past the sea of swirly-twirly gumdrops.
Ooh!
Wow... it's sucky.
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!
That is marvelous how that...
Oh!
Oh, it's very sucky.
It's very... sucky.
Whoo.
So, how'd you get here?
Work release.
Mm.
Oh, syrup and coffee?
Why didn't I think of that? Can I try some?
Be my guest.
Very generous of you.
Mmm. I love syrup.
Ohh, I love it.
Mmm...
You know, I know I sound like a broken record,
But we are buddies.
You're my best friend, that's it.
You're my best friend.
You know, buddy, nobody around here listens to me.
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.
You have great ideas.
I just try to go with the flow, you know?
Good, you go with the flow.
Yeah. Go with the flow.
No, I gotta get out of the flow.
Well, then get out of the flow.
I'm in the flow, that's what got me here.
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got nothing to show for it.
You're young. You're so young.
My papa... yeah?
He didn't make master tinker till he was 490,so...
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!
My favorite book of yours has gotta be Gus' pickles.
It's existential, yet it's so accessible.
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris here.
It's a thrill just to be talking to you
On our speakerphone.
Miles, um, so, what do you think?
Can you fly in tomorrow?
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,
Not a minute more.
Oh, that's... that's great.
I'd like a black s500to receive me at the airport.
I need the interior of that car
To be 71 degrees exactly.
We can do that.
Mr. Hobbs?
There's a situation downstairs.
I'm sorry, what?
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.
I do not hold. Do not put me on hold.
We have a problem in the mailroom.
What's going on?
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!
I'll be there tomorrow... 71 degrees.
Sir, chuck in the mailroom
Needs to talk to you.
Chuck... what, chuck?
I mean, what could be going on down there
That's so important you had to interrupt me, what?
Whoomp, there it is! A little louder
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all
Whoomp! There it is
Upside down and inside out hey!
I'm 'bout to show all you folks
What it's all about hey!
Time for me to get on the mike
And make this mother of a party hype
I'm taking you back to the old school
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna show you the way
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear you say
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all
Whoomp! There it is a little louder
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all
Whoomp, there it is!
Coming.
Hi.
Wow.
You look miraculous.
So do you.
Thank you.
What would you like to do?
I got some ideas.
Just reach out in front of you and and take a sip.
Don't look. There you go.
Well?
It tastes like a crappy cup of coffee.
No.
It is a crappy cup of coffee.
No, it's the world's best cup of coffee.
The trick is to not get your arm caught in the door!
Also, never close your eyes' cause then
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you just jump in! what are you doing?
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.
Now, look at the size of this one.
Come with me.
Watch out.
Yellow ones don't stop.
The yellow ones don't stop.
Wow... that's a big one.
I'm sorry.
You missed.
What do you mean I missed?
You missed.
Miles finch.
Miles finch.
Miles finch.
All right, let's do this.
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...
Yeah.
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get the, uh...
Taken care of so we can get started here.
Here you go.
Great.
All right... clears throat
What have you guys got so far?
Go ahead.
Uh...
We were thinking, uh, something like this, uh...
We open on a young tomato.
He's had some tough times down at the farm
With, you know, a rabbit, and...
No. No tomatoes...
Too vulnerable.
Kids, they're already vulnerable.
No, you see? I... I told you guys.
I told them the very same thing...
And no farms.
Every body's pushing small town rural.
A farm book would just be white noise.
What about this?
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,
But they're self-conscious about the way their pee smells.
Apparently, all we have is vegetables.
I have no time, so, you know,
If you've got a story here...
I've got about five or six great starts here.
I've got one idea that
I'm especially
Psyched out of my mind about.
You know, it's one of those ideas
Where you're just like, uh...
Yes!
Whoa!
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,
And I don't care who knows it!
Buddy, not now, uh,
Can you please go back to the... to the pit?
I'll come and visit you in a little while, okay?
I didn't know you had elves working here.
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious, my friend.
He doesn't, uh... get back to
The story, please. All right, okay.
So, on the cover above the title...
Does Santa know that you left the workshop?
You know, we're all laughing our heads off.
Did you have to borrow a reindeer to get down here?
Buddy... go back to the basement.
Hey, jack weed,
I get more action in a week
Than you've had your entire life.
I've got houses in I.e., Paris, and Vail,
Oh. Each one of them with a 70-inchplasma screen.
So, I suggest you wipe
That stupid smile off your face
Before I come over there and smack it off!
You feeling strong, my friend?!
Call me elf one more time!
He's an angry elf.
Look at you.
Ow! Hey, what...
Aah!
I wasn't ready for that.
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!
Ooh...
Call me elf one more time!
Call me elf!
You're an elf.
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks he's an elf.
Listen, miles...
Listen, miles! Door slams
He must be a South Pole elf.
You get the hell outta here.
Where do you want me to go?
I don't care where you go.
I don't care that you're an elf!
I don't care that you're nuts!
I don't care that you're my son!
Get out of my life now!
Hi, it's me.
I really can't talk right now.
Well, just tell me how the pitch went.
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?
Well, don't be too late, Walter,
It's Christmas Eve.
Walter... wait, um.
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.
Oh, say hi to buddy.
What? Walter, breakthrough.
We found this in the conference room.
What is it?
It's miles finch's notebook.
This thing is chock full of genius ideas.
I mean, look at that.
And his best idea is about a peach that lives on a farm.
What's more vulnerable than a peach?
What, uh, what do we do?
I think we should go with the first pitch... it's genius.
Uh, how much time we got?
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well, come on, let's, uh,
Try to get a storyboard or something ready.
Come on, let's do it. Just try.
No, you can't sit down and get a storyboard ready.
Go and get a storyboard ready.
Oh, boy! Go.
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives
"And crammed 11 cookies into the vcr.
"I don't belong here. I don't belong anywhere.
I'll never forget you. Love, buddy."
God...
Hey, buddy.
Buddy?
As you know, we need a big launch fast
To get the company back on track.
So, I think I speak for my fellow board members
When I say... this better be good.
Before I get into the story, uh,
Let me start with the cover, okay?
Now, just picture this...
Dad! I gotta talk to you.
Michael, what is it?
Buddy ran away.
What? He... he left a note.
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.
Uh, let me just finish this meeting,
And then, um, we'll figure it out, okay?
Figure out what? Buddy cares about everybody.
All you care about is yourself.
Hey, Michael.
Wait.
We're gonna have to reschedule this, uh, Mr. Greenway.
We don't have time to reschedule.
I wanna hear the damn thing now.
Son, you'll have to wait.
No, d-don't tell my kid what to do, uh...
Can't... can't we do this another time, Mr. Greenway?
I flew in just to hear this pitch,
And I intend to.
It's gonna have to wait.
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,
You will pitch me this book right now.
Well... up yours.
Yeah, up yours. Hey.
Hobbs... Hobbs!
Hobbs, you walk out of here,
And... and you're finished at greenway!
You're finished!
I don't belong anywhere.
Buddy!
Buddy!
Buddy, where are you?!
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!
Vixen, up, up!
Santa?
Come on, you can do it.
Pull up! Pull up!
Dad! What?
Michael, where you going?
Michael!
Santa.
Back off, slick. You'll scare the deer.
Buddy, is that you?
Are you okay?
Boy, am I glad to see you.
The Claus meter suddenly just dropped down to zero.
There's just no Christmas spirit anymore.
And then the strain was too
Much...
The engine broke free of her mounts.
I need an elf's help.
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.
I... I can't do anything right.
Buddy, you're more of an elf than anyone I ever met,
And the only one who I would want
Working on my sleigh tonight.
Really? Really.
Will you fix it for me, buddy?
I'll try. Papa taught me how.
You gotta find it first.
It dropped off the sleigh back over there a ways.
The engine? The engine, yeah.
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!
I'm standing here outside central park
Where it is unclear exactly what has happened.
What we do know is that authorities
Have closed the park
And are in the process of clearing it.
The only thing that people can seem to agree on here
Is that they saw something fall from the sky.
I've got an eyewitness with me
Who claims to have seen the whole thing firsthand.
What did you actually see?
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,
And my daughter actually pointed it out to me.
Oh, your daughter saw it?
Sweetheart, can you tell me
What you saw falling out of the sky?
It was Santa's sleigh!
Santa's sleigh, well, there you have it.
Santa's in Manhattan.
Sorry to interrupt your first big news story, charlotte,
But New York one has just received
Some exclusive amateur news footage
That you just might Anna follow up on.
There seems to be a strange man dressed as an elf
Wandering through central park.
Now, I don't know if this is the kind of hard-hitting news
You're used to covering in buffalo, charlotte,
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,
News is top priority.
What the heck...?
Hey!
You found it. Buddy!
I need to tell you something.
No, no. Buddy, there's something
I have to tell you right now.
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back there, not word.
I know you may be a little, um, um...
Uh, chemically imbalanced,
But you've been right about a lot of things.
I... I don't want you to leave.
You're my son, and I... love you.
Uh, buddy, uh...
What was it you wanted to tell me?
Oh, right. Come with me.
Right. Come on.
I'm herewith another eyewitness
Who has his own version of what happened.
Sir, what did you see?
I think you're great, charlotte.
Uh, I saw something fall from the sky
Right into the middle of central park.
I mean, you're a great news lady.
Thank you.
Could you tell me a bit more?
About what you saw fall from the sky?
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the story,
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.
The thing just dropped in the middle of central park.
It was amazing, and everybody's, like, going crazy.
Dick, uh, according to authorities,
The area has been cleared.
Only the central park rangers now remain in the park.
These forces are highly trained,
But rarely see action.
Some have accused them of being too gung ho
When called into duty,
And their controversial crowd control tactics
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert in '85
Are still under investigation.
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!
Slap it on real quick, we've got to get going.
That ta boy.
So, uh... you're, uh...
Santa Claus. Right.
Would you mind taking this to your firstborn?
Sure.
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's an elf?
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.
Uh, Michael, would you open this hatch for me, please?
That ta boy, thank you.
So, you're really Santa Claus?
You never can tell, kid.
Tell me, Michael,
What do you want for Christmas?
I wanted a skateboard.
Oh, not just skateboard.
Arealhuf board. Looked here.
Looked here...
How do you like them apples?
Go look and see.
Whoa.
What happened?
You made my sleigh fly.
What do you mean?
Well, before the turbine days,
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.
You believed in me. You made my sleigh fly.
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,
Then we can just get some news cameras in here,
And everyone will believe in you,
Then your sleigh will fly, right?
Christmas spirit is about believing, not seeing.
If the whole world saw me, all would be lost.
The paparazzi have been trying to nail me for years.
Hey, look!
It's the central park rangers.
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.
Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael... my list!
You bring that list back right now, you hear me?!
Come on, give me your hat and coat.
Mrs. Claus made them for me.
Hey! Hey, here I am!
Ho ho ho!
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.
So the authorities have not discovered
Any reindeer in the park?
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?
No, no sleigh bells, either.
Elves? Excuse me, please.
None of that, we really just need everyone...
It's him, it's the real Santa!
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody believes in him!
Did you see something in the park?
Everyone out there,
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.
Look, this is his list!
Okay... well, further confirmation
That there has been a Santa sighting tonight.
We have the naughty and nice list.
Lynn Kessler wants a power puff girls play set.
Mark weber wants an electric guitar.
Yes!
Carolyn Reynolds wants a Suzy- talks-a-lot.
Thanks, buddy.
Dirk Lawson wants
A day of pampering at burke
Williams spa.
Stan Tobias wants a power pumper water pistol.
Must be another dirk Lawson.
Dave keckler wants some Nike shocks.
Okay, uh, well, obviously we have
A new development in the story, uh,
A confirmation that Santa must have been sighted
Because we have his book right here. what's your name?
Uh, I'm charlotte den on, New York one.
"D," "D..."
Charlotte den on wants tiffany engagement ring
And for her boyfriend to stop dragging his feet
And commit already.
We've got power!
Charlotte... charlotte?
Hey, turn the cameras back on!
Who told you to say that?
It's the real Santa.
We need to get these cameras back on.
He needs our help!
Hey, Michael, are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
But buddy, he's... he's in the park with Santa,
The sleigh won't fly
'cause there's no Christmas spirit.
Michael! Mom!
Michael! Ohh!
Are you okay? I'm fine.
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer
Is singing loud for all to hear.
Buddy... better get going, get in now!
Santa, I'm not done with the engine yet!
Can't wait!
On, dasher, on, dancer...
I'm not done with the engine!
That's okay.
You get started, I'll catch up!
You know, he wasn't lying.
Merry Christmas.
Santa, I can't...
Stop messing around and get in!
Aah!
Santa, why are they chasing us?!
I put the mon the naughty list,
And they never forgave me.
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why
Santa Clausis coming' to town
Yaah, yaah, yaah!
Up, up, pull up!
Buddy! We need power, we're gonna crash!
He's making a list,
Checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa clausis coming' to town
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Clausis coming to town
Aah!
You can do it!
Come on, dancer.
That's my boy.
Pull, cupid! Aah!
Pull, dasher!
I'm getting too old for this job.
Now!
The engine's gone!
We're toast!
Well, still no sign of Santa,
But some spontaneous Christmas caroling
Has broken out
Right herein front of central park.
Let's have a listen in.
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows if you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
Hey!
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Come on!
Santa claus is coming' to town
Just a little more!
Hal-yah!
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've
Wait... you're not singing.
Yes, I am.
No, you're not. You're just moving your lips.
Santa!
Michael, please, what's the big deal?
Dad.
I'm telling you why
Santa clausis coming to town
Oh! Ha ha ha!
Now, my beauties!
Bye-bye.
Just like the old days!
Charlotte? Charlotte?
Well, I guess we'll never know for sure
What happened this Christmas Eve?
In central park.
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!
Ho ho ho!
And so, with a little help,
Buddy managed to save Christmas.
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
Walter started his own independent publishing company.
His first book was written by a brand new,
Critically acclaimed children's author.
The book was elf...
A, uh, fictional story
About an adopted elf named buddy
Who was raised in the North Pole?
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,
Worked in a shiny mailroom,
And eventually saved Christmas.
"First, I traveled through the seven levels
"Of the candy cane forest,
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly gumdrops,
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."
And as for me, I can't complain.
Buddy comes up to visit from time to time.
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is parson brown
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very sweet of you.
You're welcome, papa.
But you can do the job when you're in town
Hey, Suzie.
Come here, little one.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling?
Papa wants to see you.
Though your nose get a little chilling
Buddy...
We'll frolic and play buddy... buddy...
The Eskimo way, walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is parson brown
He'll say, are you married, we'll say no, man
But you can do the job when you in town, brother
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans
That we made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
I really can't stay
But, baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go 'way
But, baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful, what's your hurry?
And father will be pacing the floor
Listen to that fireplace roar
So, really, I'd better scurry
Beautiful, please don't hurry
Well, maybe just a half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby, don't hold out
Ah, but it's cold outside
I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
I'm lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Oh, your lips look delicious
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a pleasure before
I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your comb
It's up to your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay
Get rid of that hold out
Ah, but it's cold
Outside
Hah!
Aah! Unh!
[grunting]
Aah!
Oof!
I don't need any help.
You're welcome.
Aah!
Unh!
Yaa!
Aah!
[screaming]
Come on!
He can wait.
Woman: Then fire them.
In fact, get rid of the whole division.
I don't care what Luthor would have done.
I'm in charge now, and if you can't accept that, I'll...
Mercy.
[groaning]
Help me.
I'm... I'm...
Sick?
Dying?
And you couldn't do it somewhere else?
After all I've done for you.
You mean letting me, a lowly chauffeur, run your company while you were away?
Oh, was I flattered.
But then I realized there was no one else you could trust to give it back...
Only me, your loyal dog.
Well, let me tell you something.
This dog took LexCorp out of the hole you dug and brought up the stock 38% all on her own.
So if you think I'm ever gonna let you...
Unh!
[gasping]
Looks like there's some life in the old suit after all.
Now where's professor Ivo?
[gasping]
I... I fired him.
You what?
He was one of our best scientists.
How could you do that?
Well?
I... I was trying to save money.
He's probably at his place in mountain view.
Unh!
Good girl.
[breathing heavily]
[screaming]
Superman: G.L.'s already patrolling the city, and Hawkgirl will join him as soon as we're done here.
Batman and I are going to follow up some leads, but I just don't know if it'll be enough.
So... A psychic sweep.
Of the whole city.
Is it possible?
I've never tried anything like that before.
Once the gate is opened, it might not be so easy to close.
I realize it's a lot to ask, but Luthor...
I know.
He must be stopped.
Smart guy.
Ivo, it's Luthor.
You've got to help me.
Will you get up? I'm d...
[gasp]
Looks like the cigarettes finally got you...
And maybe me, too.
[gasp]
Well, what are you waiting for?
It's not like I won't be dead soon enough, anyway.
Woman, thinking: I want him to love me...
But I don't think he even likes me.
Man: I wish she'd wear some vinyl.
Different woman: I smell bad.
I just know it.
20 showers a day.
I still can't get rid of it.
Man: Bald?
How could anyone say I'm bald?
I just have a high forehead.
Different man: I should ask her out,
but what would she want with me?
But I should try, though.
Woman: Rotten kids.
They don't appreciate me.
Man: I just need a roof over my head.
That's all...
And a drink. Yeah.
Woman: It's funny.
[all talking at once]
[voices stop]
[breathing heavily]
[all talking at once]
Man: I'll sue the pants off him!
Woman: I'll take him for everything he's got!
Man: She thinks she's so special.
Woman: What do I have to tell anyone?
Man: Looks like a gorilla.
[all talking at once]
[groaning]
Aargh!
A little help here.
When will professor come back?
Never.
He has to.
You miss him.
So do I.
He was one of my best friends.
He was?
Almost like a brother, and he would have wanted me to look after you if anything ever happened to him.
So... You're going to take care of me now?
Mm-hmm.
But you're going to have to take care of me, too.
Otherwise, I'll go to sleep and never wake up again.
Thank you.
Now, there's one other thing I need...
Fuel.
[buzzer]
Stay back, freak.
Aah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Whoa! Whoa!
Hold it, big boy.
Yah!
Now, what did you want this for?
Hah!
Didn't figure on that one, did you?
Aah! Unh!
Mmm.
Aah!
[door opens]
[door closes]
Well, it looks like Ivo was right on the money.
His duplication program seems to be working rather well.
I assume you ran into Hawkgirl?
Girl with wings. Yes.
And seeing that you were able to get away with this,
I take it she didn't fare too well.
Is she still alive?
Yes.
Aww.
What's wrong?
Let me tell you a story.
It's about a young man whose dream was to build a great empire.
He succeeded.
Then he lost it all because of 7 very bad people...
Hawkgirl and her friends...
The Justice League.
That young man was me, of course, and now I have another dream.
It's to take back control of that empire.
And then, when the time comes,
I want to hand it down to someone who will continue my work...
The son I never had.
But none of that can happen until you give the Justice League what they deserve.
Mercy: He's the most deeply twisted man
I've ever met.
Of course I'll help you.
Good. If he contacts you, let us know.
You have my word.
He hasn't already contacted you, has he?
Don't you think I would have told you?
The two of you were very... Close.
I'm a different person now.
Right.
She was a little too cooperative, wasn't she?
You're learning.
I wouldn't mind hearing what she's really thinking.
[all talking at once]
Superman on radio:
J'onn? Any luck yet?
No.
Where are you?
I can't talk now.
Are you all right?
Leave me alone!
Grr!
It was some kind of android.
It had wings built into it and a mace, too.
Scary, huh?
Sounds like whoever made it had you in mind.
Yeah. It even acted like me.
Now, that's scary.
The android...
It's about 10 feet tall, gray skin?
How'd you know?
Unh!
Aah!
Unh!
Aah!
Ohh!
[sirens]
Aah!
You forgot to mention he's as strong as I am.
Hawkgirl: He wasn't like that before.
Aah! Aah!
Unh!
Ooh!
Unh! Unh!
Aah!
Unh!
[groans]
Unh!
Hah!
Didn't figure on that one, did you?
Hah!
Unh!
Unh!
[telephone ringing]
Ohh!
Ohh...
[grunting]
Another business call?
She fired Ivo months ago, and he's an M.D., something Luthor should be needing right about now.
One more thing...
Ivo's specialty is nanotechnology.
Green Lantern: Batman, it's Lantern.
We've found Hawkgirl's robot.
Where are you?
Don't even think about it.
Somehow this thing's copying all our powers just by looking at us.
We can't just stay here.
That's exactly what you're gonna do.
You come here, and all you'll do is make him even stronger.
Aah!
Lantern!
Unh!
Unh!
Hera help us!
She'd better.
No one else can now.
The Family Man - 25 fps
This will be the final boarding call for flight 2... to London, Heathrow.
Okay.
I'm not even gonna say it, Kate.
Then it'll be like I never left.
Okay?
Wait.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
About the plane?
You think it's gonna crash?
Don't say that.
No. Look, I know that we've talked about this a thousand times, and we agreed that going to
London was the right thing to do.
But in my heart... this feels wrong.
- Don't go, Jack.
- You mean don't go at all?
Well, what... what about my internship?
Believe me, I know... I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you.
- For us, Kate.
- Right, for us.
But I'm afraid that if you get on that plane... Look.
We're at the airport. Nobody ever thinks clearly at the airport.
So we should just trust the decision we already made.
You've been accepted to one of the best law schools in the country.
I've got this internship at Barclay's
Bank. We have a great plan, honey.
You wanna do something great, Jack?
Let's flush the plan. Let's start our lives right now, today.
I mean, I have no idea what this life is gonna look like, but I know that it has the both of us in it, and I choose us.
The plan doesn't make us great, Jack.
What we have together, that's what makes us great.
- I love you, Kate.
- I love you too. I do.
And one year in London is not gonna change that.
A hundred years couldn't change that.
Experts are predicting a mild rally in the bond market.
- Last night was incredible.
- Huh?
I said, last night was great.
You are an amazing lover.
Thanks.
You're not bad yourself.
- I wanna see you again.
- I'd like that too.
- Tonight.
- It's Christmas eve, Jack.
So? I'll pour eggnog over you.
I have to go visit my parents out in Jersey.
Jersey? Do you have any idea what the traffic's gonna be like?
That's why I'm taking the train.
It was nice meeting you, Jack.

Mrs. Peterson.
Hello, Jack.
You don't have to stop singing on my account. Oh, it's because I'm shy, Betty.
So, when are you gonna leave that old corpse, Mr. Peterson, and run away with me?
You know you could never satisfy me the way he does.
Ah.
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Campbell.
How'd you make out this year, Tony?
About four grand, and a bottle of 25-year-old Scotch from 9D.
I'm putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Good, but just until the deutsche mark turns.
- Thank you, Mr. Campbell.
- All right.
- Good morning, Joe.
- Merry Christmas, sir.
Campbell wants these available. Thanks, Adelle.
Better you than me.
If Med Tech shares fall any lower than 43, we're in trouble with the stock valuations.
So for God's sake, please watch what you say to your institutional customers.
We still have almost a full day of trading before zero hour, and I don't want any trouble.
A penny for your thoughts, Alan.
Hmm? Oh, God, I'm sorry.
Jack, I was thinking about, you know, Dee and the kids.
I promised I'd be home for dinner. It's Christmas eve, Jack.
Oh, is that tonight?
You think I like being here on Christmas eve, Alan?
No. Well, maybe.
Okay.
Okay, maybe I do have a touch of tunnel vision this holiday season.
But in two days we're going to announce... one of the largest mergers in U.S. corporate history.
When a deal like this turns up, you get on it and you ride it till it's over.
You don't ask it for a vacation.
December 26. After that there'll be so much money floating around here, it'll be like Christmas every day.
December 26, people. If you'd like to celebrate that day, you all have my blessing.
- You're right. I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry. I want you to be excited.
I want my gift to you to be the first gift you open this year. You know why?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes.
You're right.
I'm focused. I'm there.
Good man. Everybody, turn to page 12 in your prospectus.
You have six messages. Two of them are imperative. Whoa. I'm going home.
I'm not even here now. Good night.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
It's only 8:30. I'm disappointed.
Got some last-minute shopping to do?
You too? This holiday's about giving. I'm giving everything I've got to this deal.
- So in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anybody.
- You're my role model, Jack.
- Oh, and Oxford called.
- Ooh, my suits are ready.
Care for a Lifesaver?
- No, thank you.
- Help yourself.
Kate Reynolds. Her assistant said you could reach her at home after 8:00.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.
- I almost married her.
- You?
- Married?
- Almost married.
- And almost a broker at E.F. Hutton.
- Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.
We're standing at the airport saying good-bye, and she asked me to stay.
So you left her.
- Wasn't easy.
- Oh, stop it. I'm getting all weepy.
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
And look where it took ya. I'm gonna get this gal on the phone.
Nope. You almost married this woman.
You're not even curious why she called?
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.
Lonely Christmas eve. Call the one that got away. Why call her back and mislead her?
This happened a very, very long time ago.
8:35 on Christmas eve.
Jack Campbell still at his desk.
Now there's a Hallmark moment for you.
Peter, I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
Well, you know what?
God love you for that.
Got a call from Terry Haight.
Bob Thomas is nervous.
That'll happen when you're about to spend $130 billion on some aspirin.
Somebody's gotta nurse him through this.
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
- I need you, tiger.
- Where is he?
- Aspen.
- Call Aunt Irma and tell her I won't be able to make it.
You're a credit to capitalism, Jack.
Hey, Peter, let me ask you a question.
An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas eve.
- What do you do?
- You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
- Yeah.
- Leave it in the past.
Old flames are like old tax returns... put 'em in the file cabinet for three years, and then you cut 'em loose.
I'll leave from my office tomorrow in the afternoon.
Call the group. Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
That'll be a nice little holiday treat.
- Good night, Frank.
- Hey, Mr. Campbell.
Why didn't you call down?
I would have had Joe get your ride.
I'm thinking I'll walk tonight.
It's a nice night for it.
I'll send your car home for you. That'll be fine.
- And Merry Christmas to you, sir.
- To you too.
- Eggnog?
- Yeah, dairy case. Five dollar.
Okay.
Hey, yo. Y'all do the lotto here, right? Y'all do the lotto here?
Yeah. Cool. 'Cause I got a winner, baby. I got a winner.
Certified, good as gold. I know lotto keep a lot of brothers down, but not Cash Money.
Don't do me none, son,
'cause I'd be like...
Bang on the lottery! You know what I mean? It's all good.
Relax, son. Relax. I got you four numbers. Check it. Bust it.
That's a winner, son.
$238, B.
Cheddar coming.
- Give me my money.
- I'm sorry. Your ticket bad. You draw in the lines.
- What are you talking about, B.?
- You draw in the lines with a pencil.
I know about this.
- Yo, buster, check the ticket, son.
- No, you get out.
Yo, you ain't even looked at the ticket.
You looking at me, son. Check the ticket.
You get out now! You take the ticket somewhere else!
Next customer in line!
You get out or I call 9-1-1.
Oh, my God!
Check the ticket, stupid.
Look at the ticket. Shit, now
I'm gonna make you call God.
That's my word. You best check that ticket, fool! Let me see the ticket.
Was I talking to you?
Maybe I'll buy it from you.
You know, make a little business deal.
Stupid-ass white boy in $2,000 suit gets capped trying to be a hero. News at 11:00.
That's what you wanna see? You wanna see
Cash up in here? You want me to set it, son?
Do you wanna die?
Do you want to die?
No.
Look, I'm talking about a business deal.
Okay? I buy the ticket from you for $200.
I take it to a store where the guy behind the counter doesn't have a death wish.
I just made myself a quick $38.
Like I said, it's... it's just a business deal.
All right. Yeah.
All right.
You blew it, B.
You blew it.
The ticket was real.
Damn, you had your chance too.
Come on, Jack.
Let's get out of here.
How'd you know my name was Jack?
I call all you guys Jack.
Here. Nice doing business with ya.
Hey. Hey, um...
What do you want to carry that gun around for anyway?
You're just gonna wind up doing something you regret.
You're talking to the wrong person about regrets, Jack.
I mean, there must be programs out there and, um, opportunities.
Wait a minute. Are you actually trying to save me?
This is bananas.
This man thinks
I need to be saved, yo!
Well, everybody needs something.
Yeah? Well, what do you need, Jack?
- Me?
- You just said, everybody needs something.
I got everything I need.
Wow. It must be great being you.
I'm not saying that you'd be able to do it without some hard work, some honest hard work, and possibly some medicine.
You know, I'm gonna really enjoy this.
You just remember that you did this, Jack, okay?
You brought this on yourself.
Merry Christmas.
Mmm, ten more minutes, Jack.
It's Christmas.
# Jingle bells Santa smells
Rudolph laid an egg #
Never mind.
- Who's here?
- Rise and shine.
Don't you think we should open some presents?
- I think you should give Mama five more minutes in bed.
- Come on, Dad. Get up.
- Can we do that?
- Yea! It's Christmas!
- It's Christmas!
- Look, your sister's jumping on the bed.
What is this dog doing on the bed?
He needs to get off the bed.
- Did Santa come?
- I don't know. We'll have to go see.
- Let's go see the presents.
- You wanna get some presents?
Mommy just needs to wake up.
Jack. Strong coffee.
Oh, Jack.
Merry Christmas, dear.
Lorraine. Ed.
Hey, Jack, you old bird dog.
Merry Christmas to ya.
Talk to him. One day a year away from the Ponderosa.
- I don't think that's asking too much.
- This is who I am.
Tell her, Jack, for God's sake. You're the only one around here that gets me.
- I need some eggnog.
- 'Course you do, sweet thing.
It's almost 8:00 in the morning.
- Excuse me.
- Where you going, Jack?
- Josh, Annie, giddyup!
- Where's my car? Where's my Ferrari?
- What?
- Where's my Ferrari?
What the hell are you talking... What's he talking about? You got a Ferrari?
Let me borrow your car and then
I promise I'll have it returned.
My Caddy?
Drive your own damn car.
Oh, just let him borrow your precious Cadillac, for God sakes.
There's a perfectly good minivan sitting out there in the driveway. Here.
What the hell's wrong with him anyway?
- Tony, thank God!
- Sorry, pal. Entrance is for residents and guests only.
What? What are you talking about?
Jack Campbell, penthouse "C."
What's the matter with you?
Mrs. Peterson, I think there's something wrong with our man Tony here.
Who is this man?
Oh, come on. What is going on with you two this morning?
Is this like a, uh... a Christmas joke?
"Who is this man?" Well, we're on the co-op board together, Betty.
And we fought side by side for garbage disposals.
And every morning we exchange quasi-sexual witty banter. Ok?
Shall I call the cops?
I'm gonna call the cops.
No, I'm gonna call the cops!
You're scaring me.
- No, no, no, no.
- Thank you for not calling the cops.
Now, I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna get some sleep. Then I'll be fine.
Sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige isn't dead. Not yet anyway.
Let's, um... Let's get you some help. Surely there's a shelter somewhere in this city.
A shelter?
Hey, hey, are you smacked out of your head?
I'm the richest man in this building!
I've got twice the square footage you have!
- And I'm going upstairs.
- Take a walk, pal.
Oh, not cool.
Not cool!
You wanna get cute?
Get cute.
I'm gonna go to my office. I'm gonna file a complaint to the manager of the building.
I'm gonna have you fired, Tony. And, Mrs.
Peterson, you're on notice with the co-op board!
So you better just stop whatever this is that you're doing!
Oh, come on!
Frank, you won't believe what's been happening to me. Is Adelle here yet?
- Hold it right there.
- Where's Mintz?
The building is closed, pal.
You have to come back tomorrow.
Frank, why do I feel the need to remind you that I'm Jack Campbell, President?
I don't care who you are. It's Christmas, and like I told you, the building is closed.
I don't think you heard me correctly.
I'm Jack Campbell.
Jack Campbell!
President!
Have a nice holiday, man.
- That's my car!
- Hi, Jack.
- You stole my car.
- I know this whole thing is really bizarre to you... and you're feeling quite shocked, but just hop in.
I'll explain everything to you, okay?
Come on.
Come on.
You're probably gonna wanna buckle up, Jack. This thing moves.
- What's happening to me?
- Breathe into the bag, Jack.
This kind of thing makes a lot of guys have to throw up. I seen it happen before.
So if you feel the urge, you roll down the window and do it out there.
Try not to get so worked up, Jack.
After all, you brought this on yourself.
Brought what on myself?
I didn't do anything!
"I got everything I need."
That sound familiar?
You mean 'cause you thought I was cocky, I'm now on a permanent acid trip?
Bag yourself, Jack.
Oh, my God! Ah!
The way you intervened in that store last night, you did a good thing there, Jack.
I mean, it was incredibly impressive all the way across the board... to the upper echelons of the organization.
Please just tell me what's happening to me in plain English... without the mumbo-jumbo.
- This is a glimpse, Jack.
- A glimpse?
A glimpse of what?
You're gonna have to figure that out for yourself and you got plenty of time.
- How much time?
- As much time as it takes, which in your case is probably gonna be considerable.
Okay, look, look. I-I-I just want my life back, okay?
Now, what's it gonna take?
You wanna talk turkey?
Let's talk turkey.
How much money?
- It doesn't work like that, and I can't tell you why.
- Why not?
Because you have to figure this thing out for yourself.
Are you listening to me? Figure it out, figure it out. Figure out what?
- Let it come to you, man.
- I don't have time for this right now.
- I'm in the middle of a deal.
- Well, you're working on a new deal now, baby.
What's this?
Open it.
What is it, some kind of a signal?
Will you come whenever I ring it?
Now you gotta get out of the car, Jack.
But what do I do? I'm sorry. I can't spend any more time with you.
- I got some other business I gotta take care of.
- No, y-y-you did this to me.
You can't just leave me like this.
Okay. Look, you wanna get some air?
Let's get outside, get some air.
We'll walk and I'll explain everything to you, okay?
- Thanks, man.
- Sure.
Excuse me. Do you know where Merrison Street is?
Jeannie.
- I found Jack.
- Oh, there you are, stranger.
Where you been?
You look terrible.
Truth is, I expected you.
Kate called and asked if I knew where you were, so...
Oh, I put the Barcalounger in the center of the room. It's throwing everybody off.
What do you think?
It's a great room.
Great room.
You and me, buddy, we know how to live, huh?
Come on.
Come on, Jack.
Come on...
Come on, buddy.
Take your seat.
Are you okay?
I mean, you take off Christmas morning and you don't tell anyone where you're going.
- We're friends?
- Talk to me.
I'm having kind of a bad day.
You know, I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holiday.
What am I saying that for?
You don't wanna hear that. Come on.
Is it...
Is it trouble at work?
I... I don't think so.
Well, it's not Kate, is it?
You see, huh? It's like we're inside each other's heads.
Kate's my wife.
Just keep saying it over and over again,
Jack, like a mantra. Keep saying it.
Look, you know, you fit the profile exactly... in your 30s, house, kids, financial responsibilities.
You start thinking this isn't the life I dreamt about.
Where's the romance, you know?
Where's the joie de vivre?
Suddenly every lingerie ad in the Newark Star-Ledger... represents a life that you can't have.
It's just two kids, right?
Come on. Come on.
All right, sometimes it feels like you gave up the whole world. I know that.
But look what you got.
Look at that: four bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, a partially finished basement.
And good kids.
Look. You know what?
You probably don't wanna hear this right now.
But remember last summer when I almost had that thing with Arnie, Jr. 's speech therapist?
You remember what you said to me?
You said, "Don't screw up the best thing in your life... just because you're a little unsure about who you are."
Okay?
Go get 'em, tiger.
Could you hold on a second?
Um, never mind because... because he just walked in.
Thank you. Thank you.
Do you... have any idea what you put us through today?
You walk out of here at 7:30 in the morning.
You don't tell me where you're going, or even that you're going.
And I don't see you till hours later?
I called all of our friends. I had the state troopers looking for you.
I was on the phone with the hospital, for God's sakes.
What kind of man leaves his family on Christmas morning without a word about where he's going?
- What kind of a man does that, Jack?
- I don't know.
Could you... Could you please stop yelling at me?
- Where were you?
- I was in the city.
The city?
New York City?
- Yeah.
- Why?
- Because that's where I live.
- Don't start, Jack. Don't.
Look, you don't understand.
I... I... I woke up this morning here.
And this is very strange because... this isn't my house.
And those aren't my kids.
I'm not Dad.
I- I-I'm not a dad.
You're not my wife.
You know what, Jack.
It's not funny this time... because I am really mad.
I mean, really mad.
I mean it.
I don't even...
What...
What's that?
I like it.
Thanks, Dad.
That's mine. Hey,
I need that back.
She took my bell.
You missed the whole thing... the pancakes and the presents.
You spent six hours putting that bike together for Annie, and then you didn't even get to see the look on her face when she opened it.
You missed Christmas, Jack.
I'm sorry.
You know, we don't even have enough time for this.
And at least you're okay.
I'm okay, we're okay.
But you've gotta get dressed for the
Thompson party. And you are not wearing that.
I don't care how hilarious you think it is.
Party? No, I'm not going to a party.
You look forward to this party all year. What is it with you today?
Believe me, Kate. I really don't think that going to a party... is the right move for me at the present time.
Okay, fine. You know what? Then you just do whatever you wanna do.
- What are you doing?
- Telling my mother she doesn't have to stay with the kids.
- Why not?
- Because you'll be here.
I'll be ready in ten minutes.
This is... This is just subpar.
# Oh, the weather outside is frightful #
Lance, here you go.
Excuse me.
# Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow #
# It doesn't show signs of stopping ##
- Kate. Jack.
- Evelyn.
Come in. Hey, everybody,
Kate and Jack are here.
- Hey!
- Jeannie.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
Jack, Merry Christmas.
Whoops.
Here.
- So, like the dress?
- Oh, it's lovely.
I thought I saw you notice it at the kids' recital.
It's lovely.
It's lovely.
There he is.
- Hey, Jack. Happy holidays, man.
- Yeah.
Jack, come on over.
Hey, Jack.
Cheers, baby.
- You guys see Van Horn last night?
- Thirty-two points.
- That kid's gonna take the Nets to the championship.
- The Nets? Are you kidding?
They suck.
But they're due.
They're certainly due.
So, tomorrow's the big day, Jackie.
Okay. Why?
My triple bypass.
I'm going under the knife tomorrow. I told you that, right?
- Triple bypass.
- Yeah.
You really think you should be eating all that?
Figure I'm going in for a cleaning tomorrow.
Might as well load up on the fried stuff tonight, right?
That's good thinking, Bill.
Have another drink.
Some fried pork, mashed potatoes.
He'll be dead by morning.
- How 'bout a cigar, Jack?
- Oh, no, thank you. I'm cutting down.
- Come on. They're American made, not Cuban.
- Oh, really?
Come on.
- Very nice.
- I thought you'd like 'em.
Superb.
- How 'bout you, Arnie?
- I'm all right. Thanks.
- Finger food?
- No, thank you. I'm fine.
Come on. Soon as I put 'em down, you're gonna grab a couple.
- You always do.
- No, I'm okay.
Let me. They will melt in your mouth.
Yeah.
- Good?
- Fabulous.
At the end of this whole thing, she made me this hand-embroidered sweater.
- It was really lovely.
- How nice.
So I'm slipping it on and I notice that she's misspelled the word "lawyers."
I spent the entire day walking around... with a sweater that said,
"Nonprofit layers do it for free."
So you're a lawyer?
A nonprofit lawyer?
Probono.
- You don't get paid at all? Nobody makes a dime?
- Jack?
"Anyhoo..."
I better go wake my mom.
There you go.
Uh, I don't think so.
- She's your dog, Jack.
- No, she's not.
You're right.
She's the kids' dog.
Maybe we should go wake Josh and make him walk her.
If you take a dump sometime in this century, then we could go home where it's warm.
If I can even remember how to get home.
You remember, don't you, girl?
Hello?
# Am I hard enough
Am I rough enough #
# Am I rich enough #
Hello?
# I'm not too blind #
# To see #
- Hey!
- What?
Oh. That baby's crying.
And?
Don't give me that look, Jack.
Tuesday's your day and you know it.
And listen, try and get Josh to day care on time, okay?
# You're a pretty, pretty pretty, pretty #
# Such a pretty girl ##
All right.
Holy Mother of God!
You're not really my dad, are you?
No, I'm not.
I work on Wall Street, you know, with the big buildings.
I live in an apartment with a doorman.
And I can buy almost anything I want.
This isn't my life.
It's just a glimpse.
Where's my real dad?
I don't know.
But don't worry.
He loves you, and I'm sure he'll be back very soon.
What are you doing?
They did a pretty good job.
Who did?
The aliens in the mother ship.
You look just like him.
Oh, thanks.
Slightly better looking though, right?
Oh, no, you're not gonna start crying, are you?
I don't think I could really deal with that right now.
Do you like kids?
On a case by case basis.
Do you know how to make chocolate milk?
I... I think I could figure it out.
Promise you won't kidnap me and my brother... and plant stuff in our brains?
Sure.
Welcome to Earth.
# We're going to the zoo zoo, zoo #
# Look at all the crocodiles swimming in the... ##
This is where babies go when their parents are at work.
Check.
Just push the red button.
Okay.
Do I get a receipt or something?
I have winter camping till 4:00 and ballet class until 5:30.
- 5:30. Okay.
- And try not to be late...
- 'cause kids don't like to be the last one picked up.
- Got it. Good tip.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hey, Annie. Where do I go now?
- Big Ed's.
Big Ed's Tires?
Why?
- 'Cause you work there.
- You mean I sell tires.
That's what I do.
I'm a tire salesman.
Good Lord!
- Morning, Jack.
- Hi.
- Good morning, Jack.
- Hi.
Hey, Jack.
Jack, my boy.
Hey, guess who I played bridge with two nights ago.
Hell, you'll never guess.
One Sydney Potter. That's Sydney
Potter, C.E.O., Buy Rite Transport.
Only the third biggest trucking outfit in the state.
"Anyhoo," he's looking for a new parts supplier.
We can handle volume like that, now can't we, Jack?
I'm gonna have to get back to you on that, Ed.
Right on.
Right on.
Excuse me. Uh, do I... do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
Sure, Jack.
Where is it?
Oh, uh, it's... it's right back... right back there.
Thank you.
Oh, no.
You must've needed this every day.
What are you smiling about?
Eighty-eight?
I was in London in 1988.
You never went to London.
Jack, you're needed in mag wheels. Customer waiting.
I was the number one junior sales associate for E.F. Hutton in 1988.
- Did you know that?
- Uh, no. No, I didn't.
That's great.
That's the kind of thing you could really build on, you know?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- I mean, sales has always been a feeder for M&A. Always.
Uh-huh.
Well, look, here we are.
The mag wheels. Mag wheels.
Oh. So.
Hey, Jack, um, are you sure you're okay?
Well, I'm just a little confused right now about why I work here.
Uh...
I just started here last Tuesday, so...
The closing tip was a mildly bullish plus-76.
Much of the market's action today was fueled by the latest round of merger mania... to hit Wall Street... when Global Health Systems and Med Tech
Pharmaceutical announced their intentions... to join forces in a massive
$122 billion stock swap deal, the largest ever in the health care industry.
When asked about the possible anti-competitive implications,
Global chairman Bob Thomas referred reporters... to P.K. Lassiter & Company president
Alan Mintz, the architect behind the deal.
- That's my deal!
- Ironically, Mintz first met Thomas at a Lamaze class.
- What?
- While coaching their pregnant wives, Mintz and Thomas... struck up a dialog, and two months later, the deal with Med Tech was born.
He wasn't the architect!
I'm the architect!
Labor department officials announced today that 275,000 new jobs have been created.
The kids are asleep.
The kids, hon.
Honey.
Sweetheart, I said the kids are asleep.
That's just great. Those little monkeys can be a real handful.
Hey, I was watching that.
Not tonight.
Please leave my socks alone.
Wait.
- You want me.
- That is the general idea, yeah.
Oh, well, maybe we should grab a bottle of wine first.
Kind of break the ice.
Yeah, that's very funny.
Look, it's 10:30.
By 11:00 you're gonna be snoring like a monster, but that's very sweet.
I'll remember that for next time.
Whatever you say... honey.
Yeah.
Oh, God, you're beautiful.
Thanks, Jack.
No, I'm serious.
You're really stunning.
This is good stuff.
I want you to keep this up.
You were always a very pretty girl in college. There's no question about that.
But this...
You've really grown into a beautiful woman.
How can you do that?
What?
Look at me like you haven't seen me every day for the last 13 years.
Okay, wait. Don't move.
Don't look.
Stay right there.
I got something.
# The world was on fire #
# No one could save me but you #
Good night, sweetheart.
# Strange what desire #
# Will make foolish people do ##
Okay, we're almost out of here.
Mary Janes, Mommy.
You promised.
That's right. I did promise. Okay. All right.
We're gonna stop at the kids' shoe department first, and then I gotta pick up my watch from the battery store.
Then I'm gonna go to the linen store.
Why don't we go to all the stores?
Every single store in this god forsaken shopping mall.
Wouldn't that be exciting?
You know what?
Why don't I take the kids, and you just stay here and hang out in the men's department?
Come on, hon.
It's perfect for your frame.
Why don't you try it on?
I might want to take an inch out of the back. Okay.
Lengthen the sleeve.
You look amazing in that suit.
I mean, really... wow!
Off the charts, great.
It's an unbelievable thing.
Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.
I'm gonna buy it.
It's $2,400.
Are you out of your mind?
Come on, let's go.
- She got those shoes.
- Those shoes were $25.
Come on.
Take it off, all right?
We'll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
Daddy's a crazy guy.
No.
No.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
- Excuse me?
- I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva.
I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail.
Retail, Kate.
I pick the kids up, walk the dog, which, by the way, carries the added bonus... of carting away her monstrous crap.
I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I'm lucky.
Then everything starts all over again.
So what's in it for me?
Wh-Where are my Mary Janes?
You know, it's sad to hear that your life is such a disappointment to you.
I can't believe it isn't a disappointment to you!
Jesus, Kate, I could have been a thousand times the man I became.
I could have been one of the richest... Forbes...
How could you do this to me? How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?
Really, I want to know.
Who are you?
All right, look.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I was such a saint before... and I'm such a prick now!
But maybe I'm just not... the same guy that I was when we got married.
You know what?
Maybe you're not.
Because the Jack Campbell I married would not need a $2,400 suit... to feel better about his life.
But I'm telling you, if that's what it's gonna take, then buy it.
Jesus! We'll take the money out of the kids' college fund.
Forget it.
We'll get a funnel cake.
It'll be the highlight of my week.
Listen, I'm really sorry about that back in the store.
I don't want to fight with you.
I just sometimes wonder how we ended up here, you know.
I mean, back in college, d-did you see us here?
Life has thrown us a few surprises. I'll give you that.
It really has, hasn't it?
Yeah. So, if you had to, what would you say was the biggest surprise?
Just out of curiosity.
I'm just asking.
- Well, Annie, for one.
- Surprise, we're pregnant.
Yeah, that must have been.
I mean, that... that was.
That was a very unexpected moment.
- What are you gonna do?
- I think it turned out all right, don't you?
Yeah.
I really like Annie.
Well, good, Jack.
Maybe we'll keep her.
No, I love her.
I love Annie.
I'm just...
We had a lot of good times, didn't we?
Do you remember the place on
Charles Street where we used to go?
Charles Street?
In the village?
When we were living in Greenwich Village.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Great times. Great place.
Why did we ever leave?
You can't really raise a kid in an apartment in the village.
Then there was the whole trek out to the hospital. That didn't help either.
You were great. I mean, surviving the heart attack was one thing.
- You had a heart attack?
- Hey, Jack, stop that.
'Cause I am...
I'm still mad at you.
Who knows what would have happened if you hadn't stepped in at the store?
That's why I work for Big Ed.
That's why I work for Big Ed. Yeah.
So we had a baby,
Big Ed had a heart attack.
Bought that house, and I've been working for him ever since.
Sayonara, Wall Street.
Our life in a nutshell.
If you want to look at it that way.
How would you look at it?
A great success story.
What do you say, Jack? Show 'em how to do it, baby. Jack, we need a strike.
- Damn!
- Jesus, Jack. What are you doing?
It's a league match. Where's your follow through? Where's your stance?
You know what?
I'm doing the best I can.
It's okay, Jack.
Why am I so competitive all the time?
You can still pick up that spare. Crack 'em, Jack!
Here we go.
Hurt 'em.
You're Jack Campbell.
You're better than the sport.
You shot the rapids in Kanai.
You ran with the bulls in Pamplona.
You've jumped out of an airplane over the Mojave Desert, for Christ's sake.
You can do this.
You can do this.
Yes! Victorious!
Huh? All right!
High five!
- You're up.
- Go get 'em.
Hi, Jack.
- Evelyn, right?
- Very funny.
I saw you on lane 20.
You got the flu or something?
Something like that, yeah.
Need a nurse?
Are you a nurse?
If that's what you want.
Hey, wait a minute.
Um, don't run away.
Are we...
Are we what, Jack?
Well...
Is there something going on between us?
Are we finally being honest?
It would help me if we were.
Okay. You're right.
We've been dancing around this for years.
Here goes.
When I get dressed for a party, and I know you're gonna be there, let's just say I don't go strapless because my husband likes it.
I've got six sets of snow tires piled up in my garage, and I won't even drive in the snow.
And our kids just happen to be... in the same ballet class every year.
So, if you're asking whether
I'd like it to be more, the answer's yes.
Kate would never have to know.
Do I have your number?
Steve's out of town with the kids this weekend.
Why don't you just stop by?
Hey, Jack.
You're all flushed.
I feel good. Guess that
71 took a lot out of you.
No. I just saw
Evelyn Thompson.
She's relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
- She said that?
- Pretty much.
What is it about you?
So... if you would write her exact address down there.
You have a pen? Please. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on a second.
You're not actually thinking about cheating on Kate?
Well, it wouldn't really be cheating, Arnie.
It's complicated.
Maybe I haven't been as good a consigliere as you've been to me, but hear me out on this.
A little flirtation is harmless, but you're dealing with fire here, man.
The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.
You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account... forever, all right?
Arnie, I don't want your head to explode, but I'm telling you, those rules don't apply to me.
I-I'm not even...
I'm not talking about rules.
I'm talking about...
Y-You're...
There isn't a guy in Union County who wouldn't give his left nut... to be with Kate, all right?
She's amazing, and you're gonna fuck it up.
Just think about that, all right?
Hey, honey.
How was the game?
Long and boring and generally pretty sad.
Arnie seemed to enjoy it.
Sort of.
Hey, where's that chocolate cake?
- Do you mean this chocolate cake?
- That's my piece.
I was saving it because I got nauseated by that precooked mini-mall rotisserie chicken.
Mmm. Mmm.
It's good.
Give me that cake.
No way.
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.
It's too important to me.
I want that cake!
- You want this cake?
- I want it.
Thank you.
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, God!
Are the kids asleep?
- Say it to me, Jack.
- What?
You know what I like to hear.
I know, baby. I know what you like to hear.
Tell me.
Tell me, tell me.
You're a bad girl, baby.
You make me so hot.
What?
Not it?
Nice, Jack.
- What?
- Sweeping me off my feet.
You make me hot.
What do you say, everyone?
- This is a little birthday party for Katie.
- Happy birthday, Katie.
Good to see you kids still together. Hello, kids.
Happy birthday. Very exciting.
Evelyn, you look tremendous.
- Thank you.
- Look what happens when I do that.
- Jack? The man.
- Yes. Yes.
Do you have anything to say to your lovely wife on the day of her birth?
- You happy she was born?
- Hey, hey! Today's your birthday?
- That's funny, Jack.
- You know what?
Wow, your birthday.
It's... You're my wife.
You are my wife.
Today is your birthday.
Well, actually, I do have one thing that I want to say to you.
And God,
I hope you like it.
Bill?
- Oh, no.
- Yes. You hit it, Bill.
You wore that shirt last year, by the way. Just so you know.
# Many guys have come to you #
- # With a line that wasn't true #
- Oh!
# And you passed them by #
# Passed them by #
# Now you're in the centering and their lines don't mean a thing #
# Why don't you let me try #
# Let me try #
# Now, I don't wear a diamond ring #
# I don't even have a song to sing #
# All I know is la-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la #
# Means I love you #
# La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la #
# Means I love you #
Ahh!
Sweet.
# The things I am saying are true-ooh-ooh #
# And the way
I explain it to you #
- Get down, Jack.
# Yes, to you #
# Listen to me
La-la-la-la #
# La-la-la-la-la means #
# I love you #
# Ohh #
# La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la #
# Means I love you ##
Happy birthday, sweetheart.
Yeah.
Yeah, Jack!
There's love in the air.
He loves her.
It's official. There's love.
Mmm. Come on, it's time to get up, honey.
Go, go.
Good morning, Joshie.
Happy anniversary, honey.
Now, listen, before you do whatever crazy stunt you've got planned,
I want you to open mine first.
Maybe I should wait.
No! Come on! Come on, come on, come on. Open it.
Zeena?
I found it at an outlet store.
Look, I know it's a knock off, but
I think it's gonna look great on you.
You...
Ah, enjoy it, sweetheart.
Uh...
Yeah, uh... You're probably expecting something from me.
Um, here's the thing.
I hadn't really planned on giving you your anniversary gift... until tonight.
You know, anniversary's good all day.
What are you talking about?
You can never wait all day.
You can't even wait till it's light out. Come on!
I know. I know.
That's me. It's true.
And... But, um, it's funny.
You forgot.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
I'll fix it. I'll go out right now and I'll get you something.
I'll make it right.
Let me know if there's enough chocolate in there, sweetheart.
- Mm, not bad.
- Good.
I should have warned you.
Dad always does something really special for the anniversary.
Like what? One year he had a star named after her.
He had a star named after her?
Well, that's nice, but isn't that a little... corny?
Mom liked it.
Maybe there's a jewelry store at the mall. I can pick her up a pair of earrings or something.
That's good, but... you did forget the anniversary.
That's right. That is a major oversight. Okay, okay.
So, if I'm Kate, I can't afford the finer things.
My husband's career is definitely a crushing disappointment to me.
I'm trapped in suburbia.
Did he ever take her to the city?
Now you're getting the hang of it.
Jack, can we afford this place?
I'm taking my baby out for our anniversary. Damn the costs.
We'll have the Terrine of Quail Breast with Shiitake Mushrooms to start.
Then the Veal Medallions in Raspberry Truffle Sauce.
And the Sea Scallops with Pureed Artichoke Hearts.
Very good, sir. And may I say, those are all excellent selections.
You may. Also, we'll have a bottle of Lafite, '82.
Honey, that's an $800 bottle of wine.
We'll just have some red wine by the glass.
You are so not off the hook yet, Slick.
But I'm getting close, right?
You wanna dance?
I-I don't think there's dancing here, Jack.
Sure, there is.
Come on.
Not bad for a tire salesman from New Jersey.
I have my moments.
You gotta try one of these.
Ahh.
God, I miss that taste.
I need to tell you something.
Okay.
I think it may help us, but there's a slight chance it could make things worse.
I'm living someone else's...
I feel like I'm living someone else's life.
I remember I used to walk to work, and, uh,
I had a warm bialy in my hand, and a hot cup of coffee from Dean & Deluca, the crisp feeling of The Wall Street Journal, the smell of leather from my briefcase.
I used to be so sure about everything, confident.
You know, I-I knew exactly who I was... and what I wanted.
And then one morning,
I woke up... and suddenly it was all different.
- Worse, do you mean?
- No.
Well, maybe a few things, but mostly just different.
And it's okay.
But I never used to be like this, Kate.
I was the guy who had it all figured out.
I had no doubts.
I had no regrets.
And now?
Now I don't.
I don't have it all figured out.
Me neither.
But you always seem so certain.
Do you think there aren't mornings when I wake up... and wonder, "What the hell am I doing in New Jersey?"
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- My office is a dump.
I answer my own phone, and you seen my paycheck.
Your paycheck is a disgrace to paychecks.
Can you imagine a life... where everything was just easy?
You know, where you ask for things, and people just bring them to you?
It's wonderful.
I think about it too.
I do.
I wonder about what kind of life I would have had if I hadn't married you.
And?
Then I realize I've just erased all the things in my life that I'm sure about.
You and the kids.
Good things.
Yeah.
What are you sure about?
I'm sure that right now, there's nowhere else I'd rather be than here with you.
Oh.
Oh, Jack.
You like it?
This is beautiful.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
I'll just fill yours up to the top.
I don't know how you did it,
Hoss, but you pulled it off.
- I'm out of the doghouse?
- Way out.
Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
You may even get lucky tonight, Jack.
You're so beautiful.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky.
My God.
All this time,
I never stopped loving you.
That's all I wanted to hear.
I'm gonna wear the usual today.
What are you thinking?
You want to come to work with Dad, help me sell tires?
It's fun.
I'm pretty good at it.
Who's this? Who's that?
Who is that?
Who's on that tie?
That's Grandpa.
Yes.
Jack!
Mmm.
Have a great day.
For the money, this is hands down the best radial we carry.
Okay.
I guess I'll take 'em.
You won't regret it.
Tommy.
Would you set Mr. Collin up with four
B.F. Goodrich G-Force T.A.'s?
Give him ten percent off for having the best costume. Thank you.
You bet. Right this way, sir. Follow me.
Tell me, does the tire smell good?
Remember our
Valentine's Day special: balance and alignment for free!
How are you doing today?
It just blew out on me.
Do you have a tire like that?
I seem to have some sort of a blowout here.
- Why don't you let me take this one, Kenny?
- Okay, chief.
Peter Lassiter.
- Do I know you?
- Not exactly.
I've seen you on CNBC.
You look taller in real life.
Truth is, Mintz was so busy timing his wife's breathing, he didn't realize that Med Tech needed
Global more than the other way around.
Ten days, two weeks tops, they would have approached you with an offer.
I'm willing to bet anything it would have been 130 billion, not 122.
The trouble is, Peter, you had a pussycat running the show.
What you needed was a Doberman.
I'm impressed.
I really am.
Now, about my car.
Sure. We're gonna have to special order that tire, so it'll be ready in a couple of days.
All right.
This is my office address.
Why don't you drop off the car yourself?
We're really more of a boutique operation, as you can see.
But you're not interested in boutique dollars. I get it.
He's expecting you,
Mr. Lassiter.
Alan, this is Jack Campbell, the one I was telling you about.
- Of course. Jack. Hi.
- Mr. Mintz.
No, just call me Alan. We like to cultivate a very casual atmosphere here.
- I can see that.
- What can I tell you? Do you have kids?
Uh, actually, yes.
Two of them. Good ones.
Great, great.
Why don't you have a seat?
Peter mentioned to me that you're an avid CNBC watcher.
But he didn't say whether you had any actual Wall Street experience.
Um, I was a sales associate at E.F. Hutton.
A broker, really?
And now you're in the tire business?
That's right.
And auto supply.
In the retail end, I understand.
We get about 60 percent of our business from automotive service.
And do you mind me asking what kind of sales you did in the last year?
Just ball park. We did
1.7 million in total revenue.
1.7. That's great.
And what do you project for this year?
I think we're gonna have a banner year.
Sales are up almost 20 percent in the first quarter, and we just landed a major trucking company account.
You did? That's great. So that puts you just a tad over two million?
That's right. And that would make us number one in our market.
Excuse me. I'm gonna get a glass of water.
Look, I know our paltry little $2 million in sales... is about what you spend a year on office supplies.
And some regional trucking company account is nothing compared...
- to a multi-billion-dollar merger.
- No, no, no.
- I'm not trying to knock the tire business.
- It's okay, Alan. I get it.
I'm in your shoes, I'm thinking the same thing, but here's the deal.
Business is business.
Wall Street, Main Street.
It's all a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how they're going to send their kids to college.
It's just people, and I know people.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.
- Take you, for instance, Alan.
You have a certain energy about you, an active kind of energy.
I wouldn't be surprised if you drank about 16 Diet Cokes a day.
You're an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home.
You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients Scotch.
And your wife decorated this office.
He certainly seems to have your number.
You're a little tougher,
Peter.
For one thing, you like expensive things.
That's easy.
You've seen my car.
You smoke Hoyo de Monterreys.
You're a Scotch man, single malt, not because it's trendy but because you've been doing it for 40 years... and you like to stay with what works.
You have two great loves in your life: your horses... and this company.
And you're a man who prides himself in finding talent in unusual places.
- How would you know that?
- Because I'm here.
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to get this job.
I'll start wherever
I have to start.
I'll park cars if I have to.
The biggest part of judging character is knowing yourself, and I know this:
I can do this job.
I can.
Give me a chance, Peter.
I won't let you down.
Alan, why don't you show Jack around?
This is our war room. We did seven major deals in here last year, three of them... hostile.
- Seven?
- Yeah. You get a kind of a feeling from...
Can we cut the shit here for a minute?
Where did you get that information?
Did you go through his wallet?
Did you surf some Net?
It doesn't really matter because that circus act you pulled back there... may have dazzled Lassiter, but it doesn't cut any shit with me.
Even if you get this job, which I highly doubt, let me just give you a word of warning.
Peter Lassiter gets tired of his pet projects very, very quickly.
I've got that big office because I prove myself to him year after year after year.
Nobody is gonna come in here and turn the old man's head, especially not some tire salesman from New Jersey.
So if you're cautious and you're quiet, you watch yourself, stay away from Lassiter, maybe I'll think about keeping you on here after he gets bored with you.
Do we understand each other?
Alan!
God, you really are different.
- Excuse me?
- I mean, wow!
I'm impressed. I'm impressed.
Good for you.
Are we understanding each other?
Yes, Alan, I understand you.
- Okay then.
- Good.
- Good.
- Okay. Okay.
Alan!
Keep your eyes closed.
Hold on.
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.
Welcome to Xanadu.
It's pretty incredible, isn't it?
It's like a museum.
Look around.
So what's the big surprise?
You didn't rent this for the weekend, did you?
Think... bigger.
For the week?
This place is a perk, Kate.
A perk?
For what?
A company called P.K. Lassiter
Investment House... uses it to attract new executives.
I'm going into arbitrage, honey.
It turns out
I have a knack for it.
Jack, what are you talking about?
I'll be making twice what I make now, plus a hefty bonus.
That's just to start. And we can live in this apartment... practically rent free... until we find a place of our own.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't think so.
This is gonna be a better life for all of us.
We can put Annie and Josh into private schools.
Annie goes to a great school, Jack.
I'm talking about the best schools in the country here.
What could you possibly be thinking about? What about my job?
Well, this is New York City. It's like the needy people capital of the world.
Your Jersey clients aren't a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could find here.
I can't even believe you're talking about moving back into the city.
I thought the reason we left was because we didn't want to raise the kids here.
No. No. This is the center of the universe.
If I were living in Roman times,
I would live in Rome. Where else?
"Today America is the Roman empire. New York is Rome itself."
- John Lennon.
- Jack!
Okay, you know something? I'm detecting, like, a funky tension here.
This was supposed to be a happy day, so guess what? I don't need this.
We don't have to live here.
Forget it.
- I'll commute. I'll drive to work.
- God!
In traffic, it's over an hour each way. That's three hours every day.
- When are you ever going to see the kids?
- Kate.
You're not understanding me.
I'm talking about a perfect life, a great life.
Everything we pictured when we were young. The whole package.
You said so yourself.
Life has thrown us a few surprises, so we made sacrifices.
Well, guess what?
Now I can finally get us back on track. I can do that, Kate.
I want to do that.
I need to do that as a man!
For all of us.
Please just think about this for one second.
No more lousy restaurants.
No more clipping coupons.
No more shoveling snow.
Then get a goddamn snowblower, Jack!
Don't go get a new career without even telling me about it!
And don't... don't take Annie out of a school she loves.
Don't move us out of a house we've become a family in.
You're... You're...
Don't you see? I'm talking about us finally having a life... that other people envy.
Oh, Jack.
They already do envy us.
From London to New York.
I came back.
When you got on that plane,
I was sure it was over.
I left the airport afraid
I'd never see you again.
And then you showed up the very next day.
That was a good surprise.
You know, I think about the decision you made.
Maybe I was being naive, but I believed... that we would grow old together in this house, that we'd spend holidays here and... have our grandchildren come visit us here.
I had this image of us all gray and wrinkly, and me... working in the garden, and you repainting the deck.
But things change.
If you need this, Jack, if you really need this,
I will take these kids from a life they love, and I'll take myself from the only home we've ever shared together... and I'll move wherever you need to go.
I'll do that because I love you.
I love you, and that's more important to me than our address.
I choose us.
Oh. I'm gonna chase you.
You can't catch me.
No, you can't. You can't.
Oh!
Whoa! Oh. Whoops!
I fell down.
I knew you'd come back.
Oh, Annie.
I love you.
- What are you doing?
- Ringing my bell.
4.99? It's just salt, for God sakes.
Ninety-nine cents, darling.
Out of ten.
- You!
- Jack!
What's up?
How you feeling, baby?
Why are you here?
Here's your change, darling.
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, oh-one.
Is that rock salt?
Look at you, man. Went and got all domestic and everything.
You really figured some things out, huh?
You're not sending me back.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
Hey, did you hear me?
- Wait a second.
- I'm talking to you.
You see that?
Character. And for what, for nine bucks? That's just so disappointing.
I'm not going back.
You understand me?
- Okay, relax, Jack.
- You can't do this.
You can't keep coming in and out of people's lives, messing things up.
It's not right.
A glimpse, by definition, is an impermanent thing, Jack.
I've got kids.
I'm going home.
Is it morning yet?
No, honey.
Go back to sleep.
Take care, Annie.
I'm going back to the mother ship.
Hey.
Hey.
These past few weeks,
I know I've done some... some unusual things.
It's been interesting, that's for sure.
I've done some good things, too, though, haven't I?
You've been Jack Campbell, and that's always a good thing.
I need you to remember me, Kate.
How I am right now... at this very moment.
I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it there.
Keep it with you no matter what happens.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.
Please just promise me.
You have to promise me, because if you don't, then it's like it never happened, and I don't think
I can live with that.
I promise.
Promise me again.
- I promise.
- Okay.
Now come to bed.
Soon.
Yeah.
What time is it?
Okay. Yeah.
- Waiting for me by the door, huh?
- Paula.
Wow.
Merry Christmas.
Christmas?
It's not Christmas.
It's whatever you want it to be, Jack.
It's not Christmas.
Jack. Jack?
Can I help you?
Is Kate here?
- Does Kate live here?
- Kate? No.
There's nobody named Kate here.
Of course not.
You okay?
No.
Hello.
Santa Claus, where are you?
Everybody's here.
- Adelle?
- You're a half an hour late.
The emergency strategy session?
Trip to Aspen?
Is this ringing any bells?
Everybody is panicked here, Jack.
Jack?
I'll be there in 20 minutes.
No, I'm not gonna go talk to them until
I have something to talk to them about.
Steve, I don't care if it's
Christmas day. We're in a crisis here.
Wait a minute. Jack just walked in. I'll call you back. Jack.
Thank God that you're...
- You're here. Are you all right?
- What's going on here?
What's...
Well, it's not good.
Bob Thomas has been talking to a European drug company, Jack, and we don't know which one.
They're gonna let Bob buy a minority stake, and let him keep running the entire company.
Global knows. I don't know how they know, but they know and they're up in arms.
They think that somehow we should have been prepared for this. Prepared!
Oh, God, we're in trouble.
You know something, Alan?
Somewhere inside of you, there's a much more assertive person.
Is this another one of those
Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
No.
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Jack?
I'll tell you exactly what we're going to do.
You're going to do whatever you have to do to find out... which European company he's been talking to.
Then I'm going to clean myself up, fly to Aspen and drink eggnog with Bob Thomas.
His wife and kids will be playing in the background in the snow... while I convince him that the European company... is the devil... and Global is the answer to his prayers.
Then I'm gonna spend four hours skiing... alone.
Completely and utterly alone.
I'm going to do that because that is my life, that's what's real... and there's nothing
I can do to change that.
For Manhattan.
Kate Reynolds.
I need an address too.
It's very fragile, so I want you to be very careful with it, okay?
It's valuable.
It's over 300 years old.
You'll probably need a few guys to carry it. All right.
The painting is also very, very old, so take extra care.
It means a lot to Kate, okay?
I appreciate it.
Yeah? What?
Are you from the moving company? I'm Jack Campbell.
I'm an old... friend of Kate's.
Kate, some guy is here.
Did you call the airline like I asked you to do? It's like two hours...
- Jack.
- Kate.
God, it's been a long time.
You look...
- You look great.
- Thanks.
I... Come on in.
Come on in.
I'm just doing some... Lori, do you know where those boxes...
I'm sorry.
No, no, no! You know what... Jack.
Don't... Please.
I don't even care.
Oh, great. Thank you.
- What's going on?
- I'm moving to Paris.
Hey, Lori, have you seen that box? It says "Jack" on it.
I put it with the rest of the Salvation Army stuff.
Do you want me to look for the box or call the airline, Kate?
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
Hey, kind of giving up Christmas day for my ex-boss here.
Hey, didn't mind offering to help when she was opening the Prada bag I gave her.
- Maybe it's by the wardrobe boxes.
- Thank you.
- So you're moving.
- Yeah, to Paris.
My firm has an office there.
I'm gonna be heading it up.
Paris. Paris, France?
That's the one.
So you're... you're not at a nonprofit firm?
God, no, not with what they pay me.
Are you married?
No, I never got married,
Jack. You?
Not exactly.
Look, could we take a minute here, maybe go get a cup of coffee or something?
- I'll go for a cup of coffee.
- Yes. I found it.
Congratulations. Your earlier flight was canceled, but I got you out of
Kennedy on United at 7:00.
- Excellent.
- Am I good or what?
Yes, you're brilliant.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Here you go. It's just some old stuff of yours.
Do you ever think about us, Kate?
About what might have happened?
Jack, I'll tell you what.
If you're ever in Paris, look me up and we'll go have that cup of coffee, okay?
Or cafe. Or cafe au lait.
Oh, wait. No, no, no, no!
Don't close that up. I will never find this box again.
Well, I marked it. Just be more specific next time.
We'll leave it open then. I was just trying to close it up.
Make a right here.
Sir, you're gonna be late for your flight.
We're not going to the airport.
You can't leave this here.
You can't park here!
Kate! You can't go.
- Don't get on that plane.
- Jack?
Please, let's just go have a cup of coffee. That's all I'm asking for.
I'm sure there's another flight to Paris tonight.
Jack.
What are you doing here?
Do you need closure?
Because if you do, after all these years, you got it.
I'm okay. I'm fine.
I... I was heartbroken, Jack, but I got over it,
I moved on, and... you should move on too.
Okay? I'm sorry.
I just can't...
I've gotta go.
I-I... I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
Can I just...
I'm sorry. I was here.
We have a house in Jersey!
We have two kids.
Annie and Josh.
Annie's not much of a violin player, but she tries real hard.
She's a little precocious, but that's only because she says what's on her mind.
And when she smiles...
And Josh, he has your eyes.
He doesn't say much, but we know he's smart.
He's always got his eyes open.
You know, he's always watching us.
Sometimes you can look at him and you just know... he's learning something new.
It's like witnessing a miracle.
The house is a mess, but it's ours.
After 120 more payments, it's going to be ours.
And you, you're a nonprofit lawyer.
That's right.
You're completely nonprofit.
But that doesn't seem to bother you.
And we're in love.
After 13 years of marriage, we're still unbelievably in love.
You won't even let me touch you till I've said it.
I sing to you.
Not all the time, but definitely on special occasions.
And we've... we've dealt with our share of surprises and made a lot of sacrifices, but we stayed together.
You see, you're a better person than I am, and it made me a better person to be around you.
I don't know. Maybe it was all just a dream.
Maybe I went to bed one lonely night in December, and I imagined it all, but...
I swear, nothing's ever felt more real.
And if you get on that plane right now, it'll disappear forever.
I know we could both go on with our lives, and we'd both be fine.
But I've seen... what we could be like together.
And I choose us.
Please, Kate.
One cup of coffee.
You can always go to Paris.
Just... please, not tonight.
Okay, Jack.
Okay.
A little bit of magic time.
I feel it.
Yes, sir.
Terrific shot!
I'm in the goddamn woods again.
Goddamn it.
Damn game.
Damn it.
I spend more time in the trees than the squirrels.
Wizard Two? Why not?
Not again.
I've had five heart attacks in the last 10 years.
My first was on a golf course in South Carolina.
It wasn't that bad. A couple of doglegs that were more dog than leg.
<u>All in all, it was playable.</u>
Assuming you didn't die on the second hole.
The second coronary was at Augusta, where they had the Masters.
Went down on the first fairway.
Good thing too, because those greens would have been the end of me anyway.
My wife used to ask me before she passed on:
Why do I play a game that seems destined to kill me?
It all started back in 1928...
... when I was just a youngster in Savannah, Georgia.
Jones and Hagen are really at it. Neck and neck.
- Nuts!
- Remember that drive he hit?
- Was it 350?
- More like 400 with the roll.
I don't care how good they are.
Junuh could beat them with his eyes closed.
He won three times in a row.
When I was growing up, every town had its heroes.
Ours was Rannulph Junuh.
An athlete who was a born winner.
How I wanted to be just like him.
Junuh has the most difficult shot in the history of golf.
He must sink this shot from 110 yards to win the championship.
He steps up to the ball.
The crowd is hushed in anticipation.
Can he make this miracle shot?
And he swings!
Fore! Watch your heads!
- Where did that come from?
- I don't know!
There he is!
I'd never seen him play since it was before I was born...
... but it was said Junuh was on track to being the greatest golfer ever.
"Titanic off the tee."
"Approach shots which fell to earth. "
As Sam Snead once put it,
"Like a butterfly with sore feet."
He won just about everything.
But even he would say his most significant victory...
... was winning the heart of Adele Invergordon.
Daughter of the wealthiest man in Savannah.
But fate plays funny tricks.
It was a patriotic call to arms...
... to fight the war to end all wars.
Junuh and everyone in town believed it was his destiny...
... to lead the young men of Savannah into battle.
It was to be his crowning glory.
But nothing could have prepared him or anyone...
... for the shock and sorrow of what was to come.
- Positions.
- Ready, captain.
- Get ready. Positions.
- Ready, sir.
Prepare to advance.
Sergeant...
- Advance!
- Advance!
Confused, broken...
... and unable to face a return to a hero's welcome...
... Junuh just disappeared.
Hoping to forget...
... and to be forgotten.
But Adele, being a woman of the South, had survived worse than desertion.
And she moved on with her life, dedicating herself to her father's dream.
What we have here is the most magnificent golf resort on God's earth...
...and I'm building it here in Savannah.
Krewe Island.
Legacy to my sweet Adele.
And we'd like to use all of you as our main suppliers.
Thank you, that's quite an honor.
I wouldn't dream of anything but.
People don't obey, we'll repeal.
We can't repeal the Commandments, they don't obey that.
Yet no law on the statute book--
I was 10 years old when Junuh came home.
Stop!
Less than a year later, the Great Depression hit Savannah.
Jobs were lost.
Stores and banks were shut for good.
And John Invergordon, having spent his last dime on his great dream...
... opened Krewe Island on what should have been a glorious spring day.
It might not have been a shot heard around the world...
Oh, Daddy.
... but it reached every corner of Savannah.
Amen.
I'll be putting some doors and closets in the parlor.
With any luck, we can have boarders within a few weeks.
Hardy, can you share your room with Cara Mae?
What about the store?
Oh, Jesus.
I've died and gone to hell.
It's not as if you have a choice.
Your golf resort is dead and gone.
You've got no gumption, Neskaloosa.
My gumption is not the subject.
Then what is the subject?
If it's your offer to take it for one-tenth of what my father spent--
You're lucky to get a dime on the dollar.
Just so you can turn around and resell it...
...to some Carolina paper mill for a tidy profit?
That you've likely made the deal already is not my problem.
We should come back when the shock of your father's passing isn't so--
God.
Don't bother. I'm not selling.
You got a stack of debts that would fill the Cotton Exchange.
And I intend to pay them off... in time.
With what? Ball tokens?
With the money people will spend once they know it's the premier resort.
Did I miss something? Or are we not in the midst of a Great Depression?
People still have money and I'll make sure they know--
How exactly do you intend to accomplish that?
How?
- Well, how?
- How?
I'll tell you how.
I'll have the greatest exhibition match ever held...
...on the greatest golf course ever built.
- Bobby Jones...
- Bobby Jones?
- ...will be playing Walter Hagen...
- Walter Hagen?
...for $ 10,000.
- What?
- $ 10,000? You can't be serious.
$ 10,000 for one weekend?
I'd make it more, gentlemen...
...but that's about all
I believe I can raise...
...if I sell everything I own on this earth.
Except Krewe Island.
Jones and Hagen are coming to Krewe Island?
To play an exhibition match for 10 grand?
That's correct.
They don't know it yet, but that's what they'll be doing.
Are you off your rocker?
Nobody has the right to call
Krewe Island "Invergordon's Folly."
Nobody. Good day, gentlemen.
Adele!
Nobody holds your father responsible for this depression!
You're a damn fool!
Save your breath, judge. She'll sell.
You really think Jones and Hagen...
...will come to Krewe Island just because she wants them to?
All four golf championships in a single year.
The Grand Slam. Simply amazing.
I don't believe that's been done in the history of golf.
No, it--
It takes my breath away.
You don't impress me as someone who loses her breath.
Did you know that reprobate,
Mr. Walter Hagen...
...who I hear spends every minute chasing after women...
...has been approached to play in the
$10,000 Krewe Island exhibition match?
No, I didn't.
But how is this an urgent matter for the American Red Cross?
- Did I say that?
- At the front door.
May I speak candidly, Mr. Jones?
I wish you would.
I've come here to see you because...
...to the South, you're a hero.
They see you as a young god.
Brave, valiant...
...glorious.
One of the greatest golfers in the world today.
I would say "the greatest golfer" ...
...were it not for that incident last year...
...when Mr. Hagen whupped you by
12 strokes on your very own course.
You say he's been invited to play at Krewe Island?
She has a remarkable talent,
Mr. Hagen.
I hit the ball.
I wonder if you might excuse us for a minute, Anna Mae?
I won't be long.
A charming woman. Although, she gave me quite a fright.
With so much weight in front,
I swore she'd topple over...
...before she ever got to her knees.
I do admire a man with your...
...vitality.
The South is in such an unfortunate place these days...
...and Savannah most of all.
Memories of our defeat in the war between the States still linger...
...and with them, the defeated men who returned...
...lacking that vigor we women associate with your gender.
Now, sadly, here is Savannah, teeming with the most attractive young women...
...and nobody, absolutely nobody, to satisfy them.
Except for Bobby Jones, who will be playing in our Krewe Island tournament.
He says, "It don't matter what it is, it won't hurt you.
You just pop one in your mouth and you chew."
I'm pleased to announce
Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen...
...have accepted my golfing invitation...
...with enthusiasm.
First, of course...
...Miss Adele Invergordon's commitment to her father's dream.
Not one to concede defeat easily...
... Neskaloosa engineered an uprising against the tournament.
You boys think I've been drinking too much blackjack tea...
...but they'll be parking in our streets...
...and taxing the limits of our constabulary--
Do you think one of them damn rich Yankees...
...gives a hoot about Savannah or anybody in it?
Now, now.
Now, we need the Yankees...
...but we also need someone from Savannah in the match.
One of us giving them...
...a run for their money.
Then they'll know what we're made of.
We need someone from Savannah playing in our tournament!
What about Dougal McDermott?
He's a Scot and only comes into town to get drunk!
- Bobby Jones is from Atlanta!
- I said, Savannah!
- The South. The real South.
- Yeah.
Neskaloosa knew the golden rule of politics better than anyone.
If you can't beat them, lead them.
All right, hold it!
Hold it, everyone!
There's one person we're forgetting.
We all know there's one man who hits gargantuan drives off the tee...
...and has a lock-picker's touch on the greens...
...Savannah's own
Enderby "Cottonmouth" Conyngham!
Wait a minute!
He's 80 years old!
He'd need one caddy to carry his clubs, and two to carry him!
Junuh could whup them both.
You're off your rocker. He couldn't whup a dead possum in a sack.
- That ain't true.
- Oh, yeah?
What about Captain Junuh?
- Who?
- Captain Junuh.
My Dad says he's the greatest golfer
Savannah ever had!
- Hardy.
- Well, it's true!
You said it a hundred times!
Sit down, son.
The boy's got a point!
- Junuh's born and bred in Savannah.
- Exactly!
That is the point!
- What ever happened to him?
- He gave up golf.
Forget Rannulph Junuh, assuming you can locate his whereabouts.
I hear he's so far gone...
...he wouldn't know a putter from a pussy willow.
I know where to find him!
You find him, Hardy, and we will be there.
Fly, lad...
...with winged sandals on your feet!
If I live to be 1000, which doesn't seem likely...
... I'll never know where
I got the courage to call out.
But once I did, I wasn't backing down.
This could've been the stupidest idea
I've ever had.
Captain Junuh?
Captain Junuh?
This is Hardy Greaves, sir.
Jacks. All you be holding on guts.
I need new shoes.
You're crazy.
Get out of here with that.
Make sure you guys save some money for me.
He ain't gonna win.
What have we here?
Well, well.
Look like we got a new card player, gents.
It's all right. Don't be scared.
I ain't scared.
I've seen men drunk plenty of times.
- What do they look like?
- It ain't much.
Least not so much as they seem to think.
But it don't scare me none.
Gentlemen, this is the only male in
Chatham County who isn't full of shit.
What's your name, son?
Hardy. Hardy Greaves.
- You Frank Greaves' boy?
- Yes, sir.
What brings you here, Hardy?
Maybe I better come back when you're not so busy.
Busy?
I thought you were gonna say "drunk."
But I'm not busy and I'm not drunk.
There ain't enough whiskey in Georgia to get me drunk enough.
How drunk is drunk enough,
Captain Junuh?
Good question. Sit over here,
I'll tell you what drunk enough is.
Aaron, can you find the young man a bottle of Nehi?
I expect I could...
...just as long as I takes my money with me.
Now the question on the table...
...is how drunk is drunk enough?
And the answer is, it's all a matter of brain cells.
Brain cells?
That's right. Every drink of liquor you take kills 1000 brain cells.
But that don't matter, we got billions more.
First the sadness cells die, so you smile real big.
Then the quiet cells go, so you talk real loud for no reason at all.
That's okay, because the stupid cells go next...
...so everything you say is real smart.
And finally...
...come the memory cells.
These are tough sons of bitches to kill.
There's a golf match at Krewe Island between Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.
And there was a meeting to see who would play for Savannah.
I said you would.
That's why I'm here, so you can beat Jones and Hagen.
Hell, I'm drunker than I thought.
- I'll caddy for you.
- You'll caddy for me...
- ...against Jones and Hagen?
- Yes, sir!
I will too.
Aaron will carry the clubs,
I'll carry the balls.
And I'll carry the tees.
And I'll carry Junuh!
I wasn't joking.
I heard my Dad tell how you won every golf tournament in the South.
And how you hit a drive so long they made you wait 20 minutes...
...to measure it for a record.
And how you swing righty, but you were in the woods once...
...and you had no room to swing righty so you borrowed a lefty club...
...and hit the ball
6 inches from the hole.
It's time for you to go home.
I ain't going!
Suit yourself, because I'm going to bed.
- Night, gentlemen.
- See you later.
What are you doing in my house?
Trespassing, but on great importance to Savannah herself.
Some delegate.
Isn't it past his bedtime?
"And a little child shall lead them."
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, Junuh.
So, what's in it for you?
Pride in the great city of Savannah so close to my heart.
So close to all our hearts.
You're wasting your time.
I'm not playing.
Why is that?
I lost my swing.
Then find it!
Goddamn it! Because you're playing.
That's all there is to it!
Savannah needs you.
- Get McDermott. He'll play.
- Balls!
We don't need some sawed-off Scotsman...
...pooping drives out 40 yards!
We need a man with thunder in his fist!
A hero to boom that pill out past those golfing gods!
- We need a knight!
- You're our gentle-born chevalier.
That's one hell of a speech, fellas.
I don't take no for an answer.
Well, you'll have to because I'm not playing.
Now get out.
Something you picked up on your travels?
He's not mine.
A little young for a drinking companion, don't you think?
So, Adele, what can I do for you?
- I think you know why I'm here.
- I do.
A little late to be out looking for romance, isn't it?
Would that do it?
Would you play in the match if I had sex with you?
Yeah, that would do it.
Well, that's good, Junuh.
We've seen each other so infrequently since your return...
...I thought this was gonna be more difficult.
Where shall we do it?
Right here is fine.
Don't worry, he's out like a light.
Take an earthquake to wake him up.
For an earthquake, you'd have to play many more tournaments and do very well.
Well?
How do you suggest we begin?
Shall I just run and jump on you...
...or would you like preliminary romancing.
Romancing sounds good.
Very well, then.
Here's one short kiss.
It is, I'm afraid, all the romancing I have in me at this time.
I do hope I haven't given the impression that I'm crying over us.
Because I'm not.
You're not?
No, I'm not.
I'm crying over Savannah.
Savannah?
Over her pain, and the pain of her people.
- You're in tears over Savannah?
- I am.
I truly am.
Then who'd you take your clothes off for? Chattanooga?
Well.
This certainly has been a colossal waste of time.
I didn't ask you to come here.
No, you certainly did not.
You ever get tired of sitting around feeling sorry for yourself...
...a little golf might do you some good.
I've lost my swing.
Really?
Where did it go?
You can open your eyes now, Hardy.
Your education is over.
Go on home now.
Who's that?
Just me.
A man trying to find somewhere to rest his tired feet...
...taking in some of God's glories.
My, what a night!
I could've killed you out there.
No, sir. I set myself directly in front of you.
Judging by how you hit them balls,
I figured I'd be out of harm's way.
Excuse me, sir.
They say you can tell a player by his grip.
If you want some food or something, go into the house, help yourself.
Oh, well, thank you kindly, sir.
I always felt a man's...
...grip on his club just like a grip on his world.
- Is there something you want?
- Five dollars guaranteed.
Guaranteed for what?
Big match coming up,
Mr. Jones, Mr. Hagen.
Fella gonna be needing a caddy.
You're a caddy?
Well, that depends. You're a golfer?
I don't need a caddy.
I'm not playing.
I don't play anymore at all.
Oh. Well, thank you, sir.
I take you up on that food you offered.
- All right.
- Evening, sir.
Don't make no sense is all.
Man say he don't play, yet he out here...
...this shade of night hitting balls where he can't see them.
I've done things that have made less sense.
As we all have.
For $5 guaranteed,
I'm offering you my caddy services.
For $5? You know the winner gets $ 10,000...
...the caddy's cut is 10 percent, so that's $ 1000.
- I take $5 guaranteed.
- You don't want $ 1000?
You said you ain't even playing...
...and Lord knows how awful you gonna look if you do.
So $5 sound pretty good from where I'm sitting.
Rhythm of the game like the rhythm of life.
Here.
- Here.
- Oh, no, sir, I don't--
Go on.
- Go ahead.
- Well, thank you, sir.
You know, some folks say...
...put the ball in the front of your stance.
Others say you should--
You gonna hit the ball or dance with it?
I'm kind of partial to dancing.
Me and this gal--
Hit the ball.
- So, you're a golfer.
- No. I don't play golf.
Give me the damn club.
See, the trick is to find your swing.
What did you say?
You lost your swing.
We got to go find it.
Now somewhere in the harmony of all that is...
...ugh...
...all that was...
...all that will be.
I ain't seen a man hit like that since the North-South Championship in 1916.
They stopped play for 20 minutes to measure how far it went.
Bagger Vance the name.
Hit a few more.
And that, they say, is how
Bagger Vance became Junuh's caddy.
Oh yeah, give me one more like that.
Just like that one there.
I'm telling you the truth,
Wilbur Charles.
She was down to her panties and brassiere.
And you were in the room watching?
You think we're so stupid...
...we'd believe Miss Adele...
...get down to her skivvies with you in the room?
It's the God's honest truth, Eugene.
Scalp me, shrink my head and roast it if that ain't exactly what happened.
She thought I was asleep the whole time.
- That ain't all. Junuh's gonna play.
- He said that?
Not in so many words, but--
Look over there!
Ain't that Miss Adele now, across the street?
She went into Louder's Notions.
I could swear it's her.
I'd know that figure anywhere.
Well, as far as Junuh is concerned,
I guess that's about it.
If we don't have someone from
Savannah, I won't support this match.
- There must be plenty--
- All right!
I'll play in your damn golf match.
I should've let you finish.
Now I got nothing to show for it.
For the life of me, I have no idea what you're referring to.
- I can explain it to them--
- I don't think that's necessary!
God bless Savannah.
The day Jones and Hagen arrived in Savannah was declared a holiday.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first....
That's O.B. Keeler. He writes for the Atlanta Journal.
He goes wherever Bobby Jones goes.
And that's Walter Hagen's man,
Spec Hammond.
They say Hagen won't play without him.
That's Grantland Rice, the most powerful sports writer in the country.
He's staying at our boarding house, because he's nobody's man.
Mr. Robert Tyra Jones Jr. of Atlanta, Georgia.
Mr. Jones has won 13 national championships...
...including four U.S. Opens and five U.S. Amateurs.
He has also won all three
British Opens in which he has played.
For the first time in history, last year, won the Grand Slam.
All four major golf championships in a single year.
But what is not well known, at the very same time...
...he won his championships...
...Mr. Jones earned a degree in Engineering...
...from Georgia Tech. A degree in English from Harvard...
...and a law degree...
...from Emory University in Georgia, all with distinction.
Mr. Walter Hagen.
Mr. Hagen has won 11 national championships, including...
...four British Opens and five PGAs.
And in one stretch...
...Mr. Hagen won 22 straight professional championships.
Nice work!
Mr. Rannulph Junuh.
Walter, I think we're the underdogs.
Born and bred in Savannah, Georgia!
Mr. Junuh won the Georgia Amateur at the age of 16, making him...
...the youngest man to ever do so.
And until he left for the war was considered...
...the South's premier golfer.
Mr. Junuh returned from the war a hero...
...decorated with the medal of honor...
...for surviving a deadly mission in which...
...most--
The rest of his company were tragically defeated.
Makes you think twice about stepping on his ball.
Mr. Hagen!
Ladies and gentlemen...
...Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen, and our very own, Rannulph Junuh!
On behalf of the great city of Savannah....
Sure is some storm brewing.
- So where're you off to?
- However far it takes.
You don't expect me to stay around here, do you?
Not me. I consider it a great miracle you was even there at all today.
Let me help you with these things.
You heard Adele. Jones never finished lower than second in any tournament.
I believe she said he finished lower than second once.
Must have been the week he took his law exams.
Yeah, I believe it was.
Will you be needing these shoes,
Mr. Junuh?
Look like they're just my size.
- Keep them.
- Thank you kindly, sir.
Sure is some storm heading this way.
It's a pleasure to welcome you to our home.
It's a pleasure to be here, ma'am.
Thank you.
Hardy, take his belongings to his room, then I got chores for you.
Yes'm.
Expect this is the most exciting sports event ever, ain't it, Mr. Rice?
- Why is that, son?
- Why?
Because of Jones and Hagen.
They's out for blood.
Oh, I didn't come for Jones or Hagen.
I came for Rannulph Junuh.
You come all the way down from New York City to see Junuh?
Uh-huh.
I saw Junuh play once, then he disappeared.
I'd love to see him play, especially against Jones and Hagen.
Go get them, Junuh! Go get them!
God bless you, Junuh!
Show them what Savannah's made of!
- Go get them, Junuh!
- Give them hell!
Give them hell.
Junuh, make us proud!
Damn.
I take that you was interested in being Mr. Junuh's fore caddy.
- No.
- No?
- No.
- No?
Well, maybe I was. But I guess I just ain't got the nerve to ask you yet.
I ain't got time till you does, so here's what I propose...
...I'll assume that the moment you gets the nerve to ask...
...will be the same moment I decide
I tell you, "Yeah."
How'd that suit you?
- That suits me just fine, sir.
- Folks call me Bagger.
Yes, sir, Bagger, sir.
Soon as you're through cleaning Mr. Junuh's shoes...
...we'll measure out on the course.
Junuh knew that if he were to have any chance in the tournament...
... he had no choice but to come to terms with his demons.
The only question in his mind was...
... which demon gave him the most aggravation:
Bagger Vance or Miss Adele Invergordon?
Mr. Jones?
Could you hold, please?
- Thank you very much, Mr. Jones.
- Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Hagen.
How are you this evening?
Good time, now.
Very nice.
Thank you very much, Mr. Hagen.
Make sure you keep this area clear.
Dance and a picture, sir?
Thank you very much.
That's it. Very nice.
Look right over here.
Right here. Big smile.
Don't stop, stay together.
Just pretend there's music.
Keep going, keep going!
Look right over here. Okay.
Give me a smile.
Thank you very much.
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.
Longer.
Little shorter.
How's that?
Good. One stride equals a yard.
Go on over to the tee and start counting.
Top golfers try to get a leg up on the competition...
... by having the men they trust sneak on the course...
... and do their own measurements.
So Bagger and I walked the course that night, measuring away.
Bagger never wrote down a number.
He filed it all in his head.
Hit one a little harder.
Go and do that again.
Right here is where this game is won.
Right here on the green.
First you got to see it.
Sun gonna be there in the morning.
Over there in the afternoon.
Funny thing is, the blades of grass gonna follow the sun.
The grain is gonna shift.
That same putt...
...gonna go one way in the morning, the other in the afternoon.
One way in the morning, the other in the afternoon. You see that?
A golf course put folk through quite a punishment.
It lives and breathes just like us.
You think Junuh can win?
Yeah, if he can find his authentic swing.
"Authentic"?
Go and hit one more for me.
Yep, inside each and every one of us is one true, authentic swing.
Something we was born with that's ours...
...and ours alone. Something can't be taught to you or learned.
Something that got to be remembered.
Over time, the world can rob us of that swing...
...and get buried inside us under...
...all our woulda's and coulda's, and shoulda's.
Some folk even forget what their swing was like.
Some folk even forget what their swing was like.
- You keep swinging.
- But I don't have any balls.
Don't worry about the ball or where it's gonna go....
Just swing the club.
Close your eyes.
- Close my--
- You can't make that ball go in.
You have to let it.
Feel the club.
Feel the weight of the club.
A deep perfect line.
Dropping in, soft as butter.
Listen to the sounds of the night.
Keep swinging that club.
Feel the breeze coming off the sea.
Inside every one of us is one true, authentic swing.
Keep swinging that club...
...until you're part of the whole thing.
Something we was born with.
- That's good. Listen to the night.
- I don't feel a thing.
Just keep swinging that club until you're part of the whole thing.
That's a good thing.
Can you see it?
- All right, time to go.
- Why?
They say that God is happiest when His children are at play.
Well, it certainly seemed God was in fine spirits...
... when the day of the match dawned.
People came from far and wide.
There wasn't a room to be found in a boarding house...
... or the Krewe Island Hotel.
The match was designed as the ultimate championship.
Thirty-six holes on Saturday...
... followed by another grueling
36 holes on Sunday.
- Where's Hagen?
- Oh, he'll be here.
Hello, Mr. Junuh. Bob, how are you?
They do put on a splendid show, don't they?
Later, they'll even hit some golf balls.
Ladies and gentlemen.
By virtue of the draw...
...Mr. Jones will hit first...
...Mr. Hagen second...
...and then Mr. Junuh.
And then suddenly, in that moment...
I felt as if I could hear the earth breathing beneath me.
Junuh hit a good opening drive, and I was sure he was on his way.
It's hard to imagine three more different approaches to the game of golf.
Bobby Jones' swing was a study of grace in motion.
He had a way of making the difficult shots look easy...
... and the easy shots look even easier.
Hagen, on the other hand...
... hit more bad shots in a single game than most golfers do in a season.
But Hagen had long ago learned one thing:
Three lousy shots and one brilliant shot can still make par.
And Junuh? Well, even now...
... I can't think of it without wincing.
- Beach.
- Go ball, go!
Yep. Beach.
He missed it.
We sure got lovely weather for it, though.
Let me get that from you, sir.
Any ideas?
About what?
Could you give me a club?
That's a good one.
What the hell is wrong with his grip?
By the end of five holes,
Junuh was five strokes behind...
...with 67 holes to go.
Things would've been much worse if it weren't for Junuh's shot on the sixth.
It was a birdie.
One stroke under par for the hole...
...moving him to four behind Jones and Hagen...
...and his only hope for the entire round.
I think I've found my game.
Good news. Now we got to figure out what that game is.
By the 18th tee, at the close of the morning round...
...Jones and Hagen were neck and neck.
And as for Junuh....
This is becoming embarrassing.
Oh, no, sir. It's been embarrassing for quite some time now.
Can I make a suggestion to you?
What now?
Why don't you hook it out of bounds?
Carve it out over them pretty trees into the ocean.
Really, do what you've been doing.
Then, you'll be so far out the match...
...me and you can relax and enjoy ourselves.
Yeah.
What you waiting for? Go on.
Hook it to hell.
Put yourself out your misery.
You want to quit?
You can creep off somewhere,
I'll tell folk you took sick.
Truth be told, ain't nobody gonna object.
Fact, they probably be happy as bugs in a bake shop see you pack up.
You know I can't quit.
I know.
Just making sure you know it too.
I can't stand it!
Man alive! The fairway!
Hello, Bagger.
Hello, Mr. Bagger Vance!
I want a good explanation. What in
God's green earth are you telling him?
I'd be appreciative if we talk about this later. Right now I'm busy.
You have done a hell of a job so far.
Let me talk to him. Mr. Vance, what the judge is trying to determine is...
...your strategy for helping poor
Mr. Junuh find his game, because...
...you seem to know as much about caddying as I do driving a locomotive.
You all want to know my strategy?
Right now my player is a little confused.
See, he still think he Rannulph Junuh.
He is Rannulph Junuh, you damn twit!
Well, he is and he ain't.
Thank you.
Anybody drinking?
Here, I'm gonna get a drink.
It'll come.
I had me a uncle named Rufus.
- Stupid.
- Lost his right arm in a cotton gin.
Learned how to do everything with his left arm.
He was changing the wheel on a wagon.
Axle chopped of his left arm.
So he did everything with...
- ...his teeth.
- Was a mistake.
He said things to Mr. Johnny he shouldn't.
Mr. Johnny knocked out his teeth.
"Savannah's own."
He learned how to do everything with his feet.
Until he got this fungus.
It grew all up the--
- Stop it!
- It's about overcoming adversity.
Listen, you want to talk to me about my grip, fine.
Talk about my swing, fine.
Don't want to hear about fungus?
He became a dancer.
He made a fortune. Was the most amazing thing to see...
...this armless, toothless man sliding across the stage...
...to the music of Bessie Smith and the Duke.
I don't care if I'm 12 strokes back.
I just don't.
You don't even want to win?
It's just a game, Bagger.
Yes, sir. You said it yourself now.
"Just a game."
So maybe there's something else that's riling you.
Maybe you thought you'd just sashay onto that green...
...and the old hero of Savannah just reappear all by itself.
Don't work that way, is all.
The Junuh you was...
...you ain't never gonna be again.
Ever. That's all I'm saying.
You don't know a thing about me.
I know you'll look pretty foolish out there with...
- ...two different shoes on your feet.
- Oh, Jesus.
You got an answer for everything, don't you, Bagger.
Let me tell you.
There's no difference...
...between winning and losing, and anything in between.
What's lost is lost.
A man lives, a man dies.
In the end it all turns out the same.
You're alone.
And that's all you'll ever be.
That a fact? Alone?
So a soul is born with everything the Lord give it...
...things don't go it's way, so it gives up, and the Lord takes...
- ...everything back?
- Right.
And then the soul dies alone.
That pretty much what you said?
- That's right.
- That's a sad story, Mr. Junuh.
- Yes, it is.
- That's the dumbest thing I heard...
...any fool say. Ever.
You got yourself a hard eye there, Mr. Junuh.
Soul is born with everything, then it dies, and the good Lord--
You a funny man, Mr. Junuh!
So, what I hear, Bob's waiting to make his move.
Doesn't want to peak early.
You think Walter doesn't know?
He's keeping pace with Bobby.
When Bobby kicks his game into gear...
...he's in for a big surprise.
What about Junuh?
What about him, son?
There's still three rounds to go.
That's 54 holes.
All he's got to do is pick up one stroke every four holes and he wins!
It's possible!
It's possible, son, but not very likely.
Junuh has shown no signs of getting his game together.
He's playing Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen.
What do you know?
You can't even get a decent job!
Hardy! Hardy Greaves, come back here!
Let him go, Ida.
Been a hard time for the boy.
There something you wanted to tell me?
Well, I'm trying to think of how to say it, Junuh.
There is a purpose to this visit...
...and that's to apologize.
I'm not an apologetic woman, it takes me longer to organize my thoughts.
I want to seem properly contrite for having gotten you into this match...
...but not seem what I did was ill-intentioned, since it wasn't.
What exactly are you apologizing for?
For publicly humiliating you.
That'd be a good thing to apologize for.
However, I think that....
Basically, what I'm trying to say is...
...that I'm sorry.
But it's not my fault.
You're the one to blame.
That's one hell of an apology, Adele.
I'd stop the tournament in a flash, if I could. I truly, truly would.
Because I know it's just gonna get worse.
The way you're playing, you're destroying...
...any chance Jones and Hagen have of doing well.
And your supporters? Every man, woman and child in Savannah...
...are so demoralized that they can barely hold down their lunches.
So, you want my apology or not?
No.
Well....
That's the Junuh I know.
Just full of little surprises.
What was it, Adele?
What did you like about us?
I liked the way we danced.
What's your problem?
And they looked at me like
I was stupid or crazy, or something.
I told them you could beat Jones and Hagen, being 12 strokes behind.
I told them, all you had to do was pick up one stroke...
...every four holes of the next
54 holes, right?
Yeah, right.
Who do you think was telling me you were hopeless?
My own father, who says he was a good friend of yours...
- ...till you lost your mind in the war.
- He's right.
You can't win?
He was a good friend of mine.
He's sweeping streets, Junuh.
In the middle of Savannah, where everybody can see him.
Me, my friends and everybody.
You feeling sorry because your daddy sweeps streets?
He ain't the only man who can't get work. Wilbur's dad can't neither.
But he says he'd rather do nothing than something beneath his dignity.
Grow up, Hardy.
It ain't time for me to grow up.
Your dad's sweeping because he took every dime he had...
...and used it to pay every man and woman he owed...
...instead of declaring bankruptcy like everyone, including Wilbur's dad.
Which is why he's able to sit all day on his "dignity."
Your daddy stared adversity in the eye and he beat it back with a broom.
You really love this game, don't you?
The greatest game there is.
You really think so?
Ask anybody. It's fun, it's hard...
...and you stand on the green grass, and it's just you and the ball.
There ain't nobody to beat up on but yourself.
Just like Mr. Nunan keeps hitting himself with the club when he's angry.
He's broken his toe three times on account of it.
It's the only game you can call penalty on yourself.
If you're honest, which most people are.
There just ain't no other game like it.
You better get going.
In case you didn't see that, Bobby,
I'll show you where it's at...
...when your shot catches up to it.
Oh, yes, greatest game there is.
Right, Hardy?
- Yes sir.
- The greatest game there will ever be.
- Just you and the ball.
- All by your lonesome.
I think it's time.
- Time for what?
- Time for you to see the field.
The field?
I see it, 445 yards long, it's got a little red flag at the end...
...it's 12 strokes ahead.
That ain't it.
If you had, you wouldn't be hacking at that ball...
...like you was chopping weeds.
Just give me the club.
Sorry I bring it up.
Take that, hack away.
Here, Billy, over here!
All right, what's the "field"?
Fix your eyes on Bobby Jones.
- He's a piece of work.
- Give the man room.
Knock it out there, Bobby.
Look at his practice swing.
Almost like he's searching for something.
Then he finds it.
Watch how he settle this up, right into the middle.
Feel that focus.
He's got a lot of shots to choose from.
Duffs and tops and skulls.
There's only one shot that's in perfect harmony with the field.
One shot that's his...
...authentic shot.
That shot is gonna choose him.
There's a perfect shot trying to find every one of us.
All we got to do is get ourselves out of its way...
...and let it choose us.
Look at him, he in the field.
You can't see that flag as some dragon you got to slay.
You've got to look with soft eyes.
See the place where the tides, and the seasons...
...the turning of the earth...
...all come together.
Where everything that is...
...becomes one.
You've got to seek that place, with your soul, Junuh.
Seek it with your hands, don't think about it, feel it.
Your hands are wiser than your head's ever gonna be.
I can't take you there...
...just hopes I can help you find a way.
It's just you...
...that ball...
...that flag...
...and all you are. Seek it with your hands, don't think...
...about it, feel it.
There's only one shot that's in harmony with the field.
The home of your authentic swing.
That flag...
...and all that you are.
Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and then.
The rest of that afternoon is a blur.
Junuh kept asking question after question about the field.
While Bagger acted like nothing much had happened...
... and kept making remarks about how much Hagen's socks must have cost...
... and how long to dry tobacco leaves before they make a good smoke.
But somehow, in the middle of it all,
Junuh started playing golf.
As the day and second round came to an end, there was genuine excitement.
I do so enjoy this little game.
Why don't you ladies join me for dinner?
Hello, Hugh.
Junuh.
I'll have a double scotch.
Pretty entertaining out there today.
That's what the people want.
Entertainment.
I got a proposition, Junuh.
Exhibitions are the thing.
$5-10,000 for two days' work.
Would you like to go on tour with me?
We'd have good matches, but I'd win.
Then we'd split the money, 70-30.
You get the 30.
I'm not just looking for another payday here.
I couldn't breathe without golf.
I once had the next king of England hold the pin for me while I putted.
I did.
I've paid back everything golf gave me, many times over.
But now I'm on the receiving end.
It's the good life.
- Why me?
- Crowd likes you.
I think we have a lot in common, you and I.
You've got no illusions that there's anything worthwhile out there.
The meaning of it all is that there is no meaning.
You'd be good company, that's all.
Thanks, I'll think it over.
Hey.
I admire the way you're dealing with this match, Junuh.
Fighting the way you are, it's damn noble.
But no matter how good a fighter you are, just remember:
I can ask the king to hold the flag when I putt...
...but he won't give me his crown.
Neither is Bobby and neither am I.
I'm not asking for your crown, Walter.
If I wanted it bad enough,
I'd just take it.
Do you have something to discuss?
This might not be the right time--
I can win, Adele.
I can beat both of them.
Look in my eyes and tell me what you see.
Determination, pure determination.
Panic, Adele, pure panic.
I'm eight strokes behind the two greatest golfers.
They've never blown a lead, and I'll win.
- Know why?
- Panic?
That's right.
Oh, Junuh...
- ...you don't, by any chance--?
- Yes.
I ought to go back to my guests.
Yes, I should go back.
You will stay in touch...
...I can't wait another 12 years for the next installment.
Did you miss something about me?
Something I can feel gratified about depriving you of all these years?
I liked the way we danced.
I need the driver.
This is gonna take all I got.
That's a jigger. Help you keep it under the wind.
My putter's got more loft than this thing.
No, they about the same.
Good, I'll just putt the ball down the fairway.
Anything else?
Just bash the living shit out of it.
An iron? I guess it doesn't matter what you use...
...when you're eight strokes back.
- What club was that?
- Mid-iron.
- Some kind of driving iron.
- Extraordinarily hit, I'd say.
Pull the flag, Hardy!
Yes, sir!
Junuh eagled, picking up two strokes on the first hole.
That's it!
And he picked up another stroke when Jones bogeyed the second.
And two more on Hagen when he double-bogeyed the third.
Does that look like 180 yards to you?
No...
...it's 181.
Might want to play the ball back a bit.
He just hit a hole in one!
Hot dang!
I just seen a miracle with my own eyes!
He just hit a hole in one!
Homer, you're not gonna believe this,
Junuh made a hole in one!
He's coming back now!
He's gonna make it!
- You're kidding!
- What?
Junuh's making a run for it!
He's three from Jones and two from Hagen!
He made a hole in one! God bless
Savannah and the men she propagates!
Get back! How do you expect
Junuh to hit the ball?
His play in the third round was beautiful to watch.
While Jones and Hagen discovered new hazards...
... Junuh had discovered, as Bagger had so eloquently put it...
... how to stop thinking without falling asleep.
Junuh finished the third round one stroke behind.
It was a new match, and no one knew it better than Jones and Hagen.
- Can I have your autograph?
- Not now, girls.
Gents.
I don't believe Walter planned on exerting himself.
It was fun this morning, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.
This is my last match, Junuh.
I'm retiring.
You're at the top of your game.
I've got a wife, three children, and a law practice.
It's time to stop.
It's just a game, Junuh.
I'll never forget you winning the Georgia Open in 1916.
I never seen a swing so sweet...
...or a man get so much pleasure from it.
This is my last 18 holes, Junuh.
And I couldn't have picked a better way to end it.
Thank you, Bobby.
It is truly my pleasure.
I can't let you win out of sympathy.
You know that.
I do, and I have no intentions of losing my last match.
Thank you, Mr. Junuh.
Junuh!
Junuh, look over here!
Which would be more important to you, beating--?
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Give him some room. Thank you.
- I'd like to have a word with you.
- This isn't a good time, Adele.
No, I think this is a very good time.
I don't want to do anything that might disrupt your concentration...
...but since our little encounter,
I've been thinking....
Ten years and not a single, solitary word from you?
You don't do that to someone you love.
I deserve some correspondence, and some indication of what you felt.
I don't know what happened to you.
But whatever it was...
...it wasn't as unbearable...
...as a woman waiting with no end in sight...
...wondering if she's remembered or forgotten by the man she loves.
You never even said you were sorry.
Now I'm supposed to run into your arms and melt like butter on a hot muffin?
I'm sorry, Adele. I am truly sorry.
It's too late for "I'm sorry," Junuh!
Then tell me what to say.
It was too long ago.
No, it wasn't.
It was just a moment ago.
Did something happen since we talked last night?
No.
Not that I can think of.
Well, this is barely the place to talk about it.
You've got to go back to your game.
This town's gonna give you the biggest parade you've ever seen!
Junuh was playing a fierce fourth round.
And a wild thought began to percolate:
Junuh could win.
To the clouds, Junie!
- I think the driver.
- Give us a smile!
He smiled!
Well you got water out there on the left side, why not put your spoon out there with
Jones and Hagen and play this time smart?
I'm gonna hug the left, get there in two and close the door on them.
Hold yourself now, we've got four more holes to go. You can settle down a bit.
I've never been more settled.
An eagle and this thing is over.
That's 300 yards if it's an inch.
Longest drive of the day, Mr. Junuh.
I'm getting there in two.
Two-twenty-five, into the wind, out the bunker.
Jeez, the lifts too high.
So much for an eagle.
Says who? Where's that driving iron, Bagger?
There's a time to hit that shot and there's a time to leave it in the bag.
Which one of them times you feel this is?
Tell him. Tell him it's a mashie...
- ...so he can have one easy shot--
- That's amazing.
Man's gonna go for the green with that clinky thing?
- He's got the guts of a Greek god.
- I don't care if he's son of Zeus...
...that ball won't clear the water.
I hope you're all paying customers.
- Junuh--
- Hush yourself, Hardy.
If at first you don't succeed....
Which would make your spot...
...right here, Junuh.
Give it to him, move.
When Junuh dropped that ball...
... it was as if every heart in Savannah dropped with it.
None landing harder than his own.
You gonna be wanting a different club, Junuh?
I can't do this.
Just loose your grip up a smidge.
- A man's grip is like a--
- That's not what I'm talking about.
- I know.
- No, you don't.
What I'm talking about is a game...
...a game that can't be won...
- ...only played.
- You don't understand.
I don't need to understand.
Ain't a soul who ain't got a burden to carry he don't understand.
You ain't alone in that.
But you've been carrying this one long enough.
Time to go on, lay it down.
I don't know how.
You got a choice.
You can stop...
- ...or you could start.
- Start?
- Walking.
- Where?
Back to where you've been and then stand there.
Still.
Real still, and remember.
- It was too long ago.
- No, sir, it was just a moment ago.
Time to come on out the shadows, Junuh.
Time for you to choose.
- I can't.
- You can.
You ain't alone.
I'm right here with you.
I've been here all along.
Now play the game.
Your game. The one that only you was meant to play.
The one given to you when you was born.
You ready?
Come on, take your stance.
Strike that ball, Junuh.
Don't hold nothing back.
Now's the time.
Let yourself remember.
Remember your swing.
That's right, Junuh.
Settle yourself, that's good.
Now is the time, Junuh.
Let's go, Hardy.
Hey, Bagger.
- You are one hell of a caddy.
- I do the best with what I got.
We ain't done yet.
By the 17th,
Junuh got his swing back.
You have the right to call the game on account of darkness.
That crowd will string us up by our thumbs if we do.
All right! Play will continue!
This is when I need pals in the mermaids' union.
Cars! Get your cars, boys!
I want every car on this property lined up with lights blazing!
I don't care if you're kitchen help or Savannah police, get your car!
Does he have a shot?
Then Hagen came back from the dead.
You got a smoke?
Tell Spec to hold the flag in case I make it.
I want a three iron.
Get my shoes, will you?
- What's going on?
- Hagen wants Spec to hold the flag.
I'm gonna miss playing Walter.
Don't hold nothing back.
The ball moved.
No.
It moved.
I have to call a stroke on myself.
No!
No, don't do it! Please don't do it.
Only you and me seen it, and I won't tell a soul. I promise.
Nobody will know.
I will, Hardy.
So will you.
You've got to tell him not to do it.
It's a stupid rule that don't mean nothing.
That's a choice for Mr. Junuh.
No one wanted the penalty assessed, not even Jones and Hagen.
This was no way to win a match.
Maybe you're mistaken, Junuh.
Maybe It moved before you touched the impediment.
Might not have moved at all.
The light plays tricks.
"A ball is deemed to have moved if it leaves its original position...
...but not if it merely oscillates and returns to its original position."
Is she different?
Can you be certain?
Sometimes a ball will shudder and then settle back again, Junuh.
The ball was here, and it rolled to here.
Hit it quick, before you have time to think.
You're leaving.
Yes, sir. Yes, I am.
I need you.
No.
No, you don't.
Not no more.
There is a small matter, around about $5.
It was guaranteed.
Yes, it was.
You won't need these shoes back now that I broke them in to my foot.
Thank you, sir.
This man is yours, Hardy.
Take him on in.
You want me...
...to take over for you?
You leaving me?
Only for a little while.
You pick up Mr. Junuh's bag.
You tote it real straight.
But what if something comes up...
...and I don't know what to do?
I got a feeling you'll figure it out.
I'll be seeing you.
Wait. What's going on?
You can't leave him now, he needs you.
You're the only chance he's got.
You go, and you'll never caddy in Georgia again!
You hear?!
Where's Junuh lie?
Two and a penalty. This is three.
I can't hit it any better than that.
Judging from the sound, I think
I knocked your ball in the cup.
Interesting match.
I always thought so.
Out of the way. Step back.
Hagen and Jones both lay two, a shot ahead of Junuh.
If either of them sank their putts,
Junuh would lose.
What do you think, Hardy?
Well....
The night air's gotten colder.
My guess is it's put a layer of dew on the warmer grass...
...which will slow your ball down.
Why don't you go stand with your father?
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.
Go on.
That is one tough shot.
Make it.
Rannulph Junuh of Savannah, Georgia, has tied Mr. Jones and Mr. Hagen...
...in the greatest golf match the world has ever seen!
That was the last match in competition Bobby Jones ever played.
From that time on, Walter Hagen played only exhibition matches.
As for Captain Rannulph Junuh and Adele Invergordon...
... they did have that dance.
And me?
Well it seems like yesterday
I used to see old guys like me...
... and wonder why they still bothered with this crazy game.
But it doesn't matter.
As Bagger once said, "It's a game that can't be won, only played."
And so I play.
I play on.
I play for the moments yet to come...
... looking for my place in the field.
Who am I? You sure you want to know?
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...
... if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...
... somebody lied.
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...
... is all about a girl.
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.
The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.
Hey! Stop the bus!
That's me.
Tell him to stop! Please!
Stop!
Hey! Stop the bus!
Stop! He's been chasing us since Woodhaven.
Catch a cab, Parker!
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.
What a geek!
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.
Would you date him?
Midtown High seniors.
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.
Remember, it is a privilege to be here.
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.
So behave accordingly.
Let's not have a repeat of our trip to the planetarium.
Come on, stay together.
Proceed up the steps and into the building.
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?
The entrance is right there.
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.
I should trade my car for a Jetta...
...because you flunked out of private school?
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.
It's just...
Just what, Harry?
Forget it.
Pete!
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.
- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.
- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.
I'm something of a scientist myself.
I read your research on nanotechnology. Brilliant.
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.
- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.
I think he wants to adopt you.
There are over 32,000 known species of spider in the world.
There are over 32,000 known species of spider in the world.
They're in the order Araneae, divided into three suborders.
That's amazing!
This is the most advanced electron microscope on the East Coast.
It's unreal.
Arachnids from all three groups possess...
...varying strengths to help them search for food.
For example, the Delena spider, family Sparassidae...
...has the ability to jump to catch its prey.
For the school paper?
Next, we have the net web spider, family Filistatidae...
...genus Kukulcania.
Spins a funnel- shaped web whose strands have a tensile strength...
...proportionately equal to the high-tension wires used in bridges.
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?
Or his father will fire your father.
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?
What is going on?
The next person who talks will fail this course.
- This spider...
- Let's go.
...hunts using reflexes with nerve- conduction velocity so fast...
...that some researchers believe it borders on precognition.
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.
A spider- sense.
Hey, look at that spider.
Some spiders change colors to blend into their environment.
It's a defense mechanism.
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?
Who wouldn't?
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.
With these DNA blueprints, we have begun what was once thought impossible.
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.
I love them!
Yeah, me too.
You know, spiders can change their color...
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.
- Transfer RNA to encode an entirely new genome...
...combining the genetic information from all three...
...into these 15 genetically designed super- spiders.
There's 14.
I beg your pardon?
- One's missing.
- Yeah.
I guess the researchers are working on that one.
Do you know that this is the largest electron microscope on the East Coast?
You were talking throughout that woman's entire presentation.
Let's talk about listening.
I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools...
I don't know what it's like at those fancy private schools...
...but at Midtown High...
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.
- Sure.
- Great.
Where do you want me?
Over here?
Yeah, that's great.
Don't make me look ugly.
That's impossible.
Perfect.
- Is that good?
- Great.
That's great.
M.J., let's go!
Wait. Thanks!
Parker, let's do it.
We've solved the horizon glide and the balance issues.
I've already seen the glider.
That's not what I'm here for.
General Slocum, good to see you again.
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.
Always a pleasure to have our board of directors visit.
I want the report on human performance enhancers.
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?
Once.
All the tests since have been successful.
In the trial that went wrong, what were the side effects?
Violence, aggression...
...and insanity.
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.
Except for Dr. Stromm, our staff certifies the product...
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?
We need to take the whole line back to formula.
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.
I'll be frank with you.
I never supported your program. We have my predecessor to thank for that.
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...
...to build a prototype of their exoskeleton.
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...
...have not had a successful human trial by that date...
...l'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.
Gentlemen. Ladies.
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.
I'm already on my ass, May.
When the plant's senior electrician is laid off after 35 years...
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.
Hand me that dish. The green one.
The corporation is downsizing the people...
...and upsizing their profits.
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job somewhere.
Well, let's look in the paper and see.
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?
Computer...
Computer salesman, computer engineer, computer analyst.
My Lord, even the computers need analysts these days.
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and besides, I have a family to provide for.
I love you. And Peter loves you.
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.
How you doing? How was the field trip?
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.
- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.
Did you get some pictures, Peter?
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.
What's that all about?
In this recombination lab...
... we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...
... combining the genetic
information from all three...
... into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.
The data just doesn't justify this test.
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.
Don't be a coward.
Risks are part of laboratory science.
Let me reschedule, with a medical staff and a volunteer.
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.
Sometimes you gotta do things yourself.
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?
It begins catalyzation when the vapor hits the bloodstream.
40,000 years of evolution...
...and we've barely tapped the vastness of human potential.
Oh, that's cold.
Norman?
Norman!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Norman!
Back to formula?
Weird.
- Peter?
- Yeah?
Are you all right?
I'm fine.
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?
Yep. Big change.
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.
Okay.
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.
- I got better.
- See?
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?
Don't forget, we're painting the kitchen after school.
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.
And don't start up with me.
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?
Hi, M.J.
Hey, M.J.
I don't know if you realize this, but we've been neighbors since I was 6.
And I was wondering if we could get together sometime?
I got the car. Hop in.
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.
I thought it'd be time to get to know each other.
Or not.
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!
Tell him to stop.
- Check him out!
- Dork!
Dad!
Dad, are you all right?
Harry.
What are you doing on the floor?
I don't know.
Have you been there all night?
Last night I was...
What?
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?
Sir, I asked her to wait.
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.
What?
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.
- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...
- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.
Wow! Great reflexes!
- Thanks.
- No problem.
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.
You just get contacts?
Well, see you.
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.
Did you see that?
Parker?
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?
- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.
- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.
Help him, Harry.
How'd he do that?
Which one?
He's all yours, man.
Flash, get up!
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.
That was amazing.
I'm out of here. Come on.
Go, web!
Fly.
Up, up and away, web.
Shazam!
Go! Go!
Go, web, go!
Tallyho.
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?
Bring me some beer.
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!
You're as stupid as your mother.
Where's she going?
Where you going?
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!
- Were you listening to that?
- No.
Well, I heard, but I was just taking out the trash.
I guess you can always hear us.
Everybody shouts.
Your aunt and uncle don't.
Oh, they can scream pretty good sometimes.
Listen, M.J., about today at school with Flash...
You really freaked us out.
I'm sorry. Is he okay?
He's just happy you didn't give him a black eye for graduation.
So where are you going after you graduate?
I wanna move into the city.
And hopefully, get a job as a photographer.
Work my way through college.
What about you?
Headed for the city too.
Can't wait to get out of here.
I wanna...
What?
No, come on. Try me.
I wanna...
...act...
...on-stage.
Really?
Oh, that's perfect.
You were awesome in all the school plays.
- Really?
- Yeah.
I cried like a baby when you played Cinderella.
Peter, that was first grade.
Well...
...even so.
Sometimes...
...you know people.
You can just see what's coming.
What do you see coming for you?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.
And what for me?
For you?
You're gonna light up Broadway.
You know...
...you're taller than you look.
I hunch.
Don't.
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride in my new birthday present.
Come on.
I gotta go.
Bye.
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.
- Look at it!
- Hop in.
Oh, my God. What a cool car!
Pretty tight, huh?
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.
Cool car.
What's going on in there?
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.
Well, you're acting so strangely, Peter.
Okay. Thanks.
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.
I just don't know anymore.
I'm going to the library.
See you later.
- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.
You shirk your chores. You have all those weird experiments in your room.
- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.
- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?
No, you're not supposed to run away, but...
You're changing. I went through exactly the same thing at your age.
No. Not exactly.
These are the years when a man changes...
...into the man he's gonna become the rest of his life.
Just be careful who you change into.
This guy, Flash Thompson, he probably deserved what happened.
But just because you can beat him up...
...doesn't give you the right to.
Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.
Then stop pretending to be!
Right.
I'll pick you up here at 10.
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?
Ladies and gentlemen...
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.
For $3000...
...is there no one here man enough to stay in the ring...
...for three minutes with this titan of testosterone?
Who?
I know who.
The Flying Dutchman!
Next.
There's no featherweight division here. Next.
No, no. Sign me up.
Okay. You understand the NYWL is not responsible...
...for any injury you may and probably will sustain in said event?
And you're participating under your own free will?
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.
Told you! Told you!
Winner!
Next victim!
Are you ready for more?
Bone Saw is ready!
Will the next victim please enter the arena at this time?
If he can withstand just three minutes in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.
That's it? That's the best you got?
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...
...the terrifying, the deadly...
...the amazing Spider- Man!
- It's "The Human Spider."
- Get out there.
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.
Bone Saw will eat you up and spit you out.
I hope you brought your mommy.
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.
I'm gonna rip all eight of your feeble legs off one by one.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my legs!
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Cage! Cage! Cage!
Cage!
Hello? Guys?
Will the guards please lock the cage doors at this time?
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!
Hey, freak show!
You're going nowhere.
I got you for three minutes.
Three minutes of playtime.
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?
Finish him off!
Smash him!
- Hit him!
- Harder!
Kick his spider ass!
Hit him!
One, two, three!
That's it! That's it!
Winner!
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up for the new champion, Spider- Man!
Now get out of here.
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.
Well, check it again, webhead.
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.
I need that money.
I missed the part where that's my problem.
- Hey, what the hell...?
- Put the money in the bag.
Hurry up!
Hey! He stole the gate!
Stop that guy!
Stop him! He's got my money!
Thanks.
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!
Cut him off and call the cops!
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.
I missed the part where that's my problem.
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?
Old dude, man.
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.
Uncle Ben?
Uncle Ben.
Uncle Ben?
Peter.
I'm here, Uncle Ben.
Peter.
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.
Get a unit to the rear!
I got the back!
Who's there?
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?
Answer me!
Stop that guy!
Thanks.
See you.
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.
Oh, no. My God.
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.
Our exoskeleton's got real firepower, general.
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.
- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.
Now, what about your commitment to OSCORP?
Nothing would please me more than to put Osborn out of business.
Preflight complete. Mark.
An unidentified object
is closing fast.
What's that?
Can you see anything?
Oh, my God!
- Say "chess."
- Chess!
Peter!
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.
Dad got the place in New York, so we're all set for fall.
- Great!
- You made it.
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.
Yeah.
I know this has been a difficult time for you...
...but I want you to try to enjoy this day.
Commencement:
The end of one thing, the start of something new.
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.
You know what? Whatever.
Your loss.
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.
And if you ever need anything, give me a call.
Can I fix you something?
No, thanks.
I missed him a lot today.
I know.
I miss him too.
But he was there.
I can't help thinking about the last thing I said to him.
He tried to tell me something important, and I threw it in his face.
You loved him...
...and he loved you.
He never doubted the man you'd grow into.
How you were meant for great things.
You won't disappoint him.
With great power
comes great responsibility.
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.
Hurry up!
He's not a man. My brother saw him build a nest in Lincoln Center.
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.
Bobby. Get a load of this!
He throws up his hands, ropes come out, and he climbs up them.
I see the web, his signature, and I know Spider- Man was here.
The guy protects us, protects the people.
Some kind of freakyloo or something.
He stinks and I don't like him.
Don't move, lady!
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.
Those tights and that tight little...
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug
But we should all just give him
One big hug
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man
"Who is Spider- Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.
- Well?
- He's news.
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.
He's probably going to save somebody else. He's a hero!
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?
She needs to know if you want chintz or chenille.
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:
We double- booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?
Every copy.
Tomorrow, Spider- Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.
- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.
- That can't be done.
- Get out!
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's on it, but we can barely see him.
Aw, what is he, shy?
If we can get Julia Roberts in a thong, we can get this weirdo.
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider- Man picture."
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!
Buzz off.
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?
Yeah.
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.
That's great.
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!
Your drawer was short $6!
Next time, I'll take it from your check.
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.
Some dream, huh?
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?
Oh, yeah. Right.
I think he'd hate the idea of my waiting tables.
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.
You know, Harry doesn't live on a little place I like to call Earth.
No, I guess not.
Thanks, Pete.
We should catch up sometime.
Let's get some lunch some evening.
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.
- And I won't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry.
I won't.
I won't tell Harry.
Timing's perfect. Hey.
Five new contracts. It'll be great.
Norman's making his weekly inspection.
Spent half of it on the phone.
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.
Are you all right?
You look like you just got second place in the science fair.
I was late for work and Dr. Connors fired me.
You were late again?
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?
Around.
Peter Parker.
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who?
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.
When do I get to meet her?
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.
Pete, you're probably looking for a job now, right?
Dad, maybe you can help him out.
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- I'll make a few calls.
I couldn't accept it. I like to earn what I get. I'll find work.
I respect that.
You want to make it on your own.
That's great.
What other skills do you have?
I was thinking about photography.
Hello.
Let's go! Move it!
Watch the street!
Cheese!
They're crap.
Crap, crap. Megacrap.
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.
Take them somewhere else.
- Your wife says the tile's out of stock.
- We'll put a rug there.
Sit down. Give me that.
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.
- Scrap page one. Run that.
- Headline?
"Spider- Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos."
- Menace? He was protecting...
- You take the photos...
...l'll make up the headlines. Okay?
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.
Best thing for you.
You bring me more shots of that clown, maybe I'll buy them.
But I never said you have a job. Meat.
I'll send you a box of Christmas meat. Bring me more photos.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mr. Jameson told me to give that to you.
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.
I'm Peter Parker.
I'm a photographer.
Yes. I can see that.
As of today...
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...
...as the principal supplier to the United States military.
In short, ladies and gentlemen of the board...
...costs are down, revenues are up...
...and our stock has never been higher.
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.
What?
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake of the bombing. Expanding.
They made a tender offer we can't ignore.
Why wasn't I told?
They don't want a power struggle with entrenched management.
The deal is off if you come with it.
The board expects your resignation in 30 days.
You can't do this to me.
I started this company.
You know how much I sacrificed?!
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.
We're announcing the sale after the World Unity Festival.
I'm sorry.
You're out, Norman.
Am I?
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Welcome to OSCORP Industries
Unity Day Festival.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.
M.J., why didn't you wear the black dress?
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.
Well, maybe he'll be impressed no matter what. You think I'm pretty.
I think you're beautiful.
I forgot my drink inside.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.
- Have you seen my father?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.
What is that?
That's our glider!
What the hell was that?
Code three!
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!
Harry! Help me! Harry!
Out, am I?
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!
Hello, my dear.
It's Spider- Man!
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!
Somebody help him!
No!
Mommy!
- Hold it!
- I surrender.
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!
Lmpressive.
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!
Hold on!
Watch out!
We'll meet again, Spider- Man!
Well, beats taking the subway.
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.
Wait.
Who are you?
- You know who I am.
- I do?
Your friendly neighborhood Spider- Man.
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.
No, I'm gonna come...
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?
And we'll go and have breakfast and...
...I want to buy you something.
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.
Okay. And what do you mean, incredible?
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs...
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.
Look, Pete, I should have told you about us.
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.
It's just, you know, you never made a move.
You're right.
I didn't.
I'm gonna get some rest.
I'm gonna stay up for a while.
What was that thing?
I don't know.
Whatever it is, somebody has to stop it.
Somebody there?
Somebody.
Somebody.
Who said that?
Don't play the innocent with me.
You've known all along.
Where are you?
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.
I'm right here.
I don't understand.
Did you think it was coincidence?
So many good things, all happening for you.
All for you. Norman.
What do you want?
To say what you won't.
To do what you can't.
To remove those in your way.
The board members.
You killed them.
We killed them.
We?
Remember?
Your little accident in the laboratory.
The performance enhancers.
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.
Bringing you what you've always wanted:
Power beyond your wildest dreams.
And it's only the beginning.
There's only one who can stop us.
Or imagine if he joined us.
Spider- Man. And the Green Goblin.
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.
- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson...
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?
Copyright "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.
How about "Green Meanie"?
Spider- Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.
It is not. I resent that.
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.
You don't trust anybody.
I trust my barber.
Are you his lawyer?
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal person. That's what made this country...
Jameson, you slime.
Who takes the pictures of Spider- Man?
- I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
- Liar!
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.
Set him down, tough guy.
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad talk for a minute.
Sleep...
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.
No, you're not dead yet.
Just paralyzed...
...temporarily.
You're an amazing creature,
Spider- Man.
You and I are not so different.
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.
Well, to each his own.
I chose my path, you chose the way of the hero.
And they found you amusing for a while, the people of this city.
But the one thing they love more than a hero...
...is to see a hero fail, fall, die trying.
In spite of everything you've done for them, eventually, they will hate you.
Why bother?
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.
There are eight million people in this city.
And those teeming masses exist for the sole purpose...
...of lifting the few exceptional people onto their shoulders.
You, me...
...we're exceptional.
I could squash you like a bug right now.
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.
Imagine what we could accomplish together.
What we could create.
Or we could destroy.
Cause the deaths of countless innocents in selfish battle...
...again and again and again until we're both dead. Is that what you want?
Think about it, hero.
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.
It's me again.
How was your audition?
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...
...told my aunt, told me.
So you just came by?
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.
I took two buses and a cab to get in the neighborhood, but...
So how'd it go?
They said I needed acting lessons.
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.
I'd like a cheeseburger.
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner with Harry.
Come with us.
No, thanks. How's it going with...?
Never mind.
That's none of my business.
It's not?
Why so interested?
I'm not.
You're not?
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.
Why would you be?
I, that's a...
I don't know.
Sorry you won't come with us.
I'd better run, tiger.
Hey, check it out, man.
Come on, man.
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!
Get off me!
Wait!
You have a knack for getting in trouble.
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.
I was in the neighborhood.
You are amazing.
Some people don't think so.
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.
Do I get to say thank you this time?
Wait.
Let me in! My baby's in there!
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!
Look! Up there!
Save my baby, please!
No!
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!
God bless you, Spider- Man.
Bless you.
Don't let him get away!
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.
Oh, my God, there's somebody still up there!
I'm going.
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back.
Go! Go!
Where are you?
Where are you?
I'm gonna get you out of here!
It's okay.
You're pathetically predictable.
Like a moth to the flame.
What about my generous proposal?
Are you in or are you out?
- It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.
Oh, great.
No one says no to me!
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.
He's here.
Are you ready?
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.
Who is this lovely young lady?
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?
He'd better remember that cranberry sauce.
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.
Peter?
Is that you?
How strange. There's nobody here.
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!
It's a jungle out there.
Had to beat an old lady with a stick to get these cranberries.
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...
...and we can say grace.
Here we go.
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.
Will you do the honors?
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.
I stepped off a curb and got clipped by one of those bike messengers.
Well, let me see.
Oh, my goodness.
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving here, and we'll do things properly.
How did you say that happened?
Bike messenger.
Knocked me down.
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?
Something has come to my attention.
Are you all right?
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!
I planned this so you'd meet M.J., and now you have to leave?
I've got to go.
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.
Think she's sniffing around because she likes your personality?
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful.
They're all beautiful until they're snarling after your money like wolves.
You're wrong, Dad.
A word to the not-so-wise about your girlfriend:
Do what you need to with her, then broom her fast.
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.
Shut up about stuff you don't understand!
Harry Osborn!
I'm sorry, Aunt May.
Spider-Man is all but invincible.
But Parker, we can destroy him.
I can't.
Betrayal must not be countenanced.
Parker must be educated.
What do I do?
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.
Yes?
And then grant his wish.
But how?
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.
Tell me how!
The heart, Osborn.
First, we attack his heart.
Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses...
...as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us...
Deliver us!
Finish it!
- Finish it!
- From evil!
Two milligrams IV.
Get the BP.
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?
You have to leave.
- What happened?
- Those eyes!
Those horrible yellow eyes!
He knows who I am.
I'm sorry.
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.
She's been sleeping all day.
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.
How are you?
You okay about the other night?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad about leaving Aunt May.
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.
I haven't called him back.
The fact is...
...l'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?
At least I think I am.
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.
Would I know his name, this guy?
You'll think I'm a little girl with a crush.
Trust me.
It's funny.
He's saved my life twice, and I've never even seen his face.
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.
But do you think it's true, all the terrible things they say?
Not Spider- Man, not a chance in the world.
I know him a little bit.
I'm sort of his unofficial photographer.
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.
What'd he say?
I said...
He asked me what I thought about you.
And what did you say?
I said, "Spider- Man."
I said, "The great thing about M. J...
...is...
...when you look in her eyes...
...and she's looking back in yours...
...everything feels...
...not quite normal.
Because you feel...
...stronger...
...and weaker at the same time.
You feel excited...
...and at the same time...
...terrified.
The truth is, you don't know what you feel...
...except you know what kind of man you want to be.
It's as if you've...
...reached the unreachable...
...and you weren't ready for it."
You said that?
Well, something like that.
Dad?
Dad, is that you?
What is it?
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.
She's in love with Peter.
- Parker?
- Yeah.
And how does he feel about her?
He's loved her since the 4th grade.
He pretends like he doesn't, but there's no one Peter cares for more.
I'm so sorry.
I haven't always been there for you, have I?
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.
That's no excuse.
I'm proud of you.
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.
I'm going to rectify certain inequities.
Wake up, little spider.
Wake up.
Go home, dear.
You look awful.
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.
A smile. Finally.
Haven't seen one of those on your face since Mary Jane was here.
You were supposed to be asleep.
You know, you were about 6 years old when M.J.'s family moved in next door.
When she got out of the car, and you saw her for the first time...
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.
Well, Harry's in love with her.
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.
You're so mysterious all the time.
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...
...to let Mary Jane know how much you care?
Everybody else knows.
I'll be right back.
But...
Come on, pick up.
- Hey M.J.
- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.
M.J., it's Peter. You there?
Hello? You there?
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?
All right, well...
Don't...
Don't go up any dark alleys.
Hello?
Can Spider-Man come out to play?
Where is she?
- What is that?
- That's cool!
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out
Goblin, what have you done?
Spider- Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.
Because you never know...
...when some lunatic will come along with a sadistic choice:
Let die the woman you love...
...or suffer the little children.
- Spider- Man!
- Save us!
Save us!
Make your choice, Spider- Man...
...and see how a hero is rewarded.
Don't do it, Goblin!
We are who we choose to be.
- Now, choose!
- No!
Everybody stay still!
Ahoy up there!
We're gonna bring the barge right under you.
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!
M.J., you can do it. You have to.
Trust me.
Hold on tight and go quickly.
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!
It's time to die.
- I got something for you!
- We ought to kick your ass!
Leave Spider- Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?
You mess with Spidey, you mess with New York!
You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!
Spider- Man, watch out!
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.
I offered you friendship...
...and you spat in my face.
You've spun your last web, Spider- Man.
Had you not been so selfish, your girlfriend's death...
...would have been quick.
But now that you've really pissed me off...
...l'm gonna finish her nice and slow.
M.J. And I...
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.
Peter, stop!
Stop! It's me.
Mr. Osborn.
Thank God for you.
You killed those people on that balcony.
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!
Don't let him take me again.
I beg you. Protect me.
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.
But not you.
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.
I would never hurt you.
I knew from the beginning...
...if anything ever happened to me...
...it was you I could count on.
You, Peter Parker, would save me, and so you have.
Thank God for you.
Give me your hand.
Believe in me as I believed in you.
I've been like a father to you.
Be a son to me now.
I have a father.
His name was Ben Parker.
Godspeed, Spider- Man.
Peter.
Don't tell Harry.
What have you done?
What have you done?!
I'm so sorry, Harry.
I know what it's like to lose a father.
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.
One day Spider- Man will pay.
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider- Man will pay.
Thank God for you, Peter.
You're the only family I have.
No matter what I do...
... no matter how hard I try...
... the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.
You must miss him so much.
It's been so hard without him.
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.
When I was up there...
...and I thought I was gonna die...
...there was only one person who I was thinking of.
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.
It was you, Pete.
I kept thinking:
"I hope I make it through this...
...so I can see Peter Parker's face one more time."
Really?
There's only one man who's always been there for me...
...who makes me feel...
...like I'm more than I ever thought I could be.
That I'm just...
...me.
And that's okay.
The truth is...
...I love you.
I love you so much, Peter.
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.
I can't...
You can't what?
Tell you...
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.
Yeah. There's so much to tell.
I want you to know...
...that I will always be there for you.
I will always be there to take care of you.
I promise you that.
I will always be your friend.
Only a friend...
...Peter Parker?
That's all I have to give.
Whatever life holds in store for me...
...I will never forget these words:
"With great power
comes great responsibility. "
This is my gift.
My curse.
Who am I?
I'm Spider-Man.

This is Rachel. How can I help you?
This is Elliot.
How can I help you?
Oh.
[Chuckles]
Oh, wow.
Yeah, okay.
Give me a second to find you here.
My computer's running a little slow today.
Wake up, fella.
Oh, there you are.
Hey, you got yourself a model 5732,
128 megs of RAM, 27 gig hard drive.
Good. Good. And you say that it hangs every time you try and print?
Wow. All right,
no problem.
Can you hold for two seconds?
Carol! Carol.
I don't know what you've been told, little lady, but the rest of us start at 9:00.
[Chuckling]
I'm kidding. I'm just kidding.
Good morning.
Hey, Dan, my man!
What's up, my bro?
Put it there.
All right. Yeah.
So, hoops today? You and the guys up for some hoopage after work?
Uh, you know, we don't know yet, Elliot.
I'm not sure yet, okay?
Oh, that's cool, man.
Just let me know, 'cause I'm there, bud.
'Cause I love the round ball.
That's why they call me "Air Elliot."
- [Imitating Crowd Cheering]
- Okay.
Well, you know, make sure that you let me know the right time,
'cause last week you said 6:30, and when I got there you guys were just leaving.
- How stupid did you feel?
- Pretty stupid, Elliot.
Not a problem, Danny.
Give it up.
- [Man] Hey, Daniel.
- Hey, man, how you doing?
Hey, Bob.
- What's up?
- Hey, Elliot.
So, uh, you and your posse gonna hit the brewery tonight?
My posse? No.
Uh, they're all busy with the big, uh...
What's wrong with your neck?
Uh, nothing.
It's repetitive stress disorder.
It's a headset injury.
What do you say you and me go knock back suds and check out the babes?
Elliot, I'm married, remember?
I'm gonna go home and spend some time with my wife.
Ohhh.
Taking a trip to Whipville.
[Imitates Whip Snapping]
Oooh.
That just gets funnier every time you do that.
- Don't-Don't-Don't...
- [Elliot] Hey, Jerry!
#Jerry, Jerry, bo-berry fee, fie, fo-ferry, Jerry ##
What's happening, brother?
Uh, running to an important meeting.
Oh, yeah?
I think you're gonna appreciate this
'cause we're both stereo component nuts.
Check these out, homes.
These are the new Ingebritzens.
Right.
XVC speakers. Here, look it.
That's the back of the left speaker.
And here's the front of the right speaker.
Sweet, sweet.
That's the front of the left...
No, that's the right speaker.
- I think... Oh, man!
- [Dan] What?
It's Elliot.
Who told him we were here?
Oh!
Hi.
You guys.
Well, well, well, isn't this a big surprise?
I thought everybody was busy.
- Uh, slight change of plans, Elliot.
- Oh, is that right?
Well, I'm a little bit peeved at you guys.
I'm thinking you tried to ditch me.
I'm thinking I might
not even sit down with you.
We can understand that.
See you tomorrow.
Later, Elliot.
I'm kidding.
- Wanna switch places with me?
- No, I'm fine.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
[Dan Chuckling]
You've got to be kidding me.
[Bob]
Please, please don't tell me you have
a thing for Alison Gardner. Please.
[Jerry]
You're way out of your league.
[Carol] Plant life is out of his...
Isn't she dating
that guy, uh, uh, in research?
Brian, with the teeth...
Brad, Brian... the guy with the teeth.
No, that's been over for three months now.
- Oh, yeah? How do you know?
- I know a lot of things about her.
I know... I know that she likes her bagels buttered, but not toasted.
- Wow.
- How specific.
I know that she looks beautiful in any color,
but when she wears blue...
- [Dan] Mm-mm-mm.
- Sounds like you guys are old friends.
Well, we have been working at the same company for four years now.
You spend that much time together, you get to know each other.
So it should be really no problem for you to just get up, walk over and say hello to her.
She's with somebody.
I'll catch up with her tomorrow.
Yeah. Oh!
Come on, Elliot.
Come clean here.
You have never spoken to Alison Gardner, right?
Of course I have.
- Did I say "queer" earlier?
- Oh, you are pathetic, Elliot.
Really, you're pathetic.
Okay. I guess you guys are just not gonna let me relax until I go over there and say hello.
- [All Murmuring Agreement]
- Wow. That'll make you happy?
You think I'm pathetic?
- Don't touch me.
- [Carol] Go for it, tiger.
Good luck.
I'm gonna go.
See you later.
- Hi.
- Hi. Do I know you?
Oh, I should hope so.
Uh, we've only been working together at Synedyne for the last four years.
I'm Elliot Richards.
We-We've spoken.
I'm sorry. I-I don't...
It was the first week of June three years ago.
I said it was "wet out."
We were standing in the lobby and I said it was "really wet out."
- It was raining at the time.
- I assumed that.
Yeah.
So, here we are talking again.
Yeah.
Uh, well, take it easy.
You know, I'm here with some friends and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to...
Dear God, I would give anything to have that girl in my life.
## [Tone Loc's "Wild Thing"]
- Hi.
- Hello.
Uh, I was wondering if, uh, this is...
Uh, I was standing over there and the...
You're very glib.
I bet you're a whiz with the ladies.
- Well...
- You here alone?
No, uh, I'm here with some buddies from work...
- I saw you talking to a woman.
- Um...
Yeah, yeah.
But... I'm not with her.
But you'd like to be, huh?
- What makes you say that?
- Oh, I don't know.
When a man says he'd give anything to have a certain woman in his life,
I just assume she means something to him.
How did you hear me say that?
I was standing all the way over...
I have fantastic hearing, and a number of other equally impressive talents.
Ho-doggie!
Let's go someplace quiet so we can talk.
Um, okay. You... What?
You wanna talk to me?
Is that a problem?
You're not attracted to me?
Uh, no.
I think you're hot.
Baby, you have no idea.
- Kiss me.
- What? Here?
Don't be afraid to explore new horizons.
Um...
Can you give us two seconds, girls?
Yeah, can you give us two seconds?
Sure. Whatever.
Listen. Whoo!
[Exhales]
You seem really nice... in a strong, scary kind of a way.
But my friends are, uh, probably waiting for me, so, I'm... I'm gonna just get going.
You're so nervous, Elliot.
How do you know my name?
I'm psychic.
Plus, it's on your name tag.
Duh.
Now, then, I just wanna
talk business for a second.
Oh, um, I'm not into that.
I mean, l... I've never paid for sex before.
Except this one time.
It was an Internet thing.
You can't help it. Every time you sign on, it's sex, sex, sex.
I'm not a hooker, you silly boy.
I just wanna ask you a question.
How would you like to make
one simple decision... that'll change your life forever?
Okay, I'm glad Scientology works for you, but...
Just listen.
What if I told you that
I had the cataclysmic power... to give you anything and everything you've always dreamed of?
- Who are you?
- Promise not to tell anyone?
Okay.
Cross your heart and hope to die?
Yeah.
I'm the Devil.
Okay.
I think somebody's had
"tee many martoonis."
I am the Devil, Satan, Lucifer,
Beelzebub, the Prince of Darkness.
Well, the Princess of Darkness, anyway.
Here's my card.
Oh.
"The Devil." Yep.
That explains it.
Now I believe you.
Night-night.
[Screams]
You're a very skeptical person, you know that?
How did you...
How did you just... And you...
- What's...
- Look.
If you could just buy into this whole "I'm the Devil" thing, it'll save us both a lot of these questions.
Maybe I should call you a cab.
Although it's gonna be hard to find one that'll go to Hell this time of night.
Ooh, what a delightfully piquant wit.
I can see we're gonna get along famously.
Cheers, darling.
What are...
You can't... Look at...
Geez!
You can't do that.
That's very dangerous.
Listen here. Why is this so hard for you to believe?
Do you think your mommy and daddy just made me up so you'd be a good boy?
Okay, okay, you're the Devil.
What do you want with me?
I want you to be happy, Elliot.
You have such potential.
All you need is a little push in the right direction.
- I am happy.
- Oh, please.
You don't have to lie to me.
I know every dark thought in your tiny little mind.
I know that every night you go home to your horrible little apartment... and you eat your little frozen dinner and you make your little bowl of popcorn... and you watch TV and you can't keep your eyes open anymore.
And then you crawl off to bed... and wonder why you're alone and nobody likes you.
- Not every night.
- And you cry.
Yeah, sure.
I know what's in your heart, Elliot.
You could cry right now.
I'm talking about reinvention.
Taking control of your destiny.
You wanna be liked?
You wanna be loved?
How about respected?
How about feared?
What exactly are we talking about?
You wanna see how it works, baby?
Wish for something.
- Like what?
- Whatever you want.
It's yours.
Just say the word.
Okay, I... wish I had a Big Mac and a large Coke.
It is done.
## ["Wild Thing"]
Hi, how are you doing?
What can I get you?
- A Big Mac and a large Coke.
- fries?
- No.
- Comes to $3.47.
Do you have $3.47?
I left my purse in the underworld.
Oh, yes! This truly is the work of the Devil.
And to think that I doubted you.
I'm gonna go now.
- What's the problem?
- This doesn't prove anything!
I could have done this myself.
I even had to pay for it.
There's no such thing as a free lunch.
Didn't anyone ever tell you that?
- I didn't even get any fries!
- Oh, I don't believe this.
I'm offering you the opportunity of a lifetime and all you can do is moan about french fries?
- Good night.
- fine. Okay.
I'm obviously not getting through to you, so let's just forget it.
Come. I'll give you a lift back to your car.
That's your car?
[Engine Revving]
[Horn Honking]
[Truck Horn Honking]
Hey, hey!
[Woman]
There's Elliot!
[People Shouting,
Clamoring]
Elliot, right here.
Right here, Elliot.
Where are we?
Just a little after-hours club I own.
We better get in there.
Everyone's waiting for you.
- Everyone who?
- All your friends.
How are you doing,
Mr. Richards?
## [Techno Dance]
Hey, hey, Elliot.
- No way. This is your club?
- Sure is.
Wow!
[All Shouting]
Elliot!
Hello, Elliot.
- Hello.
- Elliot, dance with me first.
- No, Elliot, dance with me.
- He's dancing with me first.
You can dance with me.
[Devil] That's enough. Break it up. He belongs to me.
Hey, Elliot, how the hell are you?
Somebody take a picture of me and Elliot.
- Hold it.
- Excellent.
- Hi, Elliot.
- [Devil] Ooh.
I think she likes you too.
- You hungry?
- Sort of.
Look.
Wow. These look just like the cookies my grandma used to bake.
- Try one.
- Okay.
These are the cookies my grandma used to bake!
I aim to please, handsome.
- Come on.
- How did you...
- You liked that, didn't you?
- What, the cookie?
Having all those people excited to see you.
It's nice to feel accepted, isn't it?
I can give you that.
I can make the whole world love you.
- Come on.
- You still don't believe me.
- Do you?
- Of course not. first of all, you look nothing like the Devil.
Oh, really? I suppose
I could have gone this way.
- [Screams]
- But it's so "trick or treat."
It's true.
You really are the Devil.
Oh. Come on, baby.
Come and sit down.
I know this has all been horribly overwhelming for you.
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure you can.
You can ask me anything you like, as long as you don't ask me if there's a God.
I get that one all the time.
It drives me absolutely bonkers.
Yes, there's a God.
Really?
Well, what's He like?
You know, you'd think that meeting the Devil would be interesting enough, but no, all people want to know about is Him.
Like He's so bloody fascinating.
- So, He's a man?
- Yeah. Most men think they're God.
This one just happens to be right.
Now listen, darling.
I don't wanna pressure you, but why don't we take a teensy little look at the contract?
[Groaning]
This is pretty... Um...
"I, Elliot Richards, hereafter known as the Damned..."
- "The Damned"?
- How about "the Darned"? Sound better?
Don't get hung up on the language, darling.
There's nothing sinister here.
It's all standard boilerplate.
Paragraph one states that I, the Devil, a not-for-profit cooperation... with offices in Purgatory,
Hell and Los Angeles, will give you seven wishes... to use as you see fit.
Seven?
Why not eight?
Why not six? I don't know.
Seven just sounds right.
Paragraph two outlines the manner in which you'll pay for the aforementioned wishes.
[Mumbling]
What? Are you kidding?
I have to give you my soul?
After you've had your wishes, of course.
But it's my soul!
- I can't give you my soul!
- What are you, James Brown?
What's the big deal?
Have you ever seen your soul?
Do you even know what it is?
Of course.
It's the thing that... that...
No, that's the...
It floats around...
Can I tell you something?
Souls are overrated.
They don't really do anything.
Has yours done anything for you so far?
No. It's like your appendix.
You'll never even miss it.
Yeah, well, if it's so useless, then how come you want it so much?
Ooh, aren't you the clever one?
Look, who's really making out on this deal here?
Seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul?
Well, I don't know.
What have we here?
But who is that? Alison?
How did you...
She is so beautiful.
- I've been waiting for you for so long.
- Who's that?
- Who's she with?
- I want you now, my love.
- Why are you showing me this?
- I'm yours forever, my darling.
- [Gasps]
- Oh, I love your hair like that.
You must go through conditioner like crazy.
- Is this real?
- It could be.
All you have to do is sign.
And you promise I'll get her?
It's really up to you.
You're the one with the wishes.
But I promise
I'll do everything in my power.
Sign it, Elliot.
Please, Elliot. I'm waiting.
[Echoing]
[Echoing Continues]
[Wind Howling]
- [Thunderclap]
- Great!
Now, before you start wishing, you'll be needing this.
If for any reason your wish isn't going the way you hoped, just take out the pager, hit 666... and it'll bring you right back to me.
Why wouldn't it go the way that I'd hoped?
Oh, I was just throwing that out as a "for instance."
Every wish is gonna be
100% fabulous.
But you'll find that out as soon as you make one.
So, I should make one now?
Well, if you don't mind.
I've got places to go, people to condemn to an eternity of fiery torment.
Okay. Um, let me think.
- I wanna be married to Alison.
- You got it.
Um, that's not all.
I wanna be rich.
- Always a popular choice.
- That's not all.
I wanna be very rich and very powerful.
Oh, even better.
Remember, you have to say "I wish."
Right.
I wish that I were married to Alison... and that I were very, very rich and very powerful.
- How's that sound?
- Sounds good to me.
Enjoy.

Root of all evil. Ring any bells?
- What about Alison? What got into her?
- I think it was Raoul.
Yeah! That's not what I wished for.
Well, hold on now, mister.
You wished that the two of you were married.
You didn't say anything about her loving you.
Well, you know, when two people get married, I assume that...
There's your mistake.
May I suggest something?
What?
The rich and powerful thing wasn't really the way to go.
Everyone wishes for that first thing out of the gate and it never pans out.
- Really?
- The fact of the matter is... women aren't really attracted to wealth and power.
- They're not?
- No, of course not.
They couldn't give a fig for all that rubbish.
What you need to figure out is what she does want in a man.
How do I find that out?
Easy.
Easy.
[Horns Honking]
I'm not with her!
Where are we?
A place you never would
have seen without my help.
Welcome to Alison's bedroom.
[Meows]
We can't be in here. This is breaking and entering.
I know.
It's fun, isn't it?
I'm sure we're gonna find the answer somewhere around here.
- What if Alison catches us?
- Don't worry.
She won't be able to see you.
- Besides, she's in the shower... naked.
- [Shower Running]
Right behind that door.
Go on. Go ahead. Take a peep.
- No!
- Oh, come on. We both know you want to.
You must think that
I'm really perverted, don't you?
That's what you think.
You think I'm some sad, desperate, twisted, pathetic loser.
Yes.
Well, in that case, maybe
I'll just take a quick look.
Focus, Elliot. Remember, we're here
to find out what kind of man she wants.
- How are we gonna do that?
- Well, she keeps a journal.
Aha. And here it is.
Right. I should be able to find some information in here you'll find useful.
- Hey, that's private stuff.
- Is it ever. Listen to this.
"Last night was the most incredible night of my life.
"I never did find out any of the guys'
names, but I brought them back here... and all five of them banged me like a Salvation Army drum."
What?
Just kidding. I could have been a writer.
[Gasps]
Hey, it's okay. She could bump
into you and she wouldn't feel it.
Now, this is good.
[Alison's Voice]
"I meet many attractive men who are interested in me,
"and while many of them are handsome or clever or very successful,
"I find myself turning away
from them...
"and searching the horizon for someone else.
"I don't know who he is or where I'll find him.
"I only know that he is a sensitive man.
"He's a man who is in touch with his emotions.
"He's a man who's not afraid to share his fears,
"his disappointments and his tears.
Where are you,
my sensitive man?"
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
Did you see that?
She passed right through me.
We were one person for a split second, just like in Ghost.
Darling, I've got an earthquake in Chile in eight minutes.
Any chance of making a wish here?
Yes. I wish...
I were the most sensitive man in the world.
Right. Okay.
Wait! I wish I were the most emotionally sensitive man in the world.
Damn. I was hoping you wouldn't catch that.
I could have had a lot of fun with that one.
- And I want her to love me.
- Oh. You know what?
I have a great feeling about this.
- You do?
- Yeah, but... what do I know, right?
- Hey.
- I'm back, my love.
Where did you run off to?
I went to make a garland of beach plums... to place atop your glorious head like a crown.
But then I caught sight of that sunset and...
I don't know, something stirred inside me... and I had to stop and weep.
Mmm, it's beautiful.
It is.
- There I go again.
- Tissue?
No, I never wipe my tears away.
I'm not ashamed of them.
I wear them proudly, like small, wet, salty badges of emotional truth.
Elliot, um, there's something that
I think that we should talk about.
Um, we've been together for what, about three weeks now?
- Three magical weeks.
- Three magical weeks.
And I don't think that I've ever met a man who's been more in touch...
- with his feelings.
- I love you... so very much.
I love you too.
- [Barking]
- Dudley! Peter!
I'm sorry.
They're such little devils.
Come on, you naughty boys.
See ya.
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?
Um, do you need comforting on any level?
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Have I done or said anything to make you feel less good about you?
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
- Would you like something to eat?
I made a salad nicoise with dolphin-safe tuna.
Oh, wow.
- What is it?
- It's that sunset again.
And I worry about the dolphins.
I wrote a song about them.
Would you like to hear it?
Now? l-l...
[Sighs]
# Mayo-nayo-naise ##
# Swimming by the sandy shore
Dancing up among the waves #
# Dolphin, dolphin I adore #
# Everything you are #
#You're so much more than a fish to me #
# My playful friend beneath the sea ##
[Imitating Dolphin]
- I have to stop.
- Good! I mean, oh, why?
Because I'm looking at you and I'm seeing all the beauty... of the world shining at me through your eyes.
- Would you mind if I sketched you?
- I didn't know you could draw.
I'm not an artist, per se.
Okay, Elliot, there's something that I think I really have to say.
Elliot, that's amazing!
Compared to you, it's nothing.
Compared to your smile...
and the blush of your cheek and
the sound of your voice as it
floats on the evening breeze.
Compared to you, that sunset's just...
When is that darn thing gonna set?
- Maybe we should go.
- No, wait.
There's so much that I wanna say to you, but I just can't find the words.
I have an idea.
I would like... to improvise a sonnet about your hair.
How wonderful my fair one's face...
Excuse me, fellas.
Might I ask you to... take the horseplay down to another part of the beach?
Uh, no.
You know, rather
than get confrontational, why don't we all just sit down together, have some salad with dolphin-safe tuna and see if we can't start a dialogue.
You know, I had a feeling that you were gonna...
Okay, guys, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you... to respect the moment that my woman friend and I are sharing... because it's a special celebration of love and caring... and a unique spiritual and emotional understanding.
- You wanna get a beer?
- Sure.
Alison, excuse me, but I thought that this was our time together.
It's just a beer.
I'll be back in two seconds.
Actually, my place is like 40 minutes from here.
- That's fine. Which way is your car?
- It's a van.
Great.
Alison, I respect your uniqueness and individuality.
And you're your own person, and if you want to go with our new friends here... to get a drink,
I won't stand in your way.
Okay, thanks, El.
I knew you'd understand.
No, wait!
Don't go! I can't handle this kind of rejection!
Why don't you wanna stay here with me?
You wanna know why?
Because you're just too sensitive!
I'm about to go out of my mind here.
It's been wonderful, and God knows I love you, but enough is enough!
I just wanna be with a man who will ignore me and take me for granted... and who's only pretending to be interested in who I am... and what I think so he can get into my pants.
- That would be me.
- Oh, thank you!
Let's get out of here.
Alison, wait!
Alison!
I'll get into your pants!
[Screams]
Oh, Elliot, get out of there, you silly boy.
- Oh, man, you are so bad.
- Why, thank you.
Just admit it.
You're not very good at this whole instant travel thing, are you?
I'm sorry. Now then, what were we talking about?
Oh, your next wish, wasn't it?
Don't think I don't see what you're doing.
I make wishes, you think up ways to ruin them.
I've ruined them?
How can you say that?
I'm not perfect, you know.
Do you think I enjoy this?
I'm stuck in this horrible job for eternity. Everybody hates me.
I can't sleep. And when
I actually try to help someone, they turn on me like
I'm supposed to be God or something.
Well, for your information, my life is a living hell.
I work hard.
I try to look good for you.
You do look good.
You-You look very good.
I just wanted you to like me.
Oh, come on. I do like you.
It's just I'm feeling a little frustrated here.
Don't give up on me, Elliot.
I'm not giving up on you.
Nobody gets it totally right right away.
You're doing great, really.
- I am?
- Yeah, you are.
I'm so sorry your wish didn't work out.
Friends?
Sure.
Listen, I'm sorry if I said anything to upset you or make you feel bad.
And I'm gonna try to be more sensitive next time.
I think you're sensitive enough already.
You think?
Are you kidding?
You even went for me crying.
Hey! Were you just faking me out?
I was 100% sincere. It's not easy being the Barbra Streisand of Evil.

- Now, what have we learned so far?
Well, let's see.
I'm starting to think women don't know what they want.
Amen!
They say they want sensitivity, but did you see how fast Alison went for...
- those tough-guy dudes on the beach?
- Which tells you?
That... Well, it tells me that I wanna be really big and strong.
You know, I wanna have a great body and be tall and... Like... [Grunts]
- Go on.
- And I wanna be athletic.
- Check.
- And I wanna be rich too.
But I want it to be for something that I like doing, and people really like me for.
Great! This is getting really specific.
Let's see... big, strong, rich, athletic, something you like, lots of fans...
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Oh, I hope so.
In the form of a wish?
I wish I could play professional basketball.
Then I'll just say the magic words: Dennis Rodman.
- [Buzzer Sounding]
- [Screaming] No!
Just kidding.
Michael Jordan.
Yeah!
[Crowd]
Three, two, one!
[Announcer]
And that's it. That's the game.
The fans are going nuts
here at the Forum in Los Angeles.
The score: 135 to 85.
Elliot Richards has totally dominated.
If you're just tuning in, it's a shame because you just missed... one of the greatest performances in the history of sports.
Absolutely, Jerry.
Absolutely.
People said basketball caught fire with the "ascendry" of Michael Jordan.
But I tell you, after what we seen here tonight, a lot of people are gonna be saying, "Michael who?"
[Jerry] Right from the get-go, the
fans took a look at Elliot Richards...
and a couple women fainted.
And a couple fellas... I'd rather not
say...but they liked what they saw.
[Dan] Absolutely.
He's a big fella and an imposing fella.
He's enormous. He's listed at 7'6"
in the program,
but I'd say he plays the game
like he's 11 feet tall.
No, I don't think he that big, Jerry.
No, I'm saying the game he plays is-is-is... is that of some Viking giant... with a basketball in one hand and a club in the other... standing 10, 11,
12 feet tall.
It's obvious Elliot Richards controlled
this game right from the tip-off.
Right from the get-go, Elliot was
a dominating force in tonight's game.
He was Phi Slamma Jamma
runnin' stank all over it...
with rib-ticklin' jumps
of double vanilla funk.
Let's take a look.
Here's a pass worthy of John Elway.
For the dunk!
Such a beautiful play.
Here he is lining up for the three.
And Ricola! It's good!
Here comes his patented
over-the-shoulder,
no-look three-pointer.
And nothing but net!
They're in the zone.
Here he is soaring
through the air like the man...
on the flying "trapezius,"
and bam!
That's what I'm talking about!
Destroying the backboard on the glass.
This kid's an animal.
Let's take a look at that dunker again.
It's boom!
Humpty-hump-dump-dump.
Ha-ha!
I love this game, folks.
I sure enough do.
Elliot Richards
spitting glass at your ass.
Bob is courtside with Elliot Richards now. Let's go to Bob Bob.
Thank you, Jerry and Dan.
Elliot, you must be one very proud young man this evening.
Simply put, that was a staggeringly dramatic display of athletic ability.
Uh, well, you know, you go out there and you give 110%.
And you wanna play good.
And you hope you play good.
I think we played pretty good tonight.
Well, in the lexicon of sports terminology, and I don't mean to sound contrary here, the word "good" falls tragically short of encompassing the sheer virtuosity of your performance.
Um, well, you know, there's no "l" in the word "team," and this is a team effort.
And I just wanna say that I'm real proud to be associated with... these fine individuals that
I have the pleasure of working with.
Now, I would never wanna dis your teammates in any way, shape or form, but you do realize that you smashed
Wilt Chamberlain's unbreakable record... of 100 points in a single basketball game set in
Hershey, Pennsylvania, years ago?
Man, you just gotta play one game at a time and go out there and give 110%... and you gotta show that you want it more than they do when the chips fall where they may.
Thank you very much.
Back to you, Jerry and Dan.
All right! Diablos!
Number one! Yeah!
Elliot. Hi.
Alison Gardner.
The Sporting News.
- Oh. It's nice to meet you, ma'am.
- [Chuckles]
God, I can't tell you how thrilled I am to meet you.
I was just wondering if there was a possibility... you might consider doing something exclusive with me, uh, for the magazine?
Maybe more intimate, one-on-one, just the two of us.
Yeah, right.
I'd kill you in one-on-one.
Shoot!
God, it's so exciting to be here.
I mean, uh, you must have an enormously huge... talent to do what you do.
Well, you know, you go out there and you just give 110%.
And, uh, you hope you play good.
You wanna play good.
- I bet.
- I think we played pretty good tonight.
Oh, God, you were incredible tonight.
I mean, watching you,
I just kept thinking how unbelievably big... your, uh, ego must be after a game like that.
Oh, not that big, really.
- I bet it's pretty big.
- Well, I guess a little bit bigger.
- It depends on how happy I am.
- Oh!
- Whoo. God.
- Heck.
Wanna go back to my place?
I'll show you my bottle cap collection.
Oh, God, that would... that would be tremendous.
- All right, well...
- God.
I should, uh...
I should get dressed.
I can't wait.
- [Gasps] Oh, my God!
- [Screams]
Hey, what the hell!
Oh, God, there's...
Hey! Damn!
- Um...
- Oh, heck!
Oh!
I just remembered there's just this teeny, tiny thing...
- I forgot to do.
- What's teeny?
No, no, no.
It's something I have to write.
About me?
Yeah, just a little, short, itty-bitty blurb about tonight's game.
Well, uh, can I see you after the road trip?
I would love to, but I'm...
I'm working on a really big, huge, enormous story on the N.F.L., so I probably won't have time.
Oh, shoot. I understand.
You gotta give 110%.
- Right.
- Stay within yourself.
Hey, oh, yeah.
Hey, um, thanks for your time.
So long. Oh...
What the hell?
Oh, damn the Devil.
Damn the Devil to Hell!
Oh, shoot! Darn it!
Where the heck did
I put that... five, five, five.
[Growls]
Seven, seven, seven.
Come on! Oh!
[Grumbling]
[Screams]
Duh! Six, six...
Now what are you doing?
You seem so upset, Elliot.
Do you want something to relax?
You bet I'm upset. You gave me, like, this little teeny-weeny winkie.
Well, that's easily fixed, you know. Now then, let's see.
Here's some M&Ms for room 320.
- Red Hots for 316.
- You're giving them candy?
Placebos. They work just as well as the real thing. It's a scientific fact.
You can't give sick people
Tic Tacs!
Sick people have notoriously bad breath.
I'm performing a public service here.
Now then, about your next wish.
All right, okay. Um...
Well, I wanna be smart.
No, I wanna be really smart.
And I wanna be able to talk good... well.
- What is the word...
- "Articulate"?
Articulate. Yeah.
I wanna be articulate.
And I wanna be witty and sophisticated, charming.
I wanna know everything about everything... and I wanna be popular and I wanna be good-looking.
No, no, make that great-looking.
And I want Alison to fall absolutely head over heels in love with me.
- Anything else?
- Like what?
Like winkie-wise?
Oh, right. Um...
Yeah, well, um,
I wanna be...
I wanna be big.
Not like practical joke big, but, you know, sort of...
Yeah, like that.
Is that clear?
Crystal. You just say "I wish" and I'll fill in the rest.
Okay.
I wish that I was witty and articulate...
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
You've got it, smarty-pants.
Take two of these and call me in the morning.
[Woman]
Oh, Elliot!
Oh, it so wonderful to see you, darling.
Oh, New York has been so deadly dull without you.
Where have you been?
Oh, out in the Hamptons, of course.
Up to my ears in my new book.
Another one? You've written four books in three years. My God.
- What's this one about?
- Oh, same old, same old.
It's a critical deconstruction of the Neo-Romantic period in art and literature... from the political and economic perspective of the Industrial Revolution.
I can't imagine who reads this stuff!
Well, Elliot, the critics, apparently.
It's already won the Pulitzer Prize and it hasn't even been published yet.
Well, like they say,
Dr. Oingegedaydegegedaybaba, a Pulitzer Prize and $3.50 will get you a cafe latte.
So modest. Darling, you really should get around.
Everyone's dying to see you.
Mingle.
Oh, darling, you look fabulous.
Badgely Mishka?
- What a charming man. Who is that?
- Oh, that's Elliot Richards.
He's a very successful writer.
He's a very successful everything, as a matter of fact.
That's Elliot Richards?
Oh, I've read all his books.
He's brilliant.
I had no idea he was so handsome.
Well, why don't you
go over and talk to him?
- I couldn't. What would I say?
- I wouldn't worry about that.
Just, uh, let him do all the talking.
It's a common misapprehension that the word "gin" comes from the city Geneva.
Actually, the word "geneva"... small "g"... is a corruption of genievre, which of course is french for "juniper," the wonderful berry that flavors this miraculous libation.
[Guests Chuckling]
Speaking of miraculous.
I'm Elliot Richards.
How do you do?
I know who you are.
I'm Alison Gardner.
I just had to tell you how much
I loved your novel Always Toujours.
Well, I was just trying to make a simple point really.
Every time I've reread
Camus and Sartre,
I kept thinking to myself,
"Why does the existential dilemma have to be so damn bleak?"
- Yes.
- Yes, we're alone in the universe.
Yes, life is meaningless, death is inevitable.
But is that necessarily so depressing?
I couldn't agree more.
Don't you think that secular humanism is yummy?
Ooh, delish.
My, my.
They say that alcohol is a disinhibitor and it seems to be working very well on me.
Me too.
What an exquisite feeling.
Every cell in my body just wants to reach out and touch someone.
Yes, it's incredible, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
Thy physiology of touch.
Just below your epidermis, concentrated in your fingertips, the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, the clitoris, nipples, penis, lips, tongue.
Thousands and thousands of tiny little Meissner's corpuscles... all deliciously sensitive to even the slightest caress... sending all those tiny little endorphin-producing pleasure messages... to the hypothalamus... the primitive brain.
I'm tingling all over.
Do you know the largest organ in the human body?
I can guess.
You'd be wrong.
It's your integumentary system.
Your... creamy... soft... and completely desirable skin.
- Can we go to your place?
- Mais certainment.
[Alison Giggling]
Oh, this is so perfect.
Everything here absolutely screams...
"Elliot Richards."
Actually, most of the screaming... takes place... in the bedroom.
[Gasps, Sighs]
## [Classical]
- ## [Record Scratches]
- What the hell is going on, Mary?
- Who are you?
- Don't play games with me, Mr. Richards.
I'm in no mood.
I've been out of my mind all night.
- Oh, my God.
- Hi.
Who's your little friend?
- Maybe I should be running along.
- Wait. This is a mistake. I'm not gay.
Oh, really?
And I'm Tony Danza!
- Honestly, I swear it. I'm not.
- Then tell me, who was in the Broadway cast of The Pajama Game?
Janis Paige, John Raitt,
Eddy Foy, Jr.
I assume you mean the original cast because there was a revival in 1973 that starred...
Hal Linden and Barbara McNair...
I am gay!
- I rest my case.
- [Elliot] Wait.
I can prove to you that I am not gay. Kiss me.
Oh! This is just sad!
Will you shut up, bitch!
Please, Alison, let me kiss you.
Remember the champagne and the corpuscles?
All right, Elliot, kiss me.
[Groans]
I'm gay. Well, thanks for dropping by.
- Good night.
- All right.
Bu-bye.
You've been drinking again,
haven't you?
This is like the night you had all those Brandy Alexanders and ran up and down Fire Island...
with your cute little Speedos
singing "Evergreen."
And so the cow was returned
to its rightful owner.
- Okay, boys, tonight's homework.
- [Class Groans]
Algebra. "X" to the nth plus "Y" to the nth equals "Z" to the nth.
You're never gonna use that, are you?
"Imperialism and the first World War."
Well, what's done is done, I say.
No point in thinking about it now.
"German, french, Spanish."
Ja, ja. Oui, oui.
Si, si. It's nonsense.
Everyone speaks English anyway.
And if they don't, they ought to.
So, no homework tonight.
But I want you to watch
a lot of television,
don't neglect your video games... and I'll see you in the morning, shall we say, 10:00, 10:30?
No point in getting up too early, is there?
[Bell Ringing]
Elliot, darling.
What a lovely surprise.
- I hope you had a pleasant evening.
- As if you didn't know.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling. I know it must be really frustrating for you.
I'll make it up to you somehow.
Oh, yeah, you've been a really big help so far.
I know. I've been really naughty, haven't I?
Maybe a good spanking's in order.
Is that all you ever think about?
Do you think everything is about sex?
No, of course not.
I mean, there's greed, gluttony, sloth, anger, vanity, envy.
No, there's also honesty and hard work... and caring about people and doing good for somebody else.
Oh. You're just a big Boy Scout, aren't you?
I find that incredibly appealing.
No! All I've been doing is thinking about myself.
I could be doing all these really important things to help other people.
- What about Alison?
- Oh, I don't know anymore.
You mess it up anyway. I know that
Alison's not really like that.
What exactly do you have in mind?
I wanna do something great for mankind.
I wanna help create a better world.
I wanna go down in history for doing something really, really important...
and I want Alison to take me really
seriously and to treat me with respect.
I sense a wish coming on.
Yes!
I wish that I was the President of the United States.
That is the noblest, most unselfish thing I've ever heard.
And it's a great way to meet girls.
Bless you, Elliot Richards, and Godspeed.
Mr. President. Alison Gardner.
We're so honored to have you here, sir.
[Gasps]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
The actors are beside themselves
with excitement.
We're going to a play?
I think you'll find it quite amusing.
It's called Our American Cousin.
I think I've already seen it.
As a matter of fact, I'm sure I have.
I don't think you've seen it, sir.
It's an entirely new play.
Really? I think I know how it ends, anyway.
- Can't we just go to a movie?
- A what?
- [Announcer] The President!
- ## ["Hail To The Chief"]
[Champagne Cork Pops]
You seem tense tonight,
Mr. President.
Oh, well, you know,
I have a lot on my mind, what, with preserving the Union and my wife going crazy and all.
[Audience Applauding]
Can I help you find something,
Mr. President?
Yeah, I'm looking for my pager.
- Your what, sir?
- My pager. It's this... little red plastic thingy.
Looks kind of like a cell phone, only smaller.
- [Groans]
- I'm sorry! Sorry!
Ha! Ha! All right.
No problem. No problem!
No problem! No problem.
Sic semper tyrannis!
Wait!
Okay.
- [Gunshot]
- [Screams]
- [Gunshot]
- [Screams]
[Clears Throat]
You're late, Richards.
Uh, yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.
See that it doesn't. I don't think a person with your extremely limited... personal and professional skills can afford to push the envelope.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
- Creep.
- [Typing]
So, tell me, how was it?
I'm dying to know.
What are you doing here?
Just think of me as a computer virus.
I think of you as a plague.
Now, will you get off
my screen? I have work to do.
Whoa. What's this whole
"get thee behind me" thing?
We still have business here, Mr. Richards.
No, not now.
I told you, I've got work to do.
And besides, I've only got two wishes left and I don't wanna screw 'em up.
Correction.
You have one wish left.
Nice try.
I've got two more coming.
Nuh-uh. Count 'em, baby.
You were President
of the United States.
Yeah, okay, one.
You were a charming, handsome, articulate, celebrated author and raconteur.
Uh-huh, yeah. And you turned me into a flaming homosexual.
- Professional basketball player.
- Three.
The sensitive, caring,
artistic guy was four.
And the Columbian drug lord was five.
That means I have two more coming.
You forgot the Big Mac and Coke.
What? That wasn't a wish.
What do you call it? You said,
"I wish," and I got it for you.
Sounds like a wish to me.
No! No, no, no.
No, that's not fair!
Fair? Who do you think you're talking to?
I don't recall anybody ever
accusing me of being fair before.
I think I'm insulted.
What? No, this isn't right.
You can't do this.
Well, what are you gonna do about it? Sue me?
No, that's it! I've had it with you.
The whole deal is off.
Off!
Shut up!
## [Pipe Organ]
Are you all right?
Uh, not really.
Uh...
I need to talk to God.
That's the power of prayer. Just say what's in your heart and He hears.
No, you don't understand.
I really need to talk to Him now.
- It's urgent.
- Is it something you could tell me?
Um, no, it's personal.
There's nothing you could say that I wouldn't understand.
Um...
Why don't you just try me?
Okay, a few days ago I sold my soul to the Devil for seven wishes.
I've already had five of them, but the Devil says I've had six, but I'm not counting the Big Mac and Coke and she is and I don't think that's fair.
Do you?
- This is so unnecessary.
- You're coming downtown with us.
I'm telling you, the Devil gypped me for a hamburger!
Tell your story to the sergeant.
So, do you have a copy of this contract?
No. I told you, she keeps it in her office.
- At this nightclub in Oakland?
- Yes, at a nightclub, and no I can't tell you where it is.
Because you promised the Devil you wouldn't?
No, because she drove, that's why!
Right, in a Lamborghini Diablo.
- Look, Officer...
- Sergeant.
Sergeant, I know my rights. I don't have to talk to you without a lawyer.
So, you either book me or you let me go.
Gee, are those my choices?
Oh, what do I do, what do I do?
I choose "book you."
Throw him in the lockup.
Arraignment in the morning.
Drunk and disorderly.
What? Hey!
- Recommending psychiatric evaluation.
- It's her! She's the Devil!
One more word out of you and I'll pop you one, you goddamn wacko bastard.
Now, move it.
Spread 'em.
There's no point fighting about this.
You have to learn to accept the inevitable.
We're all doomed anyway, so you might as well just get with the program, wish your way out of here and move on.
I wasn't kidding when I said
I liked you. I do, Elliot.
I think you have massive potential.
If you're looking at an eternity in Hell, let me tell you, it wouldn't hurt to have a friend like me.
So you just think about that and give me a call when you're ready.
[Cell Door Shuts]
[Man]
She's the devil, that one.
What?
I said, she's the devil, that lady cop.
Oh.
Yeah, I guess.
- So, what you in for, brother?
- Eternity.
Ooh. That's a long time.
You must've did some really bad shit.
Yeah.
I sold my soul.
Hope you got something good for it.
As a matter of fact,
I got nothing for it.
That's a really bad deal, if you ask me.
I'm not asking you.
Doesn't really matter, though.
- You can't sell your soul, anyway.
- Oh, really?
Why do you say that?
Doesn't really belong to you in the first place. No way, no how.
So, who does it belong to?
It belongs to God, that universal spirit that animates and binds all things in existence.
The Devil gonna try to confuse you.
But that's her gig.
But in the end, you're gonna see
clear to who and what you are
and what you're here to do.
Now, you're gonna make some mistakes along the way. Everybody does.
But if you just open up
your heart... and open up your mind, you'll get it.
Who are you?
Just a friend, brother.
Just a really good friend.
## [Techno Dance]
[Chattering]
[Crowd Shouting]
Elliot! Elliot!
[Man]
You the man, Elliot!
Elliot, darling.
So nice of you to drop by.
- Come into my office.
- [Muttering]
Oh, don't worry about them, darling.
They're having a fabulous time.
Pathetic, aren't they?
Everybody wants to go to the party, but nobody wants to pay the piper.
Are you...
Don't get too excited.
It's just a Halloween costume.
Anyway, Elliot, my darling,
have you thought of your last wish?
No.
I hate to put a rush on this, but there is a time limit.
Read your contract.
I really don't want another wish.
[Scoffs] That's funny.
Do you think this halo's too much?
No. I really don't want it.
What do you mean, you don't want it?
You get seven wishes.
There's nothing I want.
Well, there are things that I want, but nothing that you can give me.
What is that supposed to mean?
Well, um, last night when I was lying in jail,
I was talking to this guy,
I realized that wishing just doesn't work.
All my life I wished to be better looking, to be richer, to be successful, talented, whatever.
And I always thought,
"Wouldn't it be great if someone could just wave a magic wand... and make that happen."
Well, I realized that it doesn't work by magic.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
I've been starting to think that... it really isn't that important how far we go in life anyway.
It's how we get there that really matters.
Oh.
Do you know, that is so inspiring.
So, it's okay?
Well, no, Elliot.
I'm afraid it's not okay.
A deal's a deal. You get
one more wish and I get your soul.
So, let's just get on with it, shall we?
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Oh, really?
Well, before you get all hinky,
I think I should warn you,
I'm not all peaches and cream, you know.
I do have a darker side, and believe me, it's not pretty.
Now, you can go easy
or you can go hard, but one way or another
I will get your soul!
I'm not gonna do it.
There's nothing that you can say or do that will make me.
Oh, I think you'll change your mind.
I'm just gonna slip into something a little more terrifying.
See you in Hell!
- [Screaming]
- [Roaring]
- [Roaring]
- Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute! Wait!
[Screams]
Wait!
[Screaming]
Now listen to me, you disgusting little maggot!
This is your last chance before the big weenie roast.
Make a wish or forever burn in Hell!
Okay! Okay!
I wish...
I wish that Alison has a happy life.
Oh, God.
[Screaming]
- Is this Heaven?
- Heaven? God, no, it's the courthouse.
I'm just meeting a couple of lawyers for lunch... clients of mine. Come on.
Well, wait.
What happened to the whole... you know, fire and the big horny guy with the...
Oh, just a few special effects.
Sort of the Universal Studios
Tour of Evil.
Normally it works pretty well, but evidently you weren't going for it.
That last wish of yours was a deal breaker.
What?
Nobody ever reads the contract.
Article 147, paragraph 9, subsection 3:
"Selfless Acts of Redemption."
- Huh?
- Basically, it says... if you commit one truly benevolent act, it voids the contract.
- So I get to keep my soul?
- Yes, you get to keep your soul.
Yes! Oh, yes!
Yes, I get to keep my soul!
Whoo! Hoo!
Hoo!
On November 16, I'll have been doing this for 6,000 years... and you're the first person to give away one of their wishes.
I hope it's not the beginning of a trend.
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?
No, no, I promise. Nope.
I don't get it, though.
I mean, why are you... being nice?
Look, Elliot, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
The whole good and evil thing, you know, Him and me, it really comes down to you.
You don't have to look very hard for Heaven and Hell.
They're right here on Earth.
You make the choice.
And I guess you just made yours.
So, I can go now?
Unless you want another seven wishes.
[Chuckles]
No thanks.
I didn't think so.
I really liked you, you know.
Well, to tell you the truth, you've been the best friend
I've ever had.
Oh, dear.
Don't go gushy on me now.
Go on. Go.
You'll scare the fish away.
Alison. Hi.
Hi. Oh, uh...
Elliot Richards.
We've met a couple of times.
Yeah, I remember.
Hi. How are you?
I'm great. I'm exaggerating.
I'm... I'm good.
Um, the thing is we've been working
together here for the last four years,
and I've always noticed you
and thought that... you looked like, um, a very interesting person.
I don't know how interesting I am.
Well, the truth is I don't know you and you don't know me,
and I was thinking that if we were
to get to know each other that... there's a chance that we just might hit it off.
So I was wondering if you wanted to go get a cup of coffee or...
That's really so nice of you.
I'm seeing someone.
Oh.
Well, of course you are. You're...
He's sure one lucky guy.
Uh, listen, if it ever doesn't
work out with him, then...
- That is so nice of you. Okay.
- No, thanks a lot.
- I'll see you around.
- Okay, take care. Bye.
- It's a joke.
- Right.
What's he gonna...
Hey, Elliot, fo-felliot, so-smelliot.
What's up, dudester? Yeah.
[Chuckles]
What do you say we go down to the club tonight and we, uh, pick up some chickettes?
Nice talking to you, Bob.
[Muttering]
- Hey.
- New neighbors?
Guess so.
Hi. Oh, hi.
Hi. You must be
the boy next door.
Do you wanna give me a hand?
Habla ingles?
Sprechen Sie English?
Parlez vous Americano?
- Hi. I'm Elliot Richards.
- Hey. Nicole DeLarusso.
Don't call me Nicky, though.
'Cause everyone always calls me "Nicky."
It starts off as Nicole, then it becomes Nicky, then Nick, then Ni, then just "Nn."
People just call me "Nn."
I'm cracking myself up here.
- Hey, do you wanna give me a hand?
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.
- Oh, wow. You got the new Ingebritzens.
- Oh, yeah, they're the best.
- They're the best.
[Both Chuckle]
Um, so listen, I'd be happy to hook these up for you... so you could have some music if you wanted, you know, while you're unpacking.
I could make us some dinner.
That way you wouldn't have to cook.
Yeah, right.
Me cook.
Thank you.
[Giggles]
Say, Nicole, you wouldn't happen to have a sister, would you?
No, no. I have a lot of brothers, though.

Cinderella flew through the air...
far from all things
ugly and ordinary.
When she landed at the ball,
she found herself...
most impertinently surrounded
by pirates.
There was Alf Mason,
so ugly his mother sold him
for a bottle of muscat.
Bill Jukes,
every inch of him tattooed.
And worst of them all,
Hook, with eyes blue as forget-me-nots, save when he clawed your belly with the iron hook he has... instead of a right hand, at which time... his eyes turn red.
"Girlie," said Hook,
"we have come for ye glass slippers."
Who be you to order me about and call me girlie?
Take that.!
Take that! Take that!
Commoner.!
- [Girl]
Hook came at her.
- [Screaming]
[Gasps]
[Boy]
What happened then?
What happened then?
[Girl]
The brave Cinderella settled
the matter once and for all...
with her revolver.
With her revolver?
[Woman Narrating]
The night on which
the extraordinary adventures...
of these children
may be said to have begun...
was the night Nana
barked at the window.
But there was nothing there,
not a bird or a leaf.
So the children forgot
about it,
for what troubles a grown-up
will never trouble a child.
- [Cuckooing]
- [All Gasp]
Oh, dearest George, dear Mary.
Oh, what a journey I've had.
Bath time.
- [Whooping]
- [Barks]
[Screaming]
[Screaming Continues]
[Barks]
Not fair!
[Narrator]
Not fair, indeed. But Nana was
the finest nurse on four paws.
No. No, I will not forgive you.
**[Piano]
[Narrator]
There never was
a happier, simpler family.
Mr. Darling was a banker
who knew the cost of everything,
even a hug.
Mrs. Darling was the loveliest
lady in Bloomsbury...
with a sweet, mocking mouth
that had one kiss on it...
that Wendy could never get.
Though there it was,
perfectly conspicuous
on the right-hand corner.
And sometimes there
was Aunt Millicent...
who felt a dog for a nurse
lowered the whole tone
of the neighborhood.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
Less noise.
- Let's settle down.
This is not a farm.
- [Whines]
- [Millicent]
Bravo, George. Bravo.
- Wendy's turn.
Wendy must tell a story.
** [Piano]
Cecco, who carved his name
on the governor at Goa.
Noodler, with his hands
on backwards.
- Heavens.
- Hook!
- Hook?
- Hook, whose eyes turn red as he guts you.
Upon my soul, how children are educated nowadays.
- [Chuckles]
- I'm afraid I am not learned at all, Aunt.
- But I do know a thing or two about pirates.
- Ooh.
My unfulfilled ambition is to write a great novel in three parts about my adventures.
- What adventures?
- I've yet to have them, but they will be perfectly thrilling.
But, child, novelists are not highly thought of in good society.
And there is nothing so difficult to marry as a novelist.
- Marry?
- Marry?
- Marry?
- But, Aunt, Wendy is not yet 13.
Walk toward me, dear, that I may appraise you.
[Mr. Darling]
Go on.
Walk to your auntie.
Stand up straight.
[Giggling]
[Whines]
- Stop it!
- Turn around.
[Laughter Continues]
Shh.
Mm, yes.
Oh, it's quite as I expected.
Wendy possesses a woman's chin.
Have you not noticed?
Observe her mouth.
There, hidden
in the right-hand corner, is that a kiss?
[Mrs. Darling Gasps]
- A kiss?
- Like Mother's kiss.
- [Millicent]
A hidden kiss.
- But what is it for?
It is for the greatest adventure of all.
They that find it... have slipped in and out of heaven.
Find what?
The one the kiss belongs to.
My Wendy... a woman.
Almost a woman.
She must spend less time with her brothers...
and more time with me.
[All Gasp]
She must have her own room.
Ayoung lady's room.
Leave the...
George, the daughter of a clerk cannot hope to marry as well as that of a manager.
You must attend more parties, make small talk with your superiors at the bank.
Wit is very fashionable at the moment.

But there was no sign of a body,
for none had fallen.
Certainly she had been dreaming.

If this is you in bed, what is this?
A boy.
[Narrator]
Miss Fulsom dispatched a letter
of outrage to Mr. Darling...
that set new standards
of prudery, even for her.
Yes, miss.
Mr. Darling had been practicing
small talk all afternoon.
I say, it's nice weather we're having.
And now his opportunity had arrived.
Sir Edward Quiller Couch,
the president of the bank,
was a man who enjoyed small talk...
almost as much
as a good balance sheet.
Wendy walked as one condemned.
And then... fate.
[Bell Rings]
The letter! Wait! Stop!
[Michael]
Wendy, wait!
Come back!
I say, what a splendid tie.
[Mumbles]
Wait.! You there.! Stop.!
- Wendy.! Nana, come back.!
- [Barking]
That's £200 saved.
Ajudicious investment?
Indeed.
Uh...
Hi. Um...
[Muttering]
I, uh...
You there, stop.! Wait.!
Stop! Wait!

[Men Grumbling]
[Mr. Darling]
I have been humiliated.!
[Wendy Chattering]
No!
I must become a man that children fear and adults respect, or we shall all end up in the street!
George, not so loud.
The neighbors will hear.
Let them hear.
Let the whole world know!
This is not a nurse! This is a dog.
[Whining]
[Gasps]
Tomorrow you begin your instruction...
with Aunt Millicent.
It's time for you to grow up.!
[Barking]
[Michael]
Mother?
Can anything harm us after the night-lights are lit?
No, precious.
They are the eyes a mother leaves behind to guard her children.
Mother, must you go to the party?
Please, Mother.
Yes, Mother, you don't have to go.
Father can go by himself.
Please, Mother.
By himself?
Your father is a brave man.
But he's going to need the special kiss to face his colleagues tonight.
Father? Brave?
There are many different kinds of bravery.
There's the bravery of thinking of others before oneself.
Now, your father has never brandished a sword nor fired a pistol, thank heavens.
But he's made many sacrifices for his family... and put away many dreams.
Where did he put them?
He put them in a drawer.
And sometimes, late at night, we take them out and admire them.
But it gets harder and harder
to close the drawer.
He does.
And that is why he is brave.
And remember, every cloud has a silver lining.
Oh.
Oh. No, it's snowing.
Oh, we'll catch our death.
Better death than gossip.
You will enter that drawing room with your head held high.
[Hinge Squeaking]

Aha!

Come here, you!
I got you.

- [Shrieking]
Ha!
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
[Grunting]
[Panting]
Boy, why are you crying?
[Gasps]
You can fly!
What is your name?
What is your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
Peter... Pan.
Where do you live?
Second to the right and then straight on till morning.
[Gasps]
They put that on the letters?
Don't get any letters.
But your mother gets letters.
Don't have a mother.
No wonder you were crying.
I wasn't crying about mothers.
I was crying because I can't get the shadow to stick.
And I wasn't crying!
[Chuckles]
I could sew it on for you.
[Grunts]
This may hurt a little.
[Groaning]
- [Loud Groan]
- Might I borrow your knife?
[Whimpers]
- Thank you.
- [Mimicking, Growls]
[Chuckles]
- Oh, the cleverness of me!
- Of course, I did nothing.
Aw, you did a little.
A little?
Good night.
Wendy?
One girl is worth more than 20 boys.
You really think so?
I live with boys... the Lost Boys.
They are well named.
[Gasps]
Who are they?
Children who fall out of their prams when the nurse is not looking.
If they are not claimed in seven days, they are sent to the Neverland.
- Are there girls too?
- Girls are much too clever to fall out of their prams.
Peter, it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls.
I should like to give you... a... kiss.
Don't you know what a kiss is?
I shall know when you give me one.
I suppose
I'm to give you one now.
If you like.
[Clears Throat]
Thank you.
How old are you, Peter?
Quite young.
- Don't you know?
- I ran away.
One night, I heard my mother and father talking of what
I was to be when I became a man.
So I ran away to Kensington
Gardens and I met Tink.
[Squealing]
- Tink?
- Tinker Bell.
She's my fairy.
- But there's no such thing as...
- Don't say that.
Every time somebody says that, a fairy somewhere falls down dead.
And I shall never find her if she's dead.
You don't mean to tell me there's a fairy in this room.
We come to listen
to the stories.
[Grunts]
I like the one about the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore glass slippers.
Cinderella.
Peter, he found her
and they...and they... lived happily ever after.
I knew it.
Peter.
I should like to give you... a... thimble.
What's that?
[Growls]
- [Screaming]
- Tink!
Tink.! Tink, no.!
[Chattering]
She's not very polite.
She says if you try to
give me a thimble again, she'll kill you.
Oh.
And I had supposed fairies to be charming.
[Blows Raspberry]
Peter, don't go.
I have to tell the others about Cinderella.
- But I know lots of stories, stories I could tell the boys.
- Come with me.
L... I cannot fly.
I'll teach you.
I'll teach you to ride the wind's back.
And away we go.
Could John and Michael come too?
[Snoring]
- Michael! Michael!
- [Grunts]
- John! John!
- I didn't do it.
There is a boy here who is to teach us to fly.
You offend reason, sir.
Mm-hmm.
I should like to offend it with you.
You just think happy thoughts, and they lift you into the air.
[Chuckles]
It's easy.
I've got it! I've got it!
Swords, daggers, Napoleon!
- [Wendy]
Stand back.
- Yahoo!
[Screaming]
[Grunts]
John!
- [Groans]
- [Laughing]
[Gasps]
Wendy.! Wendy.! Watch me.!
Puddings, mud pies, ice cream, never to take a bath again!
[Screaming]
[Wendy]
Michael.!
[Barking]
Whoa!
[Gasps, Giggling]
Come away.
Come away to Neverland.
Oh. What about Mother?
Father?
Nana?
- There are mermaids.
- Mermaids?
Indians!
[Both]
Indians?
- Pirates!
- [Both]
Pirates?
Whoa-ho!
John, wait for me.!
[Barking]
[Chattering]
[Chuckling]
[Laughing]
May I introduce my wife...
Mary?
Mary.
Mary.
Delighted.
Thank you, Sir Edward.
[Barking]
[Banging]
- [Guests Gasping]
- [Gasps]
Forget them, Wendy.
Forget them all.
Come with me where you'll never, never have to worry about grown-up things again.
What is it? What's wrong?
Never is an awfully long time.
[Narrator]
It would be delightful to report
that they reached the nursery in time.
But then there
would be no story.
[Michael, John Shouting]
[Laughing]
[Shouting]
[Woman]
But you're covered in dog hair, my darling.
- [Peter] Hello, old chap.
- [Wendy] Good evening.
[John]
Thank you.
Whoa-ho!
[Shouting]
Higher!
[Shouting]
Who are you?
I'm John.
[Chattering]
John.
Take hold of this.
Ta-da!
Both hands.
[John Shouting]
Pass it on.
Michael, take hold of my ankle.
Wendy, take hold of my ankle!
And whatever happens,
don't... let... go!

Cap'n?
Cap'n? As I was sitting wide-eyed on my watch,
I noticed it was wintertime on the water and springtime on the shore.
I says to meself,
"That's early for spring to be astir.
Spring's not due till 3:00 p.m."
Check the time yourself,
Cap'n, and then tell...
I was dreaming, Smee, of Pan.
Pan, Cap'n?
And in my dream,
I was a magnanimous fellow... full of forgiveness.
I thanked Pan...
for cutting off my hand... and for giving me this fine hook... for disemboweling and ripping throats... and other such homely uses... as combing my hair.
[Groans]
So, Pan did you a favor then, Cap'n?
A favor?
He threw my hand to a crocodile.
The beast liked it so much, it's followed me ever since, licking its lips for the rest of me.
[Shouting]
You call that a favor?
No. No. No. No.
Thank you.
Thank Lucifer the beast swallowed a clock.
If it wasn't for the ticking,
it'd have had me by now.
[Groans]
Why did you wake me, Smee?
Like I said, Cap'n, the ice is melting.
The sun is out.
And the flowers are all in bloom.
He's back.

You can't catch me.

[Both]
Whoa!
Michael, are you shot?
I haven't checked yet!
But there's something worser!
Oh, what could be worse?
My thoughts aren't very happy!
Happy thoughts!
Happy thoughts.
What would Mom and Dad do?
Napoleon!
[Hook]
Damnation.!
Reload the cannon! Quickly!
Reload the cannon?
But, Cap'n, he is gone.
[Hook Piercing Flesh]
Any other contributions?
Search the jungle!
Bring me those children!
[Boy] What is it?
[Boy #2]
It's a large white bird.
Quite ugly too. No!
Give me it!
When Peter's away,
I'm in charge!
I get to look through the telescope.
It's coming closer.
[Squeals]
[Gasps]
My God, I've gone blind!
[Laughing]
[Mimicking]
I'm blind. I've gone blind.
I'm blind.
Hello, Tink. Where's Peter?
[Both]
Hello, Tink.
She's blinded me!
Hello, Tink.
Hello, Tink.
- Any more news of Cinderella?
- [Chatters]
[Narrator]
Now, Tinker Bell was not all bad.
Sometimes she was all good.
But fairies are so small they only
have room for one feeling at a time.
Tink says the bird's called a..."Wendy."
And Peter wants us to...
[Gasps]
Oh, Peter! Oh!
Shoot it down.
Well, we have our orders.
Shoot the Wendy bird.
[All]
Aye, aye!
Ready? Aim!
- [Gasps]
- Fire!
Bye-bye!
Three, two,
one.!
[All Gasp]
I got it. I got it!
[All Shouting]
[Laughing]
That is no bird.
It is a lady.
[Both]
And Tootles...
[All]
Tootles has killed her.
Ha! I'm back! Great news.
I know what happened to Cinderella.
She defeated the pirates.
There was stabbing, slicing, torturing, bleeding...
and they lived happily ever after.
Well, that's a relief,
I must say.
Greater news.!
I have brought you she that told of Cinderella.
She is to tell us stories!
She is...
Dead.
Tragic.
Awful.
Good shot, though.
Whose arrow?
Mine, Peter.
Strike, Peter.
Strike true.
[Moans]
- The Wendy lives!
- [Screams]
It's my kiss.
My kiss saved her.
I remember kisses.
Let me see it.
Aye, that is a kiss.
A powerful thing.
Let us carry her down to the house.
Hands.
They're a bit dirty.
She must stay here and die.
No!
Oh, how could I have thought that? Stupid.
Sorry.
We shall build a house around her.
[All Cheering, Chattering]
With a chimney!
And a door knocker!
And windows!
[Both Whispering]
Tink did it.
Tinker Bell?
Oh, Tinker Bell?
[Squeaks]
- Was it you, Tink?
- Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[Snickering,
Chattering]
Then I am your friend no more.
[Whimpers]
[Chuckling, Gasps]
[Chattering]
First impressions
are very, very important.
[Hammering]
Here she is.
Look loveable.
Wendy lady, for you we built
this house with a door knocker.
And a chimney.
One, two, three.
[All]
Please be our mother.
Oh.
Well, it is frightfully fascinating.
But, you see,
I've had no real experience.
Do you tell stories?
Yes.
Then you're perfect.
Very well.
- I will do my best.
- Hooray!
[All Chattering At Once]
Sorry about the blindfold.
We must be cautious.
There are some nasty characters about.
If Hook discovers our hideout, he'll gut us.
How dreadful!
Oh, we live for it!
But l...
Time to meet Father, Mother.
So looking forward to being your son.
[Screams]
[Both Grunt]
Welcome, Mother.
Discipline. That's what fathers believe in.
You must spank the children immediately before they try to kill you again.
In fact, we should kill them.
[Shouting]
[All Screaming]
Peter!
Father!
I agree that they are perfectly horrid, but kill them and they shall think themselves important.
So important.
And unique.
I suggest something... far more dreadful.
Medicine.
It's the most beastly, disgusting stuff.
[Sniffs]
The sticky, sweet kind.
[All]
Kill us, please!
Kill us, please!
Littlest first. Michael?
- Michael. John. My brothers!
- Who?
[Animal Roaring]
Hello?
[Echoing]
Hello? Hello? Hello?
[Ticking]
It's louder from inside this rock.
How very peculiar.
[Low Growling]
- [Roaring]
- [Screaming]
[John]
Happy thoughts.!
Swords, daggers, Napoleon.!
[Both Screaming]
How humiliating.
John, there's something worser.
[Both Screaming]
Princess Tiger Lily.
[Gasps]
We search as ever for Peter Pan... and his secret hideout.
Luckily, two boys of his acquaintance...
were seen falling
into this part of thejungle.
Have you seen them?
[Speaking Foreign Language]
She says,
"Sorry, but, no."
My Hook thinks you have, Princess.
I say, unhand that savage, you...
you...you savage.!
[Narrator]
Now, mermaids are not
as they are in storybooks.
They are dark creatures...
in touch with all things mysterious.
If Hook had captured
Wendy's brothers,
the mermaids would know.
Oh, how sweet.
Are mermaids not sweet?
They'll sweetly drown you if you get too close.
[Clicking Tongues]
- [Hisses]
- [Screeches]
Hook has your brothers at the Black Castle.
[Thunderclap]
Like all surprise attacks, it must be conducted... improperly.
Put the children on the rock.
** [Humming]
[Laughing]
Sorry, Your Highness.
Any last words?
Beg for your lives.
Sirs! My brother and I are English gentlemen.
English gentlemen do not beg.
Please!
Please! Please!
Please don't kill us!
Please don't kill me, either.
I've never done anything...
Aah! It's cold! It's cold!
[Michael]
Help.!
Come on. Fly to the rescue, and then I'll shoot you right through your noble intentions.
I brought these.
Can you use it?
Promise me one thing.
Leave Hook to me.
I promise.
- Wait here for my signal.
- Wait here?
Peter.!
[Narrator]
Thus Wendy first laid eyes on
the dark figure who haunted her stories.
She saw the piercing eyes
and was not afraid,
but entranced.
[Men]
* We're sure to meet below *
[Laughing]
[Hook]
Mr. Smee?
That you, Cap'n?
Brimstone and gall, man.
What do you think you're doing?
Well, we've put the children on the rope, Cap'n, like you said.
Set 'em free.!
Set 'em free?
- Well, what about your trap?
- Set them free, or
I'll plunge my hook in you.
[Sword Clanging]
[Gasps]
I don't know what he wants with 'em.
I'm just a blithering idiot, aren't I?
Chain 'em up. Let 'em go.
- And take your cat with ya.
- [Door Opens]
[Whispering
In Foreign Language]
Mr. Smee?
Aye, Cap'n?
- Any sign of him?
- No, Cap'n.
Where are the children?
It's all right, Cap'n.
We let 'em go.
You what?
We let 'em go.
- [Chuckling]
- [Both Laughing]
You... let... them... go.
- [Hook's Voice]
Mr. Smee!
- [Screaming]
Who are you, stranger?
I am James Hook,
captain of the Jolly Roger.
If you are Hook, then who am I?
You are a codfish.
[Pan Laughing]
Tell me, Hook,
have you another name?
Aye.
- Vegetable?
- No.
- Mineral?
- No.
Animal?
Yes.
- Man?
- [Own Voice]
No!
- Boy?
- Yes!
- Ordinary boy?
- No!
- Wonderful boy?
- Yes.! Do you give up?
- Yes!
- I am...
- History.
- Peter, look out!
[Laughing]
There he is!
It is your requiem mass, boy.
[Shouting]
Ready to lose the other one?
Not this time.
[Gasps]
[Chuckling]
Ooh-ooh, girlie.
[Chuckles]
[Screams]
Who be you to call me girlie?
- [Peter Laughing]
- Ow.
[Michael]
Open the gate.!
- [Shouting]
- [Screams]
Teddy.!
[Groans]
Ew.
Oh.
[Grunting]
If I were you, I'd give up.
If you were me, I'd be ugly.
No!
Ready?
Fire!
[John]
Get the boat.!
- [All Shouting]
- [Screaming]
[Coughs]
[Thunderclap]
Turn the boat around.
Turn it around!
And now, Peter Pan, you shall die.
To die will be an awfully big adventure.
[Ticking]
Oh, no.
[Roars]
- Shoot it!
- [Men Shouting]
[Grunts]
[Children Laughing]
You.
[Gasps]
Smee!
Smee.!
It's all a bit tragic, really, isn't it?
[Children Whooping]

The warrior is wounded.
She is calling forth the spirit of the eagle to heal the warrior.
It's so impressive.
The warrior is healed.

[Whooping]
Peter?
Shh.
Peter?
[Gasps]
Evil day.
He has found himself a...
[Chattering]
Wendy?
And Hook is all alone.
Me too.
You too?
Banished? Tsk, tsk.
The dog.
[Chatters]
I think you and I... should talk.
Wendy?
It's only make-believe, isn't it?
That you and I are...
Oh. Yes.
Wendy?
You see, it would make me seem so old to be a real father.
Peter, what are your real feelings?
Feelings?
What do you feel?
Happiness? Sadness?
Jealousy?
Jealousy?
Tink!
Anger?
- Anger.
- [Branch Snaps]
Hook.
Love?
- Love?
- Love.
I have never heard of it.
I think you have, Peter.
I daresay you've felt it yourself... for something or... someone.
Never. Even the sound of it offends me.
Peter.
[Gasps]
Why do you spoil everything?
We have fun, don't we?
I taught you to fight and to fly.
What more could there be?
There is so much more.
What? What else is there?
I don't know.
I think it becomes clearer when you grow up.
Well, I will not grow up!
You cannot make me!
I will banish you like Tinker Bell!
I will not be banished!
Then go home.
Go home and grow up.
And take your feelings with you!
Peter!
Peter, come back! Peter!
[Tinker Bell Chattering]
[Wendy Crying]
[Narrator]
Peter did not want Wendy to leave.
Once again,
he visited Wendy's home...
to see if Mr. And Mrs. Darling
had closed the window yet.
But, as before, he saw
Mrs. Darling in her chair...
by the window, her eyes tired
with searching the heavens.
Wendy.
Wendy.
Wendy.
We can't both have her, lady.
[Windowpane Squeaking]
[Gasps]
John! Michael!
Wendy!
[Barks]
[Gasps]
The window's closed.
- George! George, help me!
- What is it? Have they returned?
The window is closed.
It must always be open for them.
- Always. Always.
- [All Grunting]
They've not returned.

Wendy, darling.
Muscat, miss?
I'm a little girl.
Rum, then?
[Chuckles]
No, thank you.
I'm told you ran away from home.
L... I had never thought of it that way.
[Tinker Bell Chattering]
I suppose I did.
How wonderful.
[Screams]
[Wendy]
My parents wanted me to grow up.
[Scoffs]
Growing up is such a barbarous business, full of inconvenience and pimples.
Things were simpler when I was younger.
And then the mess starts, the feelings come.
Pan is so lucky to be untroubled by them.
Oh, no. He cannot love.
It's part of the riddle
ofhis being.
Cigar?
Oh, there, there.
Shh, shh, shh.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
It doesn't have to be this way.
Didst thou ever want to be a pirate, my hearty?
I once thought of calling myself...
Mm?
Red-Handed Jill.
Oh, what a marvelous name!
That's what we'll call you if you join us.
But what would my duties be?
I could not be expected to pillage.
Do you, um, by any chance, tell stories?
[Wendy]
And they all lived happily...
ever... after.
Bravo!
Bravissimo.!
Might I have time to consider your generous offer?
Absolutely.
Of course, you must.
My fellows will return you whence they found you.
None of my crew will follow you.
I swear it.
My new obsession is you, not dear Peter Pan or his whereabouts.
[All Chuckling]
What would Mother think of my becoming a pirate?
Until we meet again.
[Owl Hooting]
[Bird Squawking]
[Squawking]
[Narrator]
What would Mother think
if she became a pirate?
But the more Wendy
thought ofher mother,
the less she could remember.
- John.
- I wasn't doing anything!
- John!
- Yes?
What is your father's name?
My father's name? Peter.
Father!
Yea, Peter!
Michael, who is your mother?
- Well, he got the easy one.
- You are my mother, Wendy.
And isn't she just first-class?
[Howls]
There's a new pirate aboard the Jolly Roger.
The mermaids say she is called Red-Handed Jill.
Another adventure, boys.
Come on!
[Cheering]
Red-Handed Jill?
She sounds quite fearsome!
Fearsome?
She's just a storyteller.
Just a storyteller?
Red-Handed Jill may be a brave swordsman.
[All Laughing]
A girl like her?
Brave or not,
I shall run her through!
[All Cheering]
[Cheering Stops]
Then ready yourself, Peter Pan, for I am Red-Handed Jill.
Mother!
Wendy?
'Tis true, John.
Your sister has been invited to piracy.
[Boy]
But, Mother, Hook is a fiend.
- And a bounder.
- On the contrary,
I find Captain Hook to be a man of feeling.
[Gasps, Whimpers]
[All Gasp]
Mother and Father are fighting again.
Sir, you are both ungallant and deficient.
How am I deficient?
You're just a boy.
Are you really to be a pirate, Mother?
No.
We are going home.
[All Gasp]
[Michael]
Home?
- Leave Neverland?
- [Murmuring]
We must.
We have forgotten our parents.
We must leave at once
before we... in turn are forgotten.
I've forgotten... my parents.
We must leave.
[All Shouting]
If you wish it.
- "If you wish it"?
- If you wish it!
[Parrot Squawking]
[Squawking]
[Snickering]
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!
Don't fret, my dear.
With Pan dead, we'll both be free.
[Chattering]
I have arranged a fairy guide to lead you back.
Peter, we've been talking.
What if you came back with us?
Can we go, Peter?
Please, Peter, can we go?
If you wish it.
Get your things.
[All Cheering]
You too, Peter.
Would they send me to school?
Yes.
Then... to an office?
I suppose so.
Soon I should be a man.
- You can't catch me and make me a man.
- Peter.
I want always to be a boy and have fun.
You say so, but I think it is your biggest pretend.

[Squawking Continues]
Oh! Ooh. Ooh-la-la!

Bye-bye!

There's no such thing as fairies.
**[Pipe]
Don't forget your medicine.

[Muffled Crying]
A new era begins.
[Snickering]
Take them away.
[Pirates Chattering,
Laughing]
[Snickering]
[Mumbling]
No medicine.
I don't wanna take medicine.
[Hook Grunting]
No.
[Grunting Continues]
[Narrator]
Lest he should be taken alive,
Hook always carried upon
his person a dreadful poison...
distilled when he was weeping
from the red ofhis eye.
No.
[Narrator]
A mixture of malice,
jealousy and disappointment,
it was instantly fatal
and without antidote.
[Gasps, Groans]
I was not asleep!
Wendy?
Wendy? Are you there?
[Squealing]
[Squealing Continues]

You drank my medicine.

Tink?
Why is your light going out?
Tink, why are you so cold?
[Panting]
Stay warm, Tink.
Stay warm.
Please come back.
[Sobbing]
Please, Tink, don't leave me.
Forgive me, Tink.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, Tink.
Please forgive me.
Tink!
[Thunderclap]
[Cheering, Yelling]
There's still room for a storyteller.
I'd rather die.
Shame.
Cap'n, Cap'n.
Look at the sky.
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- And look at the water.
Pan must be dead.
[Together]
No! No! Impossible!
[Snickering]
Ship's company, hats off!
A moment's silence for our fallen enemy,
Peter Pan.
- We sail at dawn!

I do believe in fairies.

- He's alive!
Oh, help.
It's Hook or me this time.
[Chattering]
Why is he? What is he?
I'll have one last story
before you die.
The story of Peter Pan.
[Gasps]
Once upon a time...
Once upon a time...
Brutes, Red-Handed Jill is gonna tell us a story.
[All Cheering]
There was a boy named Peter Pan...
who decided
not to grow up.
[Gasps]
Skip the prologue.
So he flew away to the Neverland where the pirates are.
[Gasps]
Was one of them pirates called Noodler?
- Yes.
- Captain, did you hear?
- I am in a story.
- [Boys Screaming]
What fun he must have had.
Yes.
But he was rather lonely.
Lonely?
He needed a Wendy.
- I need a Wendy.
- [Boys Screaming]
Very exciting.
Two dead already.
Why a Wendy?
He liked my stories.
What stories?
Cinderella.
Snow White. Sleeping Beauty.
- Love stories?
- [Groaning]
Adventures in which good triumphs over evil.
- [All Cheering]
- They all end in a kiss.
A kiss.
He does feel.
He feels about you.
[Pirates Yelling]
She told him stories.
He taught her to fly.
- How?
- [Snickers]
You just think happy thoughts.
They lift you into the air.
Alas, I have no happy thoughts.
That brings you down.
- [All Gasping]
- How else?
- No!
- Leave her alone.!
It's fairy dust.
You need fairy dust!
[Boys Together]
Michael.!
[Gasps]
What of Pan?
Will unhappy thoughts bring him down?
He has no unhappy thoughts.
Aw.
How if his Wendy walks the plank!
[Pirates Cheering]
[Pirates Chanting]
Plank.! Plank.! Plank.! Plank.!
Plank.! Plank.! Plank.! Plank.!
Plank! Plank! Plank! Plank!
Plank! Plank! Plank! Plank!
Plank! Plank! Plank! Plank!
Plank, plank, plank!
[Chattering]
You know, I really am
terribly sorry about this.
- [All Gasping]
- [Ticking]
The irony.
It comes for Hook... and gets a story.
- [Wendy Screams]
- No!
[Pirates Laughing]
- [Screaming]
- No!
[Snickering]
Did you hear her hit the water?
Because I didn't.
[Hook]
The beast has swallowed her whole.
Hmm.
[Both Snickering]
- Starboard side!
- [Pirates Shouting]
- It looks for more, Captain.
- Then let's give it more.
To the plank!
[Cheering]
- [Boys Protesting]
- Silence, puling spawn!
[Gasps]
I'll show you the road to dusty death.
- [Boys Screaming]
- [Pirates Cheering]
Huh?
[Ticking]
- [Grunts]
- Into the rigging with you!
Hunt it down!
Move, you scabs!
[Chattering]
[Boys Screaming]
[Boys Gasping, Laughing]
- [Pirate Shouting]

[Water Splashing]
What was that?
[Pirates Chattering]
It's here, Captain.! Devil.! Demon.!
Accursed beast.!
Your time is up.!
Hello.
[Screams]
[Water Splashing]
So, Peter Pan.
This is all your doing.
Aye, James Hook.
It's all my doing.
Proud and insolent youth, prepare to meet thy doom.
Have at thee!
[Grunting]
[Grunting Continues]
[Pirates Yelling]
Leave him.! He's mine.
Now!
[Boys Yelling]
[Yells]
[Grunting]
[Peter Yells]
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
- [Screams]
[Grunting Continues]
[Screaming]
Here you are. Here.
I never wanted to be a pirate anyway.
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life doing good works.
[Screaming]
[Grunts]
I got him!
[Screaming, Grunts]
Villain! Ne'er-do-well!
Libertine.!
[Screaming]
[Screams, Muffled Chattering]
[Grunting Continues]
[Yelling]
- It's Hook! He flies!
- [Peter Grunts]
[Grunts]
And he likes it!
[Grunting]
[Laughs]
[Screams, Grunts]
You want to fly? Let's fly.
[Peter Laughing]
Not bad... for an old man.
[Laughs]
[Grunts]
[Laughing Continues]
I know what you are!
I am the best there ever was!
You're a tragedy.
- [Peter Grunts]
- [Hook Screams, Grunts]
Me? Tragic?
She was leaving you, Pan.
Your Wendy was leaving you.
Why should she stay?
What have you to offer?
You are incomplete.
She'd rather grow up than stay with you.
[Grunts]
Let us now take a peep into the future.
[Yelling]
What's this I see?
'Tis the fair Wendy.
She's in her nursery.
The window's shut.
I'll open it!
[Grunting]
I'm afraid the window's barred.
I'll call out her name.
She can't hear you.
No!
She can't see you.
Wendy!
She's forgotten all about you.
Stop! Please! Stop it!
And what is this I see?
[Panting]
There is another in your place.
He is called... husband.
[Grunts]
[Yells, Grunts]
[All Grunting]
[Panting]
[Grunts]
[Screams]
[Boy]
No.! Peter.!
[Grunts]
[Screams, Gasps]
You die alone... and unloved.
Unloved.
Just like me.
- No!
- No!
[Yelling]
[Screaming]
- [Boys Shouting]
- Silence, all,
for Wendy's farewell.
Peter.
I'm sorry. I must grow up.
But... this is yours.
[Grunts]
'Tis just a thimble.
[Scoffs]
How like a girl!
- [Pirates Laughing]
- By all means, my beauty.
Give Peter Pan your precious thimble.
This belongs to you... and always will.
Ohh.
That was no thimble.
That was her hidden kiss.
[Thunder Rumbling]
Brace yourselves, lads.
'Tis a powerful thing.
Pan, you're pink!
[Bell Ringing]
Split my infinitives!
- [Yelling]
- [Screaming]
- [Screams]
- [Laughing]
[Laughing]
[Boys Cheering]
No! I have won!
[Peter Laughs]
Whoo-hoo!
[Hook Groaning]
You... are old.
[Grunts]
But I won!
Old.
And alone!
- Alone.
- [Hook Screaming]
- No! I won! I won!
- [Crocodile Roars]
- [Gasps]
- Done for.
Happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.
Ripping! Killing! Killing!
Choking! Lawyers! Dentists!
[Chanting Together]
Old! Alone! Done for!
[Whining]
Old.! Alone.! Done for.!
Old.! Alone.! Done for.!
Pus!
Uh, children's blood.
Puppies' blood.
- Old! Alone! Done for!
Old! Alone! Done for!
- Disease.! Scabs.!
Kittens dashed on spikes! No!

Old.! Alone.! Done for.!
Old.! Alone.!
Old. Alone.
Done for!
Done for.
[Imitating Hook]
Brimstone and gall!
Silence, you dogs!
Or I'll cast anchor in you.
[Cheering]
We won! We won!
Ready to cast off?
[Together]
Aye. Aye, Captain.
Oh, the cleverness of you.

[John]
Mother.
Nana.
[Gasps, Sighs]
Let us break it to her gently.
[Gasps]
[Gasps]
Oh, Nana.
I dreamt my little ones had come back.
I dreamed they were asleep... in their beds.
But they will never come back.
[Narrator]
They did not understand
how she could not see them.
But, you see, she saw them in their beds
so often in her dreams...
that she thought this was just
the dream hanging around her still.
[Gasps]
Hello, Mother. It really is us.
[Sighs]
Michael.
John.
Wendy.
We're back.
[All Laughing]
George, come quickly!
I'm coming.! What is it?
We're back, Father.
Did you miss us?
You're back.
Good. Excellent.
Well done.
[Sobbing]
Oh, my angel.
Of course I missed you.
[Sobbing Continues]
All right, boys, follow me.
Get your hands off that wallpaper.
Now, come on in.
The silliest thing.
These young gentlemen say that...
You're back.
[Squealing]
[All Laughing]
Ohhh.
Mother, Father,
I would like to introduce the Lost Boys.
Hello.
Hats.
May I keep them?
Well, l-l...
I mean, the expense.
Think of the neighbors.
Dash the neighbors!
[Laughs]
And dash the expense!
[Laughs]
Welcome to the family, boys.
[Cheering]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[Cheering Continues]
Will this help the expense, Father?
[Gasps]
Anyone for a pony ride?
[Cheering]
I'm Tootles.
Tootles, darling.
- I'm Curly.
- Curly, darling.
And what's your name?
Nibs. I plan the battles.
Would you like a mother, Nibs?
Yes.
Oh!
What is the matter, child?
I couldn't find the house.
And now everyone has a mother, except me.
[Chattering]
Is your name Slightly?
Yes.
Then I am your mother.
How do you know?
I feel it in my bones.
Mother!
George! Mary! I have a son!
[Narrator]
There could not have been
a lovelier sight,
but there was none to see it...
except a strange boy who
was staring in at the window.
Peter Pan had countless joys...
that other children
can never know,
but he was looking
at the onejoy...
from which he must be
forever barred.
To live would be an awfully big adventure.
[Chattering]
[Blowing Raspberry]
** [Violin]
Peter!
You won't forget me, will you?
Me? Forget?
Never.
Will you come back?
To hear stories... about me.
[Chuckles]
[Narrator]
But I was not to see
Peter Pan again.
Now I tell his story
to my children,
and they will tell it
to their children...
and so it will go on.
For all children grow up...
except one.

Harry, open the door.
Marge. How lovely to see...
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.
What is it?
Nothing. School stuff.
Later perhaps, if you behave.
I will if she does.
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.
Don't say yes in that ungrateful way.
Damn good of my brother to keep you.
He'd have been straight to an orphanage if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.
Okay.
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.
Excellent nosh, Petunia.
A bit more.
Usually just a fry-up for me, what with 12 dogs.
Just a bit more. That's a boy.
You wanna try a little drop of brandy?
A little drop of brandy-brandy windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?
What are you smirking at?
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?
St. Brutus'. It's a fine institution for hopeless cases.
Do they use a cane at St. Brutus', boy?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.
Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...
...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it.
You mustn't blame yourself about how this one turned out.
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.
I think it's time you went to bed.
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.
Actually, it's nothing to do with the father.
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.
If something's wrong with the bitch, then something's wrong with the pup.
Shut up! Shut up!
Right.
Let me tell you...
Vernon!
Vernon! Vernon, do something!
Stop!
I've got you, Marge.
I've got you.
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.
Oh, Vernon.
Oh, God.
Marge!
Please!
Marge!
Come back!
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.
You've nowhere to go.
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

What you doing down there?
- I fell over.
- What you fell over for?
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.
Well, come on, then. In.
No, no, no. I'll get this. You get in.
Come on.
Come on. Move on, move on.
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.
It's going to be a bumpy ride.
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London."
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...
...make sure you eat it before it eats you.
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?
They don't see nothing, do they?
No, but if you jab them with a fork, they feel.
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!
Ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six, five...
...four, three, three and a half...
...two, one and three quarters.
Yes!
Who is that?
That man.
Who is that?
Who is...?
That is Sirius Black, that is.
Don't tell me you've never been hearing of Sirius Black.
He's a murderer.
Got himself locked up in Azkaban for it.
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?
He's the first one that done it.
He was a big supporter of...
...You-Know-Who.
I reckon you've heard of him.
Yeah.
Him I've heard of.
Ernie, two double-deckers at 12 o'clock.
They're getting closer, Ernie.
Ernie, they're right on top of us!
Mind your head.
Hey, guys? Guys?
Why the long faces?
Yeah, yeah.
Nearly there. Nearly there.
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.
Mr. Potter, at last.
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!
Room 11.
Hedwig.
Right smart bird you got there, Mr. Potter.
He arrived here just five minutes before yourself.
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty to inform you, Mr. Potter...
...earlier this evening your uncle's sister was located...
...a little south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack.
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.
She has been properly punctured and her memory modified.
She will have no recollection of the incident whatsoever.
So that's that...
...and no harm done.
Pea soup?
No, thank you.
- Minister?
- Yes?
- I don't understand.
- Understand?
I broke the law. Underage wizards can't use magic at home.
Come now. The Ministry doesn't send people to Azkaban...
...for blowing up their aunts.
On the other hand, running away like that, given the state of things...
...was very, very irresponsible.
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.
Sirius Black, you mean?
But what's he got to do with me?
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.
And tomorrow you'll be on your way back to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.
Hedwig.
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're here, it would be best if you didn't...
...wander.
Right! You gonna move that bus or what?
Housekeeping.
I'll come back later.
I'm warning you, Hermione.
Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...
...coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
Crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy.
Harry.
Harry.
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...
...like mummies, tombs, even Scabbers enjoyed himself.
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.
- The day maid.
- Night maid.
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.
- Got everything?
- Yes.
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.
- Your clothes?
- Everything.
- Good boy.
- Thank you.
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.
Harry, some within the Ministry would strongly discourage me...
...from divulging what I'm about to reveal to you.
But I think that you need to know the facts.
You are in danger.
Grave danger.
Has this anything to do with Sirius Black, sir?
What do you know about Sirius Black, Harry?
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?
Thirteen years ago, when you stopped...
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.
Sorry.
When you stopped You-Know-Who...
...Black lost everything.
But to this day, he still remains a faithful servant.
And in his mind...
...you are the only thing that stands in the way...
...of You-Know-Who returning to power.
And that is why...
...he has escaped from Azkaban.
To find you.
And kill me.
Harry, swear to me that whatever you might hear...
...you won't go looking for Black.
Mr. Weasley...
...why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me?
Quick. Quick.
Ron, Ron!
Oh, for goodness' sake!
Don't lose him!
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.
I was lucky not to be arrested.
I still think it was brilliant.
Come on. Everywhere else is full.
Who do you think that is?
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?
How is it she knows everything?
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?
I gotta tell you something.
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...
...to come after you?
- Yeah.
But they'll catch Black, won't they?
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.
Except no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before...
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.
Why are we stopping?
We can't be there yet.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.
There's something moving out there.
I think someone's coming aboard.
Bloody hell! What's happening?
Harry.
Harry, are you all right?
Thank you.
Here, eat this. It'll help.
It's all right. It's chocolate.
What was that thing that came?
It was a dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now.
It was searching the train for Sirius Black.
If you'll excuse me, I need to have a little word with the driver.
Eat. You'll feel better.
What happened to me?
Well, you sort of went rigid.
We thought maybe you were having a fit or something.
And did either of you two...
...you know...
...pass out?
- No.
I felt weird, though.
Like I'd never be cheerful again.
But someone was screaming.
A woman.
No one was screaming, Harry.
Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts.
Now, I'd like to say a few words...
...before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast.
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...
...who's kindly consented to fill the post...
...of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Good luck, professor.
Of course. That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry.
Potter. Is it true you fainted?
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.
Our Care of Magical Creatures teacher...
...has decided to retire...
...in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs.
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...
...that his place will be taken by none other...
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.
Finally, on a more disquieting note...
...at the request of the Ministry of Magic...
...Hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of Azkaban...
...until such a time as Sirius Black is captured.
The dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds.
Now whilst I've been assured...
...that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities...
...a word of caution.
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...
...between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way.
Therefore, I must warn each and every one of you...
...to give them no reason to harm you.
It is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving.
But you know, happiness can be found...
...even in the darkest of times...
...if one only remembers to turn on the light.
Fortuna Major.
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.
- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.
Watch this.
- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.
Still doing that after three years.
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.
Green. That's a monkey.
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?
Do not give him one again.
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.
- Ron, catch.
- I will.
I think we have a winner.
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.
Look at him. His face.
Welcome, my children.
In this room, you shall explore the noble art of Divination.
In this room, you shall discover if you possess the Sight.
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.
Together we shall cast ourselves into the future.
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy, the art of reading tea leaves.
So please, take the cup of the person sitting opposite you.
What do you see?
The truth lies buried like a sentence deep within a book, waiting to be read.
But first, you must broaden your minds.
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.
- Where did you come from?
- Me?
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...
Is your grandmother quite well?
I think so.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.
Pity.
Broaden your minds.
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?
- I think you are.
- Sure.
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.
Yeah.
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.
And that there could be the sun and that's happiness.
So...
...you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be happy about it.
Give me the cup.
Oh, my dear boy.
My dear...
...you have the Grim.
The Grin? What's the Grin?
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.
It's among the darkest omens in our world.
It's an omen...
...of death."
You don't think that Grim thing's got anything to do with Sirius Black?
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.
Now, Ancient Runes, that's a fascinating subject.
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking?
A fair few.
Hang on. That's not possible.
Ancient Runes is in the same time as Divination.
You have to be in two classes at once.
Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future."
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.
I got a real treat for you today.
A great lesson. So follow me.
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.
And open your books to page 49.
Exactly how do we do that?
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.
Witty. God, this place has gone to the dogs.
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes.
Shut up, Malfoy.
Dementor! Dementor!
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.
Yeah.
Isn't he beautiful?
Say hello to Buckbeak.
Hagrid, exactly what is that?
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.
First thing you wanna know is they're very proud creatures.
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.
It may be the last thing you ever do.
Now, who'd like to come and say hello?
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Come on now.
Now...
...you have to let him make the first move. It's only polite. So...
...step up. Give him a nice bow.
Then you wait and see if he bows back.
If he does, you can go and touch him.
If not... Well, we'll get to that later.
Just make your bow.
Nice and low.
Back off, Harry. Back off.
Keep still.
Keep still.
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.
Right. I think you can go and pat him now.
Go on. Don't be shy.
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.
Not so fast, Harry.
Slow down, Harry. That's it...
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...
That's it...
Yes!
Well done! Well done, Harry, well done!
Does he get to fly?
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Put you over here, just behind the wing joint.
Don't pull out any of his feathers, because he won't thank you for that.
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.
That was wicked, Harry!
Oh, please.
Well done, well done.
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.
You're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute!
Malfoy, no...
No!
Buckbeak!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa! Buckbeak!
Away, you silly creature...
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!
Hagrid!
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!
You and your bloody chicken!
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.
Madam Pomfrey said another minute and I could've lost my arm.
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.
- He's been sighted!
- Who?
Sirius Black!
Dufftown? That's not far from here.
You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you?
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.
Like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands.
Intriguing, isn't it?
Would anyone like to venture a guess...
...as to what is inside?
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.
Now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like?
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever a person fears the most.
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...
Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart.
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.
After me. Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- Very good.
A little louder and very clear.
- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.
So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is not enough.
What really finishes a boggart is laughter.
You need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing.
Let me explain. Neville, would you join me, please?
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.
Come on.
Hello. Neville, what frightens you most of all?
Professor Snape.
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.
No...
...it won't. I want you to picture her clothes.
Only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind.
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...
...here's what I want you to do. Excuse me.
Imagine Professor Snape in your grandmother's clothes.
Can you do that?
Yes. Wand at the ready.
One, two, three.
Think, Neville, think.
Riddikulus!
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...
Form a line!
I want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most...
...and turn it into something funny.
Next! Ron!
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!
Wand at the ready, Ron.
Riddikulus!
Yes!
You see? Very good, very good!
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very enjoyable! Parvati! Next!
Show us what you see.
Keep your nerve. Steady.
Riddikulus!
And next! Step up, step up!
Wonderful, wonderful!
Here!
Riddikulus!
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.
Collect your books from the back.
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!
Sorry, you can have too much of a good thing.
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect poorly on the school...
...that privilege shall not be extended again.
No permission form signed, no visiting the village.
That's the rule, Potter.
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.
I thought if you signed it, then I could...
I can't. Only a parent or a guardian can sign.
Since I am neither, it would be inappropriate.
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.
Forget about it, guys. See you later.
Professor, can I ask you something?
You want to know why I stopped you facing that boggart, yes?
I thought it'd be obvious.
I assumed it would take the shape of Lord Voldemort.
I did think of Voldemort at first.
But then I remembered that night on the train...
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.
That suggests what you fear the most is fear itself.
This is very wise.
Before I fainted...
...I heard something.
A woman...
...screaming.
Dementors force us to relive our very worst memories.
Our pain becomes their power.
I think it was my mother...
...the night she was murdered.
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.
Not by your scar, by your eyes.
They're your mother, Lily's.
Yes.
Oh, yes. I knew her.
Your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was.
Not only was she a singularly gifted witch...
...she was also an uncommonly kind woman.
She had a way of seeing the beauty in others...
...even, and most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves.
And your father, James, on the other hand...
...he...
He had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble.
A talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you.
You're more like them than you know, Harry.
In time, you'll come to see just how much.
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.
We never got to go to the Shrieking Shack.
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.
What's going on?
Probably Neville forgot the password again.
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!
Get back, all of you.
No one is to enter this dormitory until it's been searched.
The Fat Lady! She's gone!
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.
It's not funny, Ron.
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.
- Be quiet.
- Make way.
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.
You heard. Move!
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.
Tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the Fat Lady.
There's no need for ghosts, professor.
The Fat Lady's there.
Mind where you're going! Slow down!
You listen! I'm Head Boy!
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!
Dear lady, who did this to you?
Eyes like the devil, he's got, and a soul as dark as his name.
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.
He's here, somewhere in the castle!
Sirius Black!
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.
I've searched the Astronomy Tower and the Owlery. There's nothing there.
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else in the castle.
I didn't really expect him to linger.
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts Castle on one's own...
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.
Any theories on how he managed it?
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.
You may recall...
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...
...about your appointment of Professor...
Not a single professor inside this castle would help Sirius Black enter it.
I'm quite convinced the castle is safe...
...and I'm more than willing to send the students to their houses.
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.
For in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own.
Let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud.
Turn to page 394.
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?
That's not really your concern, is it, Potter?
Suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching...
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.
"Werewolves"?
Sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks.
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?
Now, which one of you can tell me the difference...
...between an Animagus and a werewolf?
No one?
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.
An Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal.
A werewolf has no choice.
With each full moon...
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.
The werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind.
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.
Are you incapable of restraining yourself...
...or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all?
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.
As an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by Monday morning...
...two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis...
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.
Loss of limb will not excuse you.
Page 394.
The term "werewolf"...
...is a contraction of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...
...which means "man," and "wolf."
Werewolf, man-wolf.
There are several ways to become a werewolf.
They include being given the power of shape-shifting...
...being bitten by a werewolf...
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!
Aresto momentum!
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.
Let's walk you off a tower and see what you look like.
Probably a right sight better than he normally does.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.
You gave us a right good scare.
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.
Really? I meant the match. Who won?
No one blames you, Harry.
Dementors aren't supposed to be on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.
After he saved you, he sent them off.
There's something else you should know too.
When you fell, your broom sort of blew into the Whomping Willow, and...
Well...
I'm sorry to hear about your broomstick.
Is there no chance of fixing it?
No.
Professor, why do the dementors affect me so?
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.
Dementors are the foulest creatures to walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling, every happy memory...
...until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences.
You are not weak, Harry.
Dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past.
Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine.
You have nothing to be ashamed of.
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.
You made the one on the train go away.
There was only one that night.
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.
But as the dementors seem to have developed an interest in you...
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.
For now, I need to rest.
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.
We'll get you there.
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- lf you pipe down.
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.
What are you doing?!
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...
But we've decided your needs are greater than ours.
George, if you will.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs...
...are proud to present the Marauder's Map."
We owe them so much.
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.
- In his study.
- Pacing.
Does that a lot.
- So this map shows...?
- Everyone.
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.
- Every minute.
- Every day.
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.
And don't forget. When you're done,
"Mischief managed."
Otherwise, anyone can read it.
Now, how much do you want?
Delicious.
It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
Twice.
Do you want to move a bit closer?
To the Shrieking Shack?
Actually, I'm fine here.
Well, well. Look who's here.
You two shopping for your new dream home?
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!
You filthy little mudblood!
Who is that?
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?
Get out of the way!
Move!
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!
Harry!
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.
Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map.
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over to Professor McGonagall.
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!
Allow me, minister.
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry wasn't sending dementors...
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!
And what would bring him here?
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?
Come.
Harry!
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!
- So rude.
- Thick heads.
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!
Nobody will come to a pub where they'll get scared out of their wits.
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want dementors around the place.
Tell me what this is all about.
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents realized they were marked for death...
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.
Not only did Black lead him to the Potters that night...
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.
Never let James and Sirius out of his sight.
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...
...and might have, had he not run into an old friend, Sirius Black.
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.
He destroyed him!
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.
Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters...
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...
...and remains to this day...
...Harry Potter's godfather!
Ron, look!
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.
Harry, what happened?
He was their friend...
...and he betrayed them.
He was their friend!
I hope he finds me.
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!
Harry.
There you are. You came.
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.
I'm sure.
Well, everything's prepared.
The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus Charm.
Did you ever hear of it?
No? Well...
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...
...it works like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.
But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.
Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.
Close your eyes.
Concentrate.
Explore your past.
Do you have a memory?
Allow it to fill you up.
Lose yourself within it.
Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.
- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.
Shall we? Wand at the ready.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto... Expecto...
Expect...
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.
It's all right. I didn't expect you to do it the first time.
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.
As a matter of interest, what were you thinking?
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.
Well, it is.
It's the happiest I've ever felt...
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?
Then let's give it a try.
You feel ready?
Just do it.
Expecto Patronum!
Expecto Patronum!
Yes!
Well done, Harry. Well done!
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.
And just so you know, Harry...
...I think you'd have given your father a run for his money. And that...
...is saying something.
I was thinking of him.
And Mum.
Seeing their faces.
They were talking to me.
Just talking.
That's the memory I chose.
I don't even know if it's real.
But it's the best I have.
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.
Harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers...
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.
Well, maybe you should take better care of your pets!
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.
- Did.
- Didn't.
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?
Well, first off, the committee members took turns...
...talking about why we were there.
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...
...was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers.
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.
He said Buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature...
...who would kill you as soon as look at you.
And then?
And then he asked for the worst, did old Lucius.
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- You tell those spiders.
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew, he destroyed him!
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!
Mischief managed. Nox.
Potter.
What are you doing wandering the corridors at night?
I was sleepwalking.
How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter.
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle.
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I would appreciate it if you could lower your wand.
Turn out your pockets.
Turn out your pockets!
What's this?
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.
Reveal your secrets.
Read it.
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs...
...offer their compliments to Professor Snape and..."
Go on.
"And request he keep his large nose out of other people's business."
- You insolent little...
- Professor!
Well, well. Lupin.
Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we?
Harry, are you all right?
That remains to be seen.
I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact.
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.
It looks as though it's a parchment designed to insult anyone...
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.
Nevertheless, I shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess.
It is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise.
Harry, would you come with me, please? Professor, good night.
Are you deaf? Put that light out!
Come in.
I haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession...
...but quite frankly, I am astounded that you didn't hand it in.
Did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of Sirius Black...
...is a map to you?
- No.
- No, sir.
Your father never set much store by the rules either.
But he and your mother gave their lives to save yours.
Gambling their sacrifice by wandering the castle unprotected...
...with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them!
Now, I will not cover up for you again.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.
I want you to return to your dormitory and stay there.
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.
Oh, really? And who might that be?
Peter Pettigrew.
That's not possible.
It's just what I saw.
Good night, professor.
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.
The art of crystal gazing is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.
Only then can you see. Try again.
Now, what do we have here?
Do you mind me trying?
The Grim, possibly.
My dear, from the first moment you stepped foot in my class...
...I sensed that you did not possess the proper spirit...
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.
You may be young in years, but your heart is as shriveled...
...as an old maid's, your soul as dry as the pages of the books...
...to which you so desperately cleave.
Have I said something?
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...
...but now it's in the open for everyone to see.
Hang on.
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.
Harry Potter...
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.
Sorry?
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends, whose heart rots with murder...
...shall break free.
Innocent blood shall be spilt...
...and servant and master shall be reunited once more.
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?
No.
Nothing.
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.
This is going to be rich.
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?
You! You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
Hermione, no!
He's not worth it.
Malfoy, are you okay?
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees when the wind blows through them.
Why don't we just set him free?
They'd know it was me, and then Dumbledore...
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.
Says he wants to be with me when they...
When it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
A great man.
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!
Think I want you seeing something like that? No.
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...
Scabbers! You're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.
I meant me!
Blimey. What was that?
Hagrid!
Oh, crikey.
No, minister. Over this way.
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.
Someone sees you outside this time of night, you'll be in trouble.
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!
Quick. Quick!
Hagrid.
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.
Well, I think we should get down to our business, shall we?
Very well. It is the decision of the Committee for the Disposal...
...of Dangerous Creatures that the hippogriff Buckbeak...
...hereinafter called "the condemned," shall be executed this day at sundown.
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go!
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.
Oh, no.
He bit me. Scabbers.
Ron. Ron!
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.
Wait!
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?
That's not good. Ron, run!
Harry, Hermione, run!
It's the Grim!
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!
Harry!
- Help!
- Ron!
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!
Come on!
Move!
Duck!
Harry!
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.
I just hope I'm wrong.
We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we?
Come on.
Ron.
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.
If you want to kill Harry, you have to kill us too!
No. Only one will die tonight.
Then it'll be you!
Are you going to kill me, Harry?
Expelliarmus!
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?
Finally, the flesh reflects the madness within.
Well, you'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you?
- I found him.
- I know.
- He's here.
- I understand.
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!
And all this time, you've been his friend.
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.
How long have you known?
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.
You are the brightest witch of your age I've ever met.
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!
Twelve years of it!
In Azkaban!
Very well. Kill him.
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.
I know why.
You betrayed my parents.
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.
Somebody did betray your parents...
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!
And he's in this room! Right now!
Come out, come out, Peter!
- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!
Vengeance is sweet.
How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
Severus...
I told Dumbledore you were helping a friend into the castle. Here's the proof.
Brilliant, Snape.
You put your keen mind to the task and come to the wrong conclusion.
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!
You two, quarrelling like an old married couple.
Run along and play with your chemistry set!
I could do it, you know.
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only imagine what that must be like.
It's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but I'll do my best.
Severus, please.
After you.
Expelliarmus!
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.
We thought he was our friend!
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?
Curiously long life for a common garden rat!
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?
- All they could find of Pettigrew was his...
- Finger!
Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead!
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?
Scabbers!
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?
Remus?
Sirius.
My old friends!
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!
How dare you talk about James in front of him!
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!
The Dark Lord. You have no idea the weapons he possesses!
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!
James wouldn't have wanted me killed!
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!
Should have realized if Voldemort didn't kill you, we would. Together!
No!
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.
But we'll take him to the castle.
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!
I said we'd take you to the castle.
After that, the dementors can have you.
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!
I was going for the rat.
Normally, I have a very sweet disposition as a dog.
More than once, James suggested that I make the change permanent.
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.
Okay.
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?
It's fine. I'll stay.
You go, I'll stay.
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.
They might chop it.
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat.
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.
It'll be nice to do it again as a free man.
That was a noble thing you did back there.
He doesn't deserve it.
I didn't think my dad would have wanted his best friends...
...to become killers.
Besides, dead, the truth dies with him.
Alive, you're free.
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!
I don't know if you know, Harry...
...but when you were born, James and Lily made me your godfather.
I know.
I can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle...
...but if you ever wanted a different home...
What? Come and live with you?
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.
Harry!
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!
This flesh is only flesh!
Expelliarmus!
Harry!
Remus! Remus!
Run! Run!
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.
Professor?
Professor Lupin?
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!
There you are, Potter!
Sirius!
Come back here, Potter!
Sirius!
No. Sirius!
Expecto Patronum!
Harry?
I saw my dad.
What?
He sent the dementors away.
I saw him across the lake.
Harry, they've captured Sirius.
Any minute the dementors are gonna perform the Kiss.
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.
Much worse.
They're going to suck out his soul.
Headmaster, stop them.
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?
He's my rat, sir.
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.
But the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others.
A child's voice, however honest and true...
...is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen.
Mysterious thing, time.
Powerful...
...and when meddled with, dangerous.
Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen.
And you would do well, I feel, to return before this last chime.
If not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss.
If you succeed tonight...
...more than one innocent life may be spared.
Three turns should do it, I think.
Oh, and by the way.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin.
Good luck.
What the bloody hell was that all about?
Sorry, Ron, but seeing as you can't walk...
What just happened?
- Where's Ron?
Where were we at 7:30?
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?
Come on. And we can't be seen.
Hermione!
Hermione! Hermione, wait.
Hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing?
You foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach!
That's us.
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.
This is not normal.
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first term.
This is how I've been getting to my lessons all year.
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.
Dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment.
Clearly, something happened he wants us to change.
Good punch.
Thanks.
Malfoy's coming.
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?
I'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! Mark my words.
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
Of course.
Remember what Dumbledore said?
If we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared.
Let's go.
Here they come. I'd better hurry.
Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him.
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid set him free.
Scabbers, you're alive!
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.
If you go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad.
Awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time.
We can't be seen.
Fudge is coming.
And we aren't leaving?
Why aren't we leaving?
Are you mad?
That hurt.
Sorry.
We're coming out the back door. Go!
Is that really what my hair looks like from the back?
What?
I thought I just saw...
- Never mind.
- Let's go.
Okay, go, Harry. Go!
Get away. Get off.
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.
Come and get the nice dead ferret.
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.
- Now, look there.
- Where?
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?
Professor Dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster.
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.
- Over there.
- Where?
- Over there.
- This way.
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.
But where is it?
I saw the beast, just now.
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.
Buckbeak.
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.
I don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this.
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.
- Right.
- Well, well...
We must search the grounds.
Well, search the skies, if you must, minister.
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy.
Oh, executioner, your services are no longer required.
Thank you.
You'll find no small glasses in this house, professor.
- Come on.
- This way.
This way, now.
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.
- How?
- No idea.
- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!
And Snape's coming.
And now we wait.
And now we wait.
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.
- Hermione?
- Yeah?
Before, down by the lake, when I was with Sirius...
...I did see someone.
That someone made the dementors go away.
With a Patronus.
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.
According to him...
...only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it.
It was my dad.
My dad conjured the Patronus.
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.
I'm just telling you what I saw.
Here we come.
You see Sirius talking to me there?
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.
When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursleys'.
It'll just be me and him.
We could live in the country...
...someplace you can see the sky.
He'll like that after all those years in Azkaban.
Harry!
Run!
Let's go.
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.
Thanks.
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!
That was so scary.
Poor Professor Lupin's having a really tough night.
Sirius. Come on!
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.
Any minute now.
Right there. You'll see.
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.
- Sirius.
- You're dying...
...both of you.
Harry!
Expecto Patronum!
You were right, Hermione.
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!
I saw myself conjuring the Patronus before.
I knew I could do it this time because...
...well, I had already done it.
- Does that make sense?
- No.
But I don't like flying...!
Bombarda!
I'll be forever grateful for this...
...to both of you.
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.
For some time, my life will be too unpredictable.
And besides...
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.
And you know it.
And for now, that will do.
I expect you're tired of hearing this...
...but you look so like your father.
Except your eyes.
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.
It's cruel that I spent so much time with James and Lily, and you so little.
But know this:
The ones that love us never really leave us.
And you can always find them...
...in here.
You really are the brightest witch of your age.
We have to go.
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.
Did what?
Good night.
How did you get there?
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody be in two places at once?
Hello, Harry.
I saw you coming.
I've looked worse, believe me.
- You've been sacked.
- No.
No. I resigned, actually.
Resigned? Why?
Well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition.
This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want...
...well, someone like me teaching their children.
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...
...risked enough on my behalf.
Besides, people like me are...
Well, let's just say that I'm used to it by now.
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?
None of it made any difference.
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.
You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.
It made a great deal of difference.
If I am proud of anything...
...it is of how much you have learned this year.
Now, since I am no longer your teacher...
...I feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you.
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.
Until then...
...mischief managed.
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle.
Harry.
Wherever did you get it?
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.
Did not.
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.
For me?
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.
This came with it.
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.
How fast is it, Harry?
Lumos.
I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.
Mischief managed.
Always late
With your kisses
Won't you come to my arms, sweet darlin'
And stay?
Always late
With your kisses
Why, oh, why do you want to do me this way?
How long do you think
I can wait
When you know you're always late
Always late
With your kisses
Why, why, why do you want to do me this way?
That was Lefty Frizzell's
"Always Late with Your Kisses."
Before that, we heard Buck Owens.
Get your waders out.
It's seven days before the state officially drowns Northfork.
It's sunny skies with the highs being 51...
"T o the loving O'Brien family.
"lt has been brought to our attention
"that the remains of a Mrs. Patricia O'Brien
"have yet to be excavated.
Please make arrangements immediately."
The hardworking citizens of Northfork will be able to have their much-needed power... as well as... the pleasure of the recreation that this body of water will provide.
Let me add this: the good people of Northfork will be able to have their cake and eat it, too.
Two, three...
Where are we going to start-- right in here?
Where should we start?
Let's start right in here.
Then the water shall become a flood and destroy all flesh... and the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will look upon it, and I will remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature... of all flesh that is upon the earth.
And that's what we have here.
Our town is dying.
I have seen the concrete monument... the headstone for the town for Northfork.
This dam gate will close... the water will rise over the plains, and cover our businesses... our homes... and our well-being.
We have lost Northfork.
We will be losing our dear son... but we will gain the hope, the courage... to move to a higher ground.
We're all angels.
It is what we do with our wings that separates us.
What are we waiting for?
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Hadfield.
Father, his health isn't getting any better.
Rose has had to stay by his bed.
All the doctors have left Northfork.
You're returning him then?
He's a very ill child.
We cannot make the journey with him in this condition.
We apologize, Father.
We appreciate your honesty, and will ask for forgiveness.
Forgiveness?
Let's be honest, Father.
You gave us a sick child.
I gave you an angel.
You're misunderstanding us.
We love lrwin.
Halo Home is deeply regretful about the grief
Irwin has brought to your family.
God bless.
Have a nice journey.
This is wrong.
This is just downright wrong.
When did you get this letter?
I received the final notice yesterday.
I don't like this damned cake.
This is wrong on every level.
Yeah.
Where did my parents go?
We don't want to go where they're going.
You rest now.
Father, everybody's leaving.
Oh, I know.
I know.
Oh, let's stay here.
Huh?
You're the caretaker?
Yes?
Cookie takes care of the yard.
Maybe you can help me?
Who are you looking for?
A relative.
Hold still.
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis,
Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis, Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis, Marvin, Matt.
Marvin, Matt, Walter,
Willis.
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.
Anybody voted for him voted themselves right out of Northfork.
Have a good journey.
Nice concrete cork.
I have done countless evacs.
And as long as
I've been doing this job, it is never come down to 48 hours before.
That's two days, and by the time I'm through with you, it's gonna be 47.
So you'd better listen up.
And remember one very important thing.
Despite the tertiary inconveniences we're putting these people through, we're giving them new power.
All right.
Matt...
Marvin.
Please go pay a visit to the Youngs.
Eddie, Arnold.
Arnold.
I want you to get down to Hungry Horse Road, and I want you to nail Jigger, do you understand?
You betcha.
Now, you can't go into this treating it like you're throwing out homesteaders, poor old homesteaders.
Look at it like you're saving some poor dumb son of a bitch from drowning.
Mr. Rudolph.
It says here that, uh, there has been some previous attempts at evacuation.
Walter,
Willis.
Stallings. Highway 93.
Remember, the one single most important thing: it is not our business to tell anybody else theirs.
You just come in like you're their guardian angel.
You give them wings and then you move 'em on up into higher ground.
Good luck now, gentlemen.
In the early 1800s,
European settlers named Northfork after the river that embraced their town.
Word traveled around the world that angels roamed these plains like bison. that angels roamed these plains like bison.
I find the humor quite parched.
19th century.
A remarkable piece.
Artist used the finest oils.
Organic pigments.
Magnificent.
The artist has a religious vocabulary.
He used the luxuriantly white wings of the swan.
Fascinating representation of the angelic messenger.
Lovely bird.
If I do recall correctly, the Celts employed the majestic swan as their sacred symbol and messenger to the other world.
Their link that existed between the realm of their gods and the realm of humans.
Very relatable.
I can only speculate... that the man with swan wings, or in this painting, the wild bird man, is a creation of the overtaking by Christianity.
Bless the imagination.
Walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk
-Just a closer walk with Thee
-It's wrong.
It's just downright wrong.
For Thou art strong
Departed.
Jesus keep me from all wrong
It's wrong, and I'm not gonna do it.
And neither should you.
It's death till you part.
She's your mother.
I'll be satisfied as long
-As I walk
-Let me walk close to Thee
-Departed.
Just a closer walk with Thee
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
Daily walking close to Thee.
Have you ever smelled death?
I don't recall smelling it.
Death smells like nothing you've ever smelled in your life.
What does it smell like?
You know when you've smelled death.
'Cause when you smell it... you say to yourself, "Damn.
Something die?"
Anything?
Does it say anything about a child?
No. Not specifically.
There was a small child roaming the garden.
Oh, Flower, it said nothing about children.
Wait.
Narrator fluctuates between the first and third person.
Quite interesting.
I would have to say that he's above the age of a child.
Flower, every town you go scurrying off looking for offspring.
Wait.
Would you like a cup of tea?
One lump or two?
My name is Cup of Tea.
To my right, as you may already know, is Flower Hercules.
To my left, Cod.
And behind us all, but in front of you, Happy.
And you are?
Irwin.
Hello, lrwin.
And your surname?
Sir lrwin.
Well, Sir lrwin of Northfork, my family and I have traveled a long way, and we are having trouble finding a loved one.
Are you familiar with the unknown angel?
Yes.
Now... this is where we can be of help to each other.
What could we offer you?
When you leave, just take me with you.
No.
Never.
We do not take children.
Then I can't help you.
Now, Sir lrwin... you're being unreasonable.
Where we're going, we can't take you with us.
Then take me a thousand miles.
A thousand miles in anybody's book is a long way.
How about a hundred miles?
-A thousand.
-A thousand.
A thousand.
400, and that's it.
A thousand, and that's it.
Do you know how far that is?
A thousand miles is a far, far, faraway place.
500 miles.
A thousand.
All right.
We'll take you a thousand miles if you bring us the unknown angel.
In the morning?
Deal?
You the pain livin' of a heart full of shame
You broke the law...
Ursula.
-Of God and man
-You have two customers.
You stole from me the one whose ring was on my hand
I'd say that you...
But through that came livin' with a heart full of shame...
Oh, I tell you, these sons of bitches are harder to yank than a tick on the touch-hole of a chicken.
I hear ya.
Ursula...
Good morning.
You have six customers... now seated.
Well, if it ain't the bottom feeders.
Go ahead, Willis.
Eggs?
Bacon?
Mm-mm.
Sausage?
Mm-mm.
No meat?
Mm-mm.
Potatoes?
Mm-mm.
Soup.
Mm!
Uh-huh.
Chicken?
Mm-hmm.
Broth?
Cup or bowl?
Yeah!
Good work, boss.
Nice work, Walter.
Nice work, Walter.
Thank you, boys.
I'll have a bowl.
Same.
Same.
Same.
Same.
Okay.
Dent.
It's only dirt.
Afternoon, boys.
Good afternoon,
Father.
Walter.
Your wife, Patricia...
Henry...
Irwin's still sick.
I'm sorry, Father.
Mm...
Well, you got anything that'll keep his spirits up and his fever down?
If I was those parents,
I'd be ashamed.
Well, most parents can't see their child ill.
So they throw him in a lake.
All depends, Henry, on how you look at it.
Either you're halfway to heaven or halfway to hell.
Here we go, Father.
It's an antibiotic.
Inject five cc's of this into his arm.
Okay.
All right?
Bless you.
Have a safe journey.
Thank you, Father.
All right.
We thank you in advance and hope you have... a pleasant journey.
Pop?
Yeah, son?
You suppose he's got two of everything in there?
I suppose we'll find out.
Now, I don't care
If I'm not the first...
Damn it.
That you picked...
I know.
Darlin', I'll never ask...
Not one, but two Chevys.
Yesterday's gone...
I know.
...from now on
They heard of me...
This is going to be difficult.
...about the past
Yep.
Now I don't care if I'm...
Ever since we started moving folks out... we've never done well with people that owned Chevrolets.
...I'll be the last.
Matt...
...this country is being divided into two types of people--
Chevy people...
...and Ford people, Matt.
Yep.
Now, I don't care
If I'm not the first love you've known
Just so I'll be the last
Now, I don't care...
Looks like he got some kind of hammer.
...that you picked
Darlin' I'll never ask...
No, it looks more like a...
I think he was holding a shotgun.
I think you're right.
Every town we come to, you want a child.
Once again, selfish.
How observant.
The noble Englishman.
How I longed to be Earl Grey.
The wit that got us here.
It's a splendid acquisition.
Unknown architect.
Probably owner-builder.
A true visionary,
I might add.
Jesus.
No, no, he was a carpenter.
We-we-we're searching for the unknown.
The unknown doesn't just come knocking on your door.
If it is unknown, how would you know if it did come knocking?
Well, it won't be in the shape of a child.
I would have to agree.
Happy.
Do you ever disagree?
I disagree with the Englishman's use of starch.
What do the Scriptures say?
"Temperature, 105 degrees.
High.
Please look after him when I leave."
What do you suppose we do?
We're going to wing it.
It appears they've... worn out their welcome.
Good afternoon, Mr. Stalling.
My name is Walter O'Brien.
This here's my son, Willis.
We're with the evacuation committee.
It's been brought to the state's attention that you are seeking some assistance.
I'm not going anywhere, son.
We're aware of that, sir, that's why the state has asked us to come to your aid.
The state understands your difficulty with moving on.
The state will not hurt, destroy, nor harm you physically in any way.
It is our civil duty to assist you in making this transition as easy and pleasant as possible.
Your agreement is this-- you will each be assigned
65 households to depart.
Having fulfilled said obligation, you will then each receive 1.5 acres of prime, lakefront property.
Your lot size will be increased by one fifth of an acre for every additional household that you assist in evacuating beyond the initial 65.
Have I made myself clear?
I will take your vacant stares as a yes.
I could live with an acre and a half.
Okay by me.
May we, sir?
So...
...the prodigal son returns.
Already packed.
A little ahead of yourself.
I've brought what you're looking for.
You have?
Outside.
I don't see anything.
We still have a deal?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have a deal.
Yeah, we still have a deal.
Where is it?
Oh, my.
Hello.
We'd appreciate it if you both would stop screwing around.
Well, what do you want to do?
The Youngs are going to have a moving sale.
Perfect.
Now, all I need is a pair of sinners like yourselves to mount up there now.
We appreciate very much your giving us this time to discuss this matter.
A pair of wives?
At least they're not mounted.
You know, it appears to me that you folks are preparing for a flood in Biblical proportions.
You got that right, son.
A flood is going to wipe through this place, cleansing the soil of all sin.
Understandable.
When God tells us to get a move on, we're gone at the first holler of a rooster.
We ain't needing the State to come in here and tell us when to pick up and get going.
That's God's doing.
This is God's land, and by God, we ain't movin' until we get that sign from above.
Yes, sir, uh... we aren't telling you to pick up and get going.
No, sir.
Look at us as your life preservers.
You can use us if you want, or not at all.
We give you that choice.
We're all in the same boat.
So, sir, if you don't mind, sir,
I'd like to bend you and your wives' ear a bit and tell you about the signs of God that we are familiar with.
This could be that sign.
A what?
He said he was a relative.
To us?
Yes.
You're the unknown angel?
Yes.
The one you're looking for.
Optimistic.
He is unknown.
The angel part's questionable.
Very.
How romantic.
There's a novel about you, too.
I started to collect these.
This is the first one I grew.
Now I'm not saying that this boat you have built isn't worthy.
From the looks of it, you've done a mighty fine job.
But for the sake of my job, let's just say it doesn't.
Doesn't what?
Your boat doesn't float.
Imagine this, if you will.
One day, a town on the plains, let's say Northfork, was hit by a catastrophic flood, similar to the days of Noah, and you husband and yourselves are standing out there on the roof waiting to be rescued.
A friendly neighbor comes paddling by in his little wooden boat, and he yells, "Hey, there,
Mr. and Mrs. Stalling,
"and... uh, Mrs. Stalling, jump on in and I'll take you to dry land."
What do you say?
I don't know.
The water's rising.
You shout back,
"No, thank you, thy friendly neighbor.
I'm waiting for a sign from God."
No, thank you.
I'm waiting for a sign from God.
Yes, exactly.
And your friendly neighbor paddles away.
A few days later a state rescue team comes by in a larger boat.
And let's just say me and Willis are on board.
And we offer you the same deal.
"Jump on in,
"and you, Mrs. Stalling and... Mrs. Stalling, will be saved."
And you say...
No, thank you.
We're waiting for a sign from God.
A few more days pass, and the water level has risen.
It has risen above the roof.
And unfortunately, you and Mr. Stalling have drowned and now are in heaven in front of God.
Dear, we died.
What about our belongings?
We died?
Oh, yes, you three have died because you waited for a sign from God and it never came, and you three died.
But why?
That's the exact question you would ask God.
You would say, "We waited for the sign and it never came."
And you and she... and Mr. Stalling... died.
Now what do you suppose
God is going to say to you both?
I don't know.
Mr. Stalling?
I'm dead, remember?
May l?
Yes.
I'll tell you what God will say.
"l sent you two boats...
"Two boats.
...to save your lives."
What more of a sign did you three want?
May l?
Fascinating.
You have a lovely collection of feathers.
Thank you.
And your halo.
Where's that?
They took it off when I was little.
I didn't need it anymore.
And these must be your wings.
Oh, mighty.
Look at this.
And where did we get this?
These are quite stunning.
The grace of God.
Yes, they are.
We're offering you a pair of something that only the man upstairs is willing to give you.
Where'd you get these boys?
Born and raised right here in Northfork.
Dear, what are you thinking?
I'm thinking, what bird suffered this?
Oh, there's nothing fowl about these wings.
I understand your initial doubt, but how many times have you seen wings of this size and beauty?
This is what most of us were shot with.
Tranquillity at its finest.
This could make an elephant fly.
It stuck in me right here.
May I look?
Appears to be lengthy needle of some sort.
Five years, maybe six years of age.
Used numerous times for injection.
You were shot with this rifle?
Yes.
I was running with my flock and they shot me.
You were running with your flock?
Yes.
Flock of what?
Doves? Geese? Seagulls?
Angels.
Angel wings, huh?
I'm here to tell you these wings is worthless.
And to remove all doubt, we included this certificate of authenticity.
Signed, sealed and blessed by your own Father Harlan.
"Found near the glaciers, these wings, blah, blah, blah."
From what they could tell, this particular pair were detached from a juvenile who probably strayed from the flock.
"Perhaps no wiser than four years of age.
"The abbreviated wingspan reveals to us
"that he weighed no more than 25 to 30 pounds before they were removed."
A bit too disturbing for me.
Happy... are you looking at this?
Would you say amputated?
Yes. Amputated.
Fascinating.
Angel. Huh.
Aren't we all?
I'd say quite the opposite.
Probably a little devil, and daddy gave him a good strapping.
There's a back story for you.
Does this cause any pain?
No.
This would be recognized as a highly dangerous procedure without anesthesia.
Some people would just bite a bullet.
A highly skilled surgeon was overly concerned with muscle stabilization.
There's no evidence of curvature of the spine.
You're discovering feathers in this area?
Yes.
What time of day?
Morning.
Can you run your fingers through his hair?
What can you tell us about your relatives?
My mother and father were
12th generation angels.
My great grandpa and grandma had wings the size of bombers and would glide the plains of Northfork.
Come on, you ladies, can't you just smell the bird shit?
I mean, I'd like to believe these wings is authentic, but the feathers, they ain't attached to anything.
You take those moose antlers back there.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, it's a fine set of antlers, but it's more than just a rack of horns attached to a piece of board.
That wouldn't be enough.
It's an okay place to hang your hat, but there ain't no pride in it.
What you need is the whole head hanging up there.
And these marble eyes just a-staring on down at you.
Then you know you've got something really worth having.
We're still not leaving.
I've got a thousand-dollar check from the state, or would you rather use that for your funeral services?
No.
Then you best get the hell out of here right now.
Use these to fly the hell out of here.
Wow.
Eddie. Hey, Eddie.
I think Jigger's asleep.
Let's go.
Jesus Christ.
The scars on his forehead tell me he did have a halo.
Most likely metal.
To stabilize his...
Oh.
Everything all right?
Dankish, beetle-headed foot-licker.
What is wrong with you?
Happy?
You should be asking yourself that question.
Fired from a long barrel rifle.
Ten feet away.
Needle meant to penetrate two to three inches of skin.
Perhaps the hide of a herbivore.
Beast of a hallucinogenic.
Would you like a cup of tea?
This isn't tea time.
Given my weight, calculated dosage... this could be a lengthy trip.
Moist.
Mother... may l?
No.
Yes.
Plenty more where that came from.
Here.
Shoot me, shoot Cod.
And then shoot yourself in the foot.
No!
You saucy, sheep-biting, flat-mouthed dewberry.
This could be a family...
Oh.
Santa's everywhere.
I'm happy.
This should back off some evil spirits.
Hmm?
Oh.
Hmm.
Two out of three ain't that bad.
Damn it. I say we hook that thing up to our bumper and drag it out ourselves.
What are you talking about,
Willis?
You know why?
I'll tell you why.
That there was number
I know that, Willis.
I'm marking them down as departed.
We can't.
The state makes their final pass-through, and they find that Mr. Stalling locked up in that boat with his moosehead.
It's our butt.
It's our job to move them out of Northfork.
It's not our job to know where they go.
Willis... it's our job to move people, not change their beliefs.
What more could we have said?
Without the proper words, this is just a man, nailed to two pieces of wood.
Oh, he's cute.
Father?
Yes, son.
I don't think they want me.
Oh, no, they do.
They do, son.
They came a long way for you.
Then, can I go with them?
I will still have to speak with them.
Then, can you tell them I'm an angel?
I will.
I will.
Because I want them to see my wings.
Do you have wings?
Yeah? Me, too.
But mine got old and fell off.
You get some sleep now.
All right.
Mr. and Mrs. Hope?
Yes.
I'm Father Harlan.
Father.
Thank you for coming on short notice.
Irwin is a good boy.
I could go on, but that would seem like I'm selling him to you.
And I'm not.
What?
You're not...
Well, given the chance,
I'm sure lrwin would do a better job at selling himself...
-Oh.
-than me.
Can we meet him?
Unfortunately... you will have to make a decision before you can meet him.
But, Father, it says right here that we can spend the afternoon with him.
Yes, I know. I...
I'm sorry. I apologize.
But lrwin is a fragile boy.
I can't let him get his hopes up too high only to have them diminished.
His health can't afford that kind of a disappointment.
Oh, Father, we can't make a decision based upon viewing him from a window.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you go wait in the car?
Father, we come here attempting to adopt a child, and you turn it into window shopping.
He's not a puppy.
Oh.
Well, maybe that's what you and your wife should be considering.
I'm sorry if I have wasted your time.
Have a pleasant journey.
Many townspeople have speculated that the body of Jimmy Miller, son of Doris and James Miller, still lays in the Northfork dam.
One worker has said,
"There is a slight lump in the interior wall that will hold back
19 million acres of water."
Another worker said,
"Yes, Jimmy is in there.
"They never could retrieve him from the dam.
He is resting in peace."
Tom Johnson, a fisherman, put it this way,
"Heck, you can't exactly troll a hundred feet of just-poured concrete fishing for a body."
Marvin. Matt.
Walter. Willis.
Tours of the Northfork dam, and possibly Jimmy Miller, will be starting in January.
For more information, please contact Montana's
Water and Power.
Somebody is laying there.
You feel a heartbeat?
No.
You can figure... a death of a person is still considered progress.
Son of a bitch is getting the biggest headstone this side of Rushmore.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
65 residents departed.
Good job.
You sign on that bottom line,
1.5 acres will be transferred into your name.
Hmm.
Well, your log reads
64 residents departed.
Is this correct?
Well, sir...
Yes, sir, it is.
Well, you know what?
I'd like to thank you personally for your hard work and dedication in the evacuation of Northfork, and hope to see you boys out there enjoying the lake.
Wait a minute.
That's it?
We get nothing?
That's correct.
Sir, there... there is another house that we did not confirm their departure.
Well, then, you best go out there and get it confirmed, huh?
Duck.
Duck.
Goose.
Boy was a tad pigeon-toed.
What do you think?
For most, Vincent Van Gogh was a fine artist.
To some, he lacked technique.
Paint straight from the tube, very heavy-handed.
How Van Gogh cut off his ear is what is most intriguing to folks.
In each piece I've ever appraised, the story is always more fascinating than the actual piece itself.
And?
It's a fantastic yarn the boy has spun.
Unfortunately... the story is more valuable than the actual piece.
What about his collection of feathers?
Perhaps... from the stork that dropped him.
Feathers are inconsistent.
I couldn't find any connection in the scriptures.
And that spleeny ill-nurtured gnat.
Are you positive?
Oh, Flower, please, be open to inconsistency.
What did the feathers come in?
A book.
The book was in a pillowcase.
I presume that the pillow that the boy
Iays his head on is stuffed with feathers.
He is not what we are here for.
La Fleur was touched by an angel.
Is it snowing?
Can I go?
You're not mine anymore
This is it, son.
Looks pretty vacant.
Indeed it does.
If you don't ever change your mind
Trick or treat.
Smells like something died in here.
That is precisely why we're not going to get mother.
Willis, you smell that?
Yeah, it smells like something died.
Go upstairs and check all the rooms.
Then we'll leave.
What?
You're kidding.
You go upstairs and check everything out.
Willis, go upstairs, and see if anyone is up there.
I'm personally not ready to face death.
This is number 65.
Go upstairs, check it out, and let's get this over with.
I'm checking out the other side.
Willis.
Willis!
Hello?
Hello there.
Pop.
Pop!
Do you see anything?
No.
Come on. Jump.
It's about five feet, come on.
You can make it.
Jump.
Come on.
Pop, come on, jump!
You can make it. Come on.
Are you okay?
Would you like a cup of tea?
I would qualify this in the area of concussion.
A frothy, clay-brained snapper.
Let's help you get up onto your feet.
Definitely going to feel that in the morning.
Willis, let's go.
Did you see anyone?
Nope.
Come on!
Come on!
Get in the car!
Get!
What's got you so spooked?
If you don't ever change your mind
To take me back again
Grab the book.
Pop...
Just do it!
Mark them down as evacs.
Evacuated.
Do it!
Okay, I will.
Since the day you say we're through
I'm even more in love with you
And it's my fault that you're not mine anymore
And I think we should go get your mom.
These have the same texture as the feathers that were in the boy's book.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
No more than four years of age.
Weighed no more than 30 pounds.
These were attached to something very young...
I'm going to have to evaluate the other side.
Fascinating.
Oh, Lord...
Let the holy angels come to lrwin.
And carry him to your heavenly city.
Free his spirit... from the prison of his body.
Fascinating.
No.
Please, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm a man of faith.
Forgiveness is my job.
But right now,
I can't forgive my faith.
Hmm.
Here.
He grew two inches this summer.
-Pop.
Still stacking wood?
Yep.
Pop?
Yeah?
You're not even close to what death smells like.
I'm sorry.
I'm coming to get you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't forget you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Pop.
Come here.
What?
Can you see?
What?
Look closer.
No, I can't see anything.
What am I looking for?
There's a nick in my paint.
There's a nick in my paint!
Don't make it worse.
-Don't make it worse.
-It's only dirt.
I was rubbing it off.
-What color is dirt?
-Brown?
If Marvin weren't blind, he would see that it was gray-- the color underneath my paint.
Willis, the speck is brown.
Look.
Brown after Marvin's filthy hands rubbed it.
Well, I can't see how you'd think you could keep your car perfect the way you drive anyway.
It hurts.
The first one... hurts.
You just never know when it's going to come.
You know, that's fate for you.
A little rock.
You do not have a say in the matter.
Now that you've gotten the first one...
...the rest comes easy.
You spend all your time... polishing your car, making everything perfect.
Then this rock... flies out of nowhere, and puts all your hard work to shame.
Nothing you can do about it.
Absolutely nothing.
-Holy cow.
-Oh, my God.
...into the hole... take that...
...soft, so when you get down in there, you just thread this rope through the top handle.
What?
You jump down there and do it.
-Willis.
-No more. No, no, no, no.
This is downright wrong.
Once something's buried, it should stay buried.
I can't show no more respect.
You know, when this small town becomes the biggest lake this side of the Mississippi, your mother will be the catch of the day!
Then throw some rocks on her.
That should keep her down.
Where you going to take her?
What about California?
What's there?
I heard in California they're serving cheeseburgers and a soda in less than two minutes flat.
Wow...
That's fast food.
I know you've been praying.
Not to worry.
A family will come soon.
You may be an orphan... but you're still a child of God.
We must go get him, Flower.
If I didn't know your voice,
I would think it was my subconscious.
Could he be?
He is.
You don't want to believe him, do you?
You do?
He's just a child.
I can't accept that.
Yes,
I know.
We can't.
We have to.
You have to.
Don't let your motherly nature cost you your manhood.
He prayed for us.
1.5 acres of lakefront property.
Hmm.
Northern Pike?
Might be.
Pike's not a fish.
It's a dog.
Skull full of teeth.
Pick those suckers up by their eye sockets.
Weapons of massive destruction.
They drop that pike's milt into this lake.
You can forget all about the fish
Iiving in peace and harmony.
Pike eat their children.
What they should do is introduce a nice game fish
Iike the Muskie.
Now, that's a fine species.
-Mm.
-No fish from Minnesota should be allowed to swim past the Missouri.
The fine citizens of Northfork knew that Muskie was swimming through their houses, we would've never been able to get 'em to leave.
Canada ought to claim that bug-heap they call Minnesota.
Throw in Wisconsin for free.
You have to think that this must have been his last day on the job.
You ready?
1,000 miles?
Farther.
You're a relative.
Hercules... the strongest man ever to wear a skirt.
Are you going to be my mother or my father?
I'm both.
Considered the perfect soul,
I search for no one, and no one looks for me.
Whatever
I need I look within myself to find.
I am complete.
I am not king nor queen, yet I am both.
A mother and a father.
You prayed to be this way?
Isn't that what Father Harlan says?
"Pray and you shall receive?"
Would you like a cup of tea?
Irwin?
Well?
There you go, son.
And in that journey of dying, you see many things.
But all issues I had passed.
Because I was to be a witness.
A helper.
And that's the thing, I think, is important about death, is the ability for us to be witnesses.
Not only for our births of coming in, but going out.
And that's what we have here.
We've lost our town. It's gone.
But maybe there's a birth someplace else.
Maybe there's a blessing from that experience.
I'm no longer afraid of death, but it's a lesson that's taken me
60 years to learn.
As you stroll around Northfork, take your last walk down the dirt road that leads to where your house may have been, and look at the trees that you once climbed.
Smile, and remember those trees for what they will become: future snags for fishing tackle.
As you continue your walk, think to yourself,
"This is the only time
I will ever be able
"to walk on the bottom of a lake without having to hold my breath."
Remember when you leave to pack all your good memories.
No one else will pack them for you.
Good night to you all.
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?
An instant of pain, perhaps.
Something dead
which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect trapped in amber.
THE DEVI L'S BACKBONE
We'll be there soon.
What the...
It fell quite a while ago, but it never exploded.
They came... they defused it... and they left it there.
Nobody can move it.
Follow me, please.
Carlos... wait for me here.
We won't be long.
Who are those people outside?
The caretaker and two men who help him.
They're from the town.
There's always work to do here.
They're building a chicken coop.
What's going on out there?
- They've arrived.
- Ayala and Domínguez again?
Yes. Ayala's wounded.
They're always in trouble.
They've brought another boy.
As if we didn't have enough already.
Let's go.
Are you a new kid?
Got any candy?
Or a bit of bread?
I'm Gálvez, he's Owl.
He doesn't speak but he sure sees a lot.
I'm Carlos.
Got any fruit, even if it's soft?
No, but I've got some comics and toys.
- Want to see them?
- Yeah.
I can't do it.
I can't accept another boy.
I can barely feed the ones who are here. I'm sorry.
He's the son of a comrade killed at the front.
- The boy doesn't know.
- He doesn't know.
Your husband was a leftist, a brave man.
Oh, no!
I'm the brave one.
Ricardo was a man of books, of ideas.
He decided to die and leave me here to defend his ideals.
The Nationalists will arrive any day and what will they find?
Reds looking after Reds' children.
Not to mention this!
I can't keep it anymore.
If you want to leave the boy... take the rest of the gold.
There are 10 ingots left.
At least you can buy guns.
I can't even buy bread with it.
- Take it away.
- We can't.
- We're crossing enemy lines.
- You decide.
The boy goes hungry here or gets killed out there.
Class time!
Come on!
Look, Owl, a comic book!
I'll swap you.
Look at this marble.
It's my favorite. It's from China.
Or look at this one.
Owl made it himself.
All made from snot and mud.
It's six months of snot.
Hey, you! That's mine!
- Are you here to stay?
- No.
Then why are you here?
I came with Mr. Ayala, my tutor.
- What's the hell's a tutor?
- He looks after me while my father's away.
Shit, that's posh!
No one here has one of those.
Take the comic from me.
Go on.
Take it away.
C'mon.
Carlos, look!
Mr. Ayala.
Your tutor's leaving you, faggot!
Stay with him for a while.
He seems quite meek.
I'm sure you'll get along.
We'll have to fix it.
The Count of Monte Cristo.
Has Edmond Dantés broken out of prison yet?
- Has he met Abbot Faria?
- They're digging a tunnel.
- Do they manage to escape?
- I don't know.
Why don't you read on, then tell me?
There are only three teachers left.
The lady with glasses is Alma.
She teaches math and reading.
And the elegant lady you saw, remember?
Her name is Carmen.
- Is she your girlfriend?
- She's the principal.
Why did they leave me here?
Why can't I be with my father?
Carlitos... you're staying with us for a while.
Just for a while.
So be patient.
Your soap has to last you all year.
Be careful with it... or you'll be punished with two weeks of extra tasks.
You can play in the yard, but never inside the building.
This is your bed.
Number 12.
Why are there so many empty beds?
Some boys run away, but I wouldn't advise it.
It's a day's walk to town.
The nights are cold and the days...
For your locker.
Do you understand?
There are no bars here.
This isn't a prison.
See where they put the new kid?
- In Santi's bed.
- Shut up!
Pig and I think that even though you complain a lot... you're all right here.
Far away from the war, well hidden.
Well looked after.
- What could be better?
- Granada.
Why go to Granada?
We're getting married.
We'll buy a farm.
Sure.
Granada!
Does Conchita have family there?
Do you know anyone?
I don't need anyone.
I've managed fine on my own so far...
Right.
And without parents.
- Those Reds we saw were here for the gold.
- Yeah, the school's gold.
That's why they eat so well here... too much gold.
You don't believe me now, but you will.
I'll try these two tonight and let you know what happens.
That's great, kid.
Got a smoke?
- No.
- All right, so long.
I don't like those two.
They make me sick.
This place makes me sick.
When I was a kid...
I'd stand here... in the middle of the yard... and I'd look up at the sky.
I dreamed of getting out of here.
I prayed to become rich... so I could buy this dump and tear it down.
Forget it now.
I don't want anyone to know
I spent 15 years here.
Well, I'm glad you came back.
Let's go to my room.
It's getting cold.
San... ti...
Who are you?
What are you doing?
- Me? Nothing.
- What the hell's going on?
The fucking new kid spilled our water.
Come on.
You'll have to get more from the kitchen.
Isn't that off limits?
No one's ever been caught.
What about the "one who sighs"?
What's it to be?
Are you going or not?
Who's the "one who sighs"?
- You're chickenshit.
- No, I'm not.
You're a shit, a queer.
All right, I'll go.
But you're coming with me.
We'll each fill a jug.
But if you're scared...
They say she's switched off.
But I don't believe it.
Put your ear against her, you'll hear ticking.
That's her heart.
She's still alive.
And she knows we're here.
Hide!
That one.
C'mon.
See you outside.
"No one's ever been caught."
Bastard.
Shit!
Hello.
Who are you?
Do you live down here?
Many of you will die.
Jaime!
What are you up to?
"Out, out, yearnings of mine.
Let not respect bind you.
It flatters pity...
It flatters pity not to be able to hide.
Let your lips bear witness... to the blaze in your heart.
No one will believe the fire if the smoke sends no signals.
He who cares for his well-being keeps not his feelings silent.
My grief is greater than I.
And that being so... it will be easier... it will be easier... for it to defeat me... than for me to command it.
Consideration does not suffice to prevent the cry.
He is not a brave prisoner who dares not break down his jail."
A grain of strength.
Carlos, are you going to tell me who was with you last night?
He's not going to tell.
He'll squeal in the end.
Just wait and see.
You understand?
Then, for the last time... who was with you last night?
I was alone.
That boy won't talk.
If we want to know who was with him...
- What's for breakfast?
- Milk and bread.
Perfect.
Very well.
You may begin.
They think Carlos has told, but they don't care.
They're ravenous.
Look at how they're eating.
The first one to look up from his plate is his accomplice.
Marcos, Gálvez, Jaime and Owl.
Come here.
I knew you wouldn't squeal.
Dr. Casares tricked me.
Just what I said.
It isn't your fault we were punished.
- Dr. Casares is real smart.
- He sure is!
Careful.
Come on, Owl.
Shit, for a dead guy, he sure weighs a lot!
Well, well!
Christ in the yard and John the Baptist in here.
Are things that bad?
If the new Spain is Catholic and apostolic...
Try it now.
I told you.
- Dance with me.
- No.
- Come on, dance with me.
- No.
I can't dance.
Ayala said so.
Catalonia is about to fall.
Then Madrid will fall, and then...
There's talk of a ghost.
Have you heard?
Yes.
Sometimes I think that we are the ghosts.
Gálvez... last night, you didn't shoot.
That's right.
- Wow, that's great!
- It's for you.
Why are they laughing?
Fuckers.
Go back to Argentina, while you still can.
The war isn't over yet, Carmen.
England or France might still intervene.
That's just wishful thinking.
- You're like Ricardo.
- No.
No, I'm not like him.
Twenty years ago,
I found the place for me.
And I stayed.
That's all.
Look at it jump!
Where's the new kid?
Are you the "one who sighs"?
Do you live down there?
Listen.
What are you up to?
Go on, call Dr. Casares.
Ass-kisser!
Throw him down!
Go on!
He can't swim!
- Over there!
- Over there, to your left!
There he is!
Grab him! Careful!
What's going on?
What have I told you?
And you, eh?
What the fuck are you doing down here?
Whose is this?
It's mine.
If anything happens to you,
I get the blame.
Get out!
Out!
Say a word about this and I'll cut you in half.
Got that?
There you go.
Our Carlos has been here five minutes... and he's in trouble already.
Have you read any more of Monte Cristo?
Do you believe in ghosts?
There aren't any in the novel.
I think I saw one, here.
Carlos, as you can see...
I'm a man of science.
But Spain is full of superstition.
Come here.
Europe is sick with fear now, and fear sickens the soul.
And that, in turn, makes us see things.
In town... they call this...
"the devil's backbone."
They say a lot of things.
That this happens to children who shouldn't have been born.
"Nobody's children."
But that's a lie.
Poverty and disease.
That's all it is.
The liquid they're in is called "limbo water."
In the old days, it was made with various spices... cloves, rum.
So this is very, very old rum.
I sell it in town, and the money keeps the school going.
Do they drink it?
They say it helps to cure blindness, kidney ailments... and also, apparently... impotence.
Rubbish, but you know... after 60, men will pay anything just to...
You know.
So if you're going to believe in ghosts and all that rubbish... you should have a sip of this to heal your wound.
No, I'm not sure that I saw a ghost.
May I go now?
Yes, of course.
And be more careful!
Calm down.
I'm not going to hit you.
So don't make any noise.
Carlos... get out your comics so we can look at them.
- That ring's pretty.
- It's from a cigar.
I found it four summers ago.
It's very pretty.
Hey, Carlos, let's swap.
Look.
A naked woman.
It's really well drawn, like a photo.
She's a looker!
Who drew this?
Her pussy's the wrong way round.
- It looks like a mouth.
- What would you lot know?
Look, a slice of fig cake.
It's a bit squashed but it tastes good.
No, give me back my comic.
I want it back.
All right.
I'll give it to you later.
It's in my locker.
You're a real artist.
When I grow up,
I want to draw comics.
- Like mine?
- No, much better.
With more fights, more treasures.
And big ships with lots of cannons.
These bugs are disgusting.
What do they eat?
Did you hear that?
A sigh.
I didn't hear it.
I heard it too.
Don't kiss me.
Right, I forgot.
This is the last time.
"This is the last time."
Same old story.
Don't make any noise.
Scared the old man will hear?
I've never been scared.
I'm ashamed.
Yeah.
You're ashamed of me.
Not him.
He's a gentleman.
What a pity that isn't enough.
You need a hard cock as well.
And your husband and the doctor...
Tough luck.
The old man looks at you with love.
He did that even when your husband was alive.
I was 17.
By then, they took care of the poetry... and I of the flesh.
This leg...
I don't like to think about this leg.
It hurts.
Some days I can't bear it.
But I need it to stay on my feet.
I saw those lights again today
in the sky.
That's the war.
It'll never end.
The war's shit.
Well, I like it.
You like it, dickhead?
Yeah, because you see the planes doing this.
My mother says... that the earth's so dry here and the air's so hot... that the dead get stuck halfway to heaven.
- That's rubbish!
- It's like the "one who sighs."
Not that again, you little shit!
Even if it annoys him, there is a ghost.
The day the bomb fell, a boy disappeared. Santi.
Since then, no one has dared takeJaime on.
Santi slept in your bed, number 12.
Shit, I'm telling the story.
The teachers think that when the bomb fell...
Santi got scared and ran away... and maybe some shepherds found him and he's alive.
Or a cutthroat got him and took his blood.
Yeah.
They sell the blood to rich people to cure their tuberculosis.
And where's the ghost?
It came with the bomb.
Maybe if you ask it...
Take that one.
Out of the way.
Put those in, but be careful!
Don't break them.
Miss.
Look, I found this.
I thought you'd like it.
Open the gate, Jaime.
It's lovely.
It may look like gold, but it isn't.
Well, for me, it is.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
What's that?
Kids' stuff.
Can anyone tell me what these
elegant gentlemen are hunting?
- Gálvez?
- A pig.
Well, a boar.
Why not a giraffe?
- Carlos?
- A mammoth.
- Very good. And what's a mammoth?
- An ancestor of the elephant.
Very good.
Your tutor taught you that.
In those days, men had to act in groups.
No one could give up.
Imagine the death of a mammoth.
It must have been terrible.
A mammoth steak, great!
When you get to draw your comics...
I could help you write the stories.
I don't need anyone.
My stories and my drawings are mine, got that?
Tomorrow, we'll continue with the second part of prehistory.
Leave your things in the dormitory.
Then it's recess.
Santi...
- Satisfaction guaranteed.
- I hope so.
Here you go.
There isn't much.
Hey, you! Bastards!
What's going on?
International Brigade.
Two Spaniards, six Canadians, one Chinaman.
What the fuck's a Chinaman doing in a Spanish war?
You, look at your damn feet!
Against the wall!
A friend of yours, Doc?
Bomb... if you're alive... tell me where Santi is.
Santi.
Talk to me.
I don't want anyone to die.
Many of you will die.
Please.
A grain of strength.
- You're up late.
- Please, give me a minute.
I need to talk to you, but I don't want the boys to hear.
Things are very bad out there.
- Is something wrong?
- Yes.
We have to get away.
Today, if possible.
- Ayala was taken prisoner...
- Ayala?
Yes, I'm sure they questioned him.
We have to go.
Go where?
To Marseille, with the Ricards.
- We can't stay here another minute.
- But I can't leave the boys!
Very well, we'll take them, as many as we can.
- We'll use the gold.
- The gold belongs to the cause.
Fuck the cause, Carmen, fuck the cause!
I always thought there'd be an afterwards.
There is no afterwards!
Carmen, if anything happened to you...
Doctor.
The boys are waiting for your permission to have breakfast.
I'll need some papers.
But we'll go.
Boys, you may start.
Come along. Get started, please.
Get started.
My mother wrote to me.
She's a lot better.
She's coming for me soon.
Last night I saw the "one who sighs."
Last night?
You're making it up.
It's Santi. I'm sure.
Are you leaving?
Where are you going?
What about me?
Fuck me, right?
That's good.
I want you to finish breakfast, but while you're doing so... listen very carefully because
I have to tell you something...
You may go, but the gold stays here.
The gold?
- Is that all you care about?
- That's it.
What are you doing?
I hid you here so you wouldn't die outside with no one to mourn you.
Give me the key.
You know what?
Of all the orphans, you were always the saddest.
The lost one.
- A prince without a kingdom.
- Shut up!
- The only one who was really alone.
- I said shut up!
Get out of here, or I'll shoot you!
Look who's come to save you.
The old sage.
Will this weapon work?
You know that while you whisper sweet things to this old hag...
I'm the one who has to screw her?
And now... get out.
What did you see?
You know already.
I don't know anything.
Tell me.
Santi.
He's the "one who sighs."
He's dead, isn't he?
Come on, boys.
Conchita... would you bring me a few cans of gas for the journey?
Please, no!
You'll all travel in the back of the truck.
It'll be a long journey.
The older boys will have to look after the little ones.
If any of you are scared,
you can sit with me.
What are you doing?
Are you all right, ma'am?
It's my bad leg.
It's heavier than ever.
Did you think someone would just give us a farm?
What are you doing with that?
You're crazy.
They're all inside.
You going to shoot me?
Please...
- What was that?
- The children!
Get them out!
It's going to blow up!
Get out! Outside!
Carmen?
Alma, leave it be, come on!
Get out! All of you!
- I'm very cold.
- It's all right. Don't move.
Don't move, don't look.
Is it bad?
Fetch my bag from the lab.
Quickly!
They won't have heard the explosion in town.
And it was just one of many.
We can't expect any help.
If I walk all night,
I'll get to town by noon tomorrow.
I've...
I've got something to tell you.
- If I don't tell you now...
- No, please, don't.
I couldn't...
I can't hear you.
So, please...
This time... let me do the talking.
- I've learned a new poem.
- Yes.
A poem.
"Stay by my side as my light grows dim... as my blood slows down... and my nerves shatter with stabbing pain... as my heart grows weak... and the wheels of my being turn slowly.
Stay by my side... as my fragile body is racked by pain... which verges on truth... and manic time... continues scattering dust... and furious life bursts out in flames.
Stay by my side... as I fade... so you can point to the end of my struggle... and the twilight... of eternal days... at the low, dark edge of life."
Miss.
A grain of strength.
Carlos, look.
Dr. Casares.
That son of a bitch.
I should have killed him when I had the chance.
But he'll be back.
And I'll be here... waiting for him.
Carlitos... bring me my records, my music.
I need them.
All right?
Are you hungry?
"Eat beans, good for the heart.
The more you eat, the more you fart."
My stomach's all upset.
But the little ones might be hungry.
Could you kill someone?
I could.
What you said about Santi is true.
He's dead.
But I didn't kill him.
- I thought...
- I was with him.
I saw everything.
It started in the pit.
I dared him to come down with me at night to gather slugs.
Run, Jaime.
Jacinto's here.
- What did you see?
- Nothing.
- Did you see the safe?
- No.
Did you see the safe?
Why the fuck are you in here?
Who was with you?
Get up.
Get up.
I was a coward.
I was always afraid ofJacinto.
Very afraid.
But not anymore.
The next time I see him...
I know I'm going to kill him.
Look who's here.
Let's see how he handles her.
Say you're sorry and get in the car.
I'm not scared of you.
You're making me look like a fool.
Say you're sorry.
They're looking at us.
I'm not afraid of you.
Say you're sorry.
You're an animal.
Doctor, I did what you told me.
I did what you told me.
But Owl's wound is still bleeding.
Conchita.
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming, Doctor!
Help me on my feet.
Jaime, put on the record.
Turn the horn towards the window.
Didn't you say he was dead?
Bastard!
Nobody knows anything.
We're going to wait.
They're leaving!
All my life
I've always stopped short... left things unfinished.
I'm not going to leave you alone,
I promise you.
I will never leave this place.
We'll wait for you upstairs.
I'm not going to run away.
I want to talk to you.
Nothing.
They must have driven on.
Tell me, what do you want?
Jacinto.
Bring him to me.
I understand.
I'm going to help you.
Jaime! I saw Santi!
He told me what he wants!
I had to break the old man's fingers.
Even dead, he's stubborn.
Hurry up! Come on!
There's something here!
Marcelo! Out of the way!
Fucking great.
It wasn't a complete waste of time.
This is yours, isn't it?
We have to get out of here.
One of us has to climb through the window.
And then open the door.
And what then?
What's wrong?
You scared?
Yes, I am, asshole.
You're not wounded, like Owl is.
You're not bleeding.
You're not even hurt.
Santi is dead.
Jacinto killed him.
If we stay here, he'll kill us all.
Do you want to sit and wait?
You think he'll let us go?
That it'll all work out if we behave?
They have the rifle.
They're bigger than us, and stronger.
Yes, but there's more of us.
Wait!
Wait.
Check if they're still working.
- Go on.
- All right.
Gálvez, did you hurt yourself?
A bit.
Fuck! Look again!
There's nothing here but souvenirs, photographs! Just crap!
One of us has to go out and get Gálvez.
- Who'll do it?
- I'll go.
No, not you. I'll go.
I'm skinnier.
Who opened it?
Dr. Casares opened the door.
He said I'd be all right, and that we should be brave.
There's no fucking gold here!
You hear me?
You and your fancy ideas!
Fuck!
Gold, gold... My ass!
My father.
He was from Calanda.
He was an accountant.
Quite elegant. Look.
My mother was from Toledo.
And that's me.
It's blurred 'cause I moved.
But that's me.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Pig, do you think your brother in Portugal could put us up?
We don't have much time.
"How lonely, the prince without a kingdom... the man without warmth.
Jacinto, 1925, in Malaga."
I saw that gold.
It's here.
We just have to look for it.
We'll find it, and tomorrow we'll burn everything.
- And the boys?
- They've got no parents.
They've got no one.
Who'll miss them?
We're at war.
A drop in the ocean.
Look, Jacinto.
Burn the place, kill the kids,
I don't give a shit.
But we're getting out of here tomorrow.
- We need stuff from the car.
- Hurry up.
I'll need a hand.
Come on, Pig.
You're crazy, asshole!
Fuck you!
No, fuck you!
It's all for me.
Son of a bitch!
What a joke!
Gálvez, you go over there.
The rifle, Jaime, the rifle!
Santi...
What is a ghost?
A tragedy condemned
to repeat itself time and again?
A moment of pain, perhaps.
Something dead
which still seems to be alive.
An emotion suspended in time.
Like a blurred photograph.
Like an insect
trapped in amber.
A ghost.
That's what I am.
TO MY PARENTS
I should've known that you would be here, Professor McGonagall.
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.
Are the rumors true, Albus?
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.
Is it wise to trust Hagrid with something so important?
Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.
Little tyke fell asleep as we were flying over Bristol.
Try not to wake him.
There you go.
Do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people?
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.
- They really are...
- The only family he has.
He'll be famous. Every child in our world will know his name.
Exactly.
He's far better off growing up away from all of that.
Until he's ready.
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.
Good luck...
...Harry Potter.
Up. Get up!
Now!
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...
...for my Dudley's special day!
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.
Aren't they wonderful, darling?
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.
36?! But last year I had 37!
- But some are bigger than last year's.
- I don't care!
This is what we're going to do.
We're going to buy you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.
I'm warning you now, boy.
Any funny business, any at all...
...and you won't have any meals for a week.
Get in.
Make it move.
Move!
- Move!
- He's asleep!
He's boring.
Sorry about him.
He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there...
...watching people press their ugly faces in on you.
Can you hear me?
It's just, I've never talked to a snake before.
Do you...?
Do you talk to people often?
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?
Do you miss your family?
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.
Mummy, Dad, you won't believe what this snake is doing!
Thanks.
Anytime.
Snake!
Mum! Mummy! Help me!
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?
Who did this? How did you get in there? Is there a snake?
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!
The glass was there and then it was gone, like magic.
There's no such thing as magic.
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- It's mine!
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?
No more mail through this letterbox.
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.
Shoo! Go on.
Fine day, Sunday.
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!
No post on Sunday.
No blasted letters today! No, sir.
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...
Make it stop, please!
Stop it!
Mummy, what's happening?
Give me that! Give me that letter!
Get off!
They're my letters! Let go of me!
That's it! We're going away!
Far away, where they can't find us!
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?
Make a wish, Harry.
Who's there?
Sorry about that.
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.
I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry.
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.
I'm not Harry.
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.
Got something for you.
Afraid I sat on it, but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.
Baked it myself, words and all.
Thank you.
It's not every day your young man turns 11, is it?
Excuse me, but who are you?
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.
- Of course, you know about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.
Didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?
Learned what?
You're a wizard, Harry.
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.
A good one, I'd wager, once you're trained up.
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...
...I can't be a wizard.
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.
Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen?
Anything you couldn't explain, when you were angry or scared?
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to accept you...
...at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."
He will not be going! We swore we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.
You knew? You knew all along and you never told me?
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?
My perfect sister being who she was.
My mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter.
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"
I was the only one to see her for what she was.
A freak!
Then she met that Potter, and then she had you...
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.
And then she got herself blown up, and we got landed with you.
Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash.
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! A scandal!
He'll not be going.
A great Muggle like you is going to stop him?
Muggle?
Non-magic folk. This boy's had his name down since he were born.
He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry.
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen, Albus Dumbledore.
I will not pay to have a crackpot old fool teach him magic tricks.
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...
...in front of me.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that.
- I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.
"All students must be equipped with...
...one standard size 2 pewter cauldron...
...and may bring, if they desire, either an owl, a cat or a toad."
Can we find all this in London?
If you know where to go.
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.
Just helping Harry buy his school supplies.
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.
Harry Potter. Can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.
Hello, professor. I didn't see you.
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Oh, nice to meet you.
Fearfully fascinating subject.
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.
Goodbye.
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous?
All those people, how is it they know who I am?
I'm not sure I'm the right person to tell you that.
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.
Here, you get your quills and ink.
Over there, all your bits and bobs for doing wizardry.
It's a world-class racing broom.
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!
It's the fastest model yet.
But how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.
There's your money.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.
Ain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.
Hagrid, what exactly are these things?
They're goblins. Clever as they come, but not the most friendly of beasts.
Best stay close.
Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.
And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.
Ha! There's the little devil.
And there's something else as well.
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.
It's about You-Know-What in vault you-know-which.
Very well.
Vault 687.
Lamp, please.
Key, please.
Did you think your parents would leave you with nothing?
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.
Stand back.
Best not to mention this to anyone.
I still need a wand.
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.
Hello?
Hello?
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.
It seems only yesterday...
...that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands.
Here we are.
Give it a wave.
Apparently not.
Perhaps...
...this.
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.
I wonder...
Curious.
Very curious.
Sorry, but what's curious?
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.
It so happens that the phoenix...
...whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather.
Just one other.
It is curious that you should be destined for this wand...
...when its brother gave you that scar.
And who owned that wand?
We do not speak his name.
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
It's not always clear why.
But I think it is clear...
...that we can expect great things from you.
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...
...did great things.
Terrible...
...yes, but great.
Harry! Harry!
Happy birthday.
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.
First, and understand this because it's very important:
Not all wizards are good.
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...
...there was a wizard who went as bad as you can go. His name was V...
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?
No, I can't spell it.
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?
It was dark times, Harry.
Voldemort started to gather some followers.
Brought them over to the Dark Side.
Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead.
Your parents fought against him.
But nobody lived once he decided to kill them.
Nobody, not one.
Except you.
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry.
A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse, an evil curse.
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?
Well, some say he died.
Codswallop, in my opinion.
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...
...too tired to carry on.
But one thing's certain. Something about you stumped him that night.
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.
You're the boy who lived.
What are you looking at?
Blimey, is that the time?
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket, that's very important.
"Platform 93/4"?
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 93/4.
There's no such thing, is there?
Sorry.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
On your left.
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 93/4?
Think you're being funny, do you?
It's the same every year, packed with Muggles.
- Muggles?
- Platform 93/4, this way.
All right, Percy, you first.
Fred, you next.
- He's not Fred, I am.
- You call yourself our mother?
I'm sorry, George.
I'm only joking. I am Fred.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me how to...?
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.
It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well.
All you do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10.
- Best to run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.
Not at all.
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.
So it's true!
I mean, do you really have the...?
- The what?
- The scar?
Wicked!
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.
We'll take the lot.
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.
There's chocolate and peppermint and also...
...spinach, liver and tripe.
George sweared he got a booger-flavored one once.
- Are they real frogs?
- It's a spell. You want the cards.
Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.
Watch it!
That's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them.
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.
Hey, he's gone!
You can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic, isn't he?
A little.
Fred gave me a spell to turn him yellow. Want to see?
Yeah.
Has anyone seen a toad?
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?
I've only tried a few simple ones myself...
...but they've all worked for me.
For example:
Oculus Reparo.
That's better, isn't it?
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?
Just there.
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!
Come on, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.
- Hello, Harry.
- Hi, Hagrid.
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on now, follow me.
Wicked.
Welcome to Hogwarts.
Shortly, you'll pass through these doors and join your classmates.
But before you take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses.
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.
While you're here, your house will be like your family.
Your triumphs will earn you points.
Any rule-breaking and you will lose points.
At the end of the year, the house with the most points wins the house cup.
Trevor!
Sorry.
The Sorting Ceremony will begin momentarily.
It's true then, what they're saying on the train.
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.
Harry Potter?
This is Crabbe and Goyle.
And I'm Malfoy.
Draco Malfoy.
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.
You'll find out some wizarding families are better than others.
You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort.
I can help you there.
I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.
The ceiling isn't real. It's bewitched to look like the night sky.
I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.
Will you wait along here, please?
Now, before we begin...
...Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.
The first years, please note...
...that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all students.
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you...
...that the third-floor corridor is out of bounds...
...to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death.
Thank you.
When I call your name, you will come forth.
I shall place the Sorting Hat on your head...
...and you will be sorted into your houses.
Hermione Granger.
Oh, no. Okay, relax.
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.
Right, then. Right.
Okay. Gryffindor!
Draco Malfoy.
Slytherin!
Every wizard who went bad was in Slytherin.
Susan Bones.
Harry, what is it?
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.
Let's see...
I know! Hufflepuff!
Ronald Weasley.
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.
Gryffindor!
Harry Potter.
Difficult, very difficult.
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.
There's talent, oh, yes.
And a thirst to prove yourself.
But where to put you?
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.
And Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that.
No? Well, if you're sure.
Better be...
...Gryffindor!
Your attention, please.
Let the feast begin.
I'm half and half.
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.
Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.
Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?
Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.
- What's he teach?
- Potions.
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.
Hello! How are you?
Welcome to Gryffindor.
It's the Bloody Baron!
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?
Dismal. Once again, my request to join the Headless Hunt has been denied.
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.
I prefer Sir Nicholas, if you don't mind.
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?
Like this.
Gryffindors, follow me, please.
Keep up. Thank you.
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.
This is the most direct path to the dormitories.
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.
That picture's moving.
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.
- Look!
- Who's that girl?
Welcome to Hogwarts.
Password?
Caput Draconis.
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.
Gather around here.
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls, the same on your right.
Your belongings have already been brought up.
Made it!
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment.
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.
- Then one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.
Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.
There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class.
As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate...
...the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making.
However, for those select few...
...who possess the predisposition...
...I can teach you how to bewitch the mind...
...and ensnare the senses.
I can tell you how to bottle fame...
...brew glory and even put a stopper in death.
Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts with abilities...
...so formidable that you feel confident enough...
...to not pay attention.
Mr. Potter.
Our new celebrity.
What would I get if I added root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?
You don't know? Let's try again.
Where would you look if I asked you to find a bezoar?
I don't know, sir.
What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
I don't know, sir.
Pity.
Clearly, fame isn't everything...
...is it, Mr. Potter?
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum
Eye of rabbit...
What's Seamus trying to do to the water?
Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...
Mail's here.
Can I borrow this? Thanks.
Look, Neville's got a Remembrall.
I've read about those. The smoke turns red when you've forgotten something.
The problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.
"Believed to be the work of Dark wizards or witches...
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge the breach but insist nothing was taken.
The vault in question, number 713, had been emptied earlier that same day."
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.
Welcome to your first flying lesson.
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your hand over the broom and say, "Up."
Up!
Up.
Up.
Up. Up!
With feeling.
Shut up, Harry.
Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it.
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be sliding off the end.
When I blow my whistle, I want you to kick off from the ground, hard.
Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment...
...then lean forward slightly and touch back down.
On my whistle. Three, two...
Mr. Longbottom.
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!
Neville!
Come back down this instant!
Everyone out of the way!
Is he all right?
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.
Keep your feet on the ground while I take him to the hospital wing.
Understand? If I see a single broom in the air...
...the one riding it will be expelled before they can say Quidditch.
Did you see his face?
If he had squeezed this, he'd have remembered to fall on his arse.
Give it here, Malfoy.
No. I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find.
How about on the roof?
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.
Besides, you don't know how to fly.
What an idiot.
Give it here or I'll knock you off your broom!
Is that so?
Have it your way, then.
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!
Harry Potter!
Follow me.
You wait here.
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?
Yes, of course.
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.
Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker.
I always knew he'd do well.
Seeker? But first years never make the house teams.
- You must be the youngest player in...
- A century, McGonagall says.
Well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.
Our job is to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad.
Can't make any promises.
Rough game, Quidditch.
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.
But they'll turn up in a month or two.
Go on. Quidditch is great. Best game there is, and you'll be great too.
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.
You never told me your father was a Seeker too.
I didn't know.
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.
Who doesn't?
What's happening?
The staircases change, remember?
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.
Does anybody feel like we shouldn't be here?
We're not supposed to be here.
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.
Let's go.
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!
Quick, let's hide through that door!
- It's locked!
- We're done for!
Move over!
Alohomora.
Get in.
Alohomora?
Standard Book of Spells, chapter seven.
Anyone here, my sweet?
Come on.
- Filch is gone.
- He thinks this door's locked.
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.
What are they doing, keeping a thing like that locked up in a school?
Didn't you see what it was standing on?
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...
...before you come up with another idea to get us killed.
Or worse, expelled.
She needs to sort out her priorities.
Quidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.
Three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.
The Chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those hoops.
The Keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. With me so far?
I think so. What are those?
You better take this.
Careful now, it's coming back.
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.
What was that?
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.
But you are a Seeker.
The only thing I want you to worry about is this.
The Golden Snitch.
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.
Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.
What do I do with it?
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.
You catch this, the game's over.
You catch this, Potter, and we win.
One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation...
...or the ability to make objects fly.
Do you have your feathers? Good.
Now, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing.
The swish and flick. Everyone.
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Wingardium Leviosa.
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going to take someone's eye out.
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!
Splendid!
Well done, dear.
I think we're going to need another feather over here.
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.
I think she heard you.
Where's Hermione?
Parvati said she wouldn't come out of the bathroom.
She said that she'd been in there all afternoon, crying.
Troll in the dungeon!
Troll in the dungeon!
Thought you ought to know.
Silence!
Everyone will please not panic!
Now...
...prefects will lead their house back to the dormitories.
Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.
Gryffindors, keep up, please, and stay alert.
How could a troll get in?
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.
I think the troll's left the dungeon.
It's going into the girls' bathroom.
Hermione, move!
Help! Help!
Hey, pea brain!
Help!
Do something!
- What?
- Anything!
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Cool.
Is it dead?
I don't think so. Just knocked out.
Troll boogers.
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.
Miss Granger?
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.
But I was wrong.
If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me, I'd probably be dead.
Be that as it may, it was an extremely foolish thing to do.
I expected more rational behavior and am very disappointed in you.
Five points will be taken from Gryffindor...
...for your serious lack of judgment.
As for you two gentlemen...
...I just hope you realize how fortunate you are.
Not many first-year students could take on a troll...
...and live to tell the tale.
Five points...
...will be awarded to each of you...
...for sheer dumb luck.
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.
I'm not hungry.
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.
A game of Quidditch should be easy work.
Even if it is against Slytherin.
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion...
...so he could get past that dog.
But he got bit, that's why he's limping.
But why would anyone go near that dog?
At Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of the vault.
Said it was Hogwarts business, very secret.
You're saying...
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.
Let's open it.
It's a broomstick.
That's not just a broomstick, it's a Nimbus 2000!
But who...?
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.
It's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.
- What happened?
- I don't really remember.
I took a Bludger to the head two minutes in.
Woke up in hospital a week later.
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!
The players take their positions...
...as Madam Hooch steps onto the field to begin the game!
Now, I want a nice, clean game...
...from all of you!
The Bludgers are up, followed by the Golden Snitch.
Remember, the Snitch is worth 150 points.
The Seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.
The Quaffle is released and the game begins!
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!
Well done!
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!
Give me that!
Take that side!
What's going on with Harry's broomstick?
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.
Come on, Hermione!
Lacarnum Inflamarae.
Fire! You're on fire!
Go, go, go, go!
Looks like he's gonna be sick.
He's got the Snitch!
Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!
Gryffindor wins!
Nonsense! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?
Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog?
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he has a name. He's mine.
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard...
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.
Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.
You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking.
Exactly.
Now, you listen to me, all three of you.
You're meddling in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.
What that dog is guarding is between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.
Nicholas Flamel?
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?
I don't know.
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Ring the Hogwart bell
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas
Cast a Christmas spell
Knight to e5.
Queen to e5.
That's totally barbaric!
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.
I see you haven't.
Change of plans. My parents went to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry.
He's going to the library to look up Nicholas Flamel.
We've looked a hundred times!
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.
I think we've had a bad influence on her.
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.
What are you wearing?
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.
There they are.
"Your father left this in my possession before he died.
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.
My body's gone!
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!
I'm invisible?
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?
Who's there?
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.
Who is it? Show yourself.
Severus, I...
You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.
We'll have another little chat soon.
When you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.
Professors. I found this in the restricted section.
It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.
Mum?
Dad?
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!
Ron, come on, get out of bed!
- Why?
- There's something you've got to see!
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!
I only see us.
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!
I look good.
Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.
Back again, Harry?
I see that you, like many before you...
...have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.
I trust by now you realize what it does.
Let me give you a clue.
The happiest man on earth...
...would look in the mirror and see only himself...
...exactly as he is.
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.
Yes. And no.
It shows us nothing more or less...
...than the deepest and most desperate desires of our hearts.
Now you, Harry, who have never known your family...
...you see them standing beside you.
But remember this, Harry.
This mirror gives us neither knowledge...
...or truth.
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.
That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home.
And I must ask you...
...not to go looking for it again.
It does not do to dwell on dreams...
...and forget to live.
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?
I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light reading.
This is light?
Of course! Here it is!
Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone.
The what?
Honestly, don't you two read?
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers.
It'll transform any metal into pure gold...
...and produces the Elixir of Life which will make the drinker immortal."
- Immortal?
- It means you'll never die.
I know what it means!
"The only Stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...
...the noted alchemist who last year celebrated his 665th birthday."
That's what Fluffy's guarding.
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.
Don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no state to entertain.
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.
- We think Snape's trying to steal it.
- Are you still on about him?
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.
Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.
What?
You heard. Come on,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?
There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?
- Spells, enchantments.
- Right.
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.
Ain't a soul knows how, except for me and Dumbledore.
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...
I know what that is!
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it, as a matter of fact.
Is that...
...a dragon?
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.
My brother works with these in Romania.
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.
Hello, Norbert.
- Norbert?
- He's gotta have a name, don't he?
Don't you, Norbert?
He'll have to be trained up a bit, of course.
Who's that?
Malfoy.
Oh, dear.
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.
- I don't understand. Is that bad?
- It's bad.
Good evening.
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...
...gives a student the right to walk about at night.
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.
- Each.
To ensure it doesn't happen again...
...all four of you will receive detention.
Excuse me, professor, perhaps I heard you wrong.
I thought you said the four of us.
No, you heard me correctly.
Honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours.
You will join your classmates in detention.
A pity they let the old punishments die.
Was a time detention found you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.
God, I miss the screaming.
You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight.
He's got a little job to do inside the Dark Forest.
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.
Good God, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?
Norbert's gone.
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.
What if he don't like Romania?
What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby.
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.
Got to have your wits about you.
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...
...werewolves.
There's more than werewolves in those trees.
You can be sure of that.
Nighty-night.
Right. Let's go.
Hagrid, what is that?
What we're here for.
See that?
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.
Now, this one's been hurt bad by something.
So, it's our job to go and find the poor beast.
Ron, Hermione, come with me.
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.
Okay. Then I get Fang.
Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward.
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.
I'm not scared, Potter.
Do you hear that?
Come on, Fang.
Scared!
What is it, Fang?
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.
What was that thing you saved me from?
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.
Drinking its blood will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death.
But at a terrible price. For you have slain something so pure...
...that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life.
A cursed life.
- Who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?
Do you mean to say that that thing that killed the unicorn...
...that was drinking its blood, that was Voldemort?
Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?
The Philosopher's Stone.
Harry!
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.
You all right there, Harry?
Harry Potter, this is where I leave you.
You're safe now. Good luck.
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there right now in the Forest?
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.
Don't you see? We had it wrong.
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.
He'll come back.
But if he comes back...
...you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?
If he'd had the chance, he might have tried tonight.
And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final.
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore is around, Harry, you're safe.
As long as Dumbledore is around, you can't be touched.
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were frightful, but I found that enjoyable.
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.
- Not like this.
- You should see the nurse.
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.
- Of course!
- What is it?
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon...
...and a stranger just happens to have one?
How many people wander around with dragon eggs?
Why didn't I see it before?
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.
You and this stranger must have talked.
He wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after.
I said, "After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."
- Was he interested in Fluffy?
- Of course he was interested.
How often do you come across a three-headed dog?
But I told him, "The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him."
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him music and he falls straight to sleep.
I shouldn't have told you that.
Where are you going?
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!
I'm afraid he's not here.
He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left.
He's gone?
But this is important!
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.
I don't know how you know, but I assure you it is well protected.
Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly.
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.
Which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.
What would three young Gryffindors...
...be doing inside on a day like this?
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.
People will think you're...
...up to something.
Now what do we do?
We go down the trap door. Tonight.
Trevor.
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?
- Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.
You're a little scary sometimes, you know that?
Brilliant, but scary.
Let's go.
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.
- You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.
Alohomora.
Wait a minute. He's...
...snoring.
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.
It's got horrible breath.
- We have to move its paw.
- What?
Come on!
Okay. Push.
I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign.
If something bad happens, get yourselves out.
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?
The harp.
It's stopped playing.
Jump!
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.
You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!
Hermione!
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.
- We've gotta do something.
- What?
I remember reading something in Herbology.
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.
Lumus Solem.
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.
Lucky we didn't panic.
Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.
What is that?
I don't know. Sounds like wings.
Curious. I've never seen birds like these.
They're not birds.
They're keys.
And I'll bet one of them fits that door.
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.
Strange.
Alohomora!
Well, it was worth a try.
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.
What's wrong?
It's too simple.
Go on! If Snape could catch it on that old broomstick, you can.
You're the youngest Seeker in a century.
This complicates things a bit.
Catch the key!
Hurry up!
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.
Where are we? A graveyard.
This is no graveyard.
It's a chessboard.
There's the door.
Now what do we do?
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room.
Harry, you take the empty bishop's square.
Hermione, you'll be the queen-side castle.
As for me, I'll be a knight.
What happens now?
Well, white moves first.
And then...
...we play.
Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...
...real wizard's chess, do you?
You there, d5.
Yes, Hermione.
I think this is gonna be exactly like wizard's chess.
Castle to e4!
Pawn to c3!
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.
Once I make my move, the queen will take me.
Then you're free to check the king.
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, there must be another way!
Do you wanna stop Snape from getting that Stone or not?
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.
Not me. Not Hermione. You.
Knight to h3.
Check.
Ron!
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.
Checkmate.
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.
I have to go on.
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.
Not as good as you.
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.
You?
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...
Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he?
Next to him, who would suspect...
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact...
...I would have succeeded.
Even with Snape muttering his countercurse.
Snape was trying to save me?
I knew you were a danger to me, especially after Halloween.
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.
While everyone ran about, he went to the third floor to head me off.
He, of course, never trusted me again.
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.
I'm never alone. Never.
Now, what does this mirror do?
I see what I desire.
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?
Use the boy.
Come here, Potter! Now!
Tell me, what do you see?
What is it? What do you see?
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.
He lies.
Tell the truth! What do you see?
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.
I have strength enough for this.
Harry Potter...
...we meet again.
Voldemort.
Yes. You see what I've become?
See what I must do to survive?
Live off another. A mere parasite.
Unicorn blood can sustain me...
...but it cannot give me a body of my own.
But there is something that can.
Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket.
Stop him!
Don't be a fool.
Why suffer an horrific death...
...when you can join me and live?
Never!
Bravery. Your parents had it too.
Tell me, Harry...
...would you like to see your mother and father again?
Together...
...we can bring them back.
All I ask is for something in return.
That's it, Harry.
There is no good and evil.
There is only power...
...and those too weak to seek it.
Together, we'll do extraordinary things.
Just give me the Stone!
You liar!
Kill him!
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!
Good afternoon, Harry.
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?
What happened in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.
So, naturally, the whole school knows.
I see that your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble...
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?
Fine. They're both just fine.
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.
The Stone has been destroyed.
My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat...
...and agreed it was best all around.
But then, Flamel, he'll die, won't he?
He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order.
But yes, he will die.
How is it I got the Stone, sir?
One minute I was staring in the mirror and...
You see, only a person...
...who wanted to find the Stone, find it...
...but not use it, would be able to get it.
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.
And between you and me, that is saying something.
Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that Voldemort can never come back?
I'm afraid...
...there are ways in which he can return.
Harry, do you know why...
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.
And that kind of act leaves a mark.
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?
Love, Harry. Love.
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit-flavored one.
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.
But I think I could be safe...
...with a nice toffee.
Alas!
Earwax.
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?
All right. Hermione?
Never better.
Another year gone.
And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding.
And the points stand thus:
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.
In second place...
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.
And in first place...
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.
Nice one, mate.
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.
However, recent events must be taken into account.
And I have a few last-minute points to award.
To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect...
...while others were in grave peril...
...50 points.
Good job.
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best-played game of chess...
...that Hogwarts has seen these many years, 50 points.
And third...
...to Mr. Harry Potter...
...for pure nerve and outstanding courage...
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.
We're tied with Slytherin!
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies...
...but a great deal more to stand up to your friends.
I award 10 points...
...to Neville Longbottom.
Assuming that my calculations are correct...
...I believe that a change of decoration is in order.
Gryffindor wins the house cup.
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.
Thought you were leaving without saying goodbye, did you?
This is for you.
Thanks, Hagrid.
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...
...you could always threaten him...
...with a nice pair of ears to go with his tail.
But we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?
Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?
I'm not going home.
Not really.

{4820}{4888}Miss Measly's up our butts|with this group project...

{5063}{5159}- I could write your report for you.|{y:i}- Fabuloso.
{5360}{5446}You know, I can't believe|you invited those clones.
{5451}{5490}They're my friends.
{5494}{5554}Six Chicks are not your friends, okay?
{5559}{5619}Well, almost. And someday|I'm gonna be a Six Chick.
{5623}{5720}There's six of them. That's the point.|There can't be a seventh Six Chick.
{5724}{5769}It's just mathematically impossible.

{7639}{7748}- This is not okay. This is fatal.|- It's not fatal, honey. It's realistic.
{7752}{7784}I hate my life.
{7788}{7844}You don't look like girls|in "Poise" magazine...
{7848}{7917}... but you're beautiful|in your own way.
{7921}{7976}I don't wanna be beautiful|in my own way.
{7980}{8039}I wanna look like these people.
{8051}{8114}Oh, those aren't people, honey.|Those are models.

{9348}{9385}What is it?
{9401}{9495}You know how you always|wanted a Barbie Dream House?
{9502}{9643}Well, I decided to make you|your own Jenna Dream House.
{9730}{9836}- You made all this? Oh, Matty.|- Yeah.
{9867}{9956}See, that's you in your bubble bath,|reading your favorite magazine.
{9960}{10043}And there's your bedroom,|with a massive stereo...
{10047}{10101}... and every record ever made.
{10105}{10140}The good ones.
{10144}{10275}And there's that bum Rick Springfield|loafing on the couch.
{10319}{10406}And there I am, to make sure the|creep keeps his hands to himself.
{10431}{10539}Oh, almost forgot. Wishing dust.
{10547}{10655}It says, "This wishing dust knows|what's in your heart of hearts.
{10659}{10719}It'll make all your dreams|come true."
{11236}{11279}They're here.
{11283}{11327}What do we do?
{11374}{11438}Oh, my God. Matt, I'm just|gonna put this away, okay?
{11442}{11488}So there's room to dance.

{13679}{13773}Narrow, man.|Narrow, hopeless people.
{13780}{13839}- Freak.|- Robot.
{13956}{14008}I'm gonna go next door|and get my Casio.
{14012}{14092}Do whatever you want, Matt.|It's not like I need a play-by-play.
{14135}{14186}See you, loser.
{14310}{14370}Hey, I have an idea, girls.
{14375}{14431}Let's play|Seven Minutes in Heaven.

{14543}{14634}Well, you go in the closet, and some|lucky guy's gonna go in there...
{14638}{14744}... and do whatever he wants|with you for seven whole minutes.

{25304}{25387}- Unless it's retro.|- Are you really my best friend?
{25401}{25469}- You're pregnant.|- Oh, no! Oh, my God, no!
{25473}{25546}Thank God. You scared me.|What did you do last night?
{25550}{25628}See, that's the thing. Something|really strange is happening.
{25632}{25697}I slept in an apartment|I've never seen before...
{25701}{25781}... and there was a naked man|in my shower and I saw his thingy.
{25785}{25824}Oh, God. Not his thingy.
{25828}{25900}Driver, could you please pull over,|since we're here?

{26223}{26307}Wait! I know it sounds strange,|but some weird dream is-- Like that!
{26311}{26360}Do you hear it? Did you hear that?
{26364}{26464}Would you stop being ridiculous?|It's probably just Richard.
{26502}{26564}- Who's Richard?|- You drink too much.
{26568}{26614}Richard, your boss.
{26618}{26706}Brown, curly hair. British. Richard.

{27310}{27369}- I am?|- Repeat it.
{27377}{27468}I am Jenna Rink,|bigtime magazine editor.
{27472}{27502}I'm a tough bitch.
{27588}{27687}- Say it.|- I am a tough bitch.
{27691}{27771}I'm gonna walk into that office,|I won't let anyone know I'm hung-over.
{27775}{27835}But that's not the point.|I'm not hung-over--
{27859}{27924}I'm gonna walk into that office|and not let anyone know I'm hung-over.
{27928}{28034}Because the future of "Poise"|depends on me.
{28059}{28098}"Poise"?
{28138}{28167}Oh, jeez.
{28300}{28337}"Poise" magazine. Thank you.
{28343}{28388}Good morning, Miss Rink,|Miss Wyman.
{28392}{28465}- Good morning. What's her name?|- Who cares?
{28477}{28537}Jenna. Please don't yell at me,|it's not my fault.
{28541}{28594}They need a decision right now.
{28598}{28649}- Just pick one.|- That one.
{28653}{28690}Love. Knew it. Genius.
{28695}{28757}Eminem's on the phone.|He wants a decision now.
{28778}{28814}Plain.
{28849}{28910}Peanut. Plain.
{28914}{29018}There's the dynamic duo! I trust my|executive editors are late again...
{29022}{29083}... because they were out|promoting us at parties.
{29087}{29152}- You got it, Richard.|- Richard. You're my boss.
{29156}{29215}That's right, baby.|Who's your daddy?
{29219}{29248}Wayne Rink.
{29267}{29305}Morning.
{29392}{29449}Two words: summer, Saint Barts.
{29453}{29518}Oh, you're not gonna go|to Fire Island this summer?
{29522}{29587}- Are you insinuating I'm gay?|- It's a joke.
{29797}{29877}Is there anything else you|need from me, Miss Rink?
{29944}{29994}You mean like a favor?
{30023}{30061}Sure. Like a favor.
{30065}{30124}- I need to find this guy in New Jersey.|- Okay.
{30128}{30161}I have his number.
{30258}{30338}- Arlene, will you leave us, please?|- Sorry.
{30567}{30615}Jenna's a little hung-over today.
{30658}{30705}Rough.
{30709}{30765}Okay, children.
{31073}{31167}I wonder which one|Holly Housewife is going to go for.
{31171}{31241}The 1 0th or the 1 1th secret?
{31481}{31561}Seven months in a row now|they scoop us.
{31565}{31672}I mean, it's like they've got|"Sparkle"-cams hidden in all our walls.
{31676}{31749}Richard, we're installing passwords.
{31753}{31806}We're building firewalls|on all the computers.
{31810}{31864}- Jenna fired Charlotte yesterday.|- Did you?
{31912}{31978}I guarantee she has friends|at "Sparkle". She always took notes.
{31982}{32042}- She was a secretary.|- Yeah, whatever.
{32086}{32172}Our party tonight is now huge.
{32176}{32227}We need to make|an unequivocal statement...
{32231}{32284}... that "Poise" is still hot|and happening.
{32288}{32367}Now, we need a newsstand|circ analysis done immediately.
{32371}{32463}I also strongly suggest we take apart|our F.O.B., overhaul the B.O.B...
{32467}{32543}... think about new heads, decks|and slugs. Jenna, what do you think?
{32591}{32626}Can I go to the bathroom?
{33335}{33392}It's the naked guy.
{33610}{33726}"Jenna, girl, margaritas anytime.|Love you, Madonna."
{33747}{33810}I'm friends with Madonna?
{34003}{34040}Here are your messages.
{34044}{34096}And your mother called|from Barbados.
{34100}{34156}My mom called?|I wish you'd told me.
{34160}{34213}Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Rink.
{34217}{34290}I thought you said never|to bother you with family calls.
{34300}{34373}- I did? I said that?|- Please don't fire me.
{34377}{34455}No, no, I won't. It's not your fault.|I forgot that I said that.
{34459}{34507}Next time my mom calls,|let me know.
{34511}{34547}Yes, ma'am.
{34551}{34642}Oh, I have that information|that you asked for.
{34651}{34693}Matt!
{34713}{34768}The phone number|you gave me was his parents'.
{34772}{34855}I told them that I worked for Visa|and he's in a lot of trouble.
{34859}{34916}You lied to the Flamhaffs!
{34920}{35034}He's in the Village.|21 2 Bank Street, apartment 2B.
{35047}{35118}- Which village?|- The-- Greenwich Village.
{35123}{35185}Oh, right. Cool.
{35227}{35281}Wait! Should I cancel|your 2:30 meeting?
{35389}{35423}Sorry.
{35470}{35514}Excuse me?
{35535}{35572}Sir?
{35649}{35678}Hello?
{36322}{36367}{Y:i}Yeah, yeah. Hello. Yeah.
{36371}{36424}Hi, this is Jenna|and I'm looking for Matt.
{36431}{36507}I don't know if you're him,|but if you lived on Spruce Street...
{36511}{36599}... and if your favorite shirt is a gray|velour one, I need to speak to you.
{36603}{36699}{Y:i}Hello? Hello? Hello? You know what?|I got none of that.
{36703}{36810}{Y:i}If you're here from Ming Gardens,|ring twice. If not, I really don't want it.
{37008}{37067}You're not Chinese.
{37073}{37132}- Matt?|- Yeah.
{37178}{37263}You're tall. You're different.
{37283}{37360}- Yeah.|- You don't know me?
{37364}{37420}That's weird, because|yesterday you were there.
{37424}{37481}No, it wasn't yesterday,|because I'm not 13.
{37485}{37536}- Jenna.|- Yes!
{37540}{37607}- Jenna Rink.|- Yes! Matt, it's me!
{37787}{37855}- Hey.|- Oh, Matty!
{37859}{37903}Come on in.
{38038}{38070}You still take pictures?
{38074}{38166}Yeah. You know, it pays the bills.
{38170}{38222}Hey, Jenna, what are--?|Why are you here?
{38226}{38314}Matty, I told you. Something|really weird is happening.
{38319}{38394}Yesterday was my 1 3th birthday|and then....
{38399}{38461}And then today I woke up|and I'm this.
{38465}{38534}And you-- I mean, you're that.|You get it?
{38538}{38651}Are you high? You been smoking pot?|Doing X? Falling into a K-hole?
{38655}{38771}- Are you doing drugs?|- No. No. Look...
{38775}{38879}... I was sitting in my closet|and I skipped everything.
{38883}{38958}I mean, it's like a weird dream.|I can't remember my life.
{38963}{39009}You need to help me|remember my life.
{39013}{39067}- Me? I can't do that.|- Why not?
{39100}{39157}I don't know anything|about you, all right?
{39161}{39229}I haven't seen you since high school.
{39247}{39342}- What?|- We're not friends anymore, Jenna.
{39353}{39435}- Matty, you're my best friend.|- No.
{39494}{39554}Okay. It's cool.
{39578}{39624}- It's cool.|- Is it warm in here?
{39628}{39718}It's-- Maybe I should open|a window.
{39722}{39798}I need fresh air and a glass|of water and a fluffy pillow.
{39802}{39878}Have a seat. I'll get you some--|You want a glass of water?
{39882}{39944}- You want ice in that?|- I want a fluffy pillow!
{39948}{40022}A fluffy pillow, coming right up.|Sorry.
{40091}{40129}You all right?
{40184}{40300}Jenna, I think you should go back to|your apartment. I'll help you find it.
{40351}{40443}We went separate ways. We went|to different colleges, different careers.
{40447}{40521}Well, what about Christmas?|Didn't you wanna see me then?
{40555}{40631}I think I saw you through a frosted|window once, six years ago.
{40635}{40688}- Six years ago?|- Yeah.
{40692}{40742}Wasn't I home last Christmas?
{40747}{40824}I don't know. Doesn't your crowd|do Saint Barts for Christmas?
{40828}{40871}I don't know.
{40879}{40929}Is this you?
{40933}{41029}Yeah. This is where I live now.
{41183}{41253}Okay, so nice seeing you.
{41315}{41352}Good luck.
{41389}{41455}- Okay?|- Okay.
{41459}{41529}- Bye.|- Bye.
{41623}{41659}Matt.
{41694}{41742}Who is Saint Bart?
{41908}{42011}The most depressing years of my life.|Our high school yearbook.
{42015}{42050}Matt, was I a Six Chick?
{42054}{42118}Yeah, you were pretty|much their leader.
{42211}{42271}There's Tom-Tom. I wonder|what happened to her.
{42275}{42367}Last I heard, you were still good|friends. I think you even work together.
{42371}{42439}Lucy. Oh, my God, yes.
{42443}{42542}She's Lucy Wyman now.|She looks so different.
{42546}{42646}Yeah, she's pretty big into the|whole plastic surgery movement.
{42650}{42714}- I was the prom queen.|- Yep.
{42719}{42806}- And I went with Chris Grandy.|- Yep.
{42810}{42910}Oh, this is incredible. I can't believe it.|I got everything I ever wanted.
{42921}{43008}Yeah, Jenna, you got it all.|Congratulations.
{43070}{43110}It's your phone.
{43293}{43348}- Hello?|{y:i}- Hi, Gramercy calling to confirm...

{43412}{43499}My-- Yes, my limousine for 8:30.
{43503}{43563}I will be prepared to take|my ride at that time.
{43567}{43618}Oh, can you tell me where|I'm going?
{43622}{43724}{y:i}- The Palace, 27 Wall Street.|- Thank you.
{43728}{43812}I'm going to a party in a limo!
{43847}{43937}Great. Looks like you're back to your|old self. I should probably go.
{43941}{44023}- You don't wanna go to the party?|- No, I gotta work. Thanks.
{44027}{44083}Shoot, I forgot you have a job.
{44087}{44158}- It's kind of cool we both have jobs.|- Totally.
{44163}{44269}Well, if you decide you want to come,|it's gonna be fun. 27 Wall Street.
{44273}{44353}Okay, great. Thanks, Jenna.|Bye-bye.
{44370}{44408}Matt.
{44435}{44527}- Yeah.|- What if this isn't just a dream?
{44544}{44620}What if what I wished for|actually happened?
{44641}{44735}Then you got everything you ever|wanted. You might as well enjoy it.
{44767}{44814}All right, Jenna.
{44935}{44995}- Matty.|- Yeah.

{47568}{47617}How old are you, anyway?
{47621}{47685}- Thirteen.|- Me too.
{47693}{47743}Used to be.
{47817}{47861}Why are you talking to me?
{47873}{47969}- Why not? We are neighbors, right?|- But you usually ignore me.
{48036}{48122}- I like your shoes.|- Thanks.
{48126}{48156}I like your dress.
{48160}{48244}It's because I've got these|incredible boobs to fill it out.
{48302}{48338}- I like your bag.|- Thanks.
{48343}{48411}You should come by sometime.|I've got a zillion of them.
{48415}{48488}- Really?|- Yeah, it'd be totally cool.
{48492}{48545}Hey, Becky?
{48549}{48628}- Can I ask you something?|- Yeah, sure.
{48632}{48712}Can you tell I'm wearing underwear?|Because I totally am.
{48716}{48801}I think that's kind of the point.
{49375}{49444}Try it. It's soft-shell crab.
{49756}{49794}Thanks.
{50110}{50141}Hi, Tom-Tom.
{50145}{50219}Oh, God, no one's called me that|since I had my nose job.
{50223}{50294}- You had a nose job?|- Yeah, and yours is better.
{50298}{50352}Anything to drink, ladies?
{50356}{50450}- An apple martini.|- Can I have a lemonade, please?
{50454}{50552}Oh, wait. Make it|a piña colada, not virgin.
{50556}{50609}Do you wanna see my ID?|Totally have it.
{50613}{50655}There you two are.
{50659}{50728}Lucy, very nice.
{50732}{50781}Sort of a dangerous mermaid look.
{50785}{50858}And you.... Barbie meets Britney.
{50862}{50914}You look just|"scrum-didlee-umpcious"!
{50918}{50963}I know. I mean, thank you.
{50967}{51041}Everybody Wang Chung tonight,|right?
{51104}{51151}Here you go.
{51239}{51290}Thank you.
{51315}{51381}- I'm sorry, it's late.|- We're keeping you up, are we?
{51385}{51444}It's only 1 1 :00. Stay a while.
{51623}{51698}It's 11:00 on a school night|and I'm at a party. It's so cool.
{51703}{51789}It's 11:00 and people are leaving.|This is a disaster.
{51793}{51828}It is?
{51832}{51900}Speaking of disasters,|what is she doing here?
{51904}{51962}- Who?|- "Sparkle's" editor in chief, Trish Sackett.
{51966}{52026}Twelve o'clock and headed our way.
{52055}{52160}Hi, girls. Our J. Lo issue is selling|like hotcakes. How's yours doing?
{52164}{52262}My God, are things so bad you had|to come to our party to eat free food?
{52267}{52315}Put some crab|in your purse for later.
{52319}{52407}You might want to keep some|of that biting wit for your magazine.
{52411}{52487}Or you could change the name|to something more appropriate...
{52491}{52595}... like "Poison" or "Pitiful".|Whatever's more pathetic.
{52599}{52635}You know what?
{52639}{52764}You are rude and mean and sloppy|and frizzy. I don't like you at all.
{52773}{52833}Well, fortunately,|I don't care about being liked.
{52837}{52894}- I care about winning.|- This is delicious.
{52959}{53003}Ladies.
{53156}{53206}Do I smell?
{53210}{53257}Do I have bad breath?
{53261}{53376}- Am I malodorous in any way?|- No.
{53387}{53471}People seem to be running for the exit|like someone set off a stink bomb.
{53475}{53505}I don't smell anything.
{53509}{53562}I think he means|the party is a stinker.
{53566}{53673}A dud. A flop. A zero|on a scale of one to 1 0.
{53701}{53750}Maybe if somebody|played something else.
{53754}{53813}- Something with a melody.|- Play whatever you want.
{53817}{53925}All I know is if those people don't|start dancing really, really soon....
{53951}{54019}Here's to early retirement.
{55846}{55891}Matty! Matty, come here.
{55913}{56018}- Hey.|- Matty, come here.
{56022}{56071}"Thriller." Matty.
{56075}{56146}Me? No, no, no, no.|Take that thing away.
{56156}{56221}- "Thriller." Come on.|- No way.
{56225}{56271}Come on, man! Go!
{56290}{56323}Jenna, no way.
{56327}{56370}Come on, let's go.
{56374}{56414}I don't remember those moves.
{56418}{56505}I haven't done this in 1 5 years.|What are you, crazy?
{56671}{56714}Tear it up, dude!
{56884}{56939}- Come on, Matty.|- All right, all right.
{57023}{57079}Okay, here we go.
{57475}{57525}Go, Arlene!
{57647}{57700}Come on, let's go!|Let's go, Jenna!
{58289}{58341}Go, Richard!
{58799}{58878}- Jenna. I'm sorry, I gotta go.|- What do you--?
{58882}{58943}- I'm sorry.|- Wait. Don't.
{58955}{59000}Matt.

{60967}{61036}- I've decided it's gonna be awesome.|- Of course it is.
{61040}{61122}You're thin, you're hot, you can|get any guy you want, "biatch."
{61126}{61218}Not to mention, biatch, the hottest|magazine editor in the world.
{61222}{61262}Second hottest.
{61277}{61316}- Tied for first?|- Deal.
{61347}{61403}And speaking of hot....
{61407}{61504}Mr. Hotty behind you is totally|scamming on you right now.
{61736}{61825}He is not. He's totally cute.
{61829}{61895}- Should I go talk to him?|- You're not married.
{61995}{62033}Good.
{62266}{62303}Hi.
{62352}{62407}Could I borrow your ketchup?
{62411}{62451}Sure.
{62516}{62575}I actually came over here...
{62579}{62633}... because I think you're really cute.
{62673}{62771}- So do you wanna go out sometime?|- Yeah. Can you drive?
{62775}{62870}Time to go. What, do you wanna|go to jail? I meant that guy.
{62875}{62917}The man? Oh, gross.
{62934}{63011}No more daiquiris for you tonight.
{63015}{63083}You can never find a taxi|in this neighborhood.
{63087}{63151}Oh, my God. It's the naked man.
{63155}{63215}- Hey, beautiful.|- He thinks I'm beautiful?
{63219}{63324}- Well, he should. He's your boyfriend.|- My boyfriend?
{63367}{63430}Why is that lady asking|for my boyfriend's autograph?
{63435}{63465}Thank you so much.
{63469}{63518}He may not be|the best New York Ranger...
{63522}{63573}... but he's the Ranger|with the best ass.
{63619}{63649}Jenna?
{63664}{63721}- Oh, my God. Matt. Hi!|- Hey.
{63741}{63790}How are you?
{63804}{63870}I'm sorry about the other night.
{63874}{63957}- Beaver, is that you?|- Hey, Tom-Tom. How are you?
{63961}{64012}You lost all your baby fat.
{64016}{64107}- How does the Beave stay warm?|- Yeah, it's good to see you again too.
{64111}{64176}I almost didn't recognize you.|Did you get a nose job?
{64180}{64238}I can't believe you're here.|What're you doing?
{64242}{64346}I'm-- I'm actually-- I'm doing|some shopping with my....
{64350}{64403}Jenna, this is Wendy, my fiancée.
{64459}{64499}- I'm Jenna.|- Matt told me about...
{64503}{64591}... his blast from the past.|It was really sweet of you to stop by.
{64595}{64672}Matty's the sweet one. I don't know|what I'd have done without him.
{64676}{64743}- I'm sure you'll be fine.|- Are you a photographer too?

{64819}{64875}- Wendy's an anchorwoman.|- Anchorperson.
{64879}{64947}I do the weather for WWEN|in Chicago.

{65163}{65219}We haven't really--|Is that Alex Carlson?
{65223}{65291}Jenna, sorry. Sorry I'm late.

{65955}{66053}I crack a lot of jokes after we win, on|account of I'm in such a good mood.
{66122}{66196}Okay, well, we should|probably get going.
{66200}{66260}- Nice to meet you.|- Nice to see you folks.
{66264}{66339}Nice to see you folks. Bye.
{66430}{66487}You mind if I steal her|from you for the night?
{66495}{66566}Nope. I actually had my eye|on something better inside...
{66570}{66653}... so I'll see you guys later.|Have a good night.
{66657}{66722}Excuse me one second. Lucy?
{66770}{66828}Should I go to his place alone?
{66832}{66934}Yeah. Why not?|Go play. You deserve it.
{66939}{67007}Play. You mean|like games and stuff?
{67011}{67164}Yeah, games. All kinds of games.
{67461}{67518}I couldn't wait to see you tonight.

{68643}{68682}Oh, God.
{68701}{68759}Oh, gross.
{68901}{69035}Who's got the moves|on the ice and off the ice, ice, baby?
{69039}{69143}Wait! Wait! Wait! I don't wanna see|that thing again. Put it away.
{69147}{69191}Put it away!
{69195}{69244}God.
{69377}{69474}We can play Monopoly!|We can play Parcheesi!
{69500}{69563}He didn't have Battleship.|He didn't have any games.
{69567}{69604}Boys are so stupid.
{69608}{69673}Becky, it's even worse than you think.
{69677}{69740}How come the ones|that you like never like you?
{69744}{69847}Well, you have to fight for what|you want. Rule number one:
{69851}{69905}Love is a battlefield.
{69909}{70008}That's deep. Really deep.
{70012}{70103}- Good luck with fractions.|- Have fun at work.
{70143}{70193}To the office, Tom.
{70242}{70304}"Fifty-seven ways to have an orgasm."
{70304}{70329}"Fifty-seven ways to have an orgasm."
{70351}{70438}- I didn't know there were 57.|- "T ouch-her-there underwear."
{70443}{70495}No.
{70499}{70557}"He loves you, but...."
{70561}{70619}- "He loves your butt."|- Yes.
{70623}{70688}- "He lies, he cheats...|- So typical.
{70692}{70763}... what are you doing wrong?"
{70859}{70964}There's no easy way of saying this,|so I'm just gonna come out with it.
{71018}{71104}The circs are in.|Our numbers are dismal.
{71108}{71237}We're below 600,000 total circulation.|"Sparkle" is closing in on a million.
{71241}{71387}I've come off the phone with corporate|and they have dropped the R word.
{71391}{71442}Redesign?
{71447}{71491}Redesign "Poise"?
{71495}{71558}Wait. "Sparkle" copies everything|we come up with...
{71562}{71614}... and we have to redesign?|That's bullshit.
{71619}{71761}Well, either we redesign and bring up|our numbers or they pull the plug.
{71765}{71822}Richard, redesign is a death sentence.
{71826}{71917}No, it's not. It's a chance|to have some fun.
{71930}{72045}Let "Sparkle" have all our|secondhand, stale, grody ideas.
{72049}{72114}We'll open up the F.O.B.,|overhaul the B.O.B.
{72119}{72193}It's time for us to prove|we have some poise left.
{72197}{72317}Well, I shall be leaving it|to my dynamic duo...
{72321}{72381}... to come up with something|utterly fabulous.
{72422}{72535}We have two weeks,|four hours and 30 minutes.
{72551}{72626}- I have your urgent messages.|- Let's hear them.
{72630}{72682}Well, okay.
{72687}{72751}Emily Pratt called|and wanted me to tell you:
{72755}{72848}"I can't believe you scooped my story|on Vivienne Tam, you backbiting bitch.
{72852}{72906}That was a new level|of sleaze, even for you.
{72911}{72967}I hope you die in one|of her casual pantsuits."
{72971}{73042}Oh, my God, that was so mean.
{73047}{73148}Miss Lewis called. She said,|"I hope you choke on your own bile...
{73152}{73247}... you pretentious, conniving snake."
{73251}{73306}- Maybe I should read them myself.|- Good.
{73310}{73369}Oh, great.
{73470}{73541}- Miss Rink's line.|{y:i}- Put that little bitch on the phone now.
{73545}{73612}Please don't take that tone.|I'm just her assistant.
{73616}{73646}{Y:i}Tell her to call Todd.
{73675}{73801}"Sweet bottom, you seem uptight.|Let me come over and give you my...."
{73997}{74064}- Yes.|- Alex is on line one, Miss Rink.
{74068}{74160}{Y:i}Oh, gag me. Can you|please tell him I'm busy?
{74164}{74254}Okay, but he wants to know|what time would be good for dinner.
{74258}{74339}How about in 1 0 zillion years?|Ask him how that works.
{74343}{74422}{y:i}- Okay, I'll ask.|- Okay.
{74522}{74574}- Yeah?|{y:i}- I'm sorry to bother you again.
{74578}{74633}{y:i}- Pete Hansen is here to see you.|- Who?
{74637}{74716}{Y:i}Tracy from the|art department's husband.
{74731}{74787}Oh, okay. Sure.
{75040}{75150}I was just dropping off Tracy's lunch,|thought I'd say hello.
{75211}{75289}You brought Tracy her lunch?|That's so sw--
{75370}{75417}What are you doing?
{75421}{75463}What's wrong, pooky?
{75467}{75508}"Pooky"?
{75512}{75597}Pukey. You're married,|and to a girl I work with.
{75601}{75694}Well, that didn't stop us from rattling|some desk drawers loose last week.
{75703}{75801}So come on.|Lie down and take a memo.
{76007}{76104}Listen, hire the best photographer,|and I don't want Jenna to find out.
{76108}{76156}- No. Roger that.|- Okay?
{76160}{76255}God, what is up with her lately,|anyway? I mean, she seems so lost.
{76259}{76342}I have no idea. I'm getting|so sick of having her around...
{76347}{76402}... with this crazy new act|she has going on.
{76406}{76479}You know how she stole|Charlotte's idea and then fired her?
{76483}{76539}I say we go ahead|with our own presentation...
{76543}{76586}... and let her fall on her ass.
{76590}{76642}Oh, God, yeah.
{77394}{77455}Okay, you're not Cajun.
{77500}{77577}- Wanna go for a walk?|- Sure.
{77755}{77810}I still can't believe|you're getting married.
{77814}{77881}In two weeks.
{77943}{78014}Is she your soul mate, Wendy?
{78037}{78160}My soul mate? I don't know if I believe|in those. I think that's kind of naive.
{78173}{78270}But you get goose bumps|when you're around her...
{78275}{78323}... and butterflies?
{78327}{78450}No, I haven't gotten crazy like that|about a girl since high school.
{78464}{78512}Matty.
{78575}{78634}What--? What happened to us?
{78639}{78698}I mean, how come|we never stayed friends?
{78754}{78799}I don't know. I forget.
{78803}{78860}No, what happened?
{78893}{78978}I don't know. I can pretty much|peg it to your 1 3th birthday party...
{78983}{79046}... when you were playing that game.|Spin the Rapist?
{79050}{79101}Seven Minutes in Heaven.|Everybody ditched.
{79105}{79161}And that is the last thing I remember.
{79186}{79250}We don't have to get into this.|It's a long time ago.
{79254}{79325}- It really doesn't matter anymore.|- It matters to me.
{79329}{79376}Just tell me.
{79455}{79492}You came out of the closet...
{79496}{79576}... and I started to sing|my birthday song to you.
{79580}{79653}And then you picked up|and threw at me...
{79657}{79706}... with impressive force, I might add...
{79710}{79792}... the dream house that I spent|three weeks building for you.
{79796}{79872}And then you just stopped|being my friend...
{79876}{79970}... and you never spoke to me|again after that, ever.
{80053}{80106}I'm so sorry.
{80119}{80192}Forget it, Jenna. It was a long|time ago. It doesn't matter.
{80196}{80281}Matt, stop being so nice to me.|I don't deserve it.
{80321}{80370}Do you know what|kind of person I am now?
{80374}{80444}Do you know who I am right now? I....
{80496}{80564}I don't have any real friends. I....
{80568}{80639}I did something bad|with a married guy.
{80643}{80713}I don't talk to my mom and dad.
{80732}{80804}I'm not a nice person.|And the thing is...
{80842}{80894}... I'm not 13 anymore.
{81003}{81047}Jenna.
{81443}{81489}Behind you.
{83727}{83794}Oh, it's good to be home.
{84023}{84067}- Daddy.|- Jenna?
{84071}{84129}What in the world?
{84151}{84199}- Sweetheart.|- I missed you guys so much.
{84203}{84261}Are you all right?
{85794}{85847}Mom.
{85863}{85934}Do you ever wish you could go back...
{85938}{85977}... like to another time?
{85981}{86063}I wouldn't mind giving back|some of these wrinkles.
{86086}{86133}Okay.
{86155}{86279}If you were given one do-over,|anything in your life, what would it be?
{86427}{86470}Nothing.
{86474}{86546}- Really?|- Really.
{86551}{86610}But did you ever make|a big mistake?
{86615}{86698}Or a huge one that could|change your life? What about that?
{86703}{86768}Well, Jenna, I know|I made a lot of mistakes...
{86772}{86833}... but I don't regret|making any of them.
{86851}{86883}How come?
{86903}{86951}Because if I hadn't have|made them...
{86955}{87026}... I wouldn't have learned|how to make things right.
{87230}{87297}I'm sorry I missed last Christmas.
{88279}{88338}Carrie, I'm heading out, okay?
{88404}{88450}I'm so exhausted.
{88454}{88498}- Jenna's working late.|- She has been.
{88756}{88804}- Hey.|- Hey.
{88808}{88896}I was gonna stop by your office.|I tried to call you a bunch of times.
{88900}{88995}- I didn't get any messages.|- I was in a hurry.
{88999}{89054}But I did try to reach you.
{89058}{89161}I actually wanted to talk to you|about this whole redesign thing.
{89165}{89247}I hope you don't mind, but I've been|working on something on my own.
{89251}{89318}It's really last-minute.
{89323}{89411}- I hope you don't mind.|- No, of course not...
{89415}{89475}... because I'm doing the same thing.
{89768}{89847}- Hey, Jenna.|- Hey.
{89851}{89920}Someone's got|a big photo shoot going on.
{89924}{89965}- Yeah.|- What's happening?
{89969}{90039}- Did you bring them?|- Oh, yeah, I got a few.
{90059}{90103}- What are you doing?|- I'm hiring you.
{90107}{90184}Actually, "Poise"|is hiring you for the week.
{90198}{90243}Here.
{90407}{90469}This is the first half.|The rest when we finish.
{90473}{90554}I could really use this, but you|don't need to do me any favors.
{90558}{90632}I'm asking you to do me a favor.|I love your work.
{90657}{90699}I hope you'll do this with me.
{90760}{90882}You know, I've seen your magazine.|My stuff is not your style at all.
{90936}{90985}Exactly.
{91011}{91068}Who gets Francis?
{91081}{91157}There we go.|Okay, let's do it.
{91161}{91214}Up, up!
{91219}{91283}- Okay, everybody.|- Okay, everybody, climb up there.
{91287}{91329}Lots of energy.
{91333}{91415}- All right. Nice. You're the real deal.|- Keep up the flag.
{91419}{91518}All right. Jenna, this is|your class of 2004.
{91523}{91577}All right, guys. Ready?
{91827}{91901}Very good. Very good.
{93997}{94062}- They're beautiful.|- Yeah, they came out okay, huh?
{94067}{94099}- I think so.|- Yeah.
{94103}{94166}- Do you?|- I do, yeah.
{94380}{94436}Yeah, it's getting late.|I should get home.
{94440}{94490}It's getting pretty late here.
{94495}{94566}You know what I wish I had|right now?
{94571}{94613}No, what?
{94617}{94667}Razzles.
{94671}{94720}Razzles?
{94724}{94806}I haven't had Razzles...
{94831}{94874}- ... in 1 5 years.|- Remember...
{94879}{94945}- ... they're both a candy and a gum.|- That's incredible.
{94949}{95027}I can't believe they had them.|Okay, don't waste a minute.
{95031}{95103}It's been a long time. Careful.
{95138}{95178}Yeah.
{95235}{95278}What are you laughing at?
{95283}{95320}I don't know.
{95324}{95421}Life. Timing. Being here with you,|eating Razzles.
{95534}{95603}I've had a really great time|working with you this week.
{95607}{95638}- Me too.|- And everything.
{95643}{95682}Yeah.
{95735}{95772}Hey, Matty.
{95799}{95854}Tell me something.
{95858}{95908}What color is my tongue?
{95912}{95966}- What?|- What color is my tongue?
{95971}{96018}It's red. I don't know. Red.
{96022}{96074}"Red" red? Or tongue red?
{96088}{96131}Razzle red.
{96135}{96171}- Show me yours.|- What?
{96175}{96244}- Your tongue. I showed you mine.|- I'm not showing you.
{96248}{96297}Show me your tongue.|I showed you mine.
{96301}{96377}- I didn't ask to see yours.|- Matty, I need to see your tongue.
{96435}{96484}Razzle red.
{96571}{96618}You wanna know a secret?
{96647}{96692}Yeah.
{96696}{96752}You're the sweetest guy|I've ever known.
{96871}{96923}I bet I can still beat you off the jump.
{97015}{97075}Whoever goes the furthest,|the other owes a drink.
{97079}{97131}- An Orange Julius.|- Upping the stakes.
{97135}{97209}And dinner Friday night at 8:00...
{97213}{97272}... at the 24th Street Diner...
{97276}{97338}... to celebrate our redesign|being chosen.
{97342}{97396}Deal. One.
{97443}{97493}- Two.|- Two.
{97517}{97558}- Three!|- Three!
{97634}{97667}Are you okay?
{97671}{97722}I should've tucked and rolled.
{97727}{97766}I'm getting old.
{97770}{97818}No, you're not,|because that means I am.
{97822}{97856}Well?
{98006}{98037}- Hey.|- Yeah?
{98041}{98088}You got arm hair.
{98127}{98190}It's never quite got|that reaction before.
{98996}{99046}{Y:i}It was like it wasn't even me.
{99051}{99098}{Y:i}Like I had just...
{99102}{99182}{Y:i}... watched us down below, kissing.
{99217}{99283}Then I just floated home on a cloud.
{99339}{99398}That is so romantic.
{99480}{99531}- Look.|- You've got goose bumps.
{99535}{99598}I totally know. They won't go away.
{99619}{99656}Do you love him?
{99660}{99705}Duh.
{99722}{99763}When will you see him again?
{99767}{99829}I don't know, actually.|I don't know if I can.
{99833}{99913}- What? Why?|- It's complicated.
{99917}{99968}It's a grownup thing.
{99999}{100070}Well, at least you have|someone to dream about.
{100075}{100145}Guys don't wanna jump your bones|when you're a metal-mouth.
{100149}{100223}What is that attitude?|We are young.
{100247}{100340}Heartache to heartache, we stand.
{100344}{100427}Love is a battlefield.
{101221}{101290}But I like it like this,|with freckle girl and the dog.
{101309}{101381}- These photos are unbelievable, Jen.|- Okay, here's the dog.
{101385}{101450}- Francis is the dog's name.|- Okay. What do you think?
{101455}{101561}Well, I think I'm gonna start reading|"Poise" for the first time in my life.
{101959}{102023}No, I got a place I rent in Brooklyn.
{102034}{102141}That'll work? All right,|I'll see you then. Bye-bye.
{102237}{102330}Hey. I wasn't expecting to see you--
{102334}{102400}Wendy. I thought you were|flying in tomorrow.
{102404}{102466}What, are you expecting|someone else?
{102485}{102515}No. Hi.
{102519}{102566}I wanna take you to lunch. Hungry?
{102570}{102651}Yeah, yeah. What a surprise.
{102655}{102693}Okay, where do you...?
{102697}{102753}- How was your flight?|- It was good.
{102757}{102826}{Y:i}You can take pictures of|vitamin bottles anywhere.
{102830}{102906}And I was just thinking that we|should try to resolve this now.
{102911}{103030}Instead of being a commuter couple|during our first year of marriage.
{103070}{103110}What?
{103115}{103162}I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
{103166}{103227}Could you...? I missed that.
{103258}{103308}- Arlene, do you have any more--?|- Jenna.
{103323}{103391}My balls, excuse my French,|are in an iron vice.
{103395}{103486}Corporate are twisting like a bunch|of dominatrixes on steroids.
{103490}{103570}Now Lucy's presenting her own|redesign. Tell me what's going on.
{103574}{103631}What is going on is you|will have more choices.
{103635}{103729}All respect to Lucy, I'm more anxious|to know what you're working on.
{103733}{103782}- Thank you.|- I'm not complimenting you...
{103786}{103823}... I'm trying to pressure you.
{103827}{103894}How long until your balls|get totally squished?
{103898}{103966}Hopefully never. I'm really rather|attached to my balls.
{103970}{104017}Can they hang in there till 5?
{104039}{104094}Jenna, you are not yourself|at the moment.
{104098}{104202}Since when do you keep me out of|the loop? I'm really freaking out here.
{104206}{104275}- The rest of the prints are ready.|- Goody. Hang in there.
{104279}{104325}Why does nobody listen|to a word I say?
{104329}{104387}Arlene, aren't you coming?
{104391}{104473}Oh, you're invited, are you?|Okay, bye-bye.
{104477}{104538}Oh, no, excuse me.|Go ahead.
{104559}{104607}You know, what am I?|I'm just the...
{104611}{104702}... editor in chief. Whatever.
{104706}{104809}We've gotta go to 23rd, please,|between 5th and 6th.
{104813}{104897}- It's 29 West 23rd.|- You got it, lady.
{104901}{104964}The new and improved "Poise"|will explore the last frontier.
{104964}{105030}The new and improved "Poise"|will explore the last frontier.
{105035}{105097}It will go heroin chic one better.
{105101}{105139}It will OD.
{105143}{105210}It will kill.
{105215}{105290}Cause of death? Chicness.
{105295}{105423}The new "Poise" will go farther than|any fashion magazine ever before.
{105427}{105502}It will be deadly serious.
{105506}{105566}Fashion suicide.
{105655}{105705}So, what do you think?
{105954}{105990}Thank you, sir.
{105994}{106060}- How much time do we have?|- We have two minutes. Hurry.
{106209}{106262}Jeez. Such a bitch.
{106490}{106538}I know this is different.
{106542}{106604}I mean, from anything|we've ever done.
{106608}{106720}And I know you might hate it|and think I'm completely crazy.
{106744}{106810}But I won't care, even if I get fired.
{106814}{106929}And I don't mean that disrespectfully,|it's just that I've realized something.
{106982}{107034}Who are these women?
{107038}{107078}Does anyone know?
{107083}{107144}I don't recognize any of them.
{107262}{107311}I wanna see...
{107315}{107390}... my best friend's big sister...
{107436}{107500}... and the girls from the|soccer team.
{107513}{107566}My next-door neighbor.
{107570}{107650}Real women who are smart and pretty|and happy to be who they are.
{107654}{107712}These are the women|to look up to.
{107829}{107905}Let's put life back|into the magazine.
{107931}{108020}And fun and laughter and silliness.
{108050}{108168}I think we all-- I think all of us|wanna feel something...
{108194}{108274}... that we've forgotten|or turned our backs on.
{108295}{108398}Because maybe we didn't realize|how much we were leaving behind.
{108554}{108632}We need to remember|what used to be good.
{108802}{108848}If we don't...
{108852}{108947}... we won't recognize it|even if it hits us between the eyes.
{109030}{109074}I just....
{109151}{109210}Bravo!
{109310}{109369}Brilliant.
{109416}{109524}We will present this to corporate|first thing tomorrow morning.
{109635}{109725}- So who's this mystery photographer?|- Matt Flamhaff.
{109729}{109775}Is he Arthur or Martha?
{109779}{109819}Matt. He's Matt.
{109823}{109908}No, no. Is he gay?
{109912}{109969}Are you gay?
{111655}{111702}{y:i}- City and listing?|- Manhattan.
{111706}{111780}"Sparkle" magazine on Park Avenue.
{111802}{111866}- Sparkle magazine.|- Trish Sackett, please.
{112182}{112284}Jenna, I'm sorry to barge in on you like|this, but I really have to talk to you--
{112288}{112349}Hey, Beaver.
{112353}{112417}I mean Matt. I'm sorry.
{112421}{112458}Old habits die hard, you know.
{112462}{112492}Fine. Is Jenna around?
{112496}{112577}Are you here about your photos?
{112595}{112659}No, actually, I'm not.
{112663}{112713}I guess I should just tell you...
{112717}{112795}... that Jenna's decided to go|in a different direction...
{112799}{112900}... with a more established|photographer.
{112904}{113041}She's gonna use the guy who shoots|the official photos of her sweetie pie.
{113045}{113133}So don't take it personally,|because there's just a little bias.
{113137}{113222}I'm sorry to be so honest|with you, because...
{113226}{113290}... I think your pictures|are really cute.
{113294}{113336}It was nice talking to you.
{113340}{113430}Hey, Matt. While I've got you here,|do you wanna sign a general release?
{113434}{113489}Maybe we can use your|pictures in a catalog.
{113493}{113536}Fine.
{115027}{115058}Hi.
{115062}{115137}- Jenny, right?|- Jenna.
{115162}{115191}I was looking for Matt.
{115195}{115276}I wanted to tell him some really great|news about his photographs.
{115280}{115310}Everybody loved them.
{115314}{115402}That's great. I'll tell him when he gets|back. He's out getting his tux.
{115407}{115474}- His tux?|- I know. Men.
{115479}{115520}Everything's the last minute.
{115524}{115581}I mean, hello. We're getting|married tomorrow.
{115585}{115691}This'll be the cutest little backyard|wedding since I don't know when.
{115695}{115766}- Congratulations.|- Thanks. I'll tell Matt you stopped by.
{115770}{115822}- Okay.|- Bye.
{116060}{116164}We wanna feel something|again that we've forgotten.
{116168}{116250}Because we didn't stop to notice|how much we were leaving behind.
{116270}{116350}We need to remember|what used to be good.
{116446}{116476}You ready?
{116526}{116571}The meeting's cancelled, Jenna.
{116575}{116614}What, until tomorrow?
{116619}{116654}It's over.
{116693}{116732}It's over?
{116762}{116808}Lucy....
{116812}{116889}She took all your designs|to "Sparkle". Everything.
{116893}{116942}She's their new editor in chief.
{116947}{117008}Your photos showed up|in "Sparkle Online" last night.
{117012}{117054}They're in outdoor ads everywhere.
{117058}{117110}She can't take Matt's pictures.|Those belong to us.
{117114}{117191}- She can't do it!|- She can, and she is.
{117195}{117255}She got him to sign this.
{117411}{117449}Lucy, you stole Matt's pictures.
{117462}{117540}Oh, which one do you wanna be|today, the pot or the kettle?
{117544}{117594}If you don't mind,|I'd like to be the pot.
{117599}{117671}Maybe the kettle. It doesn't really|matter. They're both black.
{117675}{117760}- What are you talking about?|- I found this in your office yesterday.
{117764}{117823}Does it look familiar?|It has your name on it.
{117827}{117902}- You went through my things?|- Oh, give me a break.
{117907}{117970}How horrible. How terrible.|I can't believe I did it.
{117975}{118009}What is this?
{118013}{118086}You can wipe off the "Bambi|watching her mother get shot...
{118090}{118159}... and strapped to the back of|a van" look from your face.
{118163}{118213}I talked to Trish Sackett yesterday.
{118217}{118291}It's okay, Jenna. I know all|about your little deal.
{118295}{118343}It's a sweet little deal, actually.
{118347}{118412}Editor in chief if you help them|hit a million copies?
{118416}{118461}- So you'd give them tips.|- Oh, my God.
{118465}{118559}Not bad. I just wish I would|have thought of it.
{118563}{118629}- Oh, no.|- Oh, yes.
{118633}{118709}Only, now I'm taking your job,|you stay here with the magazine...
{118713}{118763}... you single-handedly flushed|down the toilet.
{118775}{118811}What about Matt?
{118815}{118872}Why did he sign this?|What did you say to him?
{118876}{118928}Let's see. I think that I told him...
{118932}{119002}... you had decided to go|in a different direction.
{119011}{119053}Which you are now.
{119103}{119224}I might have told him something else,|too, but I just can't remember.
{120964}{121055}George Washington Bridge,|New Jersey.
{121325}{121357}Jenna.
{121361}{121430}- Jenna Rink.|- Yeah?
{121434}{121491}Chris Grandy.
{121495}{121546}So, what are you doing?|Are you married?
{121550}{121637}Because if you're single,|I definitely want a number.
{121641}{121672}We could get together.
{121676}{121717}I'm still living at home--
{121721}{121770}- Come on, Grandy! Come on.|- Holy Christ!
{121775}{121878}This is the tune we first|tangled tongues to.
{121882}{121938}What's the dude who sings this?
{121942}{122021}- Rick Springsteen.|- It's Springfield, Grandy.
{122025}{122065}I'm out of here.
{122069}{122152}I thought you wanted my number.
{122740}{122786}I'll take these.
{122833}{122867}Good afternoon.
{122920}{122950}You remember, Wayne.
{122955}{123042}It was with the Flamhaffs|at San Ysidro Ranch.
{123046}{123111}San Ysidro Ranch.
{123127}{123234}It's so pretty. It's perfect.|It looks great.
{123583}{123636}Hi.
{123640}{123678}Hey.
{123817}{123911}I don't know what Lucy said to you|about me, but I want you to know...
{123915}{123984}... that whoever that was she|was talking about...
{124003}{124052}... wasn't me.
{124116}{124156}It doesn't matter what Lucy said.
{124160}{124251}I stopped trusting her after she stole|my Pop Rocks in the third grade.
{124296}{124337}Matt.
{124384}{124514}I am not the awful person|that I know that I was.
{124518}{124572}I don't even know that person.
{124608}{124671}And I'd like to believe....
{124675}{124764}I have to believe|that if you knew that...
{124768}{124866}... if in your heart, you really,|really knew that...
{124893}{124958}... you wouldn't be getting ready|to marry someone now.
{124963}{125051}Unless that someone were me.
{125351}{125442}Jenna, I'm not gonna lie to you.
{125503}{125563}I have felt things...
{125567}{125622}... these past few weeks...
{125650}{125729}... that I didn't know I could|feel anymore.
{125752}{125847}But I have realized|in these past few days...
{125896}{125974}... you can't just turn back time.
{126011}{126068}Why not?
{126072}{126111}I moved on.
{126115}{126149}You moved on.
{126157}{126235}We've gone down different paths|for so long.
{126239}{126304}We made choices.
{126308}{126376}I chose Wendy.
{126420}{126487}That's her family down there.
{126502}{126565}We care about each other,|you know?
{126610}{126718}You don't always get the dream|house, but you get awfully close.
{126812}{126868}Please don't cry, Jenna.
{126872}{126942}Oh, I'll be fine, I promise.
{127670}{127718}Matty, can I have it?
{127723}{127762}Please?
{127767}{127822}- You're not gonna whip it at me?|- No.
{128006}{128085}Look, I won't have you be late.|Just go.
{128096}{128179}Go on. I'm fine. I'm just crying|because I'm happy.
{128183}{128257}I want you to be so, so happy.
{128318}{128369}I love you, Matt.
{128449}{128492}You're my best friend.
{128555}{128607}Jenna, I....
{128635}{128696}I've always loved you.
{131631}{131702}Jenna's waiting for you in the closet.
{131967}{132011}Matty.
{132178}{132232}You really know what you're doing.
{132246}{132299}Come on.
{132327}{132392}- Sorry, I forgot my scarf.|- You know what?
{132396}{132496}You can be the pot and kettle|all by yourself from now on, biatch.
{132500}{132535}Come on, Matt.
{132539}{132592}- What did you call me?|- We're gonna be late.
{132596}{132641}- For what?|- You'll see.
{133924}{133970}A Razzle, Mr. Flamhaff?
{133974}{134030}Thank you, Mrs. Flamhaff.
From a secret island in the South Pacific... the courageous Tracy family run an organization called...
International Rescue.
When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world... they are always first on the scene.
They go by the name they gave their incredible machines.
The Thunderbirds.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Thunderbirds are go!
But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.
Gentlemen, we all know that A squared plus B squared equals?
- C squared.
- C squared. That's right. À But...
What happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's
E, F, and...
Mr. Tracy?
Alan.
Alan!
- How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan.
I trust re-entry wasn't too rough?
Here on Earth, we've been discussing the Pythagorean Theorem.
Did any of that happen to sink in?
I was just...
Apparently not.
Thunderbirds are... go.
I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan.
Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back.
That should keep you busy.
"That should keep you busy."
- You can take 10,000 words À and stick them up...
- Alan!
-  Headmaster.
- Mr. Tracy
Ms. Garrett.
You gotta be more careful, Alan.
Why can't I tell them
I'm a Thunderbird, Fermat?
Because technically you're not yet.
And if your identity was discovered, it'd-d-d...
- it could be very bad.
- I know, I know.
It's the Thunderbirds!
They're gonna be on TV.
- Let's go, À they're gonna be on TV!
- Whoa, whoa, where are they?
- They're in Russia, À at an oil rig fire!
- Great!
I'm stuck at school and my brothers are on a cool mission.
We are told the super rig is now in danger of total collapse.
And there is real concern for the lives of six men who remain trapped on board.
An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes ago.
They should be here any moment now.
And here they are!
Thunderbird 2, this is Thunderbird 1.
I have visual south column.
They're trapped on an inspection platform.
FAB, we'll take it from here.
Come on!
Come on!
- Scott, get out of there! À That tower's coming down!
- Got it!
Thunderbird 1, any damage?
Negative, Dad.
Come on, come on.
Swing around. You can't get close enough taking that approach angle.
Approach angle is no good.
I'm gonna have to swing her around.
Watch for wind shear,
Thunderbird 2.
I was watching for wind shear when you were still wearing diapers.
Come on, Dad.
Whoa, hold on!
Who needs diapers now, Dad?
- What'll they do now?
- Drop the rescue platform À from Thunderbird 2.
Open them up.  Here we go.
Rescue platform's on it's way.
Virgil, how's it going?
It's looking good, Dad.
Come on, jump!
Okay, I've got a visual.
Hold it there.
Targets locked.
Firing rescue lines.
Come on, hook them up!
We gotta get you out of here!
- Let's haul them out of there.
- Commencing reverse thrust.
Okay, let's bring them home.
Look out!
Gotta get them out fast.
The rig's gonna blow.
- Hang on!
- Whoa!
Whoa, sorry, boys.
Hold on tight, here we go!
Come on, Virgil.
-  Hold on, guys!
-  How are you doing, son?
Never better!
Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure.
FAB, Thunderbird 2.
Lining up target.
Fire.
Yee-ha!
- Bull's-eye!
Outstanding shot.
All right, boys.
Let's take these babies home.
The fire has been extinguished.
The rocket fired from
Thunderbird 1 has robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn.
Amazing.
The Thunderbirds have done it again, Chuck.
That was great work, Lisa.
Thanks a lot.
Ooo, I wish I could be a Thunderbird one day.
- Thunder-turd.
- Ooo.
- That's another
À good one, diaper boy.
Tracy!
There's someone here for you.
Hello, boys.
Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service.
Alan, darling.
Your father's been detained and he's asked me to pick you up.
- Is that all right?
- Sure beats the bus.
- Definitely.
- Fantastic.
Now, will any of these gorgeous young things be joining you?
Me! Me!
Just Fermat.
Quite right.
Lady Penelope, why are you in America?
- Are you on a mission À for my father?
- Alan, shh.
I am an undercover agent, so please try to be discreet.
Here we are.
- Hi, Parker.
- Good afternoon to you, À Master Hackenbacker.
- Ow!
- Hi, Nosey.
- Less of that attitude
À or I shall be obliged
- to deliver À the Parker Haymaker.
- Okay, bring it on, big guy.
Try not to run over any children, Parker.
Very good, m'lady.
Come on, Parker, chop-chop.
- All right! Yes!
- FermatWhoa!
Yeah.
Oh, look, Parker.
Pink is the new black this season.
I'm very glad to hear it, m'lady.
And hemlines are going up.
That is good news, m'lady.
And apparently England won the football last night.
- Yes!   Eng-er-land!
- Whoa!
Calm down, Parker.
Yes, m'lady.
Sorry, m'lady.
Come on, baby.
Out you jump.
Wait till your father hears about this.
Panhead!
Aliens!
Even better!
It's the Thunderbirds!
Okay, lock it up.
Okay, people, let's move it.
Let's go, let's move it.
- Hey, we need some help over here.
- Here you are, come down.
Mission complete.
Thunderbird 1.
We are good to go.
Fab.
Tracking device activated.
Ah, the chariot of the Gods.
Having dallied with the mortals, they return to Olympus.
And so I follow.
Pardon me, m'lady, approaching Tracy Island.
- Radar indicates
À we have some company.
Now that's showing off.
I wish that was me.
I'm about to run post-flight checks, Mr. Tracy.
Anything I sh-sh-sh... anything you want to tell me?
Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2 followed by illumination of the #5 engine-out light.
Okay, I'll ch-ch... study the flight data in the guidance processor.
- Dad!
- Alan!
- Let me look at you. À Oh, man.
- Pop!
- Uh-oh, look out.
- Hey, sprout!
- Hey buddy!
- Dinner's ready. À Come and get it.
Onaha, it smells delicious and I'm starved.
So, Dad, I saw the mission on TV.
It looked pretty dangerous.
Saving lives is a dangerous business, but it's what we do.
Do you think the fire was causing thermal updrafts?
Whoa, enough shop-talk.
I want to hear about school.
School's boring.
Plus, I've been thinking,
Maybe I could be home educated now.
That way I could sit in on missions from time to time. What do you think?
No shortcuts, Alan.
No school, no rockets.
Say, why aren't you wearing your retainer?
I'm getting this reading telling me the wind is blowing
60 knots right up my keister.
- No kidding.
- Did you try readjusting À the flaps?
That's the first thing I did.
It's not my first day on a Thunderbird.
- Try and keep up.
- Don't you have homework to do?
Unless he's blown up this school like the last one.
- Keep Alan away from the ships, he's a hazard.
- Enough. Pass the salad.
- No thanks. Haven't seen that much fire since that volcano in Fiji.
That wasn't Fiji, that was Istanbul.
N o,
Istanbulas the earthquake.
Nothing compares to Argentina.
Dad, I'm not really hungry.
Come on, Fermat, let's go.
But... you...
I'm not done.
Okay.
Kyrano, have you seen Lady P?
- By the pool.
- Of course.
Parker.
We're not suppose to go in there.
We could get in trouble.
Where did you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway?
Fermat, my friend, what you don't know can't hurt you.
I'll be right there.
It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident.
- Any suspects?
- Not yet, but I'll keep À you posted.
- Thanks for À bringing Alan home.
- My pleasure.
Any excuse to visit paradise.
- Tintin!
- Hey, Mr. Tracy.
Hello, Tintin.
- Good evening, Lady Penelope.
- Did you know Alan's home?
- Alan's back?
I mean...
Oh, Alan's back.
Hey, Dad.
When are those two gonna get along?
When Tintin decides the time is right.
Girls are always ahead of boys with that sort of thing.
- What sort of thing?
- Romance.
Alan and Tintin?
- I didn't see À that one coming.
- No, you wouldn't.
- Have a safe À flight home, Penny.
- Thanks, Jeff.
Okay, Fermat, run pre-flight checks.
Right.
Hydraulic systems are green.
- Commence main engine sequence.
- FAB, Alan.
Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.
No, wait, Alan!
À That's the... wrong switch!
- Warning.
- Engine sequence breach.
- Oh, God. Warning.
Engine sequence breach.
- Can't this day À get any worse?
- Alan, my office, now!
It just did.
I can't believe it.
We are so busted.
Look at this.
What is it?
Looks like some sort of... gallium electrolyte compound.
Gotta get out of here.
I know you're mad, I shouldn't have been in the ship, but if you...
You're damn right you shouldn't have been in there!
- But nothing happened. À I had it under control.
- Under control?
Do you have any idea the importance of secrecy in our operation?
You fired up a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield.
You put everyone in danger when you act selfishly.
You want to be part of the team, you have to play by the rules.
You understand?
Do you?!
- Yeah, I understand.
I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird.
You don't want me to do anything!
You won't listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something important!
I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break.
- But, Dad!
- Bottom line, Alan!
You need to grow up.
Then let me.
Please.
Hey, John, just about to turn in.
What can I do for you?
I could sure use a pizza.
You know a place that delivers?
30 minutes or it's free, right?
Anything else on your mind?
Well, we've got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore.
What's happening on planet Tracy?
Alan's home for spring break.
Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region.
Teenagers.
Well, we've all been there.
- Dad, you've done a great À job since Mom died.
- Thanks, John.
Keep an eye on that typhoon for us.
I'll call Vladivostok and see if they need any help with that fire.
FAB, Dad.
Sleep tight.
- Morning, Dad.
- Hey, son.
There's something
I'd like to sh-sh-sh...
Here, take a look.
The neural-net control system?
It's great to have you back.
I bet you didn't think spring break was gonna be this wo-wo... fun.
Watch this?
And the tiny phone lifts up.
Perfect.
Dad, it...
N-n-n... almost perfect.
There's something I wanted to talk to you about, Dad.
Oh, right.  Oh.
Oh.  Okay, right.
You're having problems with a g-g-g... chi-chi-chi... wo-wo... female?
N-n-no.
No.
Alan and I found some sort of... gallium compound on the nose-cone of Thunderbird 1.
We should check that out st-st-st... immediately.
Oh, that'd be gr-gr... swell!
The island is in sight.
Transom, I need you.
Yes, sir.
Sir, our cloaking device has evaded their detection systems.
We have a positive visual from the tracking solution on Thunderbird 1.
- Mullion?
- Sir?
Sir, armed and ready.
Shall I target the main structure?
Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine?
One of the principal tenets of Eastern martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.
This is ridiculous.
It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island.
On the other hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.
The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue.
All we need to do is give them a victim.
- Commence targeting.
- Straightaway, sir.
Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked.
Fire.
Red alert.
What the?
Warning.
Impact imminent.
Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island.
Mayday.
Mayday!
Red alert.
Red alert.
Switching to command and control center.
How bad, Brains?
Thunderbird 5, major damage sustained.
Possible m-m-m... possible strike by a m-m-m...
- Meteor?
-  Yup.
Thunderbirds are go!
- Check retros.
- Go.
Guidance systems green.
Go to maximum thrust.
There goes the cavalry.
But who will rescue the rescuers?
Alan!  Tintin!
Thunderbird 5 has been hit!
- Thunderbird 5 has been hit!
- Okay, okay.  Don't panic!
On the other hand...
Run!
- We made land.
- Cut them off.
Activating communications blackout.
Warning. Intruder alert.
-  Communications failure.
- What the h-h-h...
-  Warning.  Intruder alert.
-... devil is going on?
Communications failure.
- Mr. Tracy, do you copy?
- Warning. Intruder alert.
- Thunderbird 3, please À respond.
How'd they find the island?
Do you think it was what I did in Thunderbird 1?
- Do you think À I ruined everything?
- No.
That compound we found could have some sort of transmitting capability.
We have to do something.
My dad's in the control room, but how do we get there now?
The vents.
Let's go!
We have to get a message to my dad.
-  Emergency power to 10%.
- I'm losing all power.
-  Emergency power to 10%.
- Repeat.
-  I'm losing all power.
- Hold on, we're coming in.
- Gordon, prepare for immediate docking.
- You got it, Dad.
Reverse main thrusters on my mark.
Three, two,
- one.
- Easy, watch the roll.
Roll index angle minus two degrees.
Initiate docking sequence.
- We're locked on.
-  Nice work.
Docking sequence complete.
- Tunnel hatch secured.
Emergency packs, boys.
Let's move!
-  Air lock pressure equalized.
- We're in.  Let's go!
John!
- Scott, tackle that fire.
- Okay.
- Am I glad to see you guys.
- Easy, you're hurt.
Virgil, take care of your brother.
Gordon, give me a damage assessment.
Come on, hurry.
One-inch steel plate.
With sequential titanium locking mechanism.
I love a challenge.
Watch out for the guards.
Get in! Get in!
Who-who-who-who...
- What's going on?
- So this is Mount Olympus.
And these are the Thunderbirds.
I should have guessed.
Jeff Tracy.
The billionaire ex-astronaut, of course.
Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident?
Avalanche, wasn't it?
How tragic.
Just keep going straight ahead.
Okay.
Professor Hackenbacker?
We met at last year's international conference on nanotechnology.
I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely...
- stimulating.
- Transom, concentrate.
Sorry, sir.
The command control switch is here.
Fingerprint recognition system.
Professor.
Please.
- Activate À the control switch.
- N-n-n-n... you must be kidding.
You and I share an interest in the science of the mind.
The difference is I was born with my powers.
Trust me when I tell you you've barely touched the surface.
Even the strongest minds can be broken.
It would be a pity to break yours.
Fu-fu-fu... no way.
Activate the control switch, Prof.
Like a puppet on a string.
Activating command and control.
Activating command and control.
- We have control.
- Get up.
Sorry, Professor.
Nothing personal.
We got a caution and warning light on our EPS system!
Attempt manual override!
No, that's negative!
That's it.
Okay, this one.
Back to Thunderbird 3, now.
John, we gotta move.
The locking mechanism's jammed!
Attention Thunderbird 5. You can see I've taken over your facilities.
You no longer control your operational systems.
They've taken over.
Warm them up,
Transom.
Increasing temperature to maximum.
- Who's the bald freak?
- You.
Dad!
They've got my dad.
Okay, you have our attention.
Who are you?
What do you want?
Oh, how rude of me.
You can call me "The Hood."
Now, listen, Mr. Tracy, we won't be negotiating.
I'm going to use the Thunderbirds to rob the largest banks in the world starting with the Bank of London.
The world's monetary system will be in chaos and the Thunderbirds held responsible.
You'll never get away with it!
- Why the Thunderbirds?
- An eye À for an eye, Mr. Tracy.
An eye for an eye?
Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother, Kyrano.
I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy.
I thought he was dead.
Take them away.
Yes, sir.
Whoa.
That makes The Hood my uncle?
Every family has a black sh-sh... black sh...
This vent's murdering my allergies.
You left me to die that day.
You may have broken my body, but you have no idea how powerful my mind has become.
Now you will suffer, as I suffered, waiting for a rescue that will never come.
Wait!
Scott, status report.
CO-2 levels are rising.
Wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air.
How long will that give us?
About four hours.
Someone's there.
Time to go.
- Ow!
Run, run!
No, jump.
We can get through to the silos.
Apparently the island is not as secure as you thought.
Children?
Did you find any children?
Here they are.
Thunderbird 2 silo, in the loading arm.
Seal them in.
Hold on!
Whoa!
- The doors, you guys. À Let's go, come on!
- Go, go!
This way.
- No!
- They've got us trapped. À What do we do now?
If we can get to Thunderbird 1's silo, we can escape through the service tunnel.
But we need a plan.
- I'll use
À the Thunderizer on the door.
- Elevator active.
- You guys get the goons À with the firefly.
This equipment is only to be used in an emergency.
- I guess this qualifies.
- Yeah.
Here they come!
Fermat, can you drive this thing?
Uh... no.
Hey watch it!
I took microbiology, not driver's ed.
- Set the pressure À to maximum.
- Got it.
Retreat!
Whoo!
Let's move it!
That's it.
Time to thunderize.
Yes!
Come on, let's go!
Get them!
- Where's Fermat?
- Fermat!
- Fermat!  Hurry up!
- Coming!
- What were you doing À back there, Fermat?
- I had an n-n... idea.
Just try and keep up, okay.
I'll open the tunnel.
We gotta keep moving.
Access denied.
- Go back, yell when you À see them coming.
Access denied.
Alan.
You can run if you want.
Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me?
It is frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect.
But perhaps you already suspected that about your father.
Why did he build these magnificent machines?
Do you suppose it was guilt?
Because he let your mother die.
Open the door, Alan.
Open the door.
We can't go this way!
He's there!
No!
Ow. What are we gonna do, Alan?
I don't know.
I'm thinking, okay?
Keep backing up.
I've got an idea.
- That's your idea?
- It's not me you're angry À at, Alan.
It's not you
I'm aiming at.
Get them!
Transom, fire up
Thunderbird 1.
And set to broil.
- No sign of them.
-  Of course not.
The little brats went up like firecrackers.
Pop. Pop. Pop.
Don't... give him the satisfaction,
Professor.
This has taken too long.
Pick out the equipment you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 2.
- No more delays.
- Yes, sir.
How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that?
Relax, it's just a little water.
I could have d-drowned.
You mean you can't swim?
I repeat, I could have d-drowned.
I said I was sorry,
Fermat.
Let's just put this behind us, okay?
We gotta watch each other's backs.
- Nice drawers.
- Thank you
- Boo!
- Ah!
- Come on, stay there.
- You're worse than À a couple of girls.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Those are nice drawers.
Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5
- via satellite, right?
- Right.
So there's a minuscule possibility that if we reach the island's satellite station we could...
- Blow it up.
- No, we could hack into it and give control back to Thunderbird 5.
- Good thinking, Fermat. À Let's do it.
- Thank you.
Here's the plan.
We're here, right?
So we go along the shore, around the mountain to the access road here.
Then up to the transmitter.
So what do you think?
Good, except we're here, not there.
And the transmitter is there, not here.
We have to go through the jungle.
But that's f-f... off limits.
It's gonna be dangerous.
I'm in.
We gotta get up there fast.
Our folks are in trouble and if
The Hood gets off the island...
He's not going anywhere for now.
It's the guidance processor from Thunderbird 2.
It can't take off without it.
You're a genius.
How did you get this?
Alan, my friend, what you don't know can't hurt you.
Parker?
- M'lady?
We have an emergency.
What a charming fellow.
Come in.
Have a look at this,
Parker.
He, and this woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.
Sounds like an alias to me, m'lady.
Quite right,
Parker.
Real name
Trangh Belagant.
Assumed dead when his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of Malaya.
Oh, perfect, Parker.
The Thunderbirds rescued over
500 mineworkers in the collapse.
Including
Mr. Belagant's brother.
M'lady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, Kyrano.
How's my schedule for today, Parker?
You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough, a benefit gala for the Institute of the Blind, and incidentally, there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.
- I suppose that's urgent?
-  Yes, m'lady.
There's also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta.
- The Thunderbirds À still haven't responded?
- No, m'lady.
And the media is awash in speculation vis... vis their whereabouts.
Over to Lisa Lowe.
Chuck, disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds.
Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands have been left homeless by a volcano in Jakarta.
Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible machines to carry out...
I think it's time to send the emergency signal.
I fear you are not wrong, m'lady.
Lisa Lowe.
Back to you, Chuck.
I'm telling you, Fermat, it was like The Hood was inside my head back there.
What do you mean, Alan?
Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something.
Don't be silly,
Alan.
Everything can be explained by science.
I'm trying to figure out his weakness.
Everybody has an Achilles' heel.
Well my Achilles' heel is actually my Achilles' heel.
It's got a blister the size of a basketball.
Tintin!
- Can we s-s-s...
- Stop?
- Yes.
- No.
Okay.
No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat.
- Any word?À
- Nothing, m'lady.
Right, tell Lord Marlborough
I've broken my shooting arm.
We shall send the Institute of the Blind a dozen guide dogs.
And bring the car around.
Yes, m'lady.
The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble and I don't like that.
Let's go, Parker.
Ready for launch.
We'll use this to get into the vaults.
Subtle as usual, Mullion.
Didn't realize we'd be getting points for style.
We're robbing banks, remember?
Don't worry, you'll get your money.
Transom, initiate pre-flight diagnostics.
What's going on?
Guidance processor error.
- It's the guidance processor.
What's wrong with it?
There isn't one.
Clever Alan.
- It's the children. À They have it.
- No way.
They're dead. No one could live through something like that.
I did.
Get them, Mullion.
Take whatever you need.
Make sure you get the guidance processor before you lose your temper.
Alan, don't you think
Tintin is blossoming?
Blossoming?!
What's that suppose to mean?
Come on, Alan.
You have a c-c... crush on her.
You gotta be kidding.
I mean she's... she's not that bad,
I guess.
Okay, guys, take five.
Five isn't gonna do it.
Guys?
Don't move.
What is it?
Androctonus scorpion.
Is that dangerous?
.025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
So, "dangerous" is, in fact, an understatement.
Watch out!
- Tintin, what was that?
- Let's get going.
Hey!
She has the same powers as her uncle, The Hood.
- You think?
- Must run in the family.
Did you do that?
- Just drop it, okay?
Still think everything can be explained by science?
Not girls.
Whoa!
- Scott, Gordon. À You all right?
- We're okay.
- The heat À exchanger's blown.
- You don't say.
Come on, those brats are in here somewhere.
How are we doing,
Fermat?
Don't rush me, Alan.
This is very delicate equipment.
Which is now b-broken.
- Can you fix it?
- Y-y... maybe but,
I'll need something to solder with.
We're in the middle of nowhere, Fermat.
We are you gonna find something like that?
What?
Ow!
Perfect.
Gee, Alan, I never would have figured you for a cry-baby.
- I'm gonna kill you.
- What did he say?
I think it was some sort of apology.
Hmm.
That's...
I got it, yes!
You're the man, Fermat.
Okay, the first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird 5.
- Dad!
- It's Alan.
Dad! - Alan, where are you?
À Are you safe?
I'm at the relay station with Fermat and Tintin.
Fermat's gonna hack into the main computer system and give control back to you.
-  We're standing by.
- Okay, we're almost there.
Goodness me, Professor.
You're so good-looking without your glasses on.
I think you may find that's another thing we have in common.
Pretty?
Unauthorized transmission.
- Oh, now, that's not fair.
Just when things were starting to sizzle.
Unauthorized transmission.
A burst of transmission from the island satellite station.
- Should I jam it?
- And give Mullion À the co-ordinates.
Take the main track south east then head up Satellite Hill.
They're on to us!
We're being jammed!
- Can you finish?
- I'll try.
- Alan, what's happening?
- Hang in there, Dad. À One more minute!
It's not going to work. The signal's too weak for data transmission.
Can you hear me?
They're jamming our signal.
We're gonna lose you.
Don't worry, I'll take care of everything.
Negative.
It's too dangerous.
Follow emergency procedure.
Wait for Lady Penelope at the rendezvous point.
Can you read me?
Alan!
- Dad!
- Alan, we're losing you!
- Alan!
Dad!
- No!
- Useless!
- It is now.
- I'm sorry, Alan.
This is hard on all of us.
No, it's okay.
I'm fine.
You don't have to be such a tough guy, Alan.
I'm worried about my dad, too.
I'd do anything to be with my parents right now.
But The Hood knows we're alive now.
We have to go.
Even worse.
They know exactly...
Where we are!
Come on!
Great, more water!
Tintin, can you slow them down?
- I'd be delighted.
- Then do it and meet us À at the junkyard.
Come on, Fermat.
This will get us outta here.
There.
Come on.
Straight ahead.
Ah!
It's gonna make this thing hard to control.
- Be careful not to exceed À four bars of boost or else...
- I said no problem.
- We gotta get out À of here. What's this?
- It's a hoversled.
It's our ticket out of here, unless you've got a better idea.
- Let's wait for Lady Penelope À like your dad said.
- Here.
Great plan. Let's sit here and wait to get caught.
I say we have to do something.
Now.
Right Fermat?
Actually,
I agree with Tintin.
I don't think this is s-safe.
You don't think anything is s-s-s-safe.
Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean that I'm wrong.
If we're a team, we should make decisions as a team.
Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote or do you want to get out of here?
'Cause I'm going.
You can be a real jerk sometimes.
Go!
Oh, no!
Come on, faster!
Alan, you're going to fast!
I need more speed to get him by the trees.
Hang on!
What did I tell you guys?
Oh, no.
What are you doing?
Oh, no, not the fridge.
- Tintin!
- Hey, son.
- Sweetheart, are you okay?
- I'm fine, Dad.
Cool off, kid.
Tracy Island approaching.
Switching to aqua mode.
Isn't life fun sometimes?
Rib-tickling, m'lady.
What is it?
We have an unidentified craft approaching the island at high speed.
Lady P.
Whew, somebody roll down a window, it's getting a little hot in here.
Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes.
- Oxygen's out in 30, À so we won't feel a thing.
- Stop it!
Come on, Dad.
Situation's hopeless.
No, there's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us.
Alan?
He's just a kid.
He's a Tracy.
- This doesn't look good.
- No, m'lady.
That bougainvillea is absolutely parched and someone should do something about that hideous hammock.
Whom do we have here?
Mullion!
I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tai kwan do.
- And I know Parker.
- M'lady.
- You've broken my nose.
- Yes, that was the intention À of the maneuver.
- Whoa!
- One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual slash conversational level, but sometimes it's just not possible.
Ow!  Oh!
Shall I bring the car around, m'lady?
Parker, have a bit of a lie down.
Excuse me, m'lady.
Ah.
Lady Penelope.
Of course. He has his palace, why not his princess?
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs these days?
Ow!
Boo!
Coming through, m'lady!
Duck, m'lady!
He's weak.
Using his power makes him weak.
Whoa!
You're a formidable opponent.
More than a match for most men.
That's not saying much, then, is it?
I suggest you let us pass.
Don't try your parlor games on me, you sad little man.
You've committed a serious crime trespassing on this island and in about four seconds,
I'm going to get quite cross with you.
How are you, Alan?
I hope you don't think
I'm going to chase you.
You can make it stop, Alan!
You have something
À that belongs to me.
Really, sir, don't mind me.
This isn't the first time
I've been pulverized.
And it's never did any real harm before.
- Ow!
- Stop, I'll give it to you.
Fetch!
You made a match of it.
I'll give you that.
Put them with the others.
You're coming with me.
Put me down!
This outfit is couture.
Don't go to sleep.
John, look at me.
Keep your eyes open.
- You need to cool off, lady.
- Lady Penelope.
Big oaf!
Right, that's quite enough losing for one day.
How does it feel to be right all the time?
Not bad, actually.
I'm so sorry, Fermat.
We make quite a pair.
It's hard for me to t-t-talk.
It's hard for you to l-l-listen.
Parker, I have an idea.
Excellent, m'lady.
Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have?
I can't think.
I'm too c-cold.
Guidance processor installed.
- The guidance processor À has been installed.
- Engine sequence complete.
Thunderbird 2 is ready for takeoff.
Begin launch sequence.
- What is our ETA?
- Under an hour.
Bank of London, here we come.
Thunderbird 2 preparing for takeoff.
We gotta be quick,
The Hood's getting away.
- In position, m'lady.
- Here we go.
Launch sequence, stage two.
- Yes.
- Good shot, m'lady.
Come on, Parker.
Let's give those bad guys a good trashing.
Hydraulic systems green.
Guidance systems green.
Launch sequence, stage three.
This seems to be a straight forward six lever mortise.
- I love it when your checkered past comes in handy.
- Thank you, m'lady.
Unfortunately, I feel I shall need a piece of wire to access the mechanism.
Will this suffice, Parker?
Most certainly, m'lady.
I didn't actually need it anyway.
Of course not, m'lady.
- Quick, they're getting away.
- Okay, everyone get to À the control room.
Hat?
Get in there quick, Fermat. and save my family.
Then we'll get The Hood.
Good luck.
Access to mainframe denied.
Looks like they slipped a backdoor key into the access codes.
- I'll follow your lead, son.
- Thunderbird 5, come in.
Thunderbird 5, come in.
How long do they got before re-entry?
90 seconds, and counting.
Access to mainframe confirmed.
Okay, I just need someone on their end to confirm the access protocol.
Thunderbird 5, come in.
Dad, come on, are we coming through?
Mr. Tracy, can you hear me?
Come in.
Thunderbird 5, come in.
- Dad, come on!
- Mr. Tracy, can you here me? À Come in.
-  Dad!
- Thunderbird 5, come in.
- How long do they got?
- 45 seconds until re-entry.
Damn it, Jeff, wake up!
I think that's the first time you've ever called me by my first name, Brains.
Thanks for waking me.
- Dad.
- Alan.
Well done.
Mr. Tracy?
Confirm access protocol.
Confirmed.
We are back on-line.
Gravity is restored.
Put Thunderbird f-f... your craft into geostationary orbit immediately.
- FAB, Brains.
- Geostationary orbit re-established.
Looks like we're good to go.
- Dad, are you all right?
-  We're fine.
We still have a job to do.
Where's The Hood?
He's in Thunderbird 2.
He's headed for L-l-l...
- London.
- She's right.
He's got them all on board.
Looks like Thunderbird 3 lost a booster, Dad.
We'll never get there on time.
Let me go after The Hood.
He'll destroy everything you've built, everything the Thunderbirds stand for.
- Negative.
- I'm sorry, it's too risky.
- I can do this, you know I can.
What am I saying?
We can do this.
Okay, Alan.
We'll meet you there.
- Thunderbirds are go!
- fab.
Okay, boys, we are outta here.
- Are we really going?
- Yep.
Oh, boy.
- Ready, Fermat?
- N-n...
I guess.
Engine sequence activated.
- Flight controls are green.
-  Anti-detection shield...
- Hydraulic systems are good. activated.
Set primary fuel pumps.
Main engine start.
Don't boys just love their toys?
Engine sequence complete.
Launch sequence initiated.
Launch sequence complete.
And off we go.
Get the bridge up!
Get the bridge up!
Thunderbird 1, come in.
- Roger, Brains.
-  Situation update.
Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation.
FAB.
Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London.
I know The Hood's weakness,
Fermat.
I can stop him if we get there in time.
Stand by.
We're going to maximum thrust.
Gordon, heat 'em up.
We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds.
Lisa, are you there?
Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing causing total panic in Central London.
As far as we know, there's been no emergency call from this area.
So it's unclear why Thunderbird
2 would be active here at all.
I don't know if you can see this, but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine.
Set a course for the vault.
Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll severe the monorail's subterranean supports.
- Shall I correct our position?
- Stay on course.
But sir, we'll cause a major disaster.
No we won't.
The Thunderbirds will.
- Get us down, boys.
- Initiate landing, Fermat.
- Right.
- Three-point landing sequence initiated.
Retros to 75.
Flaps 16.
Fab.
Danger.
Landing sequence error.
- You're going too fast!
- Thanks.  Retros to 90.
Textbook, boys.
Activating electromagnetic pulse to disable the bank's security systems.
ETA one minute.
Parker, meet me at the Bank of London.
Yes, m'lady.
Let it out, boys!
- The Hood's getting away.
- Those people can't hold À on much longer.
- What are you gonna do?
- We're the Thunderbirds.
Our duty is to save those people.
Brains, we're going into the accident zone.
FAB,
Thunderbird 2 and good luck.
Brains, the monorail is down!
Repeat!
The monorail is down!
I'm going underwater in Thunderbird 4.
Automatic pilot.
You have the bridge.
- Me? Fly alone?
- Fermat, the Thunderbirds À need you right now.
I need you.
FAB, Alan.
Manual control.
Brains, come in.
What's the situation?
The Hood has caused major disaster with the vault. The mono-ma-mono... one track railway is down in the Themes.
- Where's Thunderbird 1?
- It's on the ground.
The k-k-kids are in Thunderbird 2.
FAB, we're right behind them.
Look at all this gold!
Stay focused.
Nine more banks to go.
Fermat, deploying
Thunderbird 4 in three two... one.
Thunderbird 4 is go.
I can see the monorail.
Mommy!
Don't panic, guys.
Extending magnetic claw.
Fermat, I'll hold the monorail in place.
Can you get a line on that stanchion and lift it?
I can't get a clear fix on the target.
I might hit the passengers.
I'll go and fix it myself.
- What, you mean  swim?
- Get me as close as you can.
How we doing on that line, Fermat?
Just look out your window.
Come on, Tintin.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, Tintin.
You can do this.
Opening the airlock.
Contact magnets activated.
Okay, Fermat.
We need a lift.
FAB, Alan.
Commencing reverse thrust.
That was amazing,
Tintin.
Thank you.
Nice job, Fermat.
Nothing to it, really.
Easy does it.
There they are!
Glad you could finally join us.
Hey, don't get cocky after one mission.
We still have a dangerous situation here.
I need you boys to close down this accident scene.
Tintin, go get Fermat. Meet us at
Thunderbird 1. Alan, come with me.
- Let's clean it up.À - We've got to get to À the Bank of London.
Penelope went after the Hood.
I know, she may need our help.
Ashes to ashes, diamonds to diamonds.
Lady Penelope.
What an unpleasant surprise.
Don't be rude.
I can't tell you what a pleasure it would be to use my little finger to pull this big trigger.
Now don't move!
Mullion.
- That's not cricket!
- I'm sorry.
The only part of the sport
I ever liked was winning.
How ghastly.
Hey Dad.
That stuff the Hood said, about you leaving him to die,
- he was lying, right?
- No.
You see, you can't save everyone, Alan.
It doesn't matter how hard you try, or how brave you are.
It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd give up your life in a second to save.
You just can't save everyone.
What was Mom like?
She was a lot like you.
Come on, we've got a job to do.
- Finish her off, Mullion.
- Shame on you.
I always despise a man who delegates the important jobs.
Oh, dream on, sad act.
- Good timing, Parker.
- Good afternoon, À Mr. Tracy.
- Come with us.
- My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.
The Thunderbirds.
They're here.
Kill them all.
Alan, you guys stay here with Parker.
- I'm gonna find Lady Penelope.
- But what about The Hood?
Look out, Parker!
Master Tracy!
- Look out, Parker!
- All right, that's enough À of that.
Don't move.
Go on, then.
- I'm sorry, I can't hit a lady.
- Allow me.
I've been waiting to get my hands on you little brats.
And I've been waiting to get my hands on you.
Now that was a punch.
Parker, can we wrap this up?
What did you have in mind,
Master Hackenbacker?
Strategically speaking, the best odds of success
- lie with the Parker Haymaker.
- I concur.
Penny!
Jeff, no!
Did you save them all this time, Jeff?
Or did you leave someone behind?
I didn't make you what you are.
It's not me you have to convince.
- You leave my son À out of this.
- Dad!
Dad!  Dad!
I'm disappointed in you, Alan.
I thought we were kindred spirits.
Well, we're not.
I'm Jeff Tracy's son.
- Yes, you certainly are.
- No!
Alan, no!
Alan!
Come here, you little minx!
Oh!  Ah!
Bye, bye.
Alan, stay back.
You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's footsteps.
- Let him go.
- Did you really think À you could challenge me?
- Let him go, please!
- Let him go!
Please, let him go!
PenelopeAlan!  Alan, are you all right?
Alan, get out, run!
He's getting weaker.
- He can't last much longer.
- Neither can you!
Alan, no!
Look out!
Alan!
I'm glad you could be here to see this, Jeff.
Goodbye, Alan.
- No!
- Oh.
Ah.
Oh.
Leave me, Alan.
Leave me to die.
Like your father did.
- I don't want
À to save your life.
- Aah!
- But that's what we do.
See you soon, Jeff.
Now that was definitely showing off.
- Get off me!
- Settle, mate. À You calm down.
- Gordon.
- Nice catch.
- Hey, Scott.
- Get him.
- Jeff, what did you put À in these margaritas?
- A Tracy secret.
That's my boy.
One more week and you're gonna be swimming like a f-f... do-do-do... sha-sha-sha... aquatic creature.
- Good job, Ferm.
- Thanks.
- So what do you think?
- He's getting there.
Whoa, Tintin.
Ah, you just really...
- Blossoming.
- Ew!
- Did you say blossoming?
Gather round, everybody.
I have an announcement to make.
Tonight is a special night.
We're all together, because of three very special people:
Fermat, Tintin,
Alan.
The world needs Thunderbirds.
And the Thunderbirds need you.
- Mr. Tracy.
- Thank you, sir.
Congratulations, Alan.
No shortcuts.
You earned it.
You all did.
I'm not usually an emotional man, but sometimes even the toughest nut must crack.
- Hey, way to go, sprout.
- That's my boy, Alan.
Yes, Madam President.
I see.  Of course.
Straightaway.
Boys!
Sorry, Penny.
Duty calls.
Of course it does.
And quite right, too.
Thunderbirds are go!
Fast as you can, Parker.
Certainly, m'lady.

{4373}{4464}NARRATOR: Our story begins|In difficult times.
{4465}{4524}England is threatened|with war
{4525}{4559}and many men have been asked
{4560}{4615}to leave their families|to protect their country.
{4642}{4706}I'll be home|before you know it. I promise.
{4707}{4784}Now, now. What's all this?
{4785}{4841}I want to go with you.

{5409}{5451}MAN: Drive off
{5783}{5854}NARRATOR: But the war|lasted much longer
{5856}{5908}than anyone|could have imagined.
{5909}{5970}Bombs fell from the sky
{5971}{6066}and tore at the very heart|of London.
{6067}{6130}Don't cry, son.
{6131}{6163}All aboard!
{6164}{6227}NARRATOR: In an effort|to protect its children

{9243}{9296}Is that what it is?
{9297}{9426}For a moment, it sounded|like cannons on a pirate ship.
{9427}{9497}[Gasps] You're right!
{9498}{9547}It's Captain Hook!
{9548}{9577}Uhh!

{10319}{10398}Socks. Two of 'em.
{10399}{10503}Jane, dear, how very practical.
{10504}{10586}Got them a size large|so he can grow into them.

{10898}{10926}Shh! Nanatwo!
{10927}{10972}WENDY: All right, then.
{10973}{11065}How about the time|Peter and the Lost Boys...
{11066}{11164}captured Hook's ship|right from under his nose?
{11165}{11211}DANNY: Ooh That's a good one
{11212}{11276}WENDY: It was late|one misty evening
{11277}{11317}and Hook was sure once again...
{11318}{11362}that he'd found|Peter's hide out.
{11363}{11426}Hook and his blood thirsty crew|went ashore
{11427}{11494}leaving the Jolly Roger|unguarded.
{11495}{11608}That's when Peter Pan arrived
{11609}{11690}He and the Boys|slipped aboard
{11691}{11786}and there they found it--|Hook's remarkable treasure
{11787}{11820}DANNY: Wow
{11821}{11858}WENDY: Peter told|the Lost Boys they'd hide it
{11859}{11937}and Hook would have to hunt|them down to get it back.
{11937}{12020}It was all a great game|for Peter, and then
{12021}{12096}from out of the mist,|he was there--
{12097}{12137}the evil Captain Hook
{12138}{12212}A fierce and ferocious|sword fight was fast underway.
{12213}{12240}[Thunder]
{12241}{12293}Ha ha!

{12482}{12518}DANNY: Tinker Bell
{12519}{12574}WENDY: Yes|And the Jolly Roger
{12575}{12612}Lifted into the sky
{12613}{12684}as Peter and the Boys|escaped with the treasure!

{12713}{12754}[Sputters]
{12755}{12862}Aah! You've not seen|the end of me, Peter Pan!
{12863}{12958}HOOK: I'll get you for this|if it's the last thing I do!
{12959}{13001}WENDY: So you see, Danny
{13001}{13045}Hook will never win...
{13045}{13093}as long as there's faith...

{16946}{17019}They don't mean anything.

{18198}{18321}Wellington's private secretary. They're|waiting for his body to be discovered.
{18327}{18415}- They're trying to kill him.|- We've got to do something!
{18421}{18480}Thank you, Wanda.
{18542}{18677}"Thank you, Wanda." Who does she|think she is? Frigid, stuck-up bitch!
{18683}{18806}If you want to thank me, get your|husband to pay me a decent wage.
{18812}{18896}One more face-lift,|she'll be farting out of her nose!
{18902}{19046}Why haven't they found him yet? I'm|a dirty murderer. I should be punished!
{19141}{19229}- Punish me!|- Oh, I'll punish you.
{19276}{19307}Lance?
{19313}{19366}Call the cops!
{19372}{19514}I was on vacation and he flew me in from|North Carolina to change the channel.
{19520}{19567}Call the cops!
{19636}{19778}Hola! Mamacita! Nueve-uno-uno!|Nueve-uno-uno!
{19810}{19872}- Where's the phone?|- No can do.
{19878}{19997}The phone company doesn't serve|dead people. You need a body!
{20003}{20083}Well, find me another body!
{20089}{20148}I'm not leaving|until I see Mr Wellington.
{20179}{20257}- I'll see what I can do.|- Let him know that I'm here.
{20293}{20340}Mr Sklar, sir?
{20346}{20446}It's Miss Jenkins.|She insists on seeing Mr Wellington.
{20452}{20531}I'm sorry to bust in...|Well, actually, I'm not!
{20537}{20608}That's her! That's the girl.
{20634}{20751}Hey, remember me?|On the bike - run over?
{20757}{20854}No, that's all right.|What can we do for you?
{20860}{20978}- I think that you should be arrested.|- Holy crap!
{20984}{21061}Your plans for the Brooklyn|Community Hospital are criminal.
{21067}{21122}Oh, so you mean that...
{21128}{21228}You throw those words around...|"Arrested." Kind of hit me!
{21234}{21298}That really... ooh!
{21304}{21372}I don't think there's anything funny.
{21378}{21493}It's the only public health facility|in the area, and you just bought it.
{21499}{21615}My uncle went there for a new liver,|they sent his ass to the supermarket.
{21621}{21718}If it goes private, the people|won't have any place to turn.
{21724}{21833}That's awful. You should take it up|with Mr Wellington...
{21839}{21885}I've been there twenty times,
{21891}{21985}I've made 200 phone calls,|and he seems to never be in.
{21991}{22055}So I decided to visit his home.
{22061}{22175}- He's unavailable, I guarantee you.|- I'll wait until he is available.
{22181}{22269}- I'm afraid you can't.|- Yes, I can!
{22362}{22457}Would you like to call the police?|I'm sure the press are interested.
{22463}{22581}- No, no... Let's don't even...|- I thought so!
{22587}{22698}If I take this guy's body,|could I help her out?
{22704}{22814}- You got the hots for her, huh?|- You're trying to sell me a body, right?
{22820}{22903}- Well, let's see it.|- OK.
{22909}{23025}Would you stop it? This ain't Star Trek.|I'm used to walking.
{23031}{23114}Lance Barton - Charles Wellington.
{23244}{23342}- Mr Wellington, please, don't get up.|- Damn, he's dead!
{23348}{23396}Nice bed, though.
{23402}{23530}So, that's what I'll look like?|I can't go to the Apollo in that body.
{23535}{23612}- I won't get any laughs.|- He looks funny to me.
{23618}{23718}I already get booed.|Do I really need to get beat down?
{23724}{23790}You want to meet the girl,|you take the body.
{23796}{23879}In a moment it'll be too late.
{23885}{24004}For good? Could I just be him|while you find me a better body?
{24010}{24068}You mean take it on loan?
{24074}{24157}Normally I have a problem with that,
{24163}{24252}but since we screwed up... it's a deal.
{24258}{24341}Mr Wellington, a Miss Sontee Jenkins|to see you.
{24367}{24419}Still bathing, are we?
{24465}{24548}We don't want our fingers|to go all pruney.
{24719}{24777}- Hey, it worked!|- What?
{24783}{24896}- You weren't sure it would work?|- Relax, I've read the manual.
{24902}{24975}Hey, I still look like me!
{24981}{25079}- You are you.|- I thought you said I was Wellington.
{25085}{25178}- You are Wellington.|- Thanks for clearing that up!
{25184}{25294}To everyone else you look like him,|you sound like him,
{25300}{25438}you even smell like him.|But you see yourself. Simple, huh?
{25483}{25581}- Is everýthing all right?|- You can answer him. Go ahead.
{25587}{25663}- Everýthing's cool.|- Not too cool, I hope.
{25669}{25738}Everýthing's all right!
{25744}{25843}And they'll see Wellington,|not some brother in his clothes?
{25849}{25926}- I don't feel like getting shot!|- You'll be all right!
{26138}{26196}So, you the butler?
{26202}{26250}Yes, sir...
{26274}{26327}...me the butler.
{26355}{26426}So you do all the buttlin'|around here?
{26457}{26519}Yes, indeed, sir.
{26540}{26637}- Whose butler are you?|- Your butler, sir.
{26643}{26701}You're my butler?
{26707}{26810}Don't cheat on me. If I see you buttlin'|for somebody else, I may kill them.
{26898}{26972}- Now, who am l?|- You, sir?
{26998}{27092}- You... Mr Wellington?|- Who am l?
{27109}{27140}Mr Wellington.
{27146}{27278}You're damn right I'm Wellington.|Yes, I got a body! I got a body!
{27284}{27384}You certainly have!|Would you care to get dressed?
{27390}{27448}Take that corpse for a spin!
{27454}{27554}So where does he keep...|where do I keep my clothes?
{27560}{27646}- In the closet, sir.|- I've got a closet! And a body!
{27652}{27758}I've got a body!|Let's go to the closet. Peace out!
{27764}{27822}Yeah! I'm Wellington!
{27828}{27906}- I'm Wellington!|- Good morning, Mr Wellington.
{27912}{28011}- You'd better recognise.|- I know you, you cheap bastard!
{28067}{28154}Tiger Woods, y'all,|Tiger, Tiger Woods, y'all.
{28171}{28229}Hey, Tiger Woods, y'all!
{28252}{28323}- Hi, darling.|- I'll deal with you two later.
{28501}{28610}How you doing? I'm Charles Wellington.|America's 1 5th richest man.
{28616}{28649}I know who you are!
{28681}{28730}Would you give us some privacy?
{28817}{28912}- Could I help you out?|- I don't need your help.
{28918}{29041}You have been avoiding me,|and now you're going to listen.
{29047}{29095}It's about people's lives.
{29101}{29206}Sick people, poor people.|People that you care nothing about.
{29212}{29340}They are going to be in desperate|trouble if you close the hospital.
{29346}{29433}See you later!|I'll get you a new body. Good luck!
{29439}{29478}Hey, but...
{29484}{29552}We are the only|county hospital in the area.
{29558}{29693}And you chose to privatise it|and kick sick, broke people out.
{29699}{29784}- What kind of man are you?|- Sounds like I'm an asshole.
{29790}{29871}- You think this is a joke.|- No.
{29877}{30001}This is a joke: a prostitute|and a car dealer go... Forget it!
{30007}{30094}I know all about|your board meeting on Monday.
{30100}{30238}- The one that's closed to the public.|- Glad you told me. I gotta get a haircut.
{30244}{30303}Get serious, 'cause I'll be there.
{30309}{30424}I'll bring every television camera|and news reporter I can find.
{30430}{30575}We'll make a party! We'll bring|some friends, get some chips, a DJ.
{30581}{30714}- And we get on this hospital thing!|- This meeting is over. Goodbye!
{30720}{30793}I'm serious! I'm not joking. I...
{30838}{30895}Is something wrong?
{30921}{30996}I lost the keys to the handcuffs.
{31002}{31122}Didn't your mama tell you to carry|a extra handcuff key? OK...
{31128}{31203}I'm just playing with you.|I'll look for the key.
{31209}{31299}It's not up there... it's not there...
{31337}{31394}There it is! No... roach.
{31400}{31464}There you go... got it!
{31513}{31628}You know what I've got right here?|I got your freedom!
{31634}{31706}I'm just playing. Let me get it...
{31712}{31766}Don't worry.
{31799}{31857}See? Everýthing's all right.
{31926}{31978}Thank you, bastard!
{32036}{32067}I was just playing!
{32226}{32285}What happened?|I put the pills in his drink...
{32291}{32436}I'll tell you, you blew it!|You've ruined us. You idiot!
{32442}{32507}- You incompetent moron!|- You bitch!
{32513}{32574}- Retard!|- Rich bitch!
{32580}{32630}Fat old bitch!
{32661}{32715}Now we're talking...
{32875}{32947}Honey, I'm home!
{32984}{33060}You want to put|a little English on the top...
{33066}{33145}I just want to say|that I know y'all tried to kill me.
{33248}{33371}- Darling, that's ridiculous!|- From what I hear, I'm an asshole.
{33396}{33484}So I figure we're even: I was|an asshole, you tried to kill me.
{33490}{33586}- What are you talking about?|- I know you tried to kill me.
{33592}{33724}So let's just move on. We're adults,|so what you tried to kill me?
{33730}{33833}We're never going to have|a good relationship till you admit it.
{33839}{33957}- OK... we tried to kill you.|- Gotcha! Police, here they are!
{33963}{34091}- I'm sorry!|- Just playing, I'm not going to tell.
{34096}{34211}But I do need a favour. How can|I get in touch with Sontee Jenkins?
{34217}{34327}We can find out. Should I call|our usual problem solvers?
{34333}{34416}Maybe if they visit her,|she'll change her tune.
{34422}{34493}Does she have a dog? We could kill it.
{34499}{34593}I don't have a problem with her.|I want to ask her out on a date.
{34644}{34689}Charles... !
{34695}{34792}You were getting ready|to have sex on the pool table!
{34798}{34894}- You got an eight ball in your ass.|- You're wrong.
{34900}{34982}This isn't level,|and we were trying to...
{34988}{35066}Do me a favour, keep waxing that ass,|keep her off mine.
{35135}{35186}Waxing it?
{36707}{36766}How do you change channels?
{36786}{36842}How do you get MTV?
{36883}{36939}Showtime...
{36975}{37031}Playboy...
{37037}{37140}- Hey! BET.|- Not available.
{37589}{37647}Descending to stafflevel.
{37688}{37775}I'm gonna tell you.|Baking soda'll get that right out.
{37781}{37843}Does any TV in this house get BET?
{37849}{37936}- BET, Mr Wellington?|- Black Entertainment Television.
{37942}{38026}No, I know what BET is.
{38032}{38101}- You want to watch BET?|- Yeah.
{38107}{38183}The TV in the staff lounge gets BET.
{38189}{38292}- Would you mind if I watched TV?|- Not at all, Mr Wellington.
{38298}{38374}This is your house. Enjoy!
{38380}{38468}- Thanks a lot. Take care.|- Thank you.
{38474}{38524}You jungle-fever-having bastard!
{38530}{38647}It's not enough he bosses me around|upstairs? He got to come down here.
{38653}{38779}If he asks me to change the channel,|I'm going to cut his ass!
{38785}{38828}Wanda?
{38860}{38907}Yes, Mr Wellington?
{38913}{39047}- You don't like me, do you?|- Oh, no. I like you just fine, sir.
{39053}{39150}She can't stand your ass.|You should hear her,
{39156}{39245}"I hate Wellington.|Boy, I hope he drops dead."
{39251}{39373}"Wellington stupido. Wellington cheapo.|Wellington assholo."
{39379}{39489}- Sir, it's just disrespectful.|- If I was you, I would hate me too.
{39495}{39614}Tell you what I'm gonna do.|You both get a 200% raise.
{39657}{39759}- Are you happy?|- I'm ecstatic.
{39765}{39825}Good. Take care!
{39894}{39976}I'll believe that bullshit|when I see my cheque.
{39982}{40052}All right, here we go. Come on, baby!
{40058}{40157}For Christ's sake, you gotta hit that.|It's a wide open three!
{40236}{40279}Come in!
{40342}{40447}Sir! Anything I can do for you?|I didn't hear the bell.
{40453}{40575}- Is there anybody else in here?|- I don't believe so, sir, no.
{40581}{40651}You're not from England, are you?
{40688}{40766}Of course I am, sir. I'm from London.
{40772}{40845}I was born in Fulham,|near the River Thames.
{40851}{40941}My father was a gentleman's|gentleman, and so am l.
{40947}{41003}I was right outside the door.|I heard you.
{41009}{41180}You put on this fake accent to make|rich folks feel comfortable. Good scam.
{41186}{41250}So, where you really from?
{41256}{41399}- I'm from Scarsdale. Crap! Am I fired?|- No, you're not. Mind if I watch BET?
{41405}{41481}Would you like me|to change the channel?
{41487}{41566}Drop the accent,|"Would you like me to change the..."
{41572}{41639}Just be yourself!
{41703}{41788}OK... Do you want a beer?
{41794}{41900}You know what?|Let me get it. You worked all day.
{41906}{41937}You got any Rheingolds?
{41988}{42136}The second amateur spot for the final|Apollo show has been awarded to
{42142}{42226}comedian Joe Guy from Brooklyn.|Stay tuned.
{42275}{42360}- Where are you going... sir?|- I've got to work on my material.
{42366}{42423}- Where's the nearest subway?|- Wanna take the car?
{42671}{42729}What's up, Snoop?
{42735}{42824}It's kind ofhard|being Snoop D-O double-G, Y
{42830}{42940}Keep coming up with funky ass shit|like every single day
{42970}{43027}What's up, museum?
{43033}{43115}Sipping on gin and juice|Laid back
{43121}{43185}With my mind on my money|And my money on my mind
{43276}{43327}Sipping on gin andjuice
{43333}{43426}With my mind on my money|And my money on my mind
{43474}{43540}Put up your "W"!
{44069}{44158}Are you ready for more comedy?|All right!
{44164}{44296}Our next act just won a spot|on the last night of the Apollo!
{44302}{44354}Give it up for Joe Guy!
{44393}{44502}What's up, brother?|This place is looking fine!
{44508}{44603}There's some fine-looking sisters,|except for you...
{44609}{44644}Sure this is a great idea?
{44650}{44778}- This place does seem a little...|- A little what?
{44783}{44845}It's a little dark in here.
{44851}{44912}Relax! These are my people.
{44956}{45054}There's no more little towns|in America.
{45060}{45131}The whole country is malls,
{45137}{45205}and every town's got two malls.
{45211}{45321}They got the white mall and the mall|white people used to go to.
{45327}{45404}Because there ain't nothing|in the black mall
{45410}{45487}but sneakers and baby clothes.
{45493}{45560}I guess that's all we doing,|running and screwing.
{45566}{45688}White people like their black|the same way they like their seasoning.
{45694}{45725}Just a dash!
{45760}{45895}You go to a white mall, it's all nice.|You got personal shoppers.
{45901}{46009}Go to a black mall and people say,|"Can I help you with your cheap shit?"
{46015}{46128}White people get some money...|Keep it. Stay rich. Kids get rich.
{46134}{46225}Black people get some money, it's the|countdown to "When's he going broke?"
{46281}{46357}White people die, leave a will.|Brother die and leave a bill.
{47111}{47188}Hi, it's Sontee. Leave me a message,|I'll call you back.
{47194}{47308}Hi, Sontee, Charles Wellington here,|the bastard. Remember me?
{47314}{47422}I was just wondering|if we can get together,
{47428}{47503}get something to eat,|catch a movie or something?
{47534}{47662}Hey, Sontee. Charles Wellington here...|Hope you like the flowers!
{47714}{47771}All right. Give me a call.
{47777}{47884}Charles Wellington again.|You haven't called me!
{47890}{47986}Can we get together,|catch a movie, a play... something?
{48015}{48100}Are you there?|Are you screening this call?
{48269}{48339}OK, I guess you're not there.
{48345}{48434}Hey, Sontee... Charles Wellington.|Are you there?
{48440}{48536}I know you're there! Pick up the phone!|I know you're there!
{48542}{48615}Hey! Just playing... Just playing!
{48621}{48689}Give me a call, OK?
{48793}{48868}Good morning!|Your answering machine is broken.
{48874}{48973}Not broken, but it is full!|Would you stop calling me?
{48979}{49029}- What are you doing here?|- I was in the neighbourhood.
{49035}{49136}What were you doing?|Shutting down old folks' homes?
{49142}{49211}I thought we could get in the Rolls,
{49217}{49302}have a little brunch,|discuss this whole hospital thing.
{49308}{49418}So, you're trying to impress me|with the car and the money?
{49424}{49473}Do you think I'm some video ho?
{49479}{49596}If you want to impress me,|do it at the board meeting.
{49602}{49738}- Why not spend some time together?|- Spend some time doing some good.
{49900}{50012}- You got a nice touch with the ladies.|- I can't get a girl in this body.
{50018}{50107}I definitely can't get any laughs.|Have you found anything yet?
{50113}{50178}I'm working on it. I was just in Havana.|Want one?
{50184}{50327}No! I want a body and I want it now!
{50333}{50414}You getting tough?|I'm a friggin' angel.
{50420}{50513}You don't want to be in Heaven,|or here. There is a third option.
{50519}{50604}I'm sorry. I'm sorry.|I just need a body.
{50647}{50763}There's a big rap concert tonight...|Somebody's going to die!
{50769}{50882}Hey, don't forget about me!|Go to the rap concert.
{50888}{50976}It's over between us.|I can't do this any more.
{50982}{51086}Let's get out of here. We could go|some place he'll never find us.
{51092}{51161}Chechnya, East Timor... It'll be fun!
{51167}{51287}I can't. After all, he is my husband|and I love him.
{51293}{51394}And I'm going to do whatever I can|to get him back.
{51401}{51499}Bitch!|Scheming, double-crossing bitch!
{51505}{51603}That's sweet, Winston,|but it's too late.
{51662}{51727}We cannot allow WelICo to take over!
{51749}{51843}This is a very bad time|to make a personal appearance.
{51849}{51968}I've been looking into this hospital thing,|and I think she had a point.
{51974}{52023}Let's handle this the usual way.
{52029}{52134}You do the strong silent thing,|I'll field all the questions.
{52140}{52191}I won't let you down!
{52197}{52340}We can't have that! And there's one|man responsible, Charles Wellington!
{52346}{52386}You're a bad man!
{52422}{52469}Get out of here!
{52495}{52612}- Leave our hospital alone!|- Scumbag!
{52641}{52699}Now that you own|Brooklyn Community Hospital,
{52705}{52843}are you going to be turning away|those who can't pay?
{52849}{52923}Mr Wellington|doesn't have time right now.
{52929}{53068}I don't care what you got...|cancer, rickets, polio, swine flu,
{53074}{53193}the clap, dandruff, what else...|Lyme disease, lemon disease.
{53199}{53272}It don't matter, we'll take you.
{53278}{53353}- Liar!|- We won't take you!
{53383}{53476}- Thank you!|- Here they are, Mr Wellington,
{53482}{53588}the faces you didn't dare confront.|What do you have to say?
{53594}{53710}Hey, what's up, Wheelie?|Crutchie Crutch, how you doing?
{53716}{53812}Hey, Big IV. Save me a sip.|I want a sip now!
{53818}{53940}I know what's wrong with you - your|breath is destroying the environment.
{53958}{54036}Why don't you tell them|you don't care about them?
{54042}{54128}And why you locked the press|out of this meeting?
{54134}{54264}I must have been out of my mind.|Was I taking ecstasy that day?
{54270}{54366}We're going in there.|Sklar, grab a stretcher.
{54372}{54448}Everybody!|If you can walk, let's walk.
{54454}{54583}If you can't walk, it's time to roll.|Crutch your ass in there!
{54589}{54692}We are going in!|Come on, Big IV. Let's do this!
{54698}{54819}Sorry, brother. Can we get|some more juice for Big IV?
{54852}{54903}I've brought in|some friends from the media,
{54909}{55009}so if anybody's not|where they are supposed to be,
{55015}{55106}or got a little crust in their eyes,|you might want to get up right now.
{55112}{55181}You can't bring news cameras in here.
{55187}{55235}We've got nothing to hide.
{55241}{55355}If there's not enough seats,|sit on somebody's lap.
{55361}{55495}- So, what's up?|- At your hospital in Kentucky,
{55501}{55586}a teenager with a bullet wound|was sent to another hospital
{55592}{55665}fifteen miles away, dying en route.
{55671}{55740}Hospitals don't kill people, people do.
{55746}{55856}We can't send people out|with bullet wounds to their head.
{55862}{55919}You have to take that seriously.
{55925}{56033}We got a new slogan,|"Shot in the head, you get a bed."
{56039}{56095}"If your head is bloody,|we're your buddy."
{56101}{56229}I want bullet wounds to be treated|like cash - accepted everywhere!
{56295}{56423}- Not without adequate insurance?|- Is insurance really adequate?
{56428}{56501}When you pay for it,|do you feel assured?
{56507}{56600}They shouldn't call it insurance,|but "In case shit".
{56606}{56689}I give a company money|in case shit happens.
{56695}{56767}If it doesn't, shouldn't I get it back?
{56773}{56906}If I'd known you would keep the money,|I would've got in an accident!
{56912}{57029}If you're taking my money, at least|spend it on some poor sick people.
{57035}{57100}Don't buy a Mercedes Benz with it
{57106}{57225}and park in front of Brooklyn Hospital|where broke people walk by.
{57231}{57376}I just got off the bus and I've got|to look at it? I should stab the tyre!
{57382}{57513}And why do doctors cost so much?|Do you know? Shut the hell up!
{57519}{57632}It's like doctors charging|so much for a triple bypass surgery.
{57638}{57752}Going to charge somebody|a hundred thousand dollars!
{57758}{57827}And then got the nerve to say,|"Take it easy."
{57833}{57965}I've got to get a job driving another|cab, just to pay off the doctors!
{58012}{58061}We have to be different.
{58067}{58152}Let's see how it feels|to not be the evil corporation.
{58158}{58291}Let's try taking in people bleeding|with bullet wounds to the head.
{58297}{58402}We tried the other way.|We made a lot of money.
{58408}{58548}So what if we lose a few million dollars?|A lot of you look pissed off.
{58554}{58656}Look like y'all want to get froggy.|Well, come on!
{58662}{58762}What are you going to do?|You see this foot?
{58768}{58886}It's from a little town called "Rich Man's|Ass", and it's getting homesick.
{58892}{58977}You guys have been|a lovely audience.
{58983}{59088}I wanna thank you all for showing up.|Drive home safely!
{59094}{59164}I gots to go! Take care!
{59170}{59270}Thanks a lot.|Pardon me. Nice shirt!
{59379}{59517}Hey, Chuck! I feel like I haven't|been tending to your needs.
{59523}{59661}I know your biggest fantasy|has always been a ménage à trois,
{59667}{59752}and you've always liked|Blanche from the club...
{59788}{59860}Hi, Chuck!
{59866}{59964}How would you like|to come over and taste me?
{60062}{60169}- Sir, the handcuff lady's here.|- Sontee?
{60277}{60331}Mr Wellington.
{60362}{60462}- Just call me Lance.|- I thought your name was Charles.
{60468}{60574}Charles is short for Lance.|Charles is a maiden name.
{60580}{60690}OK, Lance...|I just came to say I'm sorry.
{60696}{60806}I said a lot of bad things about you,|but you kept brushing me off.
{60812}{60887}If you meant what you said|at the meeting...
{60893}{60973}I'm sorry to jump in,|but are you hungry?
{60979}{61058}Have you been working all day?
{61064}{61141}I know you were out there marching
{61147}{61219}and AI Sharpton ate all the food.
{61225}{61353}- You wanna get something to eat?|- No, I don't think I should.
{61358}{61444}I am not trying|to impress you, I swear.
{61450}{61510}I just want to feed you.
{61516}{61601}That's all. We don't even have to drive.|We could walk...
{61607}{61677}We could skip.|We'll skip to a meal?
{61734}{61822}- I guess I am hungry.|- Come on, let's go!
{62120}{62215}- You don't like this place?|- I am just surprised.
{62221}{62315}- I didn't always have money.|- Yeah, right...
{62321}{62438}I used to visit clothes in store windows|I had on lay-away.
{62444}{62517}Used to? I was visiting|a pair of shoes last week.
{62523}{62651}I remember one time|I put a coat on lay-away in September,
{62656}{62701}so I figured I'd get it out in the winter.
{62707}{62771}I couldn't get it out till June.
{62776}{62909}- Did you wait till winter to wear it?|- I wore that coat the whole summer.
{62915}{63004}July 4th I was on the beach|with a goose down.
{63018}{63062}Stop playing!
{63068}{63168}Sweating... just drawing.|Just dripping sweat. Slipping!
{63174}{63298}To this day, when I want to lose weight,|I just put on a hot coat.
{63567}{63690}Stop, drop|Shut them down, open up shop
{63696}{63790}Oh, no|Just a rough rider
{63796}{63865}Niggers wanna try|Niggers wanna lie
{63871}{63933}Niggers wonder why|Niggers wanna die
{63939}{64000}All I feel is pain|All I feel is rain
{64006}{64066}What! What!
{64195}{64253}- Yo, dog...|- What?
{64406}{64484}- Are you OK?|- Yeah, I'm OK.
{64527}{64599}- Have you lost your mind?|- I forgot who I was.
{64605}{64735}- You forgot who you were?|- I like the song: DMX, "Rough Riders".
{64741}{64823}What about us singing,|"Whiteys wanna die, whiteys can't try"?
{64841}{64906}Might get a record deal.
{64953}{65022}You're something else.
{65028}{65125}I didn't know what to expect,|but I didn't expect this!
{65131}{65260}When I look at you, it's like|I see somebody else inside you.
{65283}{65412}Even when I was trying to be|mad at you, I see something else.
{65440}{65538}- Sounds crazy, huh?|- No, it's not crazy.
{65544}{65610}It's... it's not crazy.
{65670}{65792}- Some date, huh?|- I thought you were just feeding me.
{65798}{65869}I was till I got my ass whooped!
{65892}{65954}That guy punched me|like I owed him child support!
{66782}{66864}That was different|than I thought it would be.
{66870}{66943}Different good, or different weird?
{66949}{67052}A little bit of both, I think.|You didn't seem like my type.
{67058}{67129}So what's your type look like?
{67135}{67281}It's not all about looks. I just|kind of like a guy with all of his teeth.
{67287}{67381}- That's a good rule.|- I like a slim guy,
{67387}{67513}a guy with a goatee, nice eyes,|and he's got to be funny.
{67548}{67623}- I guess I don't have a chance.|- What's your type?
{67629}{67759}I like my women the same way|I like my coffee... Puerto Rican!
{67790}{67848}- Just playing...|- You watch it!
{67879}{67929}Boy, here we are...
{67956}{68051}- So, can I call you?|- Well, let me ask you something...
{68057}{68149}Did you say that stuff at the hospital|to try to get with me?
{68155}{68248}At first, yeah.
{68254}{68338}Then I remembered you said, "Do|something positive with your money."
{68344}{68446}So I figured I might as well help.
{68452}{68589}If I get with you... great! But if not,|at least somebody'll be happy.
{68681}{68713}You know, I'd better go.
{68745}{68833}Guess I'd better be going, too.
{68839}{68922}Yeah... I wonder|who the Knicks played?
{68928}{69011}I think they played the Lakers|or somebody...
{69094}{69137}I'm sorry...
{69143}{69197}I'm sorry. Was I wrong?
{69203}{69327}No... I knew you would try to kiss me|tonight, and I thought I'd be mad.
{69356}{69437}But I'm not.|It's something about your eyes.
{69443}{69559}You know, the first kiss|is always in the middle of a sentence.
{69565}{69693}It's always like, "Tomorrow|I'm going to the zoo to see the..."
{69781}{69829}It could be like...
{69835}{69934}"Did you hear about|that new war in Russia? I heard..."
{70058}{70137}So I can call you, right?|I mean, just to talk.
{70143}{70257}No nasty talk or anything.|Unless that's what you're into!
{70263}{70311}Good night.
{70495}{70568}Yes! Yes! Yes!
{70693}{70757}My baby! My baby!
{71824}{71886}Get off my foot, bitch!
{72186}{72301}- OK, let's go!|- Hey! Don't sneak up on me like that.
{72307}{72378}Sorry. I got a new body for you.
{72384}{72449}I don't need the body any more.
{72455}{72562}We have one minute|to get you into this fabulous corpse.
{72568}{72682}I'm cool with Wellington, 'cause|Sontee's cool with Wellington.
{72688}{72774}I just waited through|three rap songs for you.
{72780}{72898}You can't keep the body,|even if you are smitten with some girl.
{72904}{72968}It's not some girl. It's the girl.
{72974}{73112}You got Heaven, but you don't got this.|She's so fine. We like the same stuff.
{73118}{73232}She laughs at my stupid jokes,|and I don't have to censor myself.
{73238}{73317}But she only knows me as Wellington,
{73323}{73389}so I don't want to change now.
{73395}{73466}Trust me, it's better this way.
{73472}{73564}- Give me your wallet!|- One second...
{73570}{73636}Are you sure|I won't die for forty years?
{73642}{73695}Technically, yes. But...
{73701}{73801}...this body is just a loaner!|Boy, nobody listens to me.
{73807}{73881}Come on, rob me. I've got money!
{73887}{73973}How does he want to be more involved|with running the company?
{73979}{74123}He wants to be... more involved|with running... the company.
{74129}{74209}- I thought you had him under control.|- I did.
{74215}{74289}I don't know where this came from.
{74295}{74365}Maybe you schtupping his wife|changed his attitude.
{74371}{74437}There's no need to get personal.
{74443}{74560}I take personally the statement,|"What if we lose a few million dollars?"
{74566}{74633}I didn't get into this to lose money.
{74639}{74782}Do you think this crap extends|to auditing the company's finances?
{74788}{74887}- Jesus, I hope not!|- Blah, blah, blah... Let's just kill him.
{75026}{75090}What are you laughing about?
{75096}{75191}Winston, do you want|to take the lead on this one?
{75221}{75356}Cisco, I need you to get in contact|with a man named Whitney Daniels.
{75362}{75433}Tell him I need to talk to him.
{75678}{75762}Pretty sweet, huh?|Up here, Mr Daniels.
{75857}{75954}Entering second floor.|Entering second floor.
{75960}{76063}I saw this girl the other day|and she was ugly.
{76069}{76206}She was asking for a booty call. I said,|"I'm going to give you a zooty call."
{76212}{76315}What the hell do you think|you're doing? This isn't your act!
{76321}{76407}Calm down!|Hey, everybody... Whitney Daniels!
{76457}{76517}Shut up!
{76523}{76593}You've been great,|but we're going to take a little break.
{76613}{76717}Come on, everybody,|let's get back to work.
{76748}{76856}- What the hell is going on here?|- I know it looks crazy,
{76862}{76963}but to get the last night at the Apollo,|I need a place to work out.
{76994}{77113}You want to do one|of the amateur spots at the Apollo?
{77119}{77231}Do your butlers go to comedy clubs|and steal people's acts?
{77237}{77291}- You think my act is stolen?|- I know it is.
{77297}{77438}I would have stolen better material,|but the kid worked it pretty well.
{77444}{77562}- Two Rheingolds coming at you.|- Thanks a lot, Cisco.
{77568}{77642}You took everýthing from the kid, huh?
{77648}{77765}Don't tell me that Rheingold|is all you can afford.
{77771}{77903}I didn't steal anything. I just want to|play the Apollo, and only you can help.
{77909}{78033}I'm out of the comedy business. Last|person I was going to help is dead.
{78039}{78187}- Anyway, he was a special case.|- What was so special about him?
{78193}{78258}Nothing, really, if you want to know.
{78264}{78412}He didn't have much talent to speak of,|but no matter how bad it went -
{78418}{78486}and sometimes it went really bad -
{78492}{78551}he wanted to get back on stage.
{78600}{78731}He was a good kid, and I wanted to|be there when things got good for him.
{78820}{78893}But I guess that won't happen now.
{78954}{79047}- Thanks for the beer.|- Whitney, it's me, Lance!
{79069}{79156}I got hit by a truck|and I went up to Heaven.
{79162}{79275}They took my body,|and I'm in Heaven and it's all blue...
{79281}{79374}And this guy, Mr King,|he looked like Ricky Ricardo...
{79380}{79490}I don't know if it's drugs you're taking,|or need to be taking,
{79496}{79560}but do something!
{79588}{79684}Whitney, remember|when we did that gig in Atlantic City?
{79690}{79769}They only paid us two-fifty,
{79775}{79842}and we got real drunk|and hung out with these two girls.
{79848}{79922}We got so drunk,|we thought they was transvestites.
{79928}{80026}It turns out they were just|two real ugly girls.
{80032}{80118}We brought them back|to the hotel, hung out.
{80124}{80260}And we woke up - what did we|find out? They robbed us!
{80499}{80540}Booey!
{80616}{80665}This is impossible!
{80671}{80738}You've been going to church|your whole life,
{80744}{80873}putting money in the collection plate.|This is just your tax dollars at work.
{80879}{80990}Wait a minute!|Does God have a sense of humour?
{80996}{81116}I haven't met God,|but the Devil got some good weed.
{81122}{81190}Just playing... I haven't met him yet.
{81196}{81297}But I met Mr King,|he's like the manager up there.
{81303}{81339}The manager?
{81345}{81473}Having a comedy club in your home|doesn't mean you can pull this off.
{81479}{81562}You've got to work|in front of a real audience.
{81568}{81645}I got an audience.|You heard me getting laughs.
{82081}{82126}What else?
{82132}{82237}Your mother's armpits are so hairy,|it looks like buckwheat in a headlock.
{82456}{82586}What I like about telling jokes is that|it's you versus the audience.
{82592}{82683}Nobody cares what you look like|or what you wear.
{82689}{82784}People just want to know|if you're funny. Can you bring it?
{82790}{82878}I just want to go to the Apollo|and bring it one time.
{82884}{82967}What about what you said|at the hospital?
{82973}{83043}People think that stuff but never say it.
{83049}{83147}- I was just talking.|- Yeah, but it worked!
{83153}{83261}- What do you mean, worked?|- It was funny.
{83574}{83629}What's up, G?
{83712}{83763}Welcome home, G.
{83769}{83809}What are you doing?
{83837}{83889}Backing that ass up.
{83938}{84006}How about you and me knock boots?
{84012}{84095}It's just, you know,|I've noticed lately
{84101}{84215}you've been into the whole...|Jet Magazine thing, and...
{84221}{84319}- Listen, I want a divorce.|- Is it because I tried to jack you?
{84325}{84427}No, it's got nothing to do|with you trying to jack me.
{84433}{84502}The truth is, there's somebody else.
{84508}{84578}Oh... you got another ho.
{84584}{84685}Just divorce me. You can have|the house, the car...
{84691}{84757}whatever you want,|I don't want it.
{84783}{84832}- Word?|- Word.
{84838}{84904}You know,|you're a great person inside,
{84910}{85017}and you need to get in touch|with the person inside.
{85023}{85129}And until you do that,|you need to stay inside.
{85135}{85196}So, take care, all right?
{85245}{85307}He's lost his mind!
{85313}{85438}Your next act loves comedy so much,|he bought the whole club.
{85444}{85512}Please welcome|Charles Wellington Ill.
{85518}{85578}- Are you all right?|- Yeah.
{85584}{85640}- How are you feeling?|- I feel good.
{85646}{85756}Great, because the judges|from the Apollo are here.
{85861}{85917}How you doing? All right.
{85923}{85992}When I was a kid, we were so poor
{85998}{86092}that the roaches was on welfare.
{86098}{86214}Poor, my ass! Get off the stage,|you fake Bill Gates!
{86298}{86372}Yeah, we was real poor.
{86378}{86477}We were so poor|that the rats had bald spots.
{86483}{86530}Crap! Cripitty crap!
{86536}{86623}I've got to listen to this|because you own the club?
{86629}{86687}Rich son of a bitch!
{86693}{86782}That's comedy! Drinks for everybody!
{86861}{86954}Just shut up before|I crush you with my wallet.
{86977}{87090}Bothering me on the job - do I come|to your job and bother you?
{87096}{87217}Do I take the squeegee out|of your hand? I leave it right there.
{87268}{87398}I didn't always have money.|No... I was a kid, we really was poor.
{87404}{87511}We were so broke, my dad|was the cheapest man on earth.
{87517}{87637}He was so cheap that when we went|to bed he unplugged the clocks!
{87697}{87780}"You can't tell time|when you're asleep."
{87829}{87907}The last spot for|the Apollo's final show goes to...
{87913}{88024}..millionaire Charles Wellington.|And to make the night right,
{88030}{88069}closing out the show|will be Brian McKnight.
{88117}{88219}I don't know what got into|that Wellington, but I like it.
{88485}{88560}Fur is murder! Fur is murder!
{88595}{88643}I'll show you murder!
{88742}{88793}Don't be stingy!
{88843}{88916}- Stick to the soft stuff.|- Kiss my ass!
{88922}{89001}I'm so glad we're giving back|to the community.
{89007}{89053}Put on the hat!
{89059}{89174}- I still got to not get booed off stage.|- You're doing pretty good.
{89180}{89264}- Thank you for the party.|- No problem, Sickie.
{89270}{89334}You sick bastard!
{89340}{89454}What have you got here?|Damn, you're a sick man!
{89460}{89525}Nurse! Get this man|a table dance, right now!
{89619}{89693}- So, will you marry me?|- What?
{89699}{89797}I love looking at you,|talking to you, laughing with you.
{89803}{89898}Sometimes I call|your answering machine
{89904}{89962}because I love your voice.
{89968}{90070}The cars, the money...|I'd give it all up, just for you.
{90076}{90169}Today I changed the diaper|of an 86-year-old man,
{90175}{90264}- and I'd give it all up just for you!|- That's a big sacrifice.
{90289}{90346}Mr Barton!
{90437}{90488}- What?|- Nothing.
{90541}{90637}Hold that thought! I'll be right back.
{90690}{90760}- I said hold that thought!|- OK.
{91021}{91149}- Keyes, get out of here!|- Lance, you've got to come with me.
{91155}{91253}Can't you see I'm busy?|Grab yourself some ribs.
{91259}{91313}I'm not the bad guy here!
{91319}{91423}- Can I take my hands down now?|- Yes, you can.
{91429}{91505}So you really want to get married?
{91511}{91607}I really do. Just look at me,|you know I'm not lying.
{91635}{91752}I know. There's something|about your eyes.
{91758}{91829}I just want to remember all of this.
{91835}{91913}You're not going to forget me, right?
{91919}{91966}You act like something's|going to happen.
{91972}{92059}If something did happen,
{92065}{92197}Iike some day you met a guy... a black|guy, a white guy, a Spanish guy,
{92203}{92291}if he was sincere,|you'd give him a shot, right?
{92297}{92345}What are you talking about?
{92553}{92644}Everýthing's all right.|Everýthing's all right.
{92744}{92837}- So you brought the big gun.|- You've got to play by the rules.
{92843}{92958}I'm sick of it.|From now on I make the rules.
{92964}{93065}- No one makes these rules, kid.|- Every time I get something going,
{93071}{93169}- you take my body.|- This was just a temporary setup.
{93225}{93313}I'm not scared of you.|I got lawyers now, and money.
{93319}{93442}- I'm playing the Apollo, and I'm in love.|- This is bigger than that.
{93448}{93508}- Nothing's bigger than that!|- It's fate.
{93514}{93626}Why is that when it's bad it's fate,|but when it's good it's luck?
{93632}{93694}Is anything good|supposed to happen to me?
{93770}{93813}No!
{93870}{93912}Somebody call 911 !
{94076}{94150}Sorry, Lance, I tried to warn you.
{94156}{94255}- You gotta get me back.|- No dice. We had a deal.
{94261}{94354}- I'll be anybody!|- There'll be consequences.
{94360}{94449}I'll take them. Just get me back!
{94867}{94929}Hello, Sontee.
{94959}{95035}I just can't believe he's gone.|Just like that.
{95133}{95178}He's not gone.
{95184}{95300}- I know in a way he'll live on, but...|- No, honestly.
{95306}{95372}You think you loved|Charles Wellington,
{95378}{95469}but really you loved|someone inside of him.
{95475}{95580}And he didn't die tonight.|He's living on, somewhere.
{95586}{95685}I'm sure of it.|And he'll always remember us.
{95691}{95805}- What are we doing here?|- This is your future.
{95811}{95876}- I'm going to be Joe Guy?|- That's the plan.
{95882}{95962}I don't want to take his life.|He's a nice guy.
{95968}{96100}- It'll all work out for the best.|- I'm not so sure with you.
{96106}{96154}Look out, Joe!
{96640}{96702}Airbags!
{96708}{96768}Airbags!
{96774}{96835}Taxi! Taxi!
{96900}{96946}Taxi!
{96952}{97004}Taxi! Taxi!
{97055}{97139}Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
{97214}{97278}I'm black again!
{97284}{97368}I'm black again! I'm a black man!
{97374}{97453}Thank God I'm a black man!
{97459}{97570}Police are questioning Winston Sklar|in relation to the murder.
{97576}{97662}To those who knew him,|Charles Wellington was two men:
{97668}{97777}a ruthless businessman and, more|recently, a kind philanthropist.
{97783}{97891}That man who got shot today,|that wasn't Charles Wellington.
{97897}{97970}He was always a cheap ...
{97976}{98044}no-good mother ...|with a stick up his ...
{98050}{98197}The man in the park today, he was|my brother. I loved that man.
{98203}{98331}Chuck Wellington... There will|never be another one like him.
{98337}{98425}- I can't believe he's gone.|- No more questions.
{98431}{98533}Charles Wellington III,|dead at the age offifty-three.
{98539}{98631}He leaves behind his wife, Amber...
{98637}{98710}You're not going|to forget me, right?
{98716}{98794}There's something about your eyes...
{98800}{98902}Everything's all right.|Everything's all right.
{98908}{99017}...eccentric millionaire left his money|to charities, friends
{99023}{99080}and his domestic staff.
{99086}{99226}Well, it's showtime at the Apollo|as it closes its doors for good.
{99464}{99577}Hey, haven't seen you in a while.|What you doing backstage?
{99583}{99721}- How about a loan?|- Stop it! I'm just hanging out.
{99727}{99782}I miss Booey, too.
{99849}{99903}Thank you!
{100021}{100069}Lance?
{100075}{100139}- No, I'm Phil.|- Sorry.
{100144}{100246}How about a hand for your next act,|Mr Joe Guy!
{100289}{100343}- Hey, Whit.|- Hey, Joe.
{100659}{100706}Make me laugh!
{100737}{100821}Apollo... Yeah!
{100827}{100963}So, what is it all about? Looks?|Looks will determine everýthing.
{100969}{101092}You want people to judge you by|the character, what you feel inside.
{101098}{101184}Nobody cares.|All they care about is your looks.
{101190}{101289}If you look good,|you're going to have a good life.
{101295}{101383}The uglier you are,|the smarter you'd better be.
{101389}{101487}You need a book for every|ten pounds you're overweight.
{101493}{101579}Or you'd better get two books,|and get a computer while you're at it!
{101722}{101771}Lance?
{101842}{101939}I was at the Knick game,|looking at the seats.
{101945}{102045}The higher the seats got,|the uglier the people got.
{102051}{102176}If I was the usher I wouldn't|need tickets, I'd just look at faces.
{102182}{102241}You got to go up top!
{102312}{102440}A woman can fall in love|with an ugly man and admit it.
{102446}{102580}Show him off to all her friends|and the family, and be so proud.
{102586}{102708}They're holding his hand like,|"I just want you to meet Kevin.
{102714}{102838}"I know he don't look that good,|but he's good to me."
{102844}{102964}Guys would never admit to being|in love with an ugly woman.
{102970}{103104}We ain't telling nobody... "I heard|you got married." "Who told you that?"
{103182}{103257}Life. What's life all about?
{103263}{103408}Love! Love, love, love, love.|You want to be in love.
{103414}{103514}That's right. You want to feel|that first kiss again.
{103520}{103646}Because that's the only real kiss|in a relationship, is the first kiss.
{103652}{103744}All the rest of the kisses|are just protocol.
{103750}{103834}Every other kiss is protocol.|Just routine.
{103840}{103911}"Hey, you was gone, you back."
{103917}{104009}"Hey, we're having sex."|"Hey, I miss you."
{104015}{104102}The first kiss is the only real one.
{104108}{104185}And it always happens|in the middle of a conversation.
{104191}{104274}You don't even know|what they're talking about...
{104280}{104397}"And maybe someday I was thinking|about trying to get the..."
{104403}{104492}The first kiss is always|like double Dutch.
{104498}{104589}You just sitting there like,|"When do I get in?"
{104595}{104715}"Oh, yeah! I'm kissing!|I'm kissing, I'm kissing."
{104721}{104780}Hey, I got to go. Y'all be good.
{104977}{105028}That's my dog!
{105151}{105204}Joe Guy, ladies and gentlemen.
{105301}{105389}- Whitney!|- Lance!
{105437}{105505}They didn't boo! They didn't boo!
{105522}{105613}Why not make the whole thing|out of the black box?
{105619}{105692}We are back in business, huh?
{105698}{105767}I'm back, Whit. You and me!
{105773}{105850}Lance, I'm proud of you.
{106052}{106140}- Lance.|- Mr King. Keyes.
{106146}{106230}Congratulations! You killed them.|We're cool, right?
{106236}{106310}- We real cool.|- We've got to talk.
{106316}{106393}Remember Wellington|was just a temporary setup.
{106399}{106524}This is your body. It's time to set up|house, kid, 'cause this is you.
{106530}{106595}I'll sign a lease right now.
{106616}{106737}Joe, listen to Phil Quon, kid.|You're about to shine.
{106751}{106833}Kid, when we leave,|you will be Joe Guy.
{106839}{106909}You won't remember Keyes, or me.
{106915}{107054}I'm going to remember you|like you whipped my ass in third grade.
{107060}{107118}Lance, you're not getting it.
{107124}{107252}You won't remember Charles|Wellington, Sontee or Lance Barton.
{107257}{107316}You will be Joe Guy.
{107322}{107421}What do you mean,|I won't remember Sontee?
{107427}{107530}I got hit by a truck,|I got smashed by a car, I got shot.
{107536}{107605}And now you want to take my soul?
{107611}{107685}Lance, nobody could take your soul.
{107691}{107760}What you look like, that's just clothing.
{107766}{107874}How can I get Sontee|if I don't remember her?
{107880}{107950}If Sontee doesn't remember me?
{107956}{108080}The funny thing about reincarnation|is that you're still you.
{108086}{108129}I got a good feeling about this.
{108135}{108239}It was hard enough trying to get this girl|as a rich white man.
{108245}{108390}- What about as a broke black man?|- See you around, Joe.
{108434}{108532}You and me on the road.|We could blow up, son.
{108538}{108597}Joe, are you all right?
{108603}{108682}Lance? Lance?
{108721}{108829}Lance, come on, let's celebrate.|I've got some big plans.
{108861}{108997}- What are you talking about?|- Lance? Nobody else is around.
{109033}{109101}Why do you keep calling me Lance?
{109128}{109188}Look at me for a second, will you?
{109292}{109370}- Lance.|- Joe Guy.
{109396}{109474}Oh, you mean your boy, Lance Barton.
{109480}{109568}I'm sorry.|Are you still dealing with that, huh?
{109574}{109615}Yeah.
{109621}{109659}Yeah, I...
{109665}{109725}..guess I am.
{109731}{109789}- Look, Mr Daniels...|- Whitney.
{109795}{109854}Whitney. I don't have a manager.
{109860}{109935}Could I come by your office|and leave a tape?
{109941}{110045}Maybe you could take me on.
{110051}{110096}Yeah, sure...
{110102}{110149}Call me tomorrow.
{110155}{110215}You're...
{110221}{110269}You're a good kid.
{110283}{110366}Thanks a lot.|I'll call you tomorrow.
{110372}{110405}Joe Guy.
{110411}{110477}Don't act like you don't know me.
{110483}{110575}And if you don't like the tape,|keep it to yourself.
{110581}{110635}- Right.|- It's going to be all right.
{110797}{110879}Excuse me,|I'm looking for Whitney Daniels.
{110885}{110999}Just go straight, you make a right|and go down the stairs.
{111005}{111095}- He should be by the dressing rooms.|- Thanks.
{111101}{111196}I'm sorry, but do you think|they'll let me back there?
{111202}{111290}Sure, the show's been over|for about an hour.
{111296}{111363}- Do I know you?|- No.
{111369}{111498}Seriously. I'm not joking,|I just feel like I met you before.
{111514}{111579}Joe.
{111585}{111644}- Joe Guy.|- Sontee Jenkins.
{111650}{111697}Sontee?
{111703}{111752}Thanks.
{111905}{111990}We'd better get out of here|before they lock us in.
{111996}{112085}Give me your hand.|I know my way around here.
{112091}{112160}Don't be scared, everýthing's all right.
{112166}{112305}- What did you just say?|- Everything's all right, like the song.
{112311}{112428}It's just that when you said that, it...|You're a comedian?
{112434}{112509}- Do I sing that bad?|- No.
{112515}{112653}- You were on tonight, how did you do?|- They didn't boo.
{112659}{112743}- There's an after-party...|- I didn't mean to hold you up.
{112749}{112868}No, I don't feel like going.|Do you want to get something to eat?
{112874}{112942}Are you asking me out?
{112948}{113018}No, I just want to feed you.
{113024}{113095}Yeah, I'm starved.
{113189}{113228}- Nice shoes.|- Thank you.
{113261}{113321}- So, what do you do?|- Medicine.
{113327}{113389}- Are you a drug dealer?|- Watch it!
{113395}{113481}No. Actually, I own|Brooklyn Community Hospital.
{113487}{113545}You own a hospital?
{113551}{113682}My uncle went there for a new liver|and they sent him to the supermarket.
{113688}{113781}- How you doing, sir?|- This your ride?
{113787}{113875}If you want to keep it,|get it out of here!
{113881}{113985}This is nice! What kind of mileage|do you get on this?
{113991}{114056}Oh, pretty good.
{114178}{114240}Cocktails, Miss Jenkins?
{114246}{114348}- Are you the maid?|- Do I look like the maid? I'm the paid.
{114354}{114413}This is my friend, Wanda.
{114419}{114528}Let you out of the car for a minute|and you're picking up strays.
{114534}{114609}- Did you know your coat's bleeding?|- Mind your business!
{115076}{115144}- You OK, Sontee?|- I'm OK. You OK?
{115150}{115214}- Cisco, you OK?|- I'm OK. Wanda?
{115219}{115325}- No, I spilt my drink!|- You know what, you drink, I drive.
{115409}{115525}- Didn't I say to keep an eye on him?|- I'm sorry. Won't happen again, sir.
{115577}{115625}Cisco, you got any music?
{115649}{115692}Here you go.
{115817}{115906}Rolling down the street smoking lndo
{115912}{115989}Sipping on gin and juice|Laid back
{115995}{116059}With my mind on my money|And my money on my mind
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho
We kidnap and ravage
and don't give a hoot
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me
We extort, we pilfer
We filch, we sack...
Quiet, missy!
Cursed pirates sail these waters.
You don't want to bring them down on us.
Mr. Gibbs, that will do.
She was singing about pirates!
Bad luck to sing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog.
- Mark my words.
- Consider them marked.
- On your way.
- Aye, Lieutenant.
Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a miniature one.
It'd be exciting to meet a pirate.
Think again, Miss Swann.
Vile creatures, the lot of them.
I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag gets what he deserves.
A short drop and a sudden stop.
I appreciate your fervor, but I'm concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter.
My apologies, Governor Swann.
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- That's what concerns me.
There's a boy in the water!
Man overboard!
Man the ropes! Fetch a hook!
Haul him aboard!
He's still breathing.
Mary, Mother of God!
What happened here?
Most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
Lot of good it did them.
Everyone's thinking it, I'm saying it.
Pirates!
There's no proof of that!
It was probably an accident.
Rouse the captain. Heave to and take in sail. Launch the boats.
Elizabeth, accompany the boy.
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.
He'll be in your charge.
Take care of him.
It's okay. My name's Elizabeth Swann.
Will Turner.
I'm watching over you, Will.
You're a pirate!
Has he said anything?
His name's William Turner.
That's all I found out.
Take him below.
Elizabeth!
Are you all right?
Are you decent?
Yes.
Yes?
Still abed at this hour?
It's a beautiful day.
I have a gift for you.
- It's beautiful!
- Isn't it?
May I inquire as to the occasion?
Does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter?
Go on.
Actually... I had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today.
The ceremony?
Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony.
I knew it!
Commodore Norrington, as he's about to become.
A fine gentleman, don't you think?
He fancies you, you know.
Elizabeth? How's it coming?
- It's difficult to say.
- It's the latest fashion in London.
Women in London must've learned not to breathe!
My Lord, you have a visitor.
Mr. Turner! Good to see you again.
Good day, sir. I have your order.
The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle.
If I may?
Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the width of the blade.
Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the width of the blade.
Impressive. Very impressive.
Commodore Norrington's going to be very pleased with this.
Do pass my compliments onto your master.
I shall.
A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated.
Elizabeth!
You look absolutely stunning!
Will! It's so good to see you!
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?
- Elizabeth, is that proper?
- About the day we met. Remember?
How could I forget, Miss Swann?
How many times must I ask you to call me Elizabeth?
At least once more, Miss Swann.
As always.
There. See? At least the boy has a sense of propriety.
We really must be going.
Good day, Mr. Turner.
Come along!
Good day...
Elizabeth.
Hold up there, you!
It's a shilling to tie up your boat to the dock.
I need to know your name.
What do you say to three shillings and we forget the name?
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.
Two paces... march!
Right about... face!
Present... arms!
This dock is off limits to civilians.
This dock is off limits to civilians.
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one, I shall inform you.
There's some high-toned and fancy to-do at the fort.
How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen did not merit an invitation?
We have to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians.
It's a fine goal, to be sure, but it seems to me, a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous.
The Dauntless is the power in these waters, but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
I've heard of one. It's supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable.
The Black Pearl.
There's no real ship that can match the Interceptor.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
- No, it's not.
- It is. I've seen it!
- You've seen it?
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it!
- Yes, I have!
You've seen a ship with black sails, that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that Hell itself spat him back out?
- No.
- No.
But I have seen a ship with black sails.
No ship not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil,
Hell spat him back out, could have black sails, so couldn't be any other ship than The Black Pearl.
Is that what you're saying?
No.
Like I said, there's no real ship that can match the Interceptor...
You! Get away from there!
You don't have permission to be aboard!
I'm sorry, but it's such a pretty boat. Ship!
- What's your name?
- Smith! Or Smithy, if you like.
What's your purpose in Port Royal,
'Mr. Smith'?
- And no lies!
- All right. I confess.
I intend to commandeer a ship, pick up a crew in Tortuga,
I intend to commandeer a ship, pick up a crew in Tortuga, rape, pillage and otherwise pilfer my black guts out.
- I said no lies!
- I think he's telling the truth.
If he were telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us.
Unless he knew you wouldn't believe the truth even if he told you.
May I have a moment?
You look lovely, Elizabeth.
I apologize if I seem forward, but I must speak my mind.
This promotion throws into sharp relief that which I have not yet achieved.
A marriage to a fine woman.
You have become a fine woman.
I can't breathe!
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.
Then they made me their chief.
Elizabeth?
Elizabeth!
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!
- Will you be saving her?
- I can't swim!
Pride of the King's Navy, you are!
Do not lose these.
What was that?
I got her!
- She's not breathing!
- Move!
- I never would've thought of that.
- You've never been to Singapore.
Where did you get that?
On your feet.
Elizabeth!
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
- Shoot him!
- Father!
Commodore, do you intend to kill my rescuer?
I believe thanks are in order.
Had a brush with the East India
Trading Company, pirate?
Hang him!
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.
Well, well. Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir.
I don't see your ship... 'Captain'.
I'm in the market, as it were.
He said he'd come to commandeer one.
I told you he was telling the truth.
These are his.
No additional shot nor powder.
A compass that doesn't point north.
I half expected it to be made from wood.
You are without doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of!
But you have heard of me.
Commodore, I must protest!
Carefully, Lieutenant.
Pirate or not, this man saved my life!
One good deed is not enough to redeem a man for his wickedness!
- It seems enough to condemn him.
- Indeed.
Finally.
- Don't shoot!
- I knew you'd warm up to me.
Commodore Norrington, my effects, please. And my hat.
Commodore.
- Elizabeth... it is Elizabeth?
- It's Miss Swann.
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, dear, we don't have all day.
If you'll be very kind.
Easy on the goods, darling.
- You're despicable.
- Sticks and stones, love.
I saved your life, you saved mine.
We're square.
Gentlemen, my lady, you will always remember this as the day you almost caught...
Captain Jack Sparrow!
- Now will you shoot him?
- Open fire!
On his heels!
Take cover, man!
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows.
I would hate for him to miss it.
Search up the stairs!
Look lively, men!
Right where I left you.
Not where I left you.
You're the one they're hunting.
The pirate!
You seem familiar.
Have I threatened you before?
I avoid familiarity with pirates.
It would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. Excuse me.
Do you think this wise, boy?
Crossing blades with a pirate?
You threatened Miss Swann.
Only a little.
You know what you're doing.
Excellent form. How's your footwork?
If I step here...
Good.
And now I step again.
Ta.
That is a wonderful trick.
Except, once again, you are between me and my way out.
And now... you have no weapon.
Who makes all these?
I do.
And I practice with them three hours a day.
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.
Or, the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet.
You're not a eunuch, are you?
I practice three hours a day so when I meet a pirate, I can kill him!
- You cheated!
- Pirate.
- Move away!
- No.
Please?
No! I cannot just step aside and let you escape.
This shot is not meant for you.
There he is! Over here!
Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've assisted in the capture of a fugitive.
Just doing my civic duty, sir.
I trust you will remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped.
Take him away.
- Come here, boy. Come here.
- Who wants a juicy bone?
Come here, boy!
You can keep doing that forever.
The dog is never going to move.
Excuse us if we haven't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet.
There you go, miss. It was a difficult day for you, I'm sure.
I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose, but I wasn't prepared for it.
I meant you being threatened by that pirate! Sounds terrifying!
Yes, it was terrifying.
But... the Commodore proposed!
Fancy that.
That's a smart match, miss, if it's not too bold to say.
It is a smart match.
He's a fine man.
He's what any woman should dream of marrying.
That Will Turner... he's a fine man, too.
That is too bold.
Beggin' your pardon.
It was not my place.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
No, she hasn't.
She has had a trying day.
- Ghastly weather, don't you think?
- Really bleak.
What's that?
Cannon fire!
Return fire!
I know those guns.
It's the Pearl.
The Black Pearl?
I've heard stories.
She's been preying on ships and settlements for ten years.
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?
Then where do the stories come from, I wonder?
Mama!
- Sight the muzzle flash.
- Aim for the flashes!
I need a full spread, fore and aft.
Mr. Stevens, more cartridges.
Governor. Barricade yourself in my office.
That's an order.
Don't!
Hello, chum.
Up there!
Miss Swann, they've come to kidnap you.
- What?
- You're the governor's daughter!
In here!
They haven't seen you.
First chance you get, run to the fort.
Gotcha!
No! It's hot. I'm burning!
Come on!
Come on, me men.
We know you're here, poppet.
- Poppet!
- Come out.
We promise we won't hurt you.
We will find you, poppet.
You've got something of ours and it calls to us.
The gold calls to us.
The gold.
Hello, poppet.
Parley.
- What?
- I invoke the right of parley.
The Code of the Brethren states you have to take me to your captain.
I know the Code.
You can do me no harm until the parley is complete.
- To blazes with the Code.
- She wants to be taken to the Captain.
And she'll go, without a fuss.
We must honor the Code.
Say goodbye!
Goodbye.
- Come on.
- Elizabeth.
Out of my way, scum!
My sympathies. You've no manner of luck at all.
Come on, doggy! It's just you and me now.
It's you and old Jack. Come on.
That's a boy! Get your bone!
That's a good boy.
A bit closer!
That's it, doggy!
Come on, you filthy, slimy, mangy character!
No! I didn't mean it!
This ain't the armory!
Well, well, well. Look what we have here, Twigg. Captain Jack Sparrow!
Last time I saw you, you were all alone on a godforsaken island, shrinking into the distance.
His fortunes aren't improved much.
Worry about your own fortunes, gentlemen.
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers.
So there is a curse.
- That's interesting.
- You know nothing of Hell.
That's very interesting.
I didn't know we was takin' on captives.
She's invoked the right of parley with Captain Barbossa.
- I am here to...
- You will speak when spoken to.
And ye will not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley.
Aye, sir.
My apologies, miss.
Captain Barbossa... I am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities.
There are a lot of long words there.
We're naught but humble pirates.
- What is it you want?
- Leave and never come back.
I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request.
Means "no."
Very well.
I'll drop it.
Me holds are burstin' with swag.
That bit of shine matters to us?
Why?
It's what you've been searching for.
I recognize the ship.
I saw it eight years ago on the crossing from England!
Did you now?
Fine. I suppose if it is worthless there's no point in me keeping it.
No!
You have a name, missy?
Elizabeth... Turner. I'm a maid in the Governor's household.
Miss Turner!
- Turner!
- Bootstrap!
How does a maid come to own that trinket? Family heirloom?
I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
You hand it over and we'll leave and never return.
Our bargain?
Still the guns and stow them. Signal the men and make good to clear port.
You have to take me to shore.
According to the Code...
First...
Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations so I must do nothing.
Secondly, you must be a pirate for the
Pirate's Code to apply, and you're not.
Thirdly, the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.
They've taken Elizabeth!
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.
We have to hunt them down.
We must save her.
Where do you propose we start?
If you have any information concerning my daughter, share it.
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.
Mentioned it is more what he did.
Ask him where it is!
He could lead us to it.
No.
The pirates left Sparrow in his cell, ergo they are not his allies.
We will establish their most likely course...
That's not good enough!
Mr. Turner, you are not a military man or a sailor. You are a blacksmith.
And this is not the moment for rash actions!
Do not think you are the only man here who cares for Elizabeth.
Please.
- You! Sparrow!
- Aye?
You are familiar with the Black Pearl?
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?
Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants sail from the Isla de Muerta.
It's an island that cannot be found, except by those who know where it is.
The ship's real, therefore its anchorage must be a real place. Where?
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.
You want to turn pirate yourself.
Is that it?
Never!
- They took Miss Swann.
- So it is that you found a girl!
I see!
If you intend to brave all, hasten to her rescue, and so, win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone, mate.
I see no profit in it for me.
- I can get you out of here.
- The key's run off.
I helped build these cells.
These are half-pin barrel hinges.
With leverage and the proper application of strength, the door will lift free.
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.
That would be short for William,
I imagine. Good, strong name.
No doubt named for your father.
Yes.
Mr. Turner, I've changed me mind.
If you spring me from here,
I swear, on pain of death,
I shall take you to the Black Pearl, and your bonny lass.
Do we have an accord?
- Agreed.
- Agreed! Get me out!
- Hurry! Someone will have heard that.
- Not without my effects.
We're going to steal a ship?
- That ship?
- Commandeer.
We're going to "commandeer" that ship.
Nautical term.
One question about your business, or there's no use going.
This girl, how far are you willing to go to save her?
- I'd die for her.
- Good. No worries then.
This is either madness or brilliance.
It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide.
Everyone stay calm!
We're taking over the ship.
Aye! Avast!
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.
You'll never make it out of the bay.
Son... I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Savvy?
- Commodore!
- They're taking the Dauntless!
Commodore! They've taken the ship!
Sparrow and Turner!
They're taking the Dauntless!
Rash, Turner. Too rash.
That is, without doubt, the worst pirate
I have ever seen.
Here they come.
Bring her around!
Search every cabin, every hold, down to the bilges.
Sailors, back to the Interceptor!
Thank you, Commodore, for getting us ready to make way.
We'd have had a hard time by ourselves.
Set topsails and clear up this mess.
With this wind we won't catch them.
I don't need to. Get them in range of the long nines.
Run out the guns!
We are to fire on our own ship, sir?
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate.
Commodore!
He's disabled the rudder chain.
Abandon ship!
That's got to be the best pirate
I've ever seen.
So it would seem.
When I was a lad living in England, my mother raised me by herself.
After she died, I came here, looking for my father.
Is that so?
My father, Bill Turner?
It was only after you learned my name you agreed to help.
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.
I'm not a simpleton.
You knew my father.
I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner.
Everyone else just called him
"Bootstrap".
Bootstrap?
Good man. Good pirate.
I swear, you look just like him.
It's not true. He was a merchant sailor.
A respectable man who obeyed the law.
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.
My father was not a pirate!
Put it away, son.
It's not worth you getting beat again.
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
That's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it?
As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention.
The only rules that matter are these:
What a man can do and what a man can't do.
You can accept your father was a pirate and a good man, or you can't.
Pirate is in your blood, so you'll have to square with that someday.
Me, for example,
I can let you drown, but I can't bring this ship into Tortuga all by me onesies, savvy?
So.
Can you sail under the command of a pirate?
Or can you not?
Tortuga?
Tortuga.
It is a sad life that has never breathed deep the sweet, proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga. Savvy?
What do you think?
- It'll linger.
- I'll tell you, mate, if every town were like this one, no man would ever feel unwanted.
Scarlett!
Not sure I deserved that.
Not sure I deserved that.
Giselle.
Giselle.
- Who was she?
- What?
I may have deserved that.
Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot!
Mother's love!
Jack!
You should know not to wake a man when he's sleepin'.
- It's bad luck.
- Fortunately, I know how to counter it.
The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink.
The man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to his proposition.
Aye, that'll about do it.
Blast! I'm already awake!
That was for the smell.
Keep a sharp eye.
Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n?
Now, what's the nature of this venture of your'n?
I'm going after the Black Pearl.
I know where it's going to be, and I'm gonna take it.
Jack, it's a fool's errand.
You know better than me the tales of the Black Pearl.
That's why I know what Barbossa is up to.
All I need is a crew.
Captain Barbossa is not a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one.
It's a good thing I'm not a fool, then.
Prove me wrong. What makes you think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?
Let's just say it's a matter of leverage.
The kid?
That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner.
His only child. Savvy?
Is he now?
Leverage, says you.
I feel a change in the wind, says I.
I'll find us a crew. There's bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you.
One can only hope.
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!
- Take what you can!
- Give nothin' back!
You'll be dining with the captain, and he requests you wear this.
Tell him that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
He said you'd say that.
He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew.
And you'll be naked.
Fine.
There's no need to stand on ceremony, no call to impress anyone.
You must be hungry.
Try the wine.
And the apples. One of those next.
It's poisoned.
There would be no sense to be killing you.
Then release me. You have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.
You don't know what this is, do you?
It's a pirate medallion.
This is Aztec gold.
One of 882 identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Cortés.
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies.
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies.
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.
So the heathen gods placed upon the gold... a terrible curse.
Any mortal that removes but a single piece from that stone chest... shall be punished for eternity.
Shall be punished for eternity.
I hardly believe in ghost stories any more, Captain Barbossa.
Aye.
That's exactly what I thought when we were first told the tale.
Buried on an island of the dead what cannot be found, except for those who know where it is.
Find it, we did.
There be the chest.
Inside be the gold.
And we took 'em all!
We spent 'em and traded 'em, and frittered 'em away on drink and food and pleasurable company.
The more we gave 'em away, the more we came to realize... the drink would not satisfy.
Food turned to ash in our mouths,
Food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust.
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.
Compelled by greed we were, but now... we are consumed by it.
There is one way we can end our curse.
All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be restored, and the blood repaid.
Thanks to ye, we have the final piece.
And the blood to be repaid?
That's why there's no sense to be killing you.
Yet.
Apple?
I'm curious. After killing me, what are you planning on doing next?
Look!
The moonlight shows us for what we really are.
We are not among the living and so we cannot die.
We are not among the living and so we cannot die.
But neither are we dead.
For too long I've been parched of thirst and unable to quench it.
Too long I've been starvin' to death and haven't died.
Too long I've been starvin' to death and haven't died.
I feel nothing.
Not the wind on my face, nor the spray of the sea... nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.
You best start believing in ghost stories, Miss Turner.
You're in one!
What are you looking at?
Back to work!
You heard the captain.
Back to work.
Feast your eyes, Captain. All of them, faithful hands before the mast.
Every man worth his salt, and crazy to boot.
So this is your able-bodied crew?
- You, sailor!
- Cotton, sir.
Mr. Cotton, do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death?
- Mr. Cotton. Answer, man!
- He's a mute, sir.
Poor devil had his tongue cut out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him.
No one's yet figured how.
Mr. Cotton's parrot, same question.
Wind in your sails!
Wind in your sails!
Mostly, we figure that means "yes".
Of course it does. Satisfied?
Well, you've proved they're mad.
What's the benefit for us?
Anamaria!
- I suppose you didn't deserve that.
- No, that one I deserved.
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...
Borrowed without permission, but with every intention of bringing it back.
- But you didn't!
- You'll get another one.
- I will.
- A better one.
A better one!
- That one.
- What one?
That one?
Aye. That one.
- What say you?
- Aye!
Aye!
Anchor's aweigh!
No, it's frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.
It'll be far worse not to have her.
How can we sail to an island that nobody can find, with a compass that doesn't work?
The compass doesn't point north, but we're not trying to find north, are we?
We should drop canvas, sir.
She can hold a bit longer.
What's in your head as puts you in such a fine mood, Cap'n?
We're catching up.
Time to go, poppet.
Dead men tell no tales.
Chills the bones, how many honest sailors been claimed by this passage.
How is it that Jack came by that compass?
Not a lot's known about Jack Sparrow before he came to Tortuga with a mind to find the treasure of the Isla de Muerta.
That was before I'd met him, when he was captain of the Black Pearl.
What?
- He failed to mention that.
- He plays things close to the vest now.
And a hard-learned lesson it was.
Three days into the trip, the first mate says, "Everything's an equal share."
"The location of the treasure, too."
So Jack gives up the bearings.
That night, there was a mutiny.
They marooned Jack on an island and left him to die.
But not before he'd gone mad with the heat.
So that's the reason for all the...
Reason's got nothing to do with it.
When a pirate's marooned, he's given a pistol with a single shot. One shot.
That won't do much good hunting, nor to be rescued.
But after three weeks of a starving belly and thirst, that pistol looks real friendly.
But Jack escaped the island, and still has that single shot.
He won't use it, though, save on one man.
His mutinous first mate.
- Barbossa.
- Aye.
- How did Jack get off the island?
- I'll tell ye.
He waded out into the shallows, and waited three days and three nights, till all manner of sea creatures became acclimated to his presence.
On the fourth morning, he roped a couple of sea turtles, lashed them together and made a raft.
- He roped a couple of sea turtles.
- Aye.
What did he use for rope?
Human hair.
From my back.
- Let go the anchor!
- Lower the anchor line!
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.
Young Mr. Turner and I are to go ashore.
Captain.
What if the worst should happen?
- Keep to the Code.
- Aye. The Code.
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- Now we finally get to spend it.
Once we're quit of the curse, we'll be rich men... and you can buy an eye that fits and is made of glass.
This one does splinter something terrible.
Stop rubbing it.
What code is Gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?
Pirates' Code.
Any man who falls behind is left behind.
No heroes amongst thieves.
For having such a bleak outlook on pirates you're well on your way to becoming one.
Sprung a man from jail, commandeered a ship of the fleet, sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga... and you're completely obsessed with treasure.
That's not true. I am not obsessed with treasure.
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.
Gentlemen, the time has come!
Salvation is nigh!
- Our torment is nearing an end!
- Elizabeth.
For ten years we've been tested and tried and each man here has proved his mettle a hundred times over and a hundred times again!
Suffered, I have!
Punished we were, the lot of us, disproportionate to our crime!
Here it is!
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.
Every last piece that went astray, we have returned.
Save for this!
- Jack!
- Not yet.
We wait for the opportune moment.
When's that? When it's of greatest profit to you?
May I ask you something?
Have I ever given you reason not to trust me?
Do us a favor. I know it's difficult for you, but please stay here.
And try not to do anything stupid.
Who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet be paid?
Hers!
You know the first thing I'm going to do after the curse is lifted?
Eat a whole bushel of apples!
Begun by blood.
By blood undone.
Sorry, Jack.
I'm not going to be your leverage.
That's it?
Waste not.
Did it work?
- I don't feel no different.
- How do we tell?
You're not dead!
No.
- He shot me.
- It didn't work.
The curse is still upon us!
You! Maid! Your father, what was his name?
Was your father William Turner?
No.
Where's his child who sailed from England eight years ago?
The child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner? Where?
You two!
You brought us the wrong person!
No!
She had the medallion.
She's the proper age.
She said her name was Turner.
You heard her.
I think she lied to us.
You brought us here for nothing.
I won't take questioning, not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.
Who's to blame him? Your decisions have led us from bad to worse!
It was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths!
And it's you who brought us here in the first place!
If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak!
I say we cut her throat and spill all her blood. Just in case.
Yeah!
The medallion! She's taken it!
Get after her, you feckless pack of ingrates!
- Where are the oars?
- There's no oars!
The oars have gone missing!
Find them!
You!
- You're supposed to be dead.
- Am I not?
Pearlie...
Palu-li-la-la-lulu...
Parlili...
Parsnip... Parsley...
Partner...
- Parley?
- That's the one! Parley!
Parley!
Parley?
Damn to the depths whatever muttonhead thought of parley!
That would be the French.
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.
Mr. Gibbs?
Hey, boy, where be Jack?
Jack Sparrow?
He fell behind.
Keep to the Code.
Weigh anchor! Hoist the sails!
Split-quick, you dibbies!
How the blazes did you get off that island?
When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, you forgot one very important thing.
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Well, I won't be making that mistake again.
Gents, you all remember
Captain Jack Sparrow?
Aye.
Kill him.
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?
Hold your fire!
You know whose blood we need.
I know whose blood you need.
What sort of a man trades a man's life for a ship?
A pirate.
Here. Let me.
Thank you.
You said you gave Barbossa my name as yours.
Why?
I don't know.
I'm sorry. A blacksmith's hands.
- They're rough.
- No. I mean, yes, they are, but...
Don't stop.
Elizabeth.
It's yours.
I thought I'd lost it the day they rescued me.
It was a gift from my father.
He sent it to me.
Why did you take it?
Because I was afraid that you were a pirate.
That would've been awful.
It wasn't your blood they needed.
It was my father's blood.
My blood.
- The blood of a pirate.
- Will, I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.
So you expect to leave me on some beach with nothing but a name and your word it's the one I need, and watch you sail away in my ship.
No.
I expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name at all, watching me sail away on my ship, and then I'll shout the name back to you.
Savvy?
But that still leaves me standing on some beach, with naught but a name and your word it's the one I need.
Of the two of us, I am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny.
Therefore, my word is the one we'll be trusting.
Although, I suppose I should be thanking you because, in fact, if you hadn't betrayed me and left me to die,
I would have an equal share in that curse, same as you.
Funny old world, isn't it?
Captain! We're coming up on the Interceptor.
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.
What say we run up a flag of truce,
I scurry over to the Interceptor, and I negotiate the return of your medallion?
Now that's exactly the attitude that lost you the Pearl.
People are easier to search when they're dead.
Lock him in the brig.
Hands aloft to loose ta'gallants!
With this wind, she'll carry every sail we've got.
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl is gaining on us!
This is the fastest ship in the Caribbean.
Tell them that after they've caught us.
- We're shallower on the draft, right?
- Aye.
Then can't we lose them on those shoals?
We don't have to outrun 'em long.
Just long enough.
Lighten the ship!
Stem to stern!
Anything we can afford to lose, see that it's lost!
Apparently, there's a leak.
Haul on the main brace!
Make ready the guns!
And run out the sweeps.
We're gonna need that.
It was a good plan, up till now.
Gibbs!
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!
- Load the guns!
- With what?
Anything! Everything!
Anything we have left.
Load the guns!
Case shot and langrage!
Nails and crushed glass!
With a will!
The Pearl will luff up on our port quarter.
She'll rake us without presenting a target.
Lower the anchor on the right side.
On the starboard side!
- It has the element of surprise.
- You're daft, lady. You both are.
Daft like Jack.
Lower the starboard anchor!
Do it, you gobs, or it's you we'll load into the cannons!
Let go!
They're club hauling.
Hard a port! Rack the starboard oars!
Hard a port!
Keep her steady, man.
- Now!
- Fire!
Fire all!
Stop blowing holes in my ship!
- We need more ideas, lass!
- It's your turn!
- We need us a devil's dowry!
- We'll give them her!
She's not what they're after.
The medallion.
Strike your colors, you bloomin' cockroaches!
Hands, grapnels at the ready!
Prepare to board!
Pistols and cutlasses, men!
Koehler, Twigg, to the powder magazine!
And the rest of you, bring me the medallion!
Below!
Thanks very much.
Jack!
Bloody empty!
That's not very nice.
- Where is the medallion?
- Wretch!
Where is dear William?
Will.
Elizabeth!
Monkey!
I can't move it!
Elizabeth!
- Thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.
Gents! Our hope is restored!
Any of you so much as thinks the word "parley",
I'll have your guts for garters!
Will.
You godless pirate!
Welcome back, miss.
You took advantage of our hospitality last time.
It holds fair now you return the favor.
Barbossa!
Will.
She goes free!
What's in your head, boy?
She goes free.
You've only got one shot, and we can't die.
Don't do anything stupid.
You can't. I can.
Like that.
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.
A distant cousin of my aunt's nephew, twice removed.
Lovely singing voice, though. Eunuch.
My name is Will Turner!
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.
His blood runs in my veins.
It's the spitting image of old
Bootstrap Bill come back to haunt us.
On my word, do as I say, or I'll pull this trigger, and be lost to Davy Jones' locker!
Name your terms, Mr. Turner.
- Elizabeth goes free!
- Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?
And the crew. The crew are not to be harmed.
Agreed.
Barbossa, you lying bastard.
You swore she'd go free.
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she'd go free.
It was you who failed to specify when or where.
Though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine, don't it, lads?
So I'll be havin' that dress back before you go.
I always liked you.
Goes with your black heart.
It's still warm.
Off you go.
Come on.
Too long.
I'd really rather hoped we were past all this.
Jack. Jack!
Did you not notice?
That be the same island that we made you governor of on our last little trip.
I did notice.
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure up another miraculous escape.
But I doubt it.
Off you go.
Last time you left me a pistol with one shot.
By the powers, you're right.
Where be Jack's pistol?
Bring it forward.
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols.
It'll be one pistol as before, and you can be the gentleman and shoot the lady, and starve to death yourself.
That's the second time
I've watched that man take my ship.
You were marooned on this island before.
We can escape in the same way.
To what point and purpose, young missy?
The Black Pearl is gone. Unless you have a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...
Unlikely.
...young Mr. Turner will be dead long before you can reach him.
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.
You vanished from under the eyes of seven agents of the East India Company.
You sacked Nassau port without even firing a shot.
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?
How did you escape last time?
Last time I was here a grand total of three days.
Last time... the rum runners used this island as a cache.
They came by and I was able to barter passage off.
From the looks of things, they've long been out of business.
You probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.
So that's it, then?
That's the secret, grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow.
You spent three days lying on a beach drinking rum.
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.
We're devils, we're black sheep
We're really bad eggs
Drink up, me hearties, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me
I love this song!
Really bad eggs!
When I get the Pearl back,
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time.
You will be the most fearsome pirates in the Spanish Main.
Not just the Spanish Main, love.
The entire ocean.
The entire world!
Wherever we want to go, we go.
That's what a ship is.
It's not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails.
That's what a ship needs.
But what a ship is...
What the Black Pearl really is... is freedom.
Jack...
It must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island.
Oh, yes.
But the company is infinitely better than last time.
And the scenery has definitely improved.
Mr. Sparrow!
I'm not entirely sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk.
I know exactly what you mean, love.
To freedom!
To the Black Pearl!
No!
Not good! Stop!
Not good! What are you doing?
You've burned all the food, the shade, the rum.
- Yes, the rum is gone.
- Why is the rum gone?
One, because it is a vile drink that turns respectable men into scoundrels.
Two, that signal is over 1,000 feet high.
The entire Royal Navy is looking for me.
Do you think there is the slightest chance they won't see it?
But why is the rum gone?
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.
You give it one hour, maybe two, keep a weather eye open, and you will see white sails on that horizon.
"Must've been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack."
Well, it bloody is now!
There'll be no living with her after this.
- But we've got to save Will.
- No.
You're safe now. We will return to Port Royal immediately, not go gallivanting after pirates.
Then we condemn him to death.
The boy's fate is regrettable, but so is his decision to engage in piracy.
To rescue me. To prevent anything from happening to me.
If I may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion.
The Pearl was listing to scuppers after the battle. She won't make good time.
Think about it. The Black Pearl.
The last real pirate threat in the Caribbean, mate.
How can you pass that up?
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.
Commodore, I beg you, please do this for me.
As a wedding gift.
Elizabeth?
Are you accepting the Commodore's proposal?
I am.
A wedding. I love weddings.
Drinks all around!
I know. "Clap him in irons," right?
Mr. Sparrow, you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us with a bearing to Isla de Muerta.
Then contemplate all possible meanings of the phrase "silent as the grave".
- Do I make myself clear?
- Inescapably clear.
Shiver me timbers.
Cotton here says you missed a bit.
You knew William Turner.
Old Bootstrap Bill, we knew him.
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.
Never sat well with Bootstrap, what we did to Jack Sparrow, the mutiny and all.
He said it wasn't right with the Code.
That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you.
He said we deserved to be cursed, and remain cursed.
- Stupid blighter.
- Good man.
But, as you can imagine, that didn't sit too well with the Captain.
That didn't sit too well with the Captain at all.
- Tell him what Barbossa did.
- I'm telling the story!
So what the captain did, he strapped a cannon to Bootstrap's bootstraps.
Bootstrap's bootstraps!
Last we saw of old Bill Turner, he was sinking into the crushin' black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker!
It was only after that we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse.
That's what you call ironic.
Bring him.
I don't care for the situation.
Any attempt to storm the caves could turn into an ambush.
Not if you're the one doing the ambushing.
I go in and get Barbossa to send his men out in their little boats.
Your mates return to the Dauntless and blast them with your cannons.
What do you have to lose?
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.
Now, to be honest, there's a risk to those aboard the Dauntless, which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.
- It's for your own safety.
- I don't care, I have to tell him!
The pirates are cursed!
They can't be killed!
He's already informed of that. A mermaid flopped up on deck and told the story.
This is Jack Sparrow's doing!
No reason to fret. A prick of the finger, a few drops of blood...
No mistakes this time. He's only half-Turner. We spill it all!
Guess there is reason to fret.
- Beg your pardon.
- Begun by blood. By blood...
Jack!
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.
Where's Elizabeth?
Safe, like I promised. She's set to marry Norrington, like she promised, and you get to die for her like you promised.
So we're all men of our word, except for Elizabeth, who is a woman.
Shut up! You're next!
- You don't want to be doing that.
- No, I think I do.
Your funeral.
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Because...
The HMS Dauntless, pride of the Royal Navy, is floating just offshore waiting for you.
What are we doing here?
The pirates come out, unprepared and unawares.
We catch 'em in a crossfire and send 'em down to see Old Hob.
I meant, why aren't we doing what Mr. Sparrow said we should do?
- With the cannons and all?
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.
You think he wasn't telling the truth?
Hear me out, mate.
Order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best,
Robert's your uncle, Fanny's your aunt... There you are with two ships.
The makings of your own fleet.
You'll take the grandest as your flagship and who's to argue?
But what of the Pearl?
Name me captain, I'll sail under your colors and give you 10% of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?
And in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp.
Not at all. By all means, kill the whelp. Just not yet.
Wait to lift the curse until the opportune moment.
For instance... after you've killed Norrington's men.
Every... last... one.
You've planned this ever since you learned my name.
Yeah.
I want 50% of your plunder.
I'll buy you the hat.
A really big one.
Commodore.
We have an accord.
All hands to the boats!
Apologies. You give the orders.
Gents... take a walk!
Not to the boats?
Hold fire.
This is like what the Greeks done at Troy.
Except they was in a horse, instead of dresses. Wooden horse.
A moment, please.
Elizabeth?
I want you to know I believe you made a very good decision today.
Couldn't be more proud of you.
But a good decision, if made for the wrong reasons, can be a wrong decision.
Lieutenant.
Elizabeth?
Are you there?
Are you even listening to me?
What have you done?
Stop that! I already feel like a fool.
You look nice, though.
I look nice?
I must admit, Jack, I thought
I had you figured but it turns out you're a hard man to predict.
I'm dishonest. And a dishonest man you can trust to be dishonest.
Honestly, it's the honest ones you want to watch out for.
You can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid.
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters!
Right.
What would you eat first?
We should decide now so we're ready when the time comes.
What was that?
Miss Elizabeth!
Make for the ship! Move!
To the ship!
Row, men!
You can't beat me, Jack.
That's interesting.
I couldn't resist, mate.
Sorry!
What now, Jack Sparrow?
Are we to be two immortals, locked in an epic battle until Judgment Day?
Or you could surrender.
All of you with me. Will is in that cave and we must save him.
Ready, and... heave!
I need your help. Come on!
Any port in a storm.
Cotton's right. We've got the Pearl.
- Are you gonna leave Jack?
- Jack owes us a ship.
- There's the Code to consider.
- The Code?
You're pirates. Hang the Code and hang the rules!
They're more like guidelines.
Bloody pirates!
Is it supposed to be doing that?
They're stealing our ship.
Bloody pirates!
Boarders away.
Come on!
Me eye!
I'll teach you the meaning of pain.
You like pain?
Try wearing a corset.
Whose side is Jack on?
At the moment?
No fair!
Ten years you carry that pistol and now you waste your shot.
He didn't waste it.
I feel... cold.
Parley?
- The ship is ours, gentlemen.
- Huzzah!
Huzzah! Huzzah!
We should return to the Dauntless.
Your fiancé will want to know you're safe.
If you were waiting for the opportune moment... that was it.
Now, I'd be much obliged if you'd drop me off at my ship.
I'm sorry, Jack.
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.
Jack Sparrow...
Captain Jack Sparrow.
...for your crimes against the Crown.
Said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature.
The most egregious of these to be cited herewith:
Piracy, smuggling...
This is wrong.
Commodore Norrington is bound by the law, as are we all.
...impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England, sailing under false colors, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation and general lawlessness.
For these crimes, you are sentenced to be hung by the neck until dead.
May God have mercy on your soul.
Governor Swann.
Commodore.
Elizabeth.
I should have told you every day from the moment I met you...
I love you.
Watch yourself!
Marines!
I can't breathe.
Elizabeth!
Move!
I thought we might have to endure some ill-conceived escape attempt, but not from you.
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.
And this is how you thank me?
By throwing in your lot with him?
- He's a pirate.
- And a good man.
If this means the hangman will earn two pairs of boots instead of one, so be it.
My conscience will be clear.
You forget your place, Turner.
It's right here, between you and Jack.
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.
Lower your weapons.
Put them down!
So this is where your heart truly lies?
It is.
I'm feeling good about this.
We've all arrived at a special place.
Spiritually, ecumenically, grammatically.
I want you to know that I was rooting for you, mate.
Know that.
Elizabeth.
It would never have worked between us, darling.
I'm sorry.
Will.
Nice hat.
Friends.
This is the day that you will always remember as the day that...
Idiot. He's nowhere to go but back to the noose.
Sail ho!
What's your plan of action?
Sir!
Perhaps on the rare occasion, pursuing the right course demands an act of piracy.
Piracy itself can be the right course.
Mr. Turner.
I will accept the consequences of my actions.
This is a beautiful sword.
I expect the man who made it to show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life.
Thank you.
Commodore! What about Sparrow?
I think we can afford to give him one day's head start.
So...
This is the path you've chosen, is it?
After all, he is a blacksmith.
No.
He's a pirate.
Thought you were supposed to keep to the Code?
We figured they were more actual... guidelines.
Thank you.
Captain Sparrow.
The Black Pearl is yours.
On deck, you scabrous dogs! Hands to braces! Let go and haul to run free!
Now... bring me that horizon.
And really bad eggs
Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!
{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{1338}{1426}You better have a look at this, sir.
{1449}{1509}- Commercial flight.|- No. Too fast, sir.
{1515}{1605}- One of our own?|- Air Force has nothing scheduled.
{1611}{1691}We've got ourselves a bogey.
{2086}{2198}Orange Leader to Delta Group,|anticipate visual contact...
{2204}{2271}now.
{2277}{2329}Holy cow pie!
{2335}{2383}Hi. Nice antiques.
{2389}{2450}Gotta blast.
{2456}{2545}Fusion mix, stable. Engines cycling|at one million gigajoules.
{2551}{2589}Cool. We didn't blow up.
{2595}{2630}Great.
{2636}{2717}Jimmy, I think they want us to pull over.
{2723}{2788}No time for that, Carl.|Stand by with the satellite.
{2794}{2874}OK. What do I do again?
{2880}{2919}You're the deployment system, Carl.
{2925}{3010}As soon as we clear the atmosphere,|you just throw it.
{3016}{3145}- Right.|- Prepare to leave the atmosphere.
{3176}{3250}Sorry about the toast, dear.|I had to make it in the oven.
{3256}{3326}- I can't find our toaster anywhere.|- Looky.
{3332}{3417}This oven toast is brilliant,|sugar booger.
{3423}{3496}And your yolks are|absolutely perfect, too.
{3502}{3548}Run away with me, my love.
{3554}{3612}OK. But we'll have to take my car
{3618}{3688}because your transmission|needs a new compression cuff.
{3694}{3736}Whatever.
{3742}{3782}This is a good one. Quack, quack.
{3788}{3846}Would you call Jimmy?|He's going to miss the bus.
{3852}{3891}Jimmy, breakfast!
{3897}{3941}Time to come down!
{3947}{4014}# Down, down, down, down, quack|Down, down, down, down, quack
{4020}{4065}Up, up, up.
{4071}{4174}Engaging pulse rockets now!
{4186}{4273}- No!|- Now?
{4449}{4505}Is this supposed to happen?
{4511}{4560}Come on. Think.
{4566}{4650}Think. Think.
{4806}{4828}Brain blast.
{4834}{4906}Give me your lunch.
{4931}{5004}Thanks, boy.
{5305}{5394}Don't try that at home.
{5495}{5610}Must engage stabilisers.
{5672}{5717}Now, just a quick stop at my house.
{5723}{5827}I don't know, Jimmy. I gotta get|to school on time. Besides, you...
{5833}{5946}- Right. Gotcha.|- No, I didn't mean... Jimmy!
{5970}{6021}- See you in homeroom.|- OK.
{6027}{6151}Fasten your seat belt, Goddard.|It's gonna be a bumpy ride.
{6704}{6783}Well, what do you know,|the chimney fell off again.
{6789}{6881}Well, that wasn't so bad, huh?
{7033}{7092}James Isaac Neutron.
{7098}{7144}I see you up there.
{7150}{7259}How many times have we told you|not to launch yourself off the roof?
{7265}{7326}Probably nine. Exactly nine.
{7332}{7390}They say repetition is good|for a developing brain.
{7396}{7444}Then what do you think you're doing?
{7450}{7544}Last night I got a message from space,|but it was garbled in the ionosphere,
{7550}{7640}so I had to launch a communications|toaster... I mean, satellite.
{7646}{7714}- And then when I tried...|- Well, message from space. Wow.
{7720}{7769}Don't encourage him, Hugh.
{7775}{7886}Jimmy, we've repeatedly told you|not to talk to strangers.
{7892}{8013}But, Mom, I'm on the verge of contact|with an advanced alien civilisation.
{8019}{8090}I don't care how advanced|they say they are, Jimmy.
{8096}{8188}If your father and I haven't met them,|they're strangers. Right, Hugh?
{8194}{8312}Well, except for policemen.|They're there to help you.
{8460}{8551}You've got to admit that is pretty neat.
{8557}{8657}But very unsafe, honey. That's bad.
{8940}{9051}Deactivate pants.
{9267}{9362}Engage, Gingivitis 2000.
{9677}{9729}Robo-Barber prototype, engage.
{9735}{9784}Online.
{9790}{9848}Ta-da.
{9854}{9934}You rock.
{9955}{10039}You go, girl.
{10155}{10239}Shoe-Bot!
{10667}{10751}Bye, Goddard.
{10766}{10895}- Wait! I'm here!|- Goodbye, son. Have a good day.
{10901}{10989}Goddard, not on the porch.
{11036}{11079}Hey! Hey, wait!
{11085}{11212}Seems like the perfect opportunity|to try out the Super Bubble Gumobile.
{11218}{11295}"No, Jimmy, don't try it. It's too soon."
{11301}{11411}Nonsense. All great inventions|need a test run.
{11632}{11711}All right!
{12139}{12206}Hello!
{12212}{12314}- Right here.|- Hey, look. Neutron's got another one.
{12320}{12437}Nice invention, Nerdtron. Too bad|somebody already invented the bus.
{12443}{12497}Hey, guys, I've got it down this time.
{12503}{12659}Internal combustion's such old science.|Bubble travel is the way of the future.
{12704}{12805}I guess trees are, like, the brakes.
{12941}{12982}Hello?
{12988}{13020}Jimmy?
{13026}{13102}Carl.
{13171}{13215}Careful!
{13221}{13291}Hey!
{13339}{13410}- Thanks.|- That's what I'm here for.
{13416}{13490}- What a day, huh?|- Look at the bright side, Carl.
{13496}{13580}The worst is behind us.
{13589}{13664}And my fossil-to-chromosome ratios|clearly demonstrate
{13670}{13739}that female dinosaurs,|like this plesiosaurus,
{13745}{13803}were the stronger and|smarter of their species.
{13809}{13875}But, so what else is new?
{13881}{13957}After class I'll be happy|to demonstrate how boy dinosaurs
{13963}{14051}got their butts kicked by|girl dinosaurs on a regular basis.
{14057}{14153}Excuse me, but the mandible crest|of Cindy's alleged "plesiosaurus"
{14159}{14270}is that of a male megalosaur, as defined|by the Congress of Palaeontologists.
{14276}{14359}Those findings were inconclusive,|and you know it, Neutron.
{14365}{14401}Hello! Miss Fowl,
{14407}{14541}what is the standard for research|on these extra-credit reports?
{14549}{14721}Yes, well... Let's move along|to "show and tell" now, shall we?
{14726}{14768}This is Ultra Lord.
{14774}{14921}Sheen, this is the seventh week in|a row you've shown Ultra Lord in class.
{14927}{14991}Miss Fowl, this one is different.
{14997}{15079}This "Purple Vengeance" version|with power fists and nuclear knees
{15085}{15194}is a rare, never-been-seen condition,|making it highly collectable.
{15200}{15327}Never been seen, huh? Well, then,|how do you know it's even in there?
{15491}{15556}No!
{15562}{15658}Hey, Jimmy, wanna see a frog?
{15666}{15790}- That looks great, Carl.|- Thanks. What are you drawing?
{15796}{15880}Flycycle modifications for Goddard.|Second prototype.
{15886}{15941}Prototype, huh?
{15947}{16024}- Well, you know, that looks good, too.|- Thanks, Carl.
{16030}{16168}Carl! Would you please share|with us your "show and tell"?
{16174}{16230}OK.
{16236}{16289}This is my inhaler.
{16295}{16372}It provides fast-acting relief|of bronchial swelling
{16378}{16434}due to asthma or allergies.
{16440}{16523}One touch of the button and...
{16559}{16642}- I can't see!|- Thank you, Carl.
{16648}{16737}All right. Next we have...
{16743}{16819}Nick!
{16940}{16989}Yes, Nick.
{16995}{17070}You are a tad tardy again.
{17076}{17123}Oh, my. Am I?
{17129}{17264}It took me a little while to copy my|mom's handwriting for this late note.
{17284}{17338}Your "show and tell", please.
{17344}{17376}How's it goin'?
{17382}{17475}You know, I don't really|do "show and tell".
{17479}{17600}Yes, that's right. Thank you, Nick.
{17607}{17688}- Did you drop this?|- Yes. Well, I...
{17694}{17773}My dropped pencil.
{17779}{17910}Jimmy, we eagerly await|another one of your
{17916}{18021}interesting "show and tells".
{18027}{18113}As a matter of fact,|I brought my latest invention.
{18119}{18184}Behold. The Shrink Ray!
{18190}{18290}What's the matter, Neutron?|Aren't you short enough already?
{18296}{18342}Funny, Cindy.
{18348}{18454}But this device is more suited to shrink|something as vast as space itself,
{18460}{18545}like, say, your mouth.
{18630}{18691}Help me. Help me. I'm so tiny.
{18697}{18765}Just like Jimmy's brain.
{18771}{18819}So much for the Nobel Prize.
{18825}{18860}Children, that's enough.
{18866}{18927}Better luck next time.
{18933}{18984}It worked this morning.
{18990}{19046}I like your useless shrink ray, Jimmy.
{19052}{19155}Well, it's probably just|a programming error.
{19233}{19317}Oh, my.
{19421}{19505}Back! Back! Leviathan!
{19532}{19568}Come on, Jimmy.
{19574}{19694}Some of the greatest inventors started|as complete, hopeless failures, too.
{19700}{19744}- Yeah.|- Well, thank you, Carl.
{19750}{19794}I feel better, I think.
{19800}{19844}- I'm glad.|- That's good.
{19850}{19934}Hey, Retroland Theme Park.|Check it out.
{19940}{20006}Meet Ultra Lord. Live!
{20012}{20099}Look, it's the state-of-the-art,|bone-warping gravity ride.
{20105}{20144}I can hang out with Ultra Lord.
{20150}{20205}And there's a petting zoo.
{20211}{20306}- Well, look at this.|- No, meet Ultra Lord live.
{20312}{20384}Llamas and capybaras.
{20390}{20452}Who cares? Meet Ultra Lord live.
{20458}{20518}Yeah, but I'm gonna touch a llama.
{20524}{20595}Guys, we have got to go to|the grand opening tonight.
{20601}{20633}Yeah!
{20639}{20748}Yeah. But my folks won't|let me stay out after dark.
{20754}{20800}Well, it is a school night.
{20806}{20939}Pukin' Pluto, there's gotta be something|we can do. It's the grand opening.
{20945}{20999}- Sneak out.|- What?
{21005}{21074}You heard me, dweebs. Sneak out.
{21080}{21153}Yeah, but my parents sorta told me...
{21159}{21232}Parents. What, are you guys|gonna be kids forever?
{21238}{21289}What your parents|don't know won't hurt 'em.
{21295}{21410}But, Nick, sneaking out|is so barbaric.
{21416}{21498}Whatever, Neutron.|But there's only one opening night,
{21504}{21640}and anybody who matters|is gonna be there.
{21712}{21770}What d'you think, Jimmy?
{21776}{21863}Nick has a point.|There is only one opening night.
{21869}{21931}Think, think, think, think, think.
{21937}{21999}Well, according to the|{y:i}Newville Journal of Medicine,
{22005}{22076}monkeys are easily influenced|by positive reinforcement,
{22082}{22131}e.g. The giving of a banana.
{22137}{22213}And since human and monkey DNA|only differ by two per cent,
{22219}{22271}the same principle|should work on our parents.
{22277}{22319}My dad's allergic to bananas.
{22325}{22400}It's not the bananas. It's the principle.
{22406}{22445}It's called psychology.
{22451}{22505}All you have to do is butter 'em up.
{22511}{22567}Give it a try. I'll call you guys later.
{22573}{22644}We go to Retroland tonight!
{22650}{22734}Yeah!
{22801}{22867}- Watch out!|- Hey!
{22873}{22957}Hold on!
{23198}{23250}I know.
{23256}{23350}Excuse me, are you|through with that? Thanks.
{23356}{23440}A few oysters.
{23489}{23567}One lump of coal coming up.
{23568}{23647}- Thanks, Gus.|- Hi, Jimmy.
{23653}{23733}Excuse me.
{24039}{24089}Jimmy, is that you, dear?
{24095}{24174}Yeah, Mom. I'll be in in a second.
{24180}{24256}DNA match confirmed.|Welcome home, Jimmy.
{24262}{24331}Eliminate school smell.
{24337}{24412}- Normal odour restored.|- Thank you, Vox.
{24418}{24472}You're welcome.
{24478}{24594}Warning. Entry tube|closed for maintenance.
{24621}{24732}- Thank you, Vox.|- You're welcome.
{24784}{24843}Here, Goddard. Here, boy.
{24849}{24933}Here, Goddard.
{24952}{25035}Hey, look what I brought ya. Aluminium.
{25041}{25097}Do you want it? Do you want it? Huh?
{25103}{25154}Sit.
{25160}{25244}Roll over.
{25261}{25345}Play dead.
{25434}{25557}Mental note: Fix bug|in obedience program.
{25639}{25724}Good boy.
{25773}{25874}OK, Goddard,|let's check the experiments.
{26236}{26300}The invisible hamsters|are looking great...
{26306}{26378}I think.
{26384}{26496}Let's see how|the girl-eating plant is doing.
{26590}{26627}Nice choice.
{26633}{26713}As usual.
{26758}{26818}The latest burping-soda formula.
{26824}{26916}A guaranteed one burp per sip.
{27070}{27154}Excuse you!
{27266}{27349}You know, there's still no reply|to our satellite message.
{27355}{27394}Jeez, it's been a whole day.
{27400}{27483}You'd think we would have heard from|an alien civilisation by now, huh?
{27489}{27575}Well, come on, Goddard.
{27673}{27725}Say "Aah".
{27731}{27798}Add a little sand.
{27804}{27879}And in you go.
{28027}{28120}I'm just an old lump of coal
{28126}{28200}But I'm gonna be a diamond some day
{28206}{28221}Oh, yeah
{28227}{28278}Jimmy.
{28284}{28327}Hi, Mom.
{28333}{28390}Jimmy, you scared|the bejabers out of me.
{28396}{28449}Sorry about your bejabers, Mom.
{28455}{28518}And might I add|how lovely you look today.
{28524}{28591}- I'm covered in transmission fluid.|- Exactly.
{28597}{28678}And might I say,|filth never looked so good.
{28684}{28749}Yes, well, how was|"show and tell" today?
{28755}{28842}Was OK. But first, happy birthday, Mom.
{28848}{28899}Jimmy, these are beautiful.
{28905}{28972}But, sweetie, it's not my birthday.
{28978}{29018}It's not? Well...
{29024}{29162}Then whatever will I do with these|lovely pearls and priceless earrings?
{29168}{29236}- These can't be real.|- But they can.
{29242}{29319}And they are!
{29347}{29416}And all these fabulous gifts|and prizes could be yours
{29422}{29478}if you know the correct answer|to this question.
{29484}{29580}- Please may I go to Retroland tonight?|- No, it's a school night.
{29586}{29689}Thank you so much, Mother.|And might I say...
{29733}{29784}- Did you just say no?|- Yes.
{29790}{29822}- Yes!|- No.
{29828}{29854}- No?|- Yes.
{29860}{29897}- Yes!|- Jimmy...
{29903}{29973}But all my friends are going.
{29979}{30053}And anybody who matters|is gonna be there, Mom.
{30059}{30142}I matter and your father matters|and you matter.
{30148}{30214}But you're not going.|Maybe we can go next weekend.
{30220}{30369}Wait. I'm sure there must be something|else in here to change your mind...
{30457}{30541}No, Jimmy! Look out! Look out, Jimmy!
{30593}{30645}Jimmy, be careful.
{30651}{30735}Mom, get me out!
{30755}{30843}- I didn't do it!|- Stop, drop and roll! My goodness!
{30849}{30924}Goddard.
{31026}{31096}OK, Jimmy. That's the last straw.
{31102}{31190}We have told you time and time again|about playing with rockets.
{31196}{31315}But, Mom, it's technically not a rocket.|It's more of a jet-pack-type thing.
{31321}{31381}I don't care what type thing it is.
{31387}{31481}You just climb those|stair-type things right now.
{31487}{31575}Your father will have a few words|to say to you when he gets home.
{31581}{31617}It's not a rocket.
{31623}{31702}- March.|- Mom...
{32278}{32353}Yes.
{32364}{32427}The king, he loves his little orthgot.
{32433}{32560}Yes, he does. Yes, he does.|Yes, he does.
{32575}{32619}Yes, he does.
{32625}{32787}Sire, my King, it appears to be|some type of alien transmission device.
{32803}{32890}Tell me, when did it become acceptable
{32896}{32976}to approach|my royal throne unannounced?
{32982}{33018}Yes, of course, my King.
{33024}{33109}- Space him!|- I assure you that...
{33269}{33357}Wait!
{33409}{33451}I missed it.
{33457}{33525}- Can I, can I, can I space another?|- No.
{33531}{33588}- Please, brother.|- I said no, Ooblar.
{33594}{33732}- Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please...|- I would love for that to stop.
{33743}{33789}What have we here?
{33795}{33964}As the king's assistant, I am the official|checker of new things to be checked.
{34006}{34068}It's all right. It's all right. I'll handle this.
{34074}{34154}Hello!
{34163}{34234}What galaxy are you from?
{34240}{34298}- Ooblar.|- Where is your leader?
{34304}{34418}Ooblar, stop it. It's toast.
{34437}{34482}Hello, toast.
{34488}{34596}I greatly admire your ship.
{34602}{34692}Beginning transmission from Earth.
{34732}{34783}Greetings from planet Earth.
{34789}{34876}I'm Jimmy Neutron and|you're an alien life form.
{34882}{34937}- I welcome the opportunity...|- What a big head.
{34943}{35102}...for the mutual exchange of scientific|knowledge and universal brotherhood.
{35115}{35176}This here is my dog, Goddard.
{35182}{35270}And this that you're looking at|is my room. That's where I sleep.
{35276}{35365}And this is my mom and dad|right here. Mom, Dad.
{35371}{35456}Freeze that image.
{35516}{35562}They look...
{35568}{35655}delicious.
{35661}{35757}The search is over!
{35974}{36038}But, Dad, all my friends|are gonna be there.
{36044}{36146}I know, son, but if all your friends were|named Cliff, would you jump off them?
{36152}{36208}I don't think you would.|You see, Jimmy...
{36214}{36258}Jimmy. Jim, Jim, Jimmy.
{36264}{36366}Jim, James, son, let me|tell you a little about rockets.
{36372}{36423}They're big-people things, son.
{36429}{36570}And you just can't go around playing|with big-people, fiery, flying things
{36576}{36624}because that's what rockets are.
{36630}{36699}Rockets are flying things.
{36705}{36797}Well, I hope this talk has helped.
{36858}{36919}And, by the way,|Mom says you're grounded.
{36925}{36984}Sorry.
{36990}{37120}What good is it to be a genius if you|can't even go out on a school night?
{37126}{37184}Goddard, options.
{37190}{37262}Apologise. Your parents love you.
{37268}{37298}Next.
{37304}{37363}Create a time capsule.|Escape to the future.
{37369}{37438}That'll take too long. Next.
{37444}{37488}Build Goddard a female poodle.
{37494}{37586}Goddard, this is serious.
{37589}{37625}Sneak out.
{37631}{37731}That's it. Barbaric problems|call for barbaric solutions.
{37737}{37821}Phone, please.
{37825}{37860}Carl, it's me.
{37866}{37926}You get permission? Me neither.
{37932}{38011}It turns out parents|don't understand psychology.
{38017}{38104}Tell Sheen to meet us|at Retroland in one hour.
{38110}{38185}We're sneakin' out.
{38191}{38281}Halt! Hold it right there!
{38322}{38401}Jimmy's awfully quiet up there, Hugh.|Do you think we were too tough?
{38407}{38506}- No, I don't think so, dear. No.|- Maybe I should check on him.
{38512}{38647}Now, now. I'm sure he's just|reflecting on the error of his ways.
{38653}{38746}Dealing with it in a mature,|responsible manner.
{38752}{38851}"Mom says you're grounded."|Take that.
{38873}{38921}It's working now.
{38927}{39004}OK, Goddard, you know what to do.
{39010}{39071}Good boy.
{39077}{39161}See you later, Goddard.
{39227}{39326}Jimmy's a big boy now.|Don't you worry, sugar.
{39332}{39387}- I suppose you're right.|- Yeah, sure.
{39393}{39460}I was a kid once. I remember|being grounded a whole week
{39466}{39581}and not being allowed to go|to my best friend's bachelor party.
{39586}{39692}- Well, what did you do?|- Actually, I snuck out.
{39711}{39798}- You don't think that Jimmy...|- No, no.
{39804}{39852}Besides, how's he gonna sneak out?
{39858}{39925}It's not like he can just|walk right out the front door.
{39931}{40010}That's true.
{40156}{40245}Retroland, here I come.
{40434}{40505}Libby, you're breaking|my concentration.
{40511}{40607}Hey, I gotta choose a ring|that fits my personality.
{40613}{40715}Yeah! Here we go! Here we go!
{40739}{40798}Tell me what it is|you're supposed to be doing again.
{40804}{40908}T'ai Chi, while drinking Purple Flurp.
{40913}{41029}T'ai Chi promotes wellness,|relaxes and rejuvenates the body.
{41035}{41118}Whereas Purple Flurp,
{41124}{41175}being 98 per cent sugar,|creates tension
{41181}{41243}and a temporary rush of energy|and mood swings.
{41249}{41332}I figure if I do them together,
{41338}{41457}I achieve perfect balance.
{41569}{41634}It's better than the poster.
{41640}{41735}Gentlemen, this will be a night|we shan't easily forget.
{41741}{41845}I don't know what "shan't" means,|but let's go.
{42536}{42625}Do you promise to use your powers|for good and not evil?
{42631}{42657}Yes, Ultra Lord.
{42663}{42864}Now, Counterpart, take this Ultra Mask|and lead the fight for justice.
{42918}{42990}Is this kid with anyone?
{43008}{43092}Go, Carl.
{43299}{43348}Now that's what I call a ride.
{43354}{43438}Let's go.
{43648}{43707}This is way beyond awesome.
{43713}{43803}Just think if you boneheaded|dweebs had listened to your parents,
{43809}{43943}you'd be home in bed|instead of riding this monster.
{44137}{44182}I tell you, he's fine.
{44188}{44239}Just a quick peek, Hugh.
{44245}{44298}There. Now, what did I tell you?
{44304}{44349}Jimmy, are you awake, dear?
{44355}{44422}Yes, Mother. I am awake.
{44428}{44524}Son, your mother and I|just wanted to say good night.
{44530}{44633}Yes. And to tell you that we love you.
{44738}{44809}Honey, I know you're upset.
{44815}{44871}We don't like to punish you.
{44877}{44961}You're such a special boy.
{45732}{45835}According to this, we should encourage|Jimmy without overindulging him.
{45841}{45922}OK. What does it say about rockets?
{45928}{45997}- Is there someone in the kitchen?|- Our kitchen?
{46003}{46087}I didn't hear anything.
{46165}{46260}Honey, did you leave|the green light on?
{46276}{46324}Jimmy?
{46330}{46393}Jimmy?
{46449}{46529}You're not Jimmy.
{46530}{46588}Hugh?
{46594}{46639}Hugh, are you all right?
{46645}{46713}Hugh?
{47611}{47687}- Was that so cool, dude!|- Yeah! That was great!
{47693}{47747}- Mind-bending!|- Yeah!
{47753}{47817}Hey, my pants are almost dry.
{47823}{47891}Hey, Jimmy, I never thought|I'd say it, but here goes.
{47897}{47964}You know what?|That Nick is not such a bad guy.
{47970}{48066}- Are you kidding? He's a genius.|- He's a genius!
{48072}{48127}- No offence, Jimmy.|- None taken.
{48133}{48219}Actually, I find his insights on how|to deal with one's parents refreshing.
{48225}{48312}Yeah. Wouldn't it be great if our folks|all disappeared for a while?
{48318}{48350}Yeah.
{48356}{48401}Hey, a shooting star.
{48407}{48506}Cool. You get to make a wish. Lucky.
{48512}{48553}What should I wish for?
{48559}{48624}I know what I'd wish for.|I'd wish for no more parents.
{48630}{48702}That way we could do whatever|we wanted, whenever we wanted.
{48708}{48784}We'd be free.|We could have fun all the time.
{48790}{48871}Yeah!
{48898}{48952}Liftoff in five,
{48958}{49048}four, three, two...
{49054}{49128}We have liftoff.
{49134}{49215}Abort mission. Abort mission.
{49221}{49283}Goddard, wake mode.
{49289}{49397}All right. Come on, boy.|Race you to the kitchen.
{49450}{49496}Beat ya.
{49502}{49582}Hey, Mom, did you get|any more Purple Flurp?
{49588}{49665}Mom!
{49701}{49751}"Dear son/daughter,
{49757}{49829}we have gone to Florida|for an extended vacation."
{49835}{49882}"Love, your parents."
{49888}{49955}Yeah. My parents went to Florida, too.
{49961}{50003}That's weird.
{50009}{50059}From the look of it,
{50065}{50127}I'd say a lot of parents are gone.
{50133}{50171}Well... Did...
{50177}{50253}- Did they all go to Florida?|- Maybe they went to get juice.
{50259}{50376}I don't digest pulp well.|It makes me bloaty.
{50382}{50478}Goddard, scan for adult life forms.
{50531}{50673}Just as I thought. There are absolutely|no adults anywhere within radar.
{50679}{50743}They're gone. The whole city.
{50749}{50789}No parents.
{50795}{50873}No parents.
{50879}{50970}No parents!
{51098}{51182}Excuse me.
{51185}{51230}I'm letting out the cold.
{51236}{51339}I'm peeing in the shower.
{51342}{51442}Llama, llama, llama!
{51521}{51590}I'm walking up the down escalator.
{51596}{51720}# My clothes don't match! I'm out|in public and my clothes don't match!
{51955}{52071}I'm still doing it. Go, go, go.
{52099}{52230}Welcome to the Candy Bar. Whoopee|cushion or non-whoopee cushion?
{52244}{52328}Jimmy!
{52389}{52473}What'll it be, boys?
{52503}{52631}- We'll have what he's throwing.|- Excellent choice.
{52723}{52807}Hang on!
{52814}{52887}No skiing in the halls.
{52893}{52995}Don't make me get the protractor.
{53680}{53735}Morning, Goddard.
{53741}{53814}My head. What a night.
{53820}{53896}I'm stuffed now. I couldn't have ano...
{53902}{54054}OK, one more. I'm gonna have one more|and then that'll be it.
{54057}{54151}What a battle. Are there any survivors?
{54157}{54218}Help me.
{54266}{54316}I remember my first time.
{54322}{54406}Shake it off, Neutron.
{54411}{54486}I gotta get home. Mom and Dad|might be back by now.
{54492}{54576}Come on, Goddard.
{54734}{54802}We interrupt this programme|to bring you this report.
{54808}{54862}Hey, knock it off, Arnie.
{54868}{54950}"Trouble in Paradise."|That's what some kids are saying
{54956}{55047}in the aftermath of yesterday's|"Mom and Dad are gone" celebrations.
{55053}{55089}Here's Courtney Tyler.
{55095}{55197}What started as an awesome day|has become, like, a real bummer.
{55203}{55254}- Help us!|- I don't know how to make lunch.
{55260}{55324}- I want my parents.|- Somebody hold me.
{55330}{55411}I was playing on the teetertotter
{55417}{55599}and the next thing I knew I was|on the ground and my knee hurt.
{55610}{55687}Reports of tummy aches,|owies and constipation
{55693}{55761}have reached epidemic numbers|over the past few hours,
{55767}{55850}with little indication of slowing down.
{55856}{55986}And so we were gonna see|who could eat the most cotton candy.
{55992}{56068}And I won.
{56074}{56187}I want my mommy.
{56204}{56284}So, there you have it.
{56290}{56378}I want my mommy, too.
{56485}{56569}Mom? Dad?
{56789}{56905}What kind of parents|take off and leave their kid?
{56938}{57027}And they didn't even say goodbye.
{57118}{57213}Son, your mother and I|just wanted to say good night.
{57219}{57319}Yes. And to tell you that we love you.
{57328}{57385}We only do what we do|because we love you.
{57391}{57478}Maybe we can all go to Retroland|next weekend, the three of us.
{57484}{57566}What about my fabulous dog Goddard?
{57572}{57656}Sure. Your fabulous dog Goddard, too.
{57662}{57701}Well, good night, son.
{57707}{57758}Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.
{57764}{57848}We'll see you in the morning.
{57888}{57919}OK.
{57925}{57987}So they said good night.
{57993}{58045}"In the morning"? Hey, wait a minute.
{58051}{58124}Play back the last part again.|Audio only.
{58130}{58211}Good night, Jimmy. Sweet dreams.|We'll see you in the morning.
{58217}{58297}There. Why would she say that|if they weren't gonna be here?
{58303}{58406}Come on, Goddard.|We're going to the lab.
{58410}{58455}It's just as I thought.
{58461}{58556}The serifs and kerning on the note don't|match Mom and Dad's handwriting.
{58562}{58615}This note's a fake.
{58621}{58669}What is it, boy?
{58675}{58759}The Long-Range Space Scanner.|It detected something.
{58765}{58875}Filtering out background|radiation and... There it is.
{58881}{59022}Jumping Jupiter!|The Earth's been visited by aliens!
{59028}{59117}OK, so me, you and a dog
{59123}{59211}are gonna battle|an alien civilisation, right?
{59217}{59320}- By ourselves?|- He's a good dog. Aren't you, boy?
{59326}{59437}The last time we tried this, we couldn't|even break free of the atmosphere.
{59443}{59521}I know, I know. But I recalculated|the thrust-to-fuel ratio
{59527}{59613}and I've adjusted|the engine accordingly.
{59619}{59715}- I can fix that.|- Neutron.
{59762}{59863}- What is it?|- An angry mob.
{59931}{60020}In times of crisis, intellectuals|are always the first to go.
{60026}{60131}Well, they don't look angry.|They look like they're about to barf.
{60137}{60240}Let me go. You're messing with powers|far beyond your mortal comprehension.
{60246}{60285}OK, Neutron.
{60291}{60395}Ultra Freak here says you really know|what happened to all our parents.
{60401}{60505}Hey, how you doin'? I didn't say nothin'|about our parents being abducted...
{60511}{60632}- Where's my mom and dad?|- Hey, what's the matter?
{60638}{60725}Goddard, star map 72, please.
{60751}{60813}Right about there.
{60819}{60899}Long-range sensors picked up|these ion trails, indicating the route
{60905}{60962}for whatever intelligence|abducted our parents.
{60968}{61023}They lead us somewhere|in the Orion star system
{61029}{61118}three million light years away,|so we'll need to leave by Friday.
{61124}{61189}OK, that gives us about two days|to collect the plutonium,
{61195}{61289}design and test our fusion engines and|build our fleet of interstellar warships.
{61295}{61335}We'll also need to bring snacks.
{61341}{61418}Any questions?
{61487}{61551}Are you sure about this, Neutron?
{61557}{61620}Well, the data seems|to support this hypothesis.
{61626}{61731}Never argue with the data.
{61737}{61809}OK, Neutron, here's the lowdown.
{61815}{61907}You get us to those|kidnapping alien scuzzballs,
{61913}{61966}and I'll take it from there.
{61972}{62055}We're getting our parents back.
{62398}{62481}OK, Ben, that's good. Let it down slow.
{62487}{62571}Two more turns, Emma. Not too tight.
{62599}{62683}Yup. Tape adhesion is|within operational limits.
{62689}{62735}What? Cindy?
{62741}{62811}Cindy, what did you do to|that intergalactic starship?
{62817}{62913}We thought that the deep recesses|of space could use a feminine touch.
{62919}{62960}What do you think, Jimmy?
{62966}{63018}Yeah, it's OK, I guess.
{63024}{63067}You kinda ruined it though.
{63073}{63153}Hey, Jimmy, do these fusion reactors|need fuel rods?
{63159}{63250}Come on, Sheen. It's not rocket|science. You just have to...
{63256}{63327}Actually, I guess it is rocket science.
{63333}{63421}- No fuel rods, Sheen.|- OK.
{63467}{63562}And for the final touch...
{63728}{63837}Good work, everybody.|We're ready for intergalactic travel.
{63843}{63908}Neutron, this is gonna work, right?
{63914}{64005}- Yeah, Jimmy. What if it doesn't work?|- It will work!
{64011}{64057}I'm 95 per cent sure it will.
{64063}{64098}- 95?|- Yeah.
{64104}{64176}Yeah, and the other five per cent?
{64182}{64231}We blow up.
{64237}{64265}But just a little.
{64271}{64351}Look, a 95 is still an "A".
{64357}{64471}Yeah, I can deal with that.|I never got a 95 in my life.
{64477}{64630}You heard the man. Stop sucking|your thumbs and let's light this candle.
{64736}{64810}Goddard, initiate launch sequence.
{64816}{64857}Make sure seat belts are fastened
{64863}{65016}and remember to keep your hands and|arms inside the vehicles at all times.
{65986}{66047}Come on, everybody. Get in formation.
{66053}{66092}Carl, you're too low.
{66098}{66191}Come on, you stupid butterfly.
{66307}{66395}Go, Counterparts! Go!
{66398}{66480}Hang on. We're passing|through the stratosphere.
{66486}{66539}Now the mesosphere.
{66545}{66599}Entering ionosphere.
{66605}{66712}Now I know why they all end in "phere"!
{66718}{66855}This is it, baby.|Engaging pulse rockets now.
{66917}{67010}Come on, come on, come on, come on.
{67627}{67693}Look, Goddard.|The wonders of the universe.
{67699}{67869}We are witnessing celestial events|no person, or dog, has ever seen.
{67871}{67960}It's incredible.
{68122}{68183}Beautiful, isn't it, Nick?
{68189}{68289}Yeah, yeah.|Wake me when we get there.
{68290}{68334}Hey, Jimmy.
{68340}{68415}D'you think we can|rotate shifts after a while?
{68421}{68512}Hey, we'll switch.
{68621}{68702}Hey, this astronaut food isn't too bad.
{68708}{68788}That's toothpaste, Carl.
{68800}{68853}Minty.
{68859}{68959}- Hey, what's happening?|- Meteor shower.
{68965}{69044}Evasive action.
{69236}{69361}I do so relish these times of peril.
{69819}{69898}- That was close.|- Look out!
{70047}{70096}We've gotta find shelter.
{70102}{70165}Asteroid bearing 236.7 degrees.
{70171}{70255}Come on!
{70792}{70889}So then these three filmmakers|find all these sticks in the trees
{70895}{70939}shaped like stick people.
{70945}{71048}And the girl filmmaker starts crying|and her nose starts dripping.
{71054}{71158}And they don't have any tissue at all.
{71164}{71194}None?
{71200}{71236}None.
{71242}{71336}So then they start to hear|really scary noises
{71342}{71406}and voices coming from outside.
{71412}{71473}So they leave the tent.
{71479}{71526}Don't leave the tent!|Don't leave the tent!
{71532}{71637}Oh, yeah, Carl. They leave the tent|and they follow the voices,
{71643}{71741}when from out of|the darkness comes the...
{71758}{71898}Man, that was so choice.|You should have seen your faces.
{71898}{71975}Did they really leave the tent, Nick?
{71981}{72069}Hey, there's a red giant.|And that's a white dwarf.
{72075}{72161}You can relate, huh, Neutron?
{72206}{72250}Hey, Jimmy, what's the matter?
{72256}{72366}Listen, in case you haven't noticed,|I'm not exactly the tallest guy around.
{72372}{72431}Shorty, squirt, small-stuff, shrimp.
{72437}{72479}It gets to you after a while.
{72485}{72533}And next year there'll be dances.
{72539}{72639}What girl'd dance with a guy who looks|like he should still be in Gymboree?
{72645}{72738}I didn't think we liked girls yet, Jim.
{72744}{72811}We don't. We don't. No. Not yet. No.
{72817}{72861}However, one day, Carl,
{72867}{72985}an influx of hormones we can't control|will overpower our better judgment
{72991}{73083}and drive us to pursue|the female species against our will.
{73089}{73180}Stop talking like that, Jimmy.|You're gonna give me nightmares.
{73186}{73226}Listen, I wouldn't worry, Carl.
{73232}{73346}I have a feeling puberty is|light years away for you and me.
{73406}{73498}You know, we should have|never wished on that star, Jimmy,
{73504}{73596}cos I miss my folks.
{73602}{73687}My mom used to|tuck me in bed every night
{73693}{73785}before she was abducted by aliens.
{73791}{73884}Before my dad was abducted by aliens,
{73890}{73943}he would always read me to sleep.
{73949}{74052}Before my mom was inducted by aliens,
{74058}{74195}she would rub my tummy|and she'd sing...
{74246}{74292}- What?|- Nothing.
{74298}{74389}Come on, you guys.|We gotta keep our heads.
{74395}{74479}We'll find 'em.
{75268}{75332}What is it, boy?
{75338}{75417}Sensor sweeps reveal|many advanced cities and...
{75423}{75497}ion energy signatures. That's it!
{75503}{75602}We've found it. I repeat: We've found it.
{75624}{75689}Nick, we'll contact you|as soon as we find the parents
{75695}{75740}so you can kick some alien buttocks.
{75746}{75861}- Piece of cake.|- OK, scouting party, follow me.
{75867}{75961}I'll be back, Nick.
{76140}{76217}Wow. What is that?
{76735}{76847}Wow. They've evolved beyond the need|for mere conventional bodies.
{76853}{76947}They must be an advanced species|millions of years ahead of us.
{76953}{77103}Wow. When I sneeze, it looks like|an advanced species, too.
{77208}{77297}OK, they're this way.
{77338}{77427}Right this way, sire.
{77435}{77547}Ooblar, these humans look so scrawny.|Hardly very appetising.
{77553}{77595}Are you sure they're yummy?
{77601}{77652}I assure you, my slimy sovereign.
{77658}{77706}Poultra will be quite pleased.
{77712}{77795}Humans are mostly water|with a crunchy, bony centre.
{77801}{77846}Think nuts and chews.
{77852}{77907}- There they are.|- What are they doing?
{77913}{78057}- What are those things on their heads?|- It looks like a mind-control device.
{78063}{78112}Mom. Dad. Dad!
{78118}{78160}It's me. Jimmy. Over here.
{78166}{78233}Jim, Jim, Jim, Jimmys,|James, James, Jim.
{78239}{78338}Big, fiery, flying Jimmy. Hi, Jimmy.
{78344}{78443}Some dream, huh? Attack of the big|egg people. I think I've seen this one.
{78449}{78588}No, Dad. You're wearing a mind-control|device. Take yours off. Hurry!
{78614}{78664}- Dad?|- Intruder alert. Intruder alert.
{78670}{78754}Dad, no, no, no. Sh.
{78764}{78831}Jimmy, your dad's like|a mind-control duck man.
{78837}{78889}- Let's get outta here.|- Let's go.
{78895}{78998}Come back. Join us, Jimmy. Join us.
{79163}{79297}Well, well, if it isn't the littlest|rescue party. How cute.
{79303}{79351}Hello, itty-bitty humans.
{79357}{79420}You let us go, you big ball of phlegm.
{79426}{79509}That's no way to talk to the king.|He is the royal phlegm.
{79515}{79563}- Ooblar.|- Sorry, sire.
{79569}{79668}I think it's only fair to warn you that|if you don't release us within 24 hours,
{79674}{79799}an army of trained combat specialists|is poised to destroy your entire planet.
{79805}{79845}- Really?|- Really.
{79851}{79962}Oh, my. Our entire planet.|Whatever shall we do?
{79968}{80085}Do you mean this army|of trained combat specialists?
{80091}{80196}- Hey, it's Nick. Hey, Nick. Oh, man...|- Nick!
{80202}{80286}Get your grubs off me, egghead.
{80293}{80372}Don't look so surprised.|We're an advanced alien race.
{80378}{80441}What did you expect?
{80447}{80493}What do you want with our parents?
{80499}{80577}It's not what I want.|It's what Poultra wants.
{80583}{80642}- Who's Poultra?|- Poultra is our god.
{80648}{80733}The mightiest,|most ferocious creature in all...
{80739}{80845}I get tired of answering this. Roll tape.
{80868}{80987}Hello and welcome to our special|edition of "Poultra: God of Wrath".
{80993}{81116}- Brought to you by Goo...|- Commercials. Hate them.
{81122}{81173}Welcome back. If you're watching this,
{81179}{81279}chances are your friends and/or|relatives are about to be sacrificed
{81285}{81370}to the Mighty Poultra,|which is a great honour indeed.
{81376}{81453}And very painful.
{81485}{81581}And this year's human sacrifices|feature something very special:
{81587}{81624}Actual humans.
{81630}{81706}And it's all thanks to Jimmy Neutron.
{81712}{81862}Greetings from planet Earth. I'm Jimmy|Neutron and you're an alien life form.
{81868}{81929}You know, without the coordinates|you gave us,
{81935}{82002}we never would have found|your puny little planet.
{82008}{82117}For such a tiny earthling, you've been|a very big help, Jimmy Neutron.
{82123}{82201}Guards, throw these minuscule vermin|into the dungeon
{82207}{82335}until they're of worthier size, and give|Mr Neutron the presidential suite.
{82341}{82417}What?
{82533}{82628}Isn't this a funny-wunny little toy?
{82658}{82725}Get it off me! Get it off!
{82731}{82800}Take this infernal thing to the lab|and have it torn apart.
{82806}{82908}Yes, great saliva-armed one.
{82911}{82964}- Hold it. Move along.|- Goddard!
{82970}{83035}Move!
{83619}{83694}So, it was Neutron all along.
{83700}{83740}I mean, he got us into this.
{83746}{83838}Hey, Jimmy, didn't your parents|ever tell you not to talk to strangers?
{83844}{83890}That's rule number one.
{83896}{83958}Come on, you guys. Give him a break.
{83964}{84013}Jimmy didn't mean to ruin our lives
{84019}{84098}and get our parents eaten|by a giant space monster.
{84104}{84223}She's right. We need to ask ourselves|"What would Ultra Lord do?"
{84229}{84336}Let's think about that, Sheen. Maybe|sit on a shelf because he's a doll!
{84342}{84402}He's not. He's an action figure.|There's a difference.
{84408}{84506}Come on, Nick. Let Sheen talk.|Maybe he's onto something.
{84512}{84566}What would Ultra Lord do, Sheen?
{84572}{84612}Well, in episode 224
{84618}{84773}he fried the zeebot's brain with his|heat-seeking infra-thought. It was cool.
{84783}{84831}Well, I'm convinced, folks,
{84837}{84906}that's pretty much|the stupidest thing I ever heard!
{84912}{85024}No. This is the stupidest thing|you've ever heard.
{85034}{85077}You are such a baby.
{85083}{85160}Leave me alone. You're picking|on me because you're insecure.
{85166}{85239}Jimmy, you there?
{85245}{85305}Look, don't listen to them.
{85311}{85357}They're just scared.
{85363}{85405}Are you OK?
{85411}{85486}Yeah. I'm fine.
{85492}{85606}Don't be so hard on yourself.|We'll get out of this.
{85607}{85683}OK, so you made a mistake.
{85689}{85752}Beating yourself up|isn't gonna fix anything.
{85758}{85884}You know, I was the smartest kid|in school until you came along.
{85890}{85972}And I admit you know more|about some things than I do.
{85978}{86048}But I know one thing|that you don't seem to get,
{86054}{86145}and that's that we're never|getting outta here without you.
{86151}{86212}So why don't you buck up, mister,
{86218}{86278}and put that big brain of yours|back to work?
{86284}{86433}Nick can handle the fighting stuff,|but first we have to get out of this cell.
{86446}{86558}Cindy, why are you being|so nice to me?
{86564}{86655}Because there's a bunch of kids|in here that need you.
{86661}{86753}And I do, too.
{86852}{86992}I am never complaining|about my parents again.
{87009}{87078}We didn't even get our one phone call.
{87084}{87166}That's it!|Libby, let me see your cellphone.
{87172}{87224}OK, but I don't think my service plan
{87230}{87287}covers anything|outside our solar system.
{87293}{87414}- Who are you calling?|- A friend of mine.
{87452}{87498}All right, little Earth doggy.
{87504}{87628}Ooblar is going to take you apart|into tiny little pieces.
{87634}{87714}All right?
{87795}{87879}Hey, give me that!
{87881}{87925}Fine. We'll use this one then.
{87931}{88011}No, no, no, no, no. No!
{88017}{88113}Would you stop that? Those are mine.
{88316}{88401}That's not funny! Stop it!|And give me my things.
{88407}{88481}Come on, boy, pick up.
{88493}{88580}Good. Good.|Perhaps we'll get somewhere.
{88586}{88667}Goddard, you're OK.
{88674}{88787}I miss you, too, boy.|Listen, what's your situation?
{88852}{88891}Evil scientist, huh?
{88897}{89016}OK. I got an idea.|Put me on speaker, Goddard.
{89033}{89168}Danger. Danger. You have initiated|self-destruct sequence alpha.
{89174}{89228}That's my bad. Back in you go.
{89234}{89300}Self-destruct sequence|is now engaged.
{89306}{89376}No, no, no, no, no! I put it back in.|You understand me?
{89382}{89480}This unit will yield a 50-megaton|nuclear blast in exactly ten seconds.
{89486}{89571}- That's not good!|- Please clear a 30-square mile area.
{89577}{89631}Thank you and have a nice day.
{89637}{89703}- Ten, nine, eight...|- No, back up!
{89709}{89768}...seven...|- Mother!
{89774}{89833}Is he gone, boy?
{89839}{89946}Great. Lock on to this signal|and get here as fast as you can.
{90104}{90160}Halt. Who goes there?
{90166}{90191}The guard.
{90197}{90247}By order of the esteemed King Goobot,
{90253}{90345}it is my great privilege and honour|to mercilessly exterminate you.
{90351}{90455}Think. Think. Goddard, play dead.
{90686}{90740}Good boy, Goddard. Good boy.
{90746}{90798}Guess I'll make that bug a feature, huh?
{90804}{90844}- Good dog.|- Way to go!
{90850}{90913}- You're a good robot.|- Come on! Let's get the others.
{90919}{91001}Nice work, Jimmy.
{91033}{91096}Hey, Cindy. Thanks.
{91102}{91264}If you ever tell anyone I was nice to you,|you'll wind up looking like that guy.
{91264}{91360}Let's go, Neutron.|It's egg-scrambling time.
{91366}{91461}- Wait for me, Nick.|- Come back!
{91464}{91535}Please?
{91782}{91874}Bring out the humans.
{92185}{92292}Come on, it's showtime. Everybody out.
{92621}{92707}Kick it!
{93169}{93254}- Look, you guys. A football game.|- I don't think so, Carl.
{93260}{93344}Goddard, bino-scope mode.
{93554}{93603}Wow. What a lame half-time show.
{93609}{93692}They're making our parents|dance so lame.
{93698}{93805}No, my dad really dances like that.
{93856}{93950}- The festival is starting.|- Our parents! They'll be eaten!
{93956}{94033}Nobody eats my parents|unless I say so!
{94039}{94095}Come on.
{94101}{94218}Begin the incubation.
{94309}{94389}Come on, Nick.|Show them what you're made of.
{94395}{94432}Halt.
{94438}{94493}Hey, cool spear.
{94499}{94549}You really think so?|I guess so because...
{94555}{94646}Mind if I try?
{94656}{94697}No, no, no!
{94703}{94781}My hero.
{94787}{94890}- Come on, everyone.|- Get 'em, Nick. Come on!
{95334}{95373}My hero?
{95379}{95434}OK, we need another plan.
{95440}{95530}Probably a Nick-less one.
{95659}{95736}Poultra! Poultra!
{95742}{95817}Poultra! Poultra!
{95823}{95921}Citizens of Yokus,|I, King Goobot the Fifth,
{95927}{96039}give you sacrifice.
{96192}{96289}That's a big chicken.
{96464}{96548}What do we do now?
{96858}{96942}Think. Think.
{97084}{97119}Brain blast!
{97125}{97187}OK, everybody, listen up.|We don't have much time.
{97193}{97243}I've got to make it to that control tower.
{97249}{97340}Cindy, Libby, keep the guards busy|until Sheen arrives with the ship.
{97346}{97422}OK, I heard the ship part,|but was that "Sheen get the ship"?
{97428}{97459}Yeah, yeah.
{97465}{97558}There's a transport ship in that airfield|big enough to carry all of us out.
{97564}{97647}- I need you to get it here fast.|- But I don't have a driver's licence.
{97653}{97728}- I have no hand-eye coordination...|- Sheen, ask yourself,
{97734}{97810}what would Ultra Lord do?
{97837}{97876}I accept this responsibility,
{97882}{97966}understanding the consequences|that you've bestowed against me.
{97972}{98021}Poultra, din-dins.
{98027}{98126}Yummy, yummy. Foodie, woodie.
{98162}{98243}This is it, people. These crummy|aliens stole our parents.
{98249}{98327}It's time to show them what we're|made of. We're tough! We're mean!
{98333}{98384}Darn it, we're carbon-based life forms.
{98390}{98482}- Now, who's gonna kick buttocks?|- The carbon-based life forms!
{98488}{98584}Yeah!
{98644}{98690}What is this?
{98696}{98804}- Stop those kids.|- After 'em.
{98861}{98936}Cindy, Purple Flurp.
{98942}{99032}Dragon whips her tail.
{99244}{99328}Let's dance.
{99482}{99532}Yeah, Jimmy.
{99538}{99600}Come on, boy.
{99606}{99697}- Jimmy!|- Carl, "show and tell".
{99703}{99772}Come here, you.
{99778}{99862}I can't see! I can't see!
{99884}{99988}You want some? You want some?|You want a piece of me?
{99994}{100078}I didn't think so.
{100225}{100297}Munchy-crunchy time.
{100303}{100387}There you go.
{100387}{100462}- Fetch, boy.|- Hey, hey, give me that.
{100468}{100564}- Come back here, you!|- Everybody up.
{100737}{100806}Hey, nice party. Gotta blast.
{100812}{100866}Neutron.
{100872}{100949}OK, let's move out.
{100996}{101104}Guards, vaporise the Earth brats.
{101193}{101277}Hurry, head for the exit.
{101294}{101357}- Hey, where's Sheen?|- I don't know.
{101363}{101440}Stop them!
{101738}{101830}All right, Sheen!
{101834}{101953}Your ship awaits, Captain Jimmy.
{102227}{102302}Ooblar, protect!
{102388}{102423}Pooh.
{102429}{102511}Everybody to the ship!
{102529}{102599}Poultra, quickly.|Your dinner's getting away.
{102605}{102707}- OK, keep up. Let's get out of here.|- Come on!
{102846}{102919}We gotta do this quick.|Launch positions.
{102925}{102981}Temperature optimal.|Engaging plasma coils.
{102987}{103107}- Jim, I think we better leave now.|- Countdown! Ten, nine, eight...
{103113}{103185}One!
{103423}{103546}- To my ships.|- And can someone bring me a bucket?
{103604}{103713}Jimmy, here they come!
{103784}{103855}Time to discipline the naughty children.
{103861}{103926}Open fire.
{104172}{104270}OK, who wants fried chicken?
{104793}{104873}So, Neutron, now it's just you and I.
{104879}{104935}All weapons online.
{104941}{105011}Ultra Lord is not afraid of chickens
{105017}{105101}He is not afraid...
{105135}{105210}He may be a little bit|afraid of chickens
{105216}{105266}This thing's too slow. I can't outrun 'em.
{105272}{105339}- Incoming message.|- On screen.
{105345}{105407}You see, Jimmy, you can't win.
{105413}{105479}All of your friends and family|would be safe at home,
{105485}{105559}if it wasn't for one little problem. You.
{105565}{105676}- Little?|- Now you all must die!
{105682}{105765}Little, huh? I'll show you little.
{105771}{105809}Cindy, take over. Come on, boy.
{105815}{105934}What are you doing?|Is this one of those macho things?
{105940}{106059}I know we haven't field-tested this|feature yet, but we've no choice, buddy.
{106065}{106149}Goddard, flycycle!
{106334}{106441}Would you look at this? I do believe|he's going to ram us, Ooblar.
{106447}{106544}Remind me to clean|the windshield later.
{106608}{106676}You steal my parents,|you threaten my dog...
{106682}{106723}Itsy-bitsy Jimmy Neutron.
{106729}{106793}He does look a bit small and silly,|doesn't he, sire?
{106799}{106876}You attack my friends|and you made fun of my size.
{106882}{106937}- Tiny, tiny.|- So, so tiny.
{106943}{107092}Well, I may be small,|but I've got a big brain.
{107217}{107280}Not tiny!
{107302}{107376}Can't we call this whole thing|a mistake and go back to your plan -
{107382}{107497}rendezvous for universal|brotherhood and whatnot?
{107700}{107766}You've not seen the last of us,
{107772}{107856}Jimmy Neutron!
{107890}{107944}You look marvellous|sunny-side up, sire.
{107950}{108033}That's no yolk.
{108040}{108113}All right, Jimmy! Good job!
{108119}{108268}Orbiting around Jimmy's big head.|Estimated time to ear: Seven minutes.
{108383}{108451}So, I guess I can't|call you short any more.
{108457}{108609}Don't worry. I'm sure there are all kinds|of other insults you can come up with.
{108740}{108811}Let me tell you,|as soon as we get home,
{108817}{108910}we're going out dancing!
{108966}{109004}Ultra Dad!
{109010}{109090}Ultra Son!
{109102}{109137}Dad! Daddy!
{109143}{109192}Hey, Neutron.
{109198}{109254}Nice job.
{109260}{109344}Thanks.
{109351}{109444}I've got that for you, dear.
{109496}{109541}Mom, Dad,
{109547}{109635}I should have listened to you|when you said don't talk to strangers.
{109641}{109752}See, I guess I thought I was smart|enough to do everything on my own -
{109758}{109806}that I didn't need you.
{109812}{109860}But I was wrong.
{109866}{109907}I love you guys.
{109913}{109970}We love you too, Jimmy.
{109976}{110048}Having a genius for a son|may not always be easy,
{110054}{110103}but it's always interesting.
{110109}{110153}You make us so proud.
{110159}{110198}You sure do, son.
{110204}{110283}You know, not every family|gets to ride in an alien spaceship,
{110289}{110385}hurtling through the universe at warp|speeds, millions of miles from home.
{110391}{110525}- We thank you for that.|- You gotta admit, that is pretty neat.
{110649}{110703}There you are, gentlemen.
{110709}{110750}- Freeze!|- It's OK, Carl.
{110756}{110830}- It's just breakfast.|- I knew that.
{110836}{110901}I don't remember|buying this brand of soda.
{110907}{111001}- No, no, Mom... Mom, you...|- Jimmy, it's just soda.
{111007}{111091}Mom, no!
{111093}{111185}Goodness! Excuse me.
{111191}{111242}Boy, it's a scorcher out there.
{111248}{111320}- Thanks, honey.|- Hugh!
{111337}{111424}Well, at least it's coming out|of the attic, not the basement.
{111430}{111466}Hugh!
{111472}{111553}Mom!
{111680}{111780}James Isaac Neutron...
{113300}{113331}Onward, Mr Wiggles.
{113337}{113431}We reach the cafeteria by dawn.

I can't let you out, Hedwig.
I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school.
- Besides, if Uncle Vernon...
- Harry Potter!
Now you've done it.
He's in there. Vernon?
I'm warning you, if you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go.
But she's bored.
If I could only let her out for an hour or two.
So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir.
But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends.
Not one...
...all summer.
Who would want to be friends with you?
I should think you'd be a little more grateful.
We've raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table...
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...
...purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.
Which should be any minute.
Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we?
Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?
In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.
- Good. And, Dudley, you will be...?
- I'll be waiting to open the door.
Excellent.
And you?
I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.
Too right, you will.
With any luck, this could be the day
I make the biggest deal of my career...
...and you will not mess it up.
Harry Potter, such an honor it is.
- Who are you?
- Dobby, sir. Dobby the house-elf.
Not to be rude or anything...
...but this isn't a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.
Yes, sir. Dobby understands.
It's just that Dobby has come to tell you...
It is difficult, sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.
- Why don't you sit down?
- Sit down? Sit down?
Dobby, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you or anything.
Offend Dobby?
Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir...
...but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
You can't have met many decent wizards then.
No, I haven't.
That was an awful thing to say.
- Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
- Stop, Dobby. Dobby, shush.
Dobby, please, stop.
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.
- Bad Dobby.
- Stop! Stop, Dobby. Please, be quiet.
Are you all right?
Dobby had to punish himself, sir.
Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir.
- Your family?
- The wizard family Dobby serves, sir.
Dobby is bound to serve one family forever.
If they ever knew Dobby was here...
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.
Harry Potter must not go back...
...to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.
There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?
Can't say.
- Okay, I understand. You can't say.
- Don't make me talk. I...
- Dobby. Dobby, put the lamp down.
- Bad Dobby.
So when they arrive at the ninth hole...
Give me the lamp.
Dobby, stop!
- Let me go.
- Get in there and keep quiet.
- What the devil are you doing up here?
- I was just...
You just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke.
Sorry.
One more sound and you'll wish you'd never been born, boy.
- And fix that door.
- Yes, sir.
See why I've got to go back?
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world, at Hogwarts.
- It's the only place I've got friends.
- Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?
Well, I expect they've been...
Hang on. How do you know my friends haven't been writing to me?
Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby.
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him...
...Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir.
- Give me those. Now.
- No!
Dobby, get back here.
Dobby, please, no.
Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter's own good.
It spread as far as the eye could see, all over the floor of this building.
One plumber said,
"Look at all that water."
The second plumber said,
"Yes, and that's just the top of it."
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.
You're never going back to that school.
You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
Hiya, Harry.
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?
Rescuing you, of course.
Now, come on, get your trunk.
You better stand back.
Let's go.
- What was that?
- What was it?
Potter!
Dad, what's going on?
Go. Go. Go.
Dad, hurry up.
- Come on.
- Come on, Harry, hurry up.
Petunia, he's escaping!
- I've got you, Harry.
- Come here!
- Let go of me!
- No, boy!
You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere.
- Get off!
- Drive!
- Right.
- Right!
No! No! No! No!
Dad!
Damn.
By the way, Harry, happy birthday.
Come on.
Okay, come on.
Okay, come on.
- Think it'd be all right if we had some?
- Yeah, Mum will never know.
It's not much, but it's home.
I think it's brilliant.
Where have you been?
Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear.
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.
You could have died.
You could have been seen.
Of course, I don't blame you, Harry, dear.
They were starving him, Mum.
There were bars on his window.
Well, you best hope I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley.
Come on, Harry, time for a spot of breakfast.
Here we are, Harry. Now, tuck in.
That's it. There we go.
- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?
- Yes, dear, it was on the cat.
Hello.
What did I do?
Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. A bit annoying, really.
- Morning, Weasleys.
- Morning, Dad.
- What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
- Raids?
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.
Dad loves Muggles, thinks they're fascinating.
Well, now.
And who are you?
Sorry, sir. I'm Harry, sir.
Harry Potter.
Good Lord. Are you really?
Well, Ron has told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?
This morning.
Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
Did you really? How did it go?
I mean... That was very wrong indeed, boys. Very wrong of you.
Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles.
Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?
Well, that'll be Errol with the post.
Fetch it, will you, Percy, please?
- Errol.
- He's always doing that.
Look, it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick, that man.
- No.
- This lot won't come cheap.
- The spell books alone are expensive.
- We'll manage.
There's only one place we're going to get all of this. Diagon Alley.
Right.
Here we are, Harry.
You go first, dear.
But Harry's never traveled by Floo powder before, Mum.
Floo powder?
You go first, Ron, so that Harry can see how it's done. Yes.
In you go.
That's it.
Diagon Alley.
You see? It's quite easy, dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.
Come on.
In you go. That's it. Mind your head.
That's right.
Now, take your Floo powder.
That's it, very good.
Now, don't forget to speak very, very clearly.
Diagonally.
- What did he say, dear?
- Diagonally.
I thought he did.
- Not lost, are you, my dear?
- I'm fine, thank you. I was just going...
Come with us. We'll help you find your way back.
- No. Please...
- Harry?
Hagrid!
What do you think you're doing down here? Come on.
You're a mess, Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.
I was lost, I...
Hang on. What were you doing down there then?
Me? I was... I was looking for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
They're ruining all the school cabbages.
Harry. Hagrid.
Hello, Hermione.
- It's so good to see you.
- It's great to see you too.
What did you do to your glasses?
Oculus Reparo.
I definitely need to remember that one.
You'll be all right now then, Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.
- Okay, bye.
- Thank you. Bye.
Come on, everyone's been so worried.
Harry.
Thank goodness. We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.
Here he is.
Mum fancies him.
Make way there, please.
Let me by, madam. Thank you.
Excuse me, little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.
It can't be. Harry Potter?
Harry Potter!
Excuse me, madam.
Nice big smile, Harry.
Together, you and I rate the front page.
Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is.
When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning...
...to purchase my autobiography,
Magical Me...
...which, incidentally, is currently celebrating...
...its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list...
...he had no idea that he would, in fact, be leaving...
...with my entire collected works...
...free of charge.
Now, ladies?
Harry, now you give me those, and I'll get them signed.
All of you wait outside.
That's it.
I'll bet you loved that, didn't you, Potter?
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a bookshop without making the front page.
Leave him alone.
Look, Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.
Now, now, Draco, play nicely.
Mr. Potter.
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.
Forgive me.
Your scar is legend.
As, of course, is the wizard who gave it to you.
Voldemort killed my parents.
He was nothing more than a murderer.
You must be very brave to mention his name.
Or very foolish.
Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
And you must be Miss Granger.
Yes, Draco has told me all about you. And your parents.
Muggles, aren't they?
Let me see.
Red hair, vacant expressions...
...tatty, secondhand book.
You must be the Weasleys.
It's mad in here.
Let's go outside.
- Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
- Lucius.
Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids?
I do hope they're paying you overtime...
...but judging by the state of this,
I'd say not.
What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard...
...if they don't even pay you well for it?
We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy.
Clearly.
Associating with Muggles.
And I thought your family could sink no lower.
I'll see you at work.
See you at school.
- 10:58, come on.
- The train will be leaving any moment.
Fred, George, Percy, you first.
Okay.
After you, dear.
Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry.
Let's go.
- What do you two think you're doing?
- Sorry.
Lost control of the trolley.
- Why can't we get through?
- I don't know.
The gateway has sealed itself for some reason.
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.
Harry, if we can't get through...
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.
Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
The car.
Ron, I should tell you...
...most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car.
Right.
Okay.
Oh, no! The Invisibility Booster must be faulty.
Come on, then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.
Okay.
All we need to do is catch up with the train.
We can't be far behind.
- Do you hear that?
- We must be getting close.
Hold on.
Harry!
Hold on!
Take my hand!
Hold on!
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
- I think we found the train.
- Yeah.
Welcome home.
Up! Up!
It's not working!
Up! Ron, mind that tree!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
- My wand. Look at my wand.
- Be thankful it's not your neck.
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
Come on, go! Fast!
Scabbers, you're okay.
The car!
Dad's gonna kill me.
See you, Hedwig.
So a house-elf shows up in my bedroom...
...we can't get through the barrier to platform 93/4...
...we almost get killed by a tree...
Clearly someone doesn't want me here this year.
Well, take a good look, lads.
This night might well be the last you spend in this castle.
Oh, dear, we are in trouble.
You were seen by no less than seven Muggles.
Do you have any idea how serious this is?
You have risked the exposure of our world.
Not to mention the damage you inflicted on a Whomping Willow...
...that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
Honestly, Professor Snape,
I think it did more damage to us.
Silence.
I assure you that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me...
...the both of you would be on the train home tonight.
- As it is...
- They are not.
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.
Headmaster...
...these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.
- As such...
- I am well aware of our bylaws...
...having written quite a few of them myself.
However, as head of Gryffindor house...
...it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
We'll go and get our stuff, then.
What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
You're going to expel us, aren't you?
Not today, Mr. Weasley...
...but I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done.
I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention.
Morning, everyone.
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Professor Sprout.
Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Gather around, everyone.
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.
Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root?
Yes, Miss Granger?
Mandrake, or Mandragora...
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.
As our Mandrakes are still only seedlings...
...their cries won't kill you yet.
But they could knock you out for hours, which is why I have given you earmuffs...
...for auditory protection.
So could you please put them on, right away? Quickly.
Flaps tight down, and watch me closely.
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.
Got it? And...
...now you dunk it down into the other pot...
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs.
- No, ma'am, he's just fainted.
- Yes, well, just leave him there.
Right, on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.
- There's Nearly Headless Nick.
- Hello, Percy, Miss Clearwater.
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Say it. I'm doomed.
- You're doomed.
- Hi, Harry.
I'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.
Hi, Colin. Nice to meet you.
Ron, is that your owl?
Bloody bird's a menace.
Oh, no.
Look, everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.
Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible.
Ronald Weasley!
How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!
Your father's now facing an inquiry at work...
...and it's entirely your fault!
If you put another toe out of line...
...we'll bring you straight home!
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor.
Your father and I are so proud.
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
Me.
Gilderoy Lockhart...
...Order of Merlin, Third Class...
...honorary member of the Dark Force Defense League...
...and five times winner...
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.
But I don't talk about that.
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him.
Now, be warned.
It is my job to arm you...
...against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind.
You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room.
Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here.
I must ask you not to scream.
It might provoke them.
Cornish pixies?
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan...
...but pixies can be devilishly tricky little blighters.
Let's see what you make of them.
Come on now, round them up.
They're only pixies.
- You just stay there!
- Please, get me down!
- Get off me!
- Stop. Hold still!
Peskipiksi Pesternomi!
I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage.
What do we do now?
Immobulus!
Why is it always me?
I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program.
We're gonna train earlier, harder and longer.
What...? I don't believe it.
- Where you think you're going, Flint?
- Quidditch practice.
- I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
- Easy, Wood. I've got a note.
I smell trouble.
"I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team...
...permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker."
You've got a new Seeker. Who?
- Malfoy?
- That's right.
And that's not all that's new this year.
Those are Nimbus 2001 s.
How did you get those?
A gift from Draco's father.
You see, Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best.
At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in.
They got in on pure talent.
No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood.
You'll pay for that one, Malfoy.
Eat slugs!
You okay, Ron?
Say something.
- Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?
- No, Colin, get out of the way.
Let's take him to Hagrid's.
He'll know what to do.
This calls for a specialist's equipment.
Nothing to do but wait till it stops,
I'm afraid.
- Okay.
- Better out than in.
- Who was Ron trying to curse, anyway?
- Malfoy. He called Hermione...
Well, I don't know exactly what it means.
He called me a Mudblood.
- He did not.
- What's a Mudblood?
It means "dirty blood." Mudblood's a foul name for someone who's Muggle-born.
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.
It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family...
...who think they're better than everyone else because they're pure-blood.
That's horrible.
It's disgusting.
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.
Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half-blood or less.
More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do.
Come here.
Don't you think on it, Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.
Harry, Harry, Harry.
Can you possibly imagine...
...a better way to serve detention...
...than by helping me to answer my fan mail?
Not really.
Fame is a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.
Remember that.
Come.
Come...
...to me.
- What?
- Sorry?
That voice.
Voice?
- Didn't you hear it?
- What are you talking about, Harry?
I think you're getting a bit drowsy.
And great Scott, no wonder. Look at the time. We've been here nearly four hours.
Spooky how the time flies when one is having fun.
Spooky.
Blood.
I smell blood.
Let me rip you.
Let me kill you.
Kill!
Kill!
- Kill!
- Harry!
- Did you hear it?
- Hear what?
- That voice.
- Voice? What voice?
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just...
It's time.
It's moving.
I think it's going to kill.
- Kill?
- Harry, wait! Not so fast!
Strange.
- I've never seen spiders act like that.
- I don't like spiders.
What's that?
"The Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Enemies of the Heir, beware."
It's written in blood.
Oh, no.
It's Filch's cat.
It's Mrs. Norris.
"Enemies of the Heir, beware."
You'll be next, Mudbloods.
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way, make way.
Potter?
What are you...?
Mrs. Norris?
- You've murdered my cat.
- No. No.
I'll kill you.
- I'll kill you!
- Argus!
Argus, I...
Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately.
Everyone except...
...you three.
Ravenclaws, follow me.
She's not dead, Argus.
She has been Petrified.
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.
I know exactly the countercurse that could've spared her.
But how she has been Petrified,
I cannot say.
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.
You saw what he wrote on the wall.
It's not true, sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.
- Rubbish.
- If I might, headmaster?
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
However...
...the circumstances are suspicious.
I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner.
I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus.
You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail.
That's why Ron and I went looking for him, professor.
We'd just found him when he said...
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- When I said I wasn't hungry.
We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
- Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
- My cat has been Petrified.
- I want to see some punishment!
- We will be able to cure her, Argus.
As I understand it, Madam Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.
When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris.
And in the meantime...
...I strongly recommend caution...
...to all.
- It's a bit strange, isn't it?
- Strange?
You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear...
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others, I mean?
Are you mad?
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign.
She's right, you know.
Could I have your attention, please?
Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals...
...into water goblets.
Like so.
One, two, three.
Vera Verto.
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?
Mr. Weasley.
"One, two, three. Vera Verto."
Vera Verto!
That wand needs replacing,
Mr. Weasley.
- Yes, Miss Granger?
- Professor...
...I was wondering if you could tell us about the Chamber of Secrets.
Very well.
You all know, of course...
...that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago...
...by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age:
Godric Gryffindor,
Helga Hufflepuff...
...Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin.
Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously.
- One did not.
- Three guesses who.
Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective...
...about the students admitted to Hogwarts.
He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families.
In other words, pure-bloods.
Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school.
Now, according to legend...
...Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle...
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.
Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it...
...until that time when his own true Heir returned to the school.
The Heir alone...
...would be able to open the Chamber...
...and unleash the horror within, and by so doing...
...purge the school of all those who...
...in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic.
Muggle-borns.
Naturally, the school has been searched many times.
No such chamber has been found.
Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
The Chamber is said to be home to something...
...that only the Heir of Slytherin can control.
It is said to be the home...
...of a monster.
Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets, and it has been opened, that means...
The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?
Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
- If you're talking about Malfoy...
- Of course. You heard him.
"You'll be next, Mudbloods."
I heard him.
But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
Maybe Ron's right, Hermione.
I mean, look at his family.
The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.
Mind you, it would be difficult.
Not to mention we'd be breaking about 50 school rules...
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.
"Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker...
...to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another."
You mean if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?
- Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
- Exactly.
But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
- How long will it take to make?
- A month.
A month?
But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...
...he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.
I know.
But it's the only plan we've got.
Another goal for Slytherin!
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.
Yeah!
Yeah!
All right there, Scarhead?
Watch yourself, Harry!
Wood, look out!
Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger.
That's been tampered with, that has.
I'll stop it.
No! Even with a proper wand, it's too risky. You could hit Harry.
Training for the ballet, Potter?
You'll never catch me, Potter.
Let's go.
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!
Finite Incantatem!
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?
No. I think my arm is broken.
Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straightaway.
- Not you.
- Boy doesn't know what he's saying.
This won't hurt a bit.
Brackium Emendo!
Yes, well, that can sometimes happen...
...but the point is...
...you can no longer feel any pain, and, very clearly, the bones are not broken.
Broken? There's no bones left.
Much more flexible, though.
Mr. Malfoy, stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.
Should have been brought straight to me.
I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back...
You will be able to, won't you?
I'll be able to, certainly.
But it'll be painful.
You're in for a rough night, Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?
Kill.
Kill.
Time to kill.
Hello.
Dobby?
Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby.
Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
It was you. You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
Indeed. Yes, sir.
- You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
- At least you would be away from here.
Harry Potter must go home.
Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see...
Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.
Dobby had to iron his hands.
You better clear off before my bones come back, or I might strangle you.
Dobby is used to death threats, sir.
Dobby gets them five times a day at home.
I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
Not kill you, sir.
Never kill you.
Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed...
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir.
Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin.
Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?
This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elf's enslavement.
Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes.
Listen.
Listen!
Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts.
Harry Potter must not stay here...
...now that history is to repeat itself.
Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
I shouldn't have said that.
- Bad Dobby! Bad!
- Stop it!
Stop it, Dobby!
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?
Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe.
No, Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?
Put him here.
- What happened?
- There's been another attack.
I think he's been Petrified,
Madam Pomfrey.
Look. Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker.
What can this mean, Albus?
It means...
...that our students are in great danger.
- What should I tell the staff?
- The truth.
Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe.
It is as we feared, Minerva.
The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again.
Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
Of course.
Don't you see?
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here.
- Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
- Maybe.
We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight...
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?
No. No one ever comes in here.
- Why?
- Moaning Myrtle.
Who?
Moaning Myrtle.
- Who's Moaning Myrtle?
- I'm Moaning Myrtle.
I wouldn't expect you to know me.
Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable...
...moping Moaning Myrtle?
She's a little sensitive.
Gather round!
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?
Can you all hear me?
Excellent.
In light of the dark events of recent weeks...
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this Dueling Club...
...to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves...
...as I myself have done on countless occasions.
For full details, see my published works.
Let me introduce my assistant...
...Professor Snape.
He has sportingly agreed to help with a short demonstration.
I don't want any of you youngsters to worry.
You'll still have your Potions master when I'm through with him. Never fear.
One.
Two.
- Three!
- Expelliarmus!
- Do you think he's all right?
- Who cares?
An excellent idea to show them that,
Professor Snape...
...but if you don't mind me saying, it was obvious what you were about to do.
If I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.
Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students...
...to block unfriendly spells, professor.
An excellent suggestion,
Professor Snape.
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter, Weasley, how about you?
Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells.
We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox.
Might I suggest someone from my own house?
Malfoy, perhaps?
- Good luck, Potter.
- Thank you, sir.
Wands at the ready.
- Scared, Potter?
- You wish.
On the count of three...
...cast your charms to disarm your opponent. Only to disarm.
We don't want any accidents here.
One.
- Two.
- Everte Statum!
Rictusempra!
I said disarm only.
Serpensortia!
Don't move, Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.
Allow me, Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!
Vipera Evanesca.
What are you playing at?
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?
- I'm a what?
- You can talk to snakes.
I know. I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.
No, they can't.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.
This is bad.
What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...
- That's what you said to it.
- You were there. You heard me.
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.
I spoke a different language?
But I didn't realize...
How can I speak a language without knowing I can?
I don't know, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on or something.
Harry, listen to me.
There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin house is a serpent.
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.
Exactly.
Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson.
But I'm not.
I can't be.
He lived a thousand years ago.
For all we know, you could be.
I'll see you back in the common room.
I want blood.
They all must die.
Kill.
Kill.
Kill.
Time to kill.
Caught in the act.
I'll have you out this time, Potter.
Mark my words.
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand...
Professor...
...I swear I didn't.
This is out of my hands, Potter.
Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.
Sherbet Lemon.
Professor Dumbledore?
Bee in your bonnet, Potter?
I was just wondering if you put me in the right house.
Yes. You were particularly difficult to place.
But I stand by what I said last year.
You would have done well in Slytherin.
You're wrong.
Harry?
Professor.
Your bird...
There was nothing I could do.
- He just caught fire.
- And about time too.
He's been looking dreadful for days.
Pity you had to see him on a burning day.
Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry.
They burst into flame when it is time for them to die...
...and then they are...
...reborn from the ashes.
Fascinating creatures, phoenixes.
They can carry immensely heavy loads.
Their tears have healing powers.
Professor Dumbledore, sir!
Wait! Listen!
Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry.
I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic.
Relax.
I do not believe...
...that Harry attacked anyone.
- Of course you don't.
Right. Well, I'll...
- I'll just wait outside, then.
- Yes.
- You don't think it was me, professor?
- No, Harry.
I do not think it was you.
But I must ask you...
...is there something you wish to tell me?
No, sir.
Nothing.
Very well, then.
Off you go.
Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
Crabbe and Goyle.
We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle...
...can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
- How?
- I've got it all worked out.
I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught.
Simple, but powerful.
Now, once they're asleep...
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs...
...and put on their uniforms.
- Whose hair are you ripping out, then?
- I've already got mine.
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.
I got this off her robes.
I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion.
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these.
Ron, maybe I should do it.
Yeah. Right.
Wingardium Leviosa.
Cool.
How thick could you get?
Come on, let's get them.
We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves.
Add the hairs.
Essence of Crabbe.
Cheers.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Me too.
Harry?
Ron.
Bloody hell!
We still sound like ourselves.
You need to sound more like Crabbe.
- Bloody hell.
- Excellent.
- But where's Hermione?
- I...
I don't think I'm going.
You go on without me.
Hermione, are you okay?
Just go. You're wasting time.
Come on.
I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
Excuse me.
What are you doing d...?
I mean, what are you doing down here?
I happen to be a school prefect.
You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at night.
What are your names again?
- I'm...
- Crabbe, Goyle, where have you been?
Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time?
Why are you wearing glasses?
- Reading.
- Reading?
I didn't know you could read.
And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?
Mind your attitude, Malfoy.
Well, sit down.
You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave.
They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them.
What's wrong with you, Crabbe?
Stomachache.
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks.
I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up.
Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing...
...that ever happened to this place.
- You're wrong!
What?
You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore?
Well? Do you?
Harry Potter?
Good one, Goyle.
You're absolutely right.
Saint Potter.
And people actually think that he's the Heir of Slytherin?
But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
You know I don't, Goyle.
I told you yesterday.
How many times do I have to tell you?
Is this yours?
But my father did say this:
It's been 50 years since the Chamber was opened.
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.
The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died.
So it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time.
As for me...
...I hope it's Granger.
What's the matter with you two?
You're acting very odd.
It's his stomachache.
Calm down.
Scar.
Hair.
Hey! Where are you going?
That was close.
Hermione, come out.
We've got loads to tell you.
Go away.
Wait till you see. It's awful.
Hermione?
Are you okay?
Do you remember me telling you...
...that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations?
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.
Look at my face.
Look at your tail.
Have you spoken to Hermione?
She should be out of hospital in a few days...
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.
What's this?
Yuck!
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
- Come to throw something else at me?
- Why would I throw something at you?
Don't ask me. Here I am, minding my own business...
...and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me.
But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you.
I mean, it'll just go right through you.
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it.
Ten points if you get it through her stomach!
Fifty points if it goes through her head!
- But who threw it at you, anyway?
- I don't know. I didn't see them.
I was just sitting in the U-bend, thinking about death...
...and it fell through the top of my head.
"Tom Marvolo Riddle."
My name...
...is Harry...
...Potter.
Do you know anything...
...about the Chamber of Secrets?
Can you...
...tell me?
Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here?
Are you Tom Riddle?
Hello, can you hear me?
Riddle!
Come.
Professor Dumbledore.
Dumbledore?
It is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, Tom.
Yes, professor. I suppose I...
I had to see for myself if the rumors were true.
I'm afraid they are, Tom.
They are true.
About the school as well?
I don't have a home to go to.
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, professor?
I understand, Tom, but I'm afraid...
...Headmaster Dippet may have no choice.
Sir, if it all stopped, if the person responsible was caught...
Is there something...
...you wish to tell me?
No, sir. Nothing.
Very well, then. Off you go.
Good night, sir.
- Let's get you out of there.
- Evening, Hagrid.
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone...
You can't. You don't understand.
The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...
...is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.
Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid.
- Now, stand aside.
- No!
- Stand aside, Hagrid.
- No!
Cistem Aperio!
Arania Exumai!
Aragog!
Aragog!
I can't let you go.
They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.
Hagrid!
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch.
The monster had killed somebody, Ron.
What would any of us have done?
Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?
That would be a cheerful visit.
"Hello, Hagrid.
Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me, now, would you?
No.
What's that you've got, Hagrid?
It's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes, you know.
Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing to do.
But once their acne's cleared up, we'll chop them up and stew them...
...and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-Petrified.
In the meantime, though, you three...
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?
Hello, Neville.
Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come.
Come on!
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.
Unless it wasn't a student.
Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something.
And they found it.
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
All right, listen up.
We play our game,
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.
We're stronger, quicker and smarter.
Not to mention they're dead scared that Harry will Petrify them...
...if they fly anywhere near him.
- Well, that too.
Professor McGonagall.
- This match has been canceled.
- We can't cancel Quidditch.
Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.
Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley.
There's something the both of you have to see.
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.
Hermione!
She was found near the library...
...along with this.
Does it mean anything to either of you?
No.
Could I have your attention, please?
Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately:
"All students will return to their house common rooms by 6:00 every evening.
All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher.
No exceptions."
I should tell you this:
Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught...
...it is likely the school will be closed.
We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron.
I can't believe it's him...
...but if he did set the monster loose last time...
...he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.
But you heard McGonagall.
We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
Who's there?
Hello?
Hello?
- What's that for?
- Nothing. I was expecting...
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
I just made a pot of tea.
Hagrid, are you okay?
I'm fine. I'm all right.
Did you hear about Hermione?
Yeah. I heard about that, all right.
Look, we have to ask you something.
Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?
What you had to understand about that is...
Quick, under the cloak.
Don't say a word.
Be quiet, both of you.
- Professor Dumbledore, sir.
- Good evening, Hagrid.
I wonder, could we...?
Of course. Come in. Come in.
That's Dad's boss.
Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic.
Bad business, Hagrid, very bad business.
Had to come.
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.
- The Ministry's got to act.
- But I never...
You know I never, professor.
I want it understood, Cornelius...
...that Hagrid...
...has my full confidence.
Albus, look,
Hagrid's record is against him.
- I've got to take him.
- Take me?
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.
I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
Already here, Fudge?
Good.
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!
Believe me...
...I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your...
You call this a house?
No.
I simply called up the school and was told the headmaster was here.
Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?
The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside.
This is an order of suspension.
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.
I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch.
Well, what, with all these attacks...
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.
I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.
Take him away and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance.
You mark my words, there'll be killings next!
You think so?
Calm yourself, Hagrid.
If the governors desire my removal...
...I will, of course, step aside.
However...
...you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts...
...to those who...
...ask for it.
Admirable sentiments.
Shall we?
Fudge.
Come, Hagrid.
Well?
If...
If anybody was looking for some stuff...
...then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders.
Yep. That would lead them right.
That's all I have to say.
And someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away.
Good boy.
Hagrid's right.
With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day.
Look.
Come on.
Come on, Fang.
Come on.
What?
You heard what Hagrid said.
"Follow the spiders."
They're heading to the Dark Forest.
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
"follow the butterflies"?
Harry, I don't like this.
- Harry, I don't like this at all.
- Shush!
Can we go back now?
Come on.
Who is it?
Don't panic.
Hagrid?
Is that you?
We're friends of Hagrid's.
And you?
You're Aragog, aren't you?
Yes.
Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks.
They think it's Hagrid.
They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.
That's a lie.
Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
- Then you're not the monster?
- No.
The monster was born in the castle.
I came to Hagrid from a distant land in the pocket of a traveler.
Harry.
But if you're not the monster, then what did kill that girl 50 years ago?
We do not speak of it.
It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
But have you seen it?
I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me.
The girl was discovered in a bathroom.
When I was accused,
Hagrid brought me here.
- Harry!
- What?
Well, thank you.
We'll just go.
Go?
I think not.
My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command.
But I cannot deny them fresh meat...
...when it wanders so willingly into our midst.
Goodbye, friend of Hagrid.
Can we panic now?
Know any spells?
One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them.
Where's Hermione when you need her?
Let's go!
Arania Exumai!
Go!
Glad we're out of there.
Arania Exumai!
- Thanks for that.
- Don't mention it.
Get us out of here.
Now!
Come on!
Come on, move faster!
Come on! Go!
Get us in the air.
The flying gear's jammed!
- Come on! Pull!
- I'm trying!
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.
If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban,
I'll kill him.
I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?
- What have we found out?
- We know one thing.
Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
He was innocent.
Wish you were here, Hermione.
We need you.
Now more than ever.
- What's that?
- Ron...
This is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked.
Come on.
"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land...
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...
...instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye.
Spiders flee before it."
Ron, this is it.
The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.
But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?
Because no one did look it in the eye.
Not directly, at least.
Colin saw it through his camera.
Justin... Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost, he couldn't die again.
And Hermione had the mirror.
I bet you she was using it to look around corners in case it came along.
And Mrs. Norris?
I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry.
The water.
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.
"Spiders flee before it."
- It all fits.
- How's a basilisk been getting around?
A dirty, great snake.
Someone would have seen it.
- Hermione's answered that too.
- Pipes? It's using the plumbing.
Remember what Aragog said about that girl 50 years ago?
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?
Moaning Myrtle.
All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
All teachers to the second-floor corridor immediately.
As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message.
Our worst fear has been realized.
A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself.
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?
A girl has been snatched by the monster,
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.
- My moment?
- Weren't you saying just last night...
...that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
That's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy.
- Your skills, after all, are legend.
- Very well.
I'll just be in my office getting...
Getting ready.
Who is it that the monster's taken,
Minerva?
Ginny Weasley.
"Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever."
Ginny.
Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber.
At least we can tell him what we know.
Professor, we have some information for you.
Are you going somewhere?
Well, yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.
- What about my sister?
- Well...
As to that, most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.
I must say, when I took the job, there was nothing in the description...
You're running away?
- After all you did in your books?
- Books can be misleading.
- You wrote them.
- My dear boy, use your common sense.
My books wouldn't have sold as well if people didn't think I'd done those things.
You're a fraud.
You've been taking credit for what other wizards have done.
Is there anything you can do?
Yes, now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.
Otherwise, all those wizards would have gone blabbing.
I'd never have sold another book.
In fact, I'm going to have to do the same to you.
Don't even think about it.
Who's there?
Hello, Harry.
- What do you want?
- To ask you how you died.
It was dreadful.
It happened right here in this very cubicle.
I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses.
I was crying, and then
I heard somebody come in.
- Who was it, Myrtle?
- I don't know. I was distraught!
But they said something funny, a kind of made-up language.
And I realized it was a boy, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and...
...I died.
- Just like that? How?
I just remember seeing a pair of great, big, yellow eyes...
...over there by that sink.
This is it.
This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.
Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue.
Excellent, Harry. Good work.
Well, then, I'll just be...
There's no need for me to stay.
Yes, there is.
- You first.
- Now, boys, what good will it do?
Better you than us.
But... Obviously, yes.
Sure you don't want to test it first?
It's really quite filthy down here.
- All right. Let's go.
- Oh, Harry?
If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet.
Thanks, Myrtle.
Now, remember: Any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
Go on.
This way.
- What's this?
- It looks like a snake.
- It's a snakeskin.
- Bloody hell.
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.
Heart of a lion, this one.
The adventure ends here, boys.
But don't fret.
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.
How you two tragically lost your minds...
...at the sight of her mangled body.
So...
You first, Mr. Potter.
Say goodbye to your memories.
Obliviate!
- Ron! Ron, are you okay?
- I'm fine.
Hello.
Who are you?
- Ron Weasley.
- Really?
And who am I?
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.
It's an odd sort of place, isn't it?
Do you live here?
- No.
- Really?
- What do I do now?
- You wait here...
...and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through.
- I'll go on and find Ginny.
- Okay.
Ginny! Ginny, please don't be dead.
Wake up, wake up.
Please wake up.
She won't wake.
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean, she won't wake?
- She's not...?
- She's still alive, but only just.
- Are you a ghost?
- A memory...
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.
She's cold as ice.
Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up.
You've got to help me, Tom.
There's a basilisk.
It won't come until it's called.
- Give me my wand, Tom.
- You won't be needing it.
- We've got to go. We've got to save her.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.
You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker,
I grow stronger.
Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.
It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...
...Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
- But why?
- Because I told her to.
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.
She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Still, the power of the diary began to scare her.
She tried to dispose of it in the girls' bathroom.
And then who should find it but you?
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.
And why did you want to meet me?
I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could.
So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf Hagrid...
...to gain your trust.
- Hagrid's my friend.
- And you framed him, didn't you?
- It was my word against Hagrid's.
Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that.
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...
...so I decided to leave behind a diary...
...preserving my 16-year-old self in its pages...
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work.
Well, you haven't finished it this time.
In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready.
And everyone who was Petrified will be all right again.
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore.
For many months now, my new target has been you.
How is it that a baby with no extraordinary magical talent...
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time?
How did you escape with nothing but a scar...
...while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.
Voldemort is my past, present and future.
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.
- You're Voldemort.
- Surely you didn't think...
...I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name?
No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere...
...would fear to speak when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world.
Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me.
He'll never be gone. Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him.
Fawkes?
So this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender.
A songbird and an old hat.
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin...
...against the famous Harry Potter.
Parseltongue won't save you now,
Potter. It only obeys me.
No!
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you.
Yes, Potter.
The process is nearly complete.
In a few minutes, Ginny Weasley will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory.
Lord Voldemort will return...
...very much alive.
Ginny?
Remarkable, isn't it...
...how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body?
I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live.
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon, Harry.
Funny, the damage a silly little book can do...
...especially in the hands of a silly little girl.
What are you doing?
Stop. No!
It was me.
But I swear, I didn't mean to.
Riddle made me, and...
Harry, you're hurt.
Don't worry.
Ginny, you need to get yourself out.
Follow the Chamber and you'll find Ron.
You were brilliant, Fawkes.
I just wasn't quick enough.
Of course.
Phoenix tears have healing powers.
Thanks.
It's all right, Ginny.
It's over.
It's just a memory.
Amazing!
This is just like magic!
You both realize, of course...
...that in the past few hours, you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules.
Yes, sir.
There is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
Yes, sir.
Therefore, it is only fitting...
...that you both receive...
...Special Awards for Services to the School.
Thanks, sir.
Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would...
...have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban.
I believe we want our gamekeeper back.
First, I want to thank you, Harry.
You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber.
Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.
And...
...second...
...I sense that something is troubling you.
Am I right, Harry?
It's just...
You see, sir, I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain...
Certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me.
I see.
Well, you can speak
Parseltongue, Harry. Why?
Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue.
If I'm not mistaken, Harry...
...he transferred some of his powers to you...
...the night he gave you that scar.
Voldemort transferred some of his powers to me?
Not intentionally...
...but yes.
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.
It's true. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.
Determination, resourcefulness...
...and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules.
Why, then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?
- Because I asked it to.
- Exactly, Harry. Exactly.
Which makes you different from Voldemort.
It is not our abilities that show what we truly are.
It is our choices.
If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor...
...then I suggest you look more closely at this.
Be careful.
Godric Gryffindor.
It would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
Dobby.
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.
I'll deal with you later.
Out of my way, Potter.
So it's true. You have returned.
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...
...was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
- Ridiculous.
- Curiously, Lucius, several of them...
...were under the impression that you would curse their family...
...if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place.
- How dare you!
- Beg your pardon?
My sole concern has always been and will always be...
...the welfare of this school...
...and, of course, its students.
The culprit has been identified,
I presume?
Yes.
And?
Who was it?
Voldemort.
Only this time he chose to act through somebody else...
...by means of this.
I see.
Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it.
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...
...should find their way into innocent hands.
The consequences for the one responsible would be...
...severe.
Well, let us hope...
...that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day.
Don't worry. I will be.
Dumbledore.
Come, Dobby. We're leaving.
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?
Mr. Malfoy.
Mr. Malfoy!
I have something of yours.
Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
I think you do, sir.
I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...
...that day at Diagon Alley.
You do, do you?
Why don't you prove it?
Come, Dobby.
Open it.
Dobby.
Master has given Dobby a sock.
What? I didn't give...
Master has presented Dobby with clothes.
Dobby is free.
You lost me my servant!
You shall not harm Harry Potter.
Your parents were meddlesome fools too.
Mark my words, Potter.
One day soon...
...you are going to meet the same sticky end.
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?
- Just promise me something.
- Anything, sir.
Never try to save my life again.
- Welcome back, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.
- Good evening, Sir Nicholas.
- Good evening.
- Good to see you, Sir Nicholas.
- Thank you.
Hello.
- Hermione! Welcome back.
- Thanks, Sir Nicholas.
Harry. It's Hermione.
- Welcome back, Hermione.
- It's good to be back.
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.
We had loads of help from you.
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Thanks.
Could I have your attention, please?
Before we begin the feast...
...let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout, Madam Pomfrey...
...whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered...
...to all who had been Petrified.
Also, in light of the recent events...
...as a school treat...
...all exams have been canceled.
Oh, no.
Sorry I'm late.
The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused.
Some ruddy bird called Errol.
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry and Ron...
...and Hermione, of course...
...I would still be you-know-where...
...so I'd just like to say thanks.
There's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid.
The Empire of lzmer has long been a divided land.
Ruled by the Mages, an elite group of magic users.
The lowly Commoners, those without magic... are little more than slaves.
Izmer's young Empress Savina... wishes equality and prosperity for all.
But the evil Mage Profion has other intentions.
At last!
Come, Damodar.
Release him.
You are mine now.
Come to me!
Yes, I told you it could be done.
You have the power of the lmmortals.
You can control Dragons.
With a Dragon army at my command...
I can crush the Empress... and control what is rightfully mine!
You don't like that, do you?
Good!
I can use every ounce of your rage!
Come on.
Follow me.
Follow me!
I said follow me!
What now, my lord Profion?
We shall have to modify our plans.
Summon the High Council of Mages immediately.
They're about to learn something of our young Empress... that may give them pause for thought.
It will be done.
This must be some twisted magic experiment... gone seriously wrong.
Why is it every time something bad happens... you blame the Mages?
When was the last time you saw a river catch on fire?
You think they care if anyone got hurt?
I'd love to find a way to give those Mages some payback.
"Ridley the Savior."
That'll be the day.
Look, Ridley, things are the way they are.
There's nothing you can do to change it.
You got your haves and your have-nots.
We are your gotta-gets.
And right about now, we gotta get paid.
The Magic School.
The what?!
The Magic School?
Are you crazy?
We'll break into the Magic School.
Think of what we could get.
With the fire, it won't be heavily guarded.
Think of the challenge, Snails.
Think of what we could find in there.
If we pull this off... we'll be the envy of every Thief in Sumdall.
Trust me.
Why would the Empress want to disband this Council?
It's a concept
I find difficult to believe.
Azmath, your loyalty is commendable... but we have all watched the Empress' growing up... and we have all heard her views... on what she considers to be the injustices of the land.
But she is just a young woman.
Young people speak from the heart, not the mind.
In time, with our counsel... she will come to understand why things cannot be changed.
Maybe so.
But is that a risk you are willing to take?
Her revolutionary ideas... have already taken root among the people.
In time, her influence will grow.
As the months go by... she will learn to master the powers of her Scepter.
When she does,
I have no doubt... she will use it to enforce her changes upon us.
What do you propose, Profion?
I humbly ask that we vote to remove the Scepter... from the Empress' control... so that government in lzmer will remain secure.
Remove the Scepter which lolls above our heads... and destroy the threat of revolution forever!
And if she does not agree?
Then... her true intentions will become clear.
And then we will be forced to do whatever we must... to protect the strength and unity of lzmer.
What say you?
How could he get the Council to turn against me?
He plays on the fears of the others-- their fears of change.
I know, Vildan... but the changes I propose are for the good of the people.
All people deserve to be free and equal... whether Commoner or Mage.
I know this within the depths of my soul... and if necessary...
I would die to make that the way lzmer is run.
What can I do to stop Profion?
You must outsmart him.
Over the past years,
I have been searching... for an ancient artifact called the Rod of Savrille.
It holds the same powers as your Scepter... with one difference--
It controls Red Dragons.
If you could obtain it... you could relinquish your Scepter to the Council... and still have protection against Profion.
I must have that Rod of Savrille!
With one wave of it,
I will topple her... and bring down that useless
Council of idiots with her.
What is your wish, my lord?
Pay a visit to the Magic School and see our friend Vildan.
Persuade him to give you the scroll of which he speaks... and bring it here to me.
And, Damodar... make sure that he's no longer around... to give our young Empress any more good advice.
Come, my friend.
Ridley, why it got to be so high?
Snails, let go of me.
Can't we just rob the first floor next time?
Hurry up.
Why don't we just rob God while we're up here?
Come on, Snails.
I thought you said this was going to be easy.
No, I said it wasn't impossible.
That's the same thing you said... when we robbed that little Halfling's house.
Who'd he catch? Me.
Who'd he beat from the waist down? Me.
-Are you going to jump?
-You going to catch me?
-I'm going to catch you.
-Promise?
I promise. Now jump.
All right.
Sorry.
I thought I heard something.
You did.
Me hitting the ground.
That is a big Dragon.
Now we're talking.
All right. Let's get to work.
I've already told you, Marina.
The Empress can't use... her Scepter of Gold-Dragon control... or Profion will paint her as a tyrant to the Council.
Profion must be made to expose himself to them.
Damn it, I know it's here.
Where is it?
It should be right here.
Are you sure you put it away in its proper place?
I'm sure.
You're sure, are you?
Then why is it filed here with these volumes on alchemy?
It belongs in Dracology.
Where is it?
I know I've got it somewhere.
Ah, yes, this was it.
Really, Marina, you must stop dawdling.
The Empress only has three days until the Council... forces her to relinquish her Scepter to them.
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.
You must understand the seriousness of our task.
I just feel like I should be doing something more... than shelving books.
I understand, Marina... but you must learn to be patient to maintain focus.
That's the best help you can provide just now.
I suppose you're right.
I never saw a scroll so hard to decode!
It's protected by very ancient magic.
Marina, fetch me some Manticore wing.
-What is that?
-A Dragon tooth.
-Put it back!
-Just a Dragon tooth.
-Put it back.
-A Gold Dragon tooth?
-It's too big. Put it back.
-Come on, Ridley.
Here.
What'd you give me the rodent for?
Pick it up! Come on.
You already got enough of these at your house.
Look at this.
We're going to be rich.
You know how much we could get for one of these?
Don't touch that!
One of the lab creatures must have got loose again.
Marina, check on it.
Right.
Snails, relax.
It's an illusion.
I knew that.
Don't touch anything else!
All right.
What are you doing?
We're the...
The cleaning crew.
Right.
This is dirty.
Cleanup crew's more like it.
You're Thieves trying to rob us.
She must've put a holding spell on us with that bracelet.
It must be the only way she can get guys to come home with her.
I'd have to put a feeble-mind spell on myself... to want to take you home.
That was funny.
You're going to the city dungeon.
That wasn't.
What a relief.
I'll be thanking you when they cut my head off.
You should.
It'd be an improvement.
There's that superior intelligence... you Mages are so famous for.
Yes, well, speaking of intelligence... what kind of genius would break into a Magic School?
He'd have to be really stupid or--
Or what?
Well...
Master!
If you don't tell me which scroll it is...
I'll have to kill you painfully.
Never!
Are you crazy?
You just zapped...
The Chief of the Crimson Brigade!
To the streets of Sumdall!
Follow them, you fools!
Where are we going?
Hey, nice trick!
No, the other way!
Watch out!
Lady, please, stop and listen.
Escapes are our bread and butter.
-What's that?
-I don't know!
Get this rope off so I can deal with it!
Can't nobody get a moment of peace around here?
I ought to...
Nice lid.
You shouldn't have done that.
Check that door.
It's locked! It's locked!
Follow me!
If you think I'm going in that filthy mess--
That's disgusting!
Post Brigades at every sewer entrance and exit.
I want them found... now.
Marina of Pretensa, student Mage... is sought for the brutal murder of Vildan Vildir.
A reward will be...
I can't believe this!
You better believe it.
They're framing us.
They're framing you.
You're nothing but a Thief.
They can't be framing me.
I'm an aristocrat. I'm a Mage.
A low-level Mage-- completely expendable.
Practically worthless.
This is ridiculous.
I'll go to the authorities.
I can't go to the authorities.
That's right.
They'll toss you in prison... and torture you till you confess.
You better tell us,
'cause like the man said... we're your accomplices.
All right.
Come on!
You allow... a slip of a girl to escape you... with the scroll... and now Norda, the Empress' finest tracker... is in pursuit... and you tell me not to concern myself?
It was a mistake.
It will not happen again.
There you are right.
And here's why...
Just a friend I'm sending along for the ride.
A gentle reminder not to make any more mistakes.
The moment you deliver me the Rod...
I'll ensure that he-- it... vacate the premises.
Now... may I suggest... that once you two have become fully acquainted... you follow the Empress' tracker Norda.
She happens to be good at her job.
She will lead you to our missing friends... and the scroll... and this time, Damodar... don't fail me.
It's about time!
If we find the Rod, the Empress heaps us with gold, huh?
Why don't you try and rise above being a Dwarf?
This isn't about gold.
It's about saving our Empire.
Empire?
Who cares about the Empire?
You Mages are the only ones who benefit from it.
Oh, really? That's an interesting sentiment... coming from a guy who steals things for a living.
Have you ever heard of honor amongst Thieves?
We might live outside the law, but we respect each other.
Unlike a bunch of back-stabbing Mages.
That is just the sort of half-baked, illiterate drivel... that proves Commoners really are common.
That's it. We're out of here.
Come on, Snails.
We'll go into hiding.
She can find the Rod herself.
Fine.
I thought you were leaving.
Mind if we eat first?
No. Be my guest.
Those red marks there look like the locks... my father used to put on plans in his carriages.
Please.
This is an ancient scroll, not a blueprint for a bucket.
You don't seem to know what you're doing... so you might as well let me have a look.
Give that back!
Let's see. He used to put his fingers like this... and then he'd say something like...
Alanor, salah--
What was that word?
Bidet.
Bidet? Bidara! Bidara.
Alanor, salah, bidara!
Can't blame me for trying.
At least l--
See that there?
I knew that boy had talent!
Alanor, salah, bidara!
Do not let them escape... or you will suffer a fate far worse... than that which hath been inflicted upon me.
So there I am, hogtied, lying on my back.
This Orc starts poking me with the spear.
Kind of a no-win situation.
So, I say to myself,
"What do I got to lose?"
So, I take that spear and bite it.
And I start chewing.
Idol of idols.
With an Elf.
You got to be kidding.
The problem with Elves is they got no meat on their bones.
You got to get yourself a nice 250-pound Dwarf.
With hair on her chin you can hang on to.
Excuse me, little man.
You looking for somebody in particular?
Or are you just looking for... somebody?
Actually...
I'm looking for someone just like you.
What a coincidence...
'cause I was looking for someone just like you.
We got to celebrate.
Bartender, give me a bottle of your best wine.
Make that your cheapest.
Wait.
I need the girl.
Bar fight!
Get them !
This ain't the time for romance!
-What are you doing?
-Come on! Come on!
Wait, I got to go back.
I think I'm in love!
With an Elf?
They think Humans are a joke!
All right, I lied.
I just want to hit it!
Let's get Ridley out of here.
Bidet, bidet, bidet.
That Wraith must have been defective.
-He seemed reliable to me.
-He did not.
It's Damodar, man.
He's onto us.
With what we've walked into, everyone's going to be onto us.
What do you mean, everybody's onto us?
Go ahead.
Tell him what you got us into.
Me? But you--
Go ahead.
Tell me what you got us into.
According to the Wraith inside the scroll... the Rod we're looking for caused the Great War.
Is that all?
Have you lost your damn mind?
What does this Rod do?
It's supposed to have the power to control Red Dragons.
I don't know about you... but this sound like a pretty bad idea to me.
It gets better.
This map leads to a Dragon temple.
To get in, we have to get the Eye of the Dragon... from the Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild... in Antius City.
Xilus?
No. Get--
No way!
I told her she's crazy... but she keeps going on about
Profion and the Empress.
Profion?
They can take care of themselves.
I suggest we lay low...
Iet the whole thing blow over, come back, rob everybody.
That's all. Let's go.
Snails, there's one more small problem.
Problem?
What's the problem, Ridley?
I kind of committed us to find it.
Ridley, how could you do something like that?
You--
I can't believe this.
I can't believe--
"This is our big chance, huh?
"Let's rob the magic school.
This is our big chance!"
That's what you said to me, right?
This is... dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
Dumb!
I got a new name for dumb.
"Ridley."
This is the Ridley-est thing
I ever heard of.
I'll understand if you don't want to go.
What do you mean I can't go?
Look, all I'm saying is that... don't you think this is just a little bit out of our league?
Just a little bit?
Snails, listen to me, OK?
This Eye of the Dragon we're supposed to get?
It's a ruby the size of your fist.
I don't--
A ruby the size of a fist?
Yeah. We'll use her to help us get it, and we'll take off.
We'll make a fortune.
Trust me.
I hate when you say that!
Ridley, I know I'll regret this.
I knew you'd come through for me!
Don't touch me.
OK, just a little bit.
We're in.
How about you?
I don't see what choice I have.
Just tell me one thing--
If I help, who'll pay me?
We'll worry about that later.
That's a terrible way to do business.
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it!
Get out of here!
Ridley, check it out.
Let's go.
Listen, we're looking for esteemed Guildmaster Xilus.
We thought you'd know him.
The only thing I know is... you ought to take your business out of town... before you get the words
"outsiders not appreciated"... branded right where your nose used to be.
Get it?
Thanks for your time!
If I ain't drinking, you sure ain't shopping!
Come on!
There you are!
Where have you been?
Don't look at us, all right?
We're just shopping.
Is that three-eyed hyphen bastard watching us?
If we follow him... he'll probably lead us into the Guild.
There he goes.
Let's go.
Come on.
Elwood, we'll go in.
You keep a lookout.
Nice.
Isn't that Tollum?
The guy that kidnapped the Duke of--
Let's keep 'em walking.
Let's go find Xilus.
That won't be necessary.
Like I said,
"Outsiders not appreciated."
You was talking to us?
We was confused
'cause your third eye... was looking at somebody completely different.
Take 'em away!
Don't touch me!
Get off me! Get off of me!
Where do you think they took Snails?
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
Just let me do the talking.
So this is it?
Everything a Thief strives for?
You must be Xilus.
Ridley Freeborn. Practitioner of the larcenous crafts.
Member in good standing of the Sumdall Guild.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
A fellow Thief.
The pleasure's all mine.
See?
Sumdall, eh?
How is old Sumdall?
That's a pretty tough town, isn't it?
All those Mages.
We get by.
Yes, well, I think you must be very accomplished... to have such a precious morsel traveling with you.
What might I do for you?
The unity of our kingdom--
We understand you have something called the Eye of the Dragon.
We desperately need it.
Yes, well, I'm always happy to help a fellow Thief.
Have you ever heard of the Antius Guild Maze?
Of course.
Every Thief has heard of it.
Wonderful.
Then you'll know that the Eye of the Dragon... is the prize at the center of my Guild Maze, won't you?
You finish the maze, you win the prize.
Has anyone ever finished it before?
They all died trying.
But look on the bright side.
At least the prize is still there.
Good health.
And jolly good luck.
This is a good one, Ridley.
That's no fair!
-I give him forty seconds.
-Nah, a minute.
I can't believe they're betting on whether or not he lives.
Au contraire, precious morsel.
They're betting on how long before he dies.
Be careful, Ridley!
Oh, my.
This is not right!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very clever.
But is clever enough?
Come on, the game ain't over yet.
Very light on his feet, isn't he?
What kind of vault is that?
I think she needs to visit her friend.
Nice.
Well, yes, yes, yes.
Very clever. Well done, you.
-You were absolutely amazing.
-Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thank you.
I waited fifteen years for someone to pick that lock.
I knew the man that could survive that maze... would be able to get into that vault.
And now, here he is.
The man. You.
Why don't you give me what's rightfully mine?
What about honor amongst Thieves?
What a romantic notion.
Do you honestly believe
I could've amassed my wealth... if I worried about honor?
So, pretty boy... if you don't want Hugo here... to rearrange your features for you...
I suggest you just give it up.
Who the hell is he?
Who the hell are you?
I don't know who you are... but be prepared for a lesson in pain.
You must be joking.
I never joke when Mages trespass in my Guild!
This is the map you're after.
Clear a path, and I'll put it out.
Do it.
Let go of me!
You OK?
We got to save Marina.
Wait. What about the Dwarf?
You get the Dwarf,
I'll get the girl.
Wait. How come I always got to get the Dwarf?
Damn!
Ridley, we already have the Dragon's Eye.
Let's take it to Sumdall and sell it.
Snails, we're not leaving without Marina.
Listen to you, Ridley!
You're going to risk your life for a Mage?
Listen, Snails--
What?
I wouldn't do that... if I were you.
Hey, it's you.
You know her?
We're acquainted.
Is that the Elf you were drooling over?
I wouldn't put it that way.
But, yeah, that's her.
Pretty, huh?
They all look alike to me.
Silence!
Where is the girl?
None of your business.
Wrong, Human.
It is my business to arrest you and Marina of Pretensa... and to take you and the scroll you stole... back to the Empress of lzmer.
So you're the law, are you?
I should have known.
One of your fellow lawmen-- in fact, the Chief of the Crimson Brigade-- beat you to the punch.
He just took off with Marina!
-Damodar.
-That's him.
Only he's not working for the law anymore.
He's working for Profion.
He's the one you want, not us.
Your Majesty.
Yes, Norda.
Have you found me the scroll?
No, Your Highness.
I have unfortunate tidings to report.
It seems Profion also seeks the Rod.
But how could he know?
I do not know, milady.
Damodar has captured
Marina of Pretensa... and the scroll... but I have her companions in my custody.
What is your command?
Seek Damodar out.
We need that Rod.
The Council demands my response imminently.
Norda, please hurry.
Our time is running out.
As you wish.
Gather the horses.
We will track Damodar.
They will travel with us.
Should they try to escape... kill them.
Tell me...
Why were you at the Thieves Guild?
It isn't exactly a sightseeing spot, is it?
We needed money for supplies.
You'll have to do better than that.
I'm curious.
You're a Mage... and yet you're disgracing your family... by consorting with Thieves.
You're a disgrace to lzmer, conspiring against the Empress.
I have no dispute with her.
You know me.
I have served her family loyally for many a year.
It is Profion's desire to dethrone her... not mine.
Then why do you help him?
Look at me.
Look at me!
If I do not obtain the Rod...
I will die.
Please... help me.
I'm sorry, but l...
I cannot help you.
Foolish girl.
I can suck... the information I want... right out of you.
Your friends have procured... the Eye of the Dragon... from the Thieves Maze.
A key... of some sort.
Can't I just walk?
Don't you people know Dwarves are terrified of horses?
Get over it.
A lot of Dwarves are afraid to show their true feelings.
I'm not, OK?
They followed the valley.
I know these lands.
There's a shortcut up ahead.
Through the forest and over those hills.
It means leaving the trail... but if Damodar sets up camp and we ride all night... we stand a good chance of cutting him off.
All right, let's go.
I love the way you track.
You wouldn't happen to be single, are you?
What?
There's no harm in asking is there?
It just so happens that I'm single.
Can you believe it?
How old are you?
Twenty-three. I know
I'm a little young for you.
What if I get my hands on an aging potion?
I'll sacrifice a couple of years for you.
I'm 234.
Oh, damn.
I didn't mean that much of a change.
Hurry.
Ridley, look--Beholders.
Relax, Snails.
We'll just sneak around 'em.
Now what?
A little distraction.
All right, Snails, stay close.
All clear.
OK. I'll get Marina.
You get the map.
OK. Hey, wait, Ridley.
How you get the girl and I get a map?
We got to work out some new plans.
Go.
Be careful.
All right.
You, too.
Let's go in.
We were not meant to enter this place.
This task they must complete alone.
I'm Damodar.
A little black magic.
All right, Damodar.
Nice.
Piece of cake.
I knew this was too easy.
Need a hand?
It's OK.
Let's get you out of here.
Come on.
Just like you Thieves.
Always taking things that don't belong to you.
All right. Now...
I'm mad.
You want to play, do you?
Yeah. Let's play.
OK, you win. Game over.
There they are!
So much for getting out of here without a fight.
Thanks.
Anytime.
Hit him ! Hit him !
Let's go!
Come on.
You cannot be serious.
I've never been so serious.
Oh, please.
If you'll give me the Dragon's Eye...
I might decide... to let you die quickly.
Go to hell!
Not your usual punctual self.
Where's my Dragon's Eye?
I have it.
Really?
Show it to me.
Let him go first, and it's yours.
Snails, don't!
Make it easy on yourself.
Give me what is mine.
Never!
You're as stubborn as your friend.
Very well.
You've made your choice.
Come on, Ridley!
Transporting!
Come on, Ridley!
Come on!
The Council has voted.
You must oblige us.
You understand the consequences of your decision--
Do not patronize me, Azmath... for I understand all too well.
Yes, I violate the law in defying the Council... but if I were to give you this Scepter... my crime would be graver yet... for I would be defying my conscience... and our people.
Have you all forgotten?
This Council was created to protect the people of lzmer... but ask yourselves...
Is this what you are doing?
I say not.
Your concern is only for yourselves... not the people.
And Your Majesty is forcing the Empire... to the verge of civil war... in the best interests of the people?
The man who convinced you to take the Scepter from me... so that he would leave the state defenseless.
Be careful, my friends... for once he's done with me, this Council may be next.
War benefits no one, Profion... and I oppose it.
But if it is necessary to obtain the freedom of our people... then no cost could be too great to achieve that goal.
Do you hear her words?
She violates our highest law!
And then seeks to force us into submission... with a threat of war.
Each citizen of lzmer, whether a Commoner or a Mage... deserves an equal right for prosperity... and as Empress... this is how I decree lzmer shall be run... from this day forward.
Such pretty words.
My friends, I warned you... that this headstrong child... will defy you and destroy you.
Her youth denies her the wisdom... to understand why some things cannot change... but idealism is for children... and a child is not fit to govern an Empire.
I ask you one last time!
Will you submit to the ruling of this Council... and relinquish your Scepter?
I was praying... that you would find the wisdom... to see that the path
I propose for lzmer... is the right one.
I do not wish to fight you... but I will not leave the Empire... at the mercy of an unscrupulous charlatan!
So decide as you must, but know one thing--
I am not afraid.
A wonderful performance.
My friends, ask yourselves... are we prepared to see our Empire... destroyed by a child?
Then is now not the time we should act?
Then down with the tyrants... and let the war begin!
What is he doing?
Isn't he going to use any spells?
Wait.
How did you do that?
The Elven people do not require spells to work with magic.
You use magic.
We are part of it.
Part of magic?
As are all living creatures, including Dragons.
Sadly, Humans see only their destructive powers.
I had a dream. I saw--
You saw a Dragon being born.
It was amazing.
Life was exploding all around.
So it should.
You see, when Dragons are born, they bring new magic with them.
Magic is the life force of our world.
It keeps nature and everything around us... in balance.
And if many Dragons should die?
Life would wither as it must... and the balance would be destroyed.
The Rod.
You and your countrymen... are very close to irreparably destroying... the fabric of magic with this Rod you seek.
The Rod is man-made... unnatural.
It must not be disturbed.
You must rest.
I'm sorry about Snails.
I'm sure you are.
He died for a good cause.
A good cause?
What cause is that?
The Empress against Profion?
Politics.
I'm through with all that.
I'm not going to die over some power struggle... between a couple of greedy Mages.
No, you're wrong.
No, you're wrong! Mage!
You never had to live on the other side.
You know what?
Snails was right.
There is nothing we can do to change it... and if I had listened to him, he would still be alive.
Just because some Mages are evil does not mean they all are.
I'm not!
Let me let you in on a little secret.
The Empress that Snails died for stands to lose everything... because she is fighting to change things.
As if she has anything to worry about.
You are so naive.
She risks everything... because she does not believe the system is fair.
Profion seeks to dethrone her because she believes... that Mages and Commoners should be treated as equals.
She is fighting to change what you hate so much!
That, Ridley, is what Snails died for.
When Vildan told me what was happening with the Empress...
I wanted to do all I could to help her.
But even then,
I did not understand... why she would want Commoners to be equal with us.
But now... after being with you for only a few days... and seeing how you always manage to find your way...
I understand why the Empress is right.
Please, Ridley.
Help me show them we are not like they are.
You know, for a Mage... you're pretty smart.
It will protect you.
Thank you.
All right. This is it.
This is the entrance to the dungeon.
What happened?
What is it?
It's a wall force of some kind.
I've never seen this kind of magic.
Only you were meant to pass.
I guess I go alone, then.
Be careful.
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
Great.
Now what?
Sorry, Snails.
Finally, a Mage who got what he deserved.
Why do you disturb the Rod of Savrille?
To save the Empire of lzmer.
Who...
What are you?
I am Savrille, creator of the Rod... cursed with the crime of trying to control the Red Dragons... and sentenced to this purgatory... until someone worthy of its power takes it.
You are such a man?
I don't know if anybody's such a man.
But I'm going to find out.
Be warned. Anyone who wields the power of the Rod... shall suffer a horrible fate... for the evil it creates cannot be undone... unless its spell is broken.
How do I break the spell?
That, you must discover.
The Empress has called her Dragons upon us.
Don't just stand there admiring them !
Destroy them before they reach us.
Hurry! Hurry!
Prepare to fire!
Fire!
Come on.
Get up! Prepare to fire again!
Move that crossbow.
Aim for their wings, you fools!
Fire, you fools! Fire!
What have I done?
Come to me.
I found the Rod!
Thanks for saving me the trouble.
Feels good, doesn't it?
Remember... your stupidity and persistence got your Thief friend killed.
Don't let it be responsible... for finishing off the rest of your social circle.
Oh, look.
I've cut her. What a shame.
Don't hurt her.
Then give me the Rod!
And you'll release them?
Don't do it, Ridley.
You have my word.
Finally.
You said you'd let them go!
I lied.
Kill them... slowly.
Give that to me.
You said you'd set me free.
Now what about my head?
Here they come!
Come, Damodar.
To the roof of Sumdall.
Fire!
My destiny.
Come to me.
Look. I've cut you.
What a shame.
You can run, Your Ladyship... but you'll never run far enough!
Let their blood rain from the sky!
You'll pay for that, boy.
You really think that you can steal my destiny?
I'll invent a new destiny especially for you... full of pain.
A new kind of pain and new senses to feel it with.
Not if I kill you first.
This will be a real pleasure.
Not so talented, eh, Mr. Ridley?
I've enjoyed our little chat, but now it's your time to die.
My little tracker.
I could--
Hey, Mage!
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Back for more?
You really think you can use that, you little burglar?
Well, that's impossible.
Bring them down on him, Ridley!
Destroy him !
I won't become you.
What have you done?
Your Majesty.
It's over, Profion.
The battle maybe, Your Majesty.
Maybe... but not the war.
Thank you.
People of lzmer... at long last, I do declare that you are now all equal.
Let the celebration begin.
You hear that, buddy?
That's for you.
Nothing's going to be the same without you.
But I guess I'll have to get used to that.
I just hope wherever you are... you know that you did make a difference.
You helped things change.
You finally got it.
Your big score.
I guess I'd better get going... or I'm going to miss my own knighting ceremony.
Ridley the Savior.
Can you believe it?
I'm going to miss you, pal.
Do not question your gift.
Your friend awaits you.
Inside a snowflake, like the one on your sleeve... there happened a story you must see to believe.
Way up in the mountains, in the high range of Pontoos... lay the small town of Whoville:
The home of the Whos.
Ask any Who, and they'll have this to say:
"There is no place like Whoville around Christmas Day."
Every window was flocked, every lamppost was dressed... and the Whoville band marched in their Christmas-y best.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Arbor Day was fine, and Easter was pleasant... and every Saint Fizzin's day, they ate a Fizz pheasant.
But every Who knew, from their twelve toes to their snout... they loved Christmas the most, without a single Who doubt.
- Farfingle's welcomes you!
- Thank you.
Merry Christmas!
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's!
We got a snoozlephone for your brother Drew... and a snoozlephone for your brother Stu, a muncle for your uncle... a fant for your aunt and a fandpa for your cousin Leon.
So, we just need... Cindy?
Sale on Aisle 3!
- Cindy Lou!
- Merry Christmas.
Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred.
Excuse me.
Cindy Lou? Honey?
- Dad?
- Yeah?
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?
This is what Christmas is all about!
Can't you feel it?
Merry Christmas!
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's.
Wait a second!
Your change!
Another minute closer to Christmas!
And, for the next five minutes only,
99 percent off!
Yes, every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot... but the Grinch, who lived just north of Whoville... did not.
Get on it, girls.
All the good mistletoe's at the top.
- Hey, Drew, I'll race you!
- Not if I race you first.
Last one to the top is a stinky old Grinch!
You guys, where are we?
I think we should go back.
What? You're scared of the Grinch!
No!
They say he lives up here in a big cave.
And only comes down when he's hungry for the taste of...
- Who flesh!
- Drew!
You're scared of the Grinch!
You're scared of the Grinch!
- Are too!
- Am not!
Wait for me!
Go on, touch it. Touch the door.
Do it for me, Stu.
Well done, Max!
Serves them right, those Yuletide-loving... sickly-sweet, nog-sucking cheer mongers!
I really don't like them.
No, I don't.
Max!
Get my cloak!
I've been much too tolerant of these Whovenile delinquents... and their innocent, victimless pranks.
So, they want to get to know me, do they?
They want to spend a little quality time with the Grinch.
I guess I could use a little... social interaction.
Merry Christmas!
Yeah, you bet.
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.
Oh, my.
Someone has vandalized that vehicle.
You see, Max?
The city is a dangerous place.
The Grinch hated Christmas.
The whole Christmas season.
Top of the day. Flatfoot.
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.
Here's a present for you.
Be sure to run real fast with it.
Come on. Double time. Move.
It could be that his head wasn't screwed on just right.
Or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
But I think that the most likely reason of all... may have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
Stranger, won't let you go till you buy a chapeau!
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?
I guess.
You guess?
It's just, I look around at you and Mom and everyone getting all kerbobbled.
Doesn't this seem superfluous?
Dad!
Dad!
- What happened to you?
- It was the Grinch!
- Grinch?
- What do you want? I mean...
"Grinch? Oh, no!"
Did someone just say, "Grinch"?
Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir.
Lou.
I don't need to remind you that this Christmas... marks the one thousandth Whobilation.
Whoville's most important celebration!
And The Book of Who says, very clearly:
"Every size of Who we can measure...
"knows that Whobilation is a time we must treasure."
Now, Lou, please tell me that your boys... were not up on Mount Crumpit... provoking the one creature within a billion bilometers of here... who hates Christmas!
But it was the Grinch!
No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch.
It was, and he came after...
I think they were up on the mountain... playing with matches, or defacing public property, or...
That's a relief.
All right, you heard the man:
There is no Grinch problem here.
- I need it there by tomorrow.
- Heck of a rush.
Merry Christmas, Mo. Heck of a rush.
But, Dad...
I just don't understand something.
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?
You kids and the Grinch!
You see, Cindy, the Grinch is a Who, who always...
Actually, not a Who. He's more of a...
- A what?
- Exactly, honey.
And he's a What who doesn't like Christmas.
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.
Not a single Christmas card, in or out.
Ever!
But why?
Lou, where's my mail?
Lou! Got the wrong mail here.
Lou! I got the wrong mail!
- I'll be right there.
- Lou, we got a problem!
All right, we'll straighten this out.
It'll take them years to sort this out.
This is his and now it's yours, and this hers and now it's his!
And for the rest of you:
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.
Jury duty!
Would you mind helping me take this to the back room, honey?
- Be careful of the sorting machine, right?
- Yeah.
Gesundheit.
You're the...
The...
The Grinch!
That worked out nicely.
Help!
Help me! Somebody!
Max, let's go.
Our work here is finished.
Help me!
Please help!
That is not a chew toy!
Stop it, Max!
Get that out of your mouth!
You have no idea where it's been!
Help!
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!
There! Give me that!
Don't you know you shouldn't take things that don't belong to you?
What's your problem?
Are you a wild animal?
Let's go.
Thanks for saving me.
Saving you?
Is that what you think I was doing?
Wrong-o.
I merely noticed that you were improperly packaged, my dear.
Hold still!
Max, pick out a bow.
Can I use your finger for a second?
Hello! Hello!
- Cindy?
- Dad!
Daddy!
Daddy!
What the hey...?
Honey.
Cindy?
Dad! It was amazing!
You've been practicing your Christmas wrapping!
I am so proud of you.
Now, that's holiday.
Sweet little Cindy didn't know what to do.
In her head, bum-tumbled a conflict or two.
"If the Grinch was so bad, then why did he save me?
"Maybe he wasn't so bad."
Maybe. Just maybe.
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shopping.
Good, I'm so glad you're home.
I can feel it, Lou. This is the year.
When everybody asks who has the most spectacular lights in greater Whoville... they're gonna cry out,
"Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"
Isn't this the chandelier from the dining room?
It's all for the cause, dear.
And Cindy?
Could you be Mommy's little helper... and unscrew the bulb there from the refrigerator?
- 'Cause somehow I missed that one.
- Go on!
Every year Martha May Whovier has the best lights.
Not this year.
This year...
I'm gonna beat that prim, perfect little prissy...
Betty!
- Hi!
- Martha!
My, I've never seen so many beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!
I'd blow every fuse if I tried to keep up with you, Martha May!
Isn't this antique darling?
It's handcrafted and almost 100 years old.
Jeez. I'm really impressed!
This, however, is new.
Betty! Sweetie!
Good night, Betty.
- I got it!
- Honey, I've got it.
Hello?
Is my sub-zero chillibrator running?
- I suppose.
- You better go catch it!
That's a good one! That is rich.
Let's go home.
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.
Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke.
There's got to be a better way!
A car would have paid for itself by now!
Goody. Another load coming down.
What's that stench?
It's fantastic!
Max! Grab a bag.
We'll come back for the rest.
Of course, when I say "we,"
I mean "you."
It's amazing what these Whos just throw away.
Oh, well.
One man's toxic sludge is another man's potpourri.
I don't know. It's some kind of soap.
"Where are you, Christmas?
"Why can't I find you?
"Why have you gone away?
"My world is changing
"I'm rearranging
"Does that mean Christmas
"changes too?
"Where are you, Christmas?
"Do you remember
"The girl you used to know?
"You and I were so carefree
"Now nothing's easy
"Did Christmas change
"Or just
"me?"
Sweet!
"Be it ever so
"Heinous
"There's no place like home"
First floor, factory rejects.
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!
But we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.
At least I scared the bejeebles out of that little girl at the post office.
She'll be scarred for life, if we're lucky.
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.
Must be afraid of reprisals.
Yes!
Down a size and a half!
And this time, I'll keep it off.
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!
There's no stick!
I'm smarter.
Any calls?
You have no messages.
Odd. Better check the outgoing.
If you utter so much as one syllable...
I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish!
If you'd like to fax me, press the star key.
Oh, well.
That's more like it.
Excellent year.
I'll tell you, Max...
I don't know why I ever leave this place.
I've got all the company
I need right here.
Hello!
Hello!
How are you?
How are you?
I asked you first.
I asked you first.
That's really mature, saying exactly what I say!
Mature... exactly... what I say...
I'm an idiot!
You're an idiot!
All right, fine.
I'm not talking to you anymore.
In fact, I'm going to whisper.
So that by the time my voice reverberates off the walls and gets back to me...
I won't be able to hear it!
You're an idiot!
Am I just eating because I'm bored?
Who could that be?
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?
No.
I hear you know some things about the Grinch.
Cindy Lou had some questions in her curious heart.
Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?
With her dad's blabbacorder she wouldn't give an inch.
In your own words, please tell me everything you know about the Grinch.
Where did he come from?
He came the way all Who babies come.
On calm nights... baby Who girls and tiny Who fellas... drift from the sky in their own pumbersellas.
Hey, honey, our baby is here!
He looks just like your boss.
So that's how it works.
It was Christmas Eve, and a strange wind blew that night.
We were having our annual holiday get-together.
It was morning before anybody realized that he was out there!
The poor dear!
But, you know what?
We knew right away that he was special.
Do you want a Christmas cookie?
Yes, which Christmas cookie would you like?
Santa.
His first words!
Yes, that is a Santa plate.
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?
Santa, bye-bye!
He was a wonderful... whatever he was.
And we raised him like any other Who child:
With a deep love of Christmas.
Don't forget, tomorrow is our big Christmas gift exchange.
Everyone bring a special gift for a special someone.
The...
Grinch...
He had no sense of color coordination.
Although I hardly remember him.
I didn't have time to socialize.
I was far too busy with my... studies.
Now, class, is everyone almost finished?
And if the truth be told, he...
He liked Martha.
Martha was my girlfriend.
I don't like discussing this Grinch so very close to Christmas, but... maybe if you hear the truth, you'll understand why...
Put your back into it!
I tried to take him under my wing.
You don't have a chance with her.
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!
He had hair. Not pleasant.
He shed.
Not right.
You know, Christmas is my favorite time of year.
I just love the colors.
The red... and the green.
Did I have a crush on the Grinch?
Of course not.
I didn't ask you that.
Right.
For some reason, when he came home that day... he really got into the Christmas spirit for the first time.
Perfect!
Whoopsie!
What a lovely family heirloom!
The fires of love!
This will be perfect on the top of her tree.
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!
I want you all to look your best tomorrow.
You don't have a chance with her.
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!
Has everyone given their gifts?
- I haven't.
- What?
Merry Christmas, Martha May.
Why do you have a bag on your head?
Probably because he's embarrassed by that hideodorous gift.
Mr. Grinch... please take the bag off.
Yes, you.
Take it off.
Put the book down.
And your foot.
Look at that hack job!
Stupid present!
Stupid tree!
I hate Christmas!
- The anger.
- The fury!
The muscles!
It was a horrible day when they were so cruel to him.
And...
I could hardly bear it.
I hate Christmas! I hate it!
And that was the last time we ever saw him.
The very last time.
So, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes... he stood outside his cave... hating the Whos.
Alphabetically.
Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who...
I... hate you!
Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you.
Hate, hate, hate. Hate, hate, hate.
Double hate.
Loathe entirely!
Nutcrackers?
It's their Whobilation.
He snarled with a sneer.
Tomorrow is Christmas!
It's practically here.
Max!
Fetch me my sedative.
Now to take care of those pesky memories.
"Whobilation, plentiful with candy canes and pies
"I can't wait to get there to eat some google fries
"Whobilation, Whobilation"
- Dad?
- Yeah.
I've been thinking about the Whobilation and I may do something drastic.
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.
- Where did she go?
- Honey!
Honey! Hi!
Look, I just found the cutest light for my Christmas display.
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.
And now, the nominations... for that Who among us who best typifies... the qualities of Whodom and Whodery... the Whoville holiday cheermeister!
Do I hear a nomination?
I nominate the Grinch!
- The Grinch?
- The Grinch?
My, my, my.
What an altruistic daughter you have there, Lou!
Thank you.
Cindy?
Let me quote a verse... from The Book of Who.
Thank you.
"The term 'Grinchy' shall apply when Christmas spirit is in short supply."
Now, I ask you: Does that sound like our holiday cheermeister?
True, Mr. May-Who.
But The Book of Who says this too:
"No matter how different a Who may appear...
"he will always be welcomed with holiday cheer."
Yes, the book also says, the...
"The award...
"cannot go to the Grinch, because...
"sometimes things get the lead-pipe cinch."
You made that up! It doesn't say that.
No, it does.
What page?
Lost my place, but it's...
It's in here!
But the book does say:
"The cheermeister is the one who deserves a back slap or a toast.
"And it goes to the soul at Christmas who needs it most."
And I believe that soul is the Grinch.
And if you're the Whos I hope you are, you will too.
She's right!
Fine.
You people want to waste a perfectly good nomination... why, it's up to you.
But I am telling you... the Grinch will never come down.
And when he doesn't, the Mayor will wear the crown.
Well, more or less.
"Deck your heart with jollity
"Style your smile all Christmas-y
"Flick some flocking on the tree
"Let there be Whobilation
"Bake the fruitcake, egg the nog
"Feed the flaming Who-ltide log
"Baste the beast and gulp the grog
"Let there be Whobilation
"Tick, tock, tick, tock
"Counting down the Christmas clock
"Old, young, big, small"
Blast this Christmas music.
It's joyful and triumphant.
Must drown them out!
Not working!
The whipperwinds whipped high above the Who town.
A trip or a slip you'd slide all the way down.
But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.
She'd invite the Grinch herself, that brave Cindy Lou.
Play, monkey! Play!
Howdy?
Mr. Grinch?
Mr. Grinch!
Hello?
Excuse me.
Hello... little girl.
How dare you enter... the Grinch's lair?
The impudence! The audacity!
The unmitigated gall!
You called down the thunder... now, get ready for the boom!
Gaze into the face of fear!
Mr. Grinch... my name is Cindy Lou Who.
You see?
Even now the terror is welling up inside you.
I'm not scared.
Denial is to be expected in the face of pure evil.
I don't think so.
Doubt?
Another unmistakable sign of the heebie-jeebies!
Now you're doomed!
Run for your life... before I kill again!
I'm a psycho!
Danger! Danger!
Maybe you need a time-out.
Kids today.
So desensitized by movies and television.
What do you want?
Mr. Grinch, I came to invite you... to be holiday cheermeister.
- "Holiday Whobie-what-y"?
- Cheermeister.
"Cheermeister. Celebrate with friends."
That's a good one.
I know you hate Christmas, but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?
- Don't care.
- I myself am having some Yuletide doubts.
But maybe if you reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas...
"Maybe if you reunite with the Whos and be a part of Christmas."
Grow up!
Then maybe it'll be all right for me, too!
I'm sorry, your session is over.
Please make another appointment with the receptionist on the way out.
Please, please.
You have to accept the award.
Award?
You never mentioned an award!
Yeah, with a trophy and everything.
- And I won?
- You won!
- That means there were losers.
- I guess.
- So, if you come...
- A town full of losers!
I like it.
Was anyone emotionally shattered?
Come on, a minute ago
I couldn't shut you up! Details, details!
The Mayor wasn't happy.
Oh, no.
Martha May will be there.
She will?
And she'll see me.
A winner.
She'll be on me like fleegle flies on a flat-faced floogle horse.
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby, but the G train has left the station.
So, will you come?
All right.
I don't know if it's that adorable twinkle in your eye... or that nonconformist streak... that reminds me of a younger, less hairy me.
But you've convinced me.
Who knows? This Whobilation could change my entire outlook on life!
- Really?
- No.
There you are, honey.
You can make snow angels later.
We can't be late for the Whobilation!
The nerve of those Whos.
Inviting me down there on such short notice.
Even if I wanted to go, my schedule wouldn't allow it.
"4:00, wallow in self-pity.
"4:30, stare into the abyss.
"5:00, solve world hunger...
"tell no one.
"5:30, jazzercise.
"6:30, dinner with me."
I can't cancel that again.
"7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing."
I'm booked.
If I bumped the loathing to 9:00,
I'd have time to lay in bed... stare at the ceiling and slip slowly into madness.
But what would I wear?
It's not a dress, it's a kilt!
Sicko!
Stupid.
Ugly.
Out of date.
This is ridiculous.
If I can't find something nice to wear,
I'm not going!
That's it, I'm not going.
It's time for our Holiday Cheermeister of the Year Award!
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!
He isn't here.
What?
He didn't show?
Who could have predicted this?
All right. I'll swing by for a minute, allow them to envy me... grab a handful of popcorn shrimp, and blow out of there.
But what if it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?
How dare they?
All right, I'll go.
But I'll be fashionably late.
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!
Yes!
Definitely not!
All right. I've made my decision!
I'm going, and that's that.
Had my fingers crossed.
Maybe I should flip a coin!
I guess the award goes to... the runner-up.
That's right. A man for whom
Christmas comes not once a year... but every minute of every day.
A handsome, noble man.
A man who has had his tonsils removed twice!
That's an interesting story.
You see, what happened was...
Hello, Martha.
He made it!
- Cindy.
- Honey!
Look...
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.
I believe I'm here to... accept an award of some kind.
And the child mentioned a check.
- No, I didn't.
- All right, then, give me the award.
Come on, while I'm young!
Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister, you'll get your award.
But first, a little family reunion.
They nursed you. They clothed you.
Here they are... your old biddies!
Are you two still living?
We missed you!
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.
Sweater? What are you talkin' about?
No, I can't!
I can't do that!
Don't touch me there!
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!
Chair of Cheer?
What's the Chair of Cheer?
You didn't tell me about the Chair of Cheer.
Please, Mr. Grinch.
No. I can't do it, honestly.
I'm not ready. It's too much, too soon!
It's that time of year.
The Cheermeister's ride in the Chair of Cheer!
Put me down! I mean it!
I've got a lawyer.
There'll be hell to pay!
First, you'll put your taste buds to the test... as you judge the Who pudding cook-off!
- Mine first.
- I really don't know...
No, mine's the best!
You'll enjoy this!
This is not pudding.
What is it?
This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy.
Christmas conga!
Look at the time.
I really should be getting back.
All right!
Fruitcake, tra-la-la!
No.
Fudge Judge.
Made it myself.
Yeah? Mine are homemade too.
Okay.
Put it in. Bring it on!
Is that all you got?
Is that all you got? Come on.
Out of the way, slow-mo!
Excuse me.
He's number one in the sack race run!
Number one! I'm number one!
I'm number one!
No child can beat the Grinch!
I beat you.
He won!
And now it's time for the moment we've all been waiting for.
Yes! My award.
- Write the check.
- There's no check.
Are you sure? Because I thought
I heard someone mention a check.
I said, there's no check.
And now it's time... for Present Pass-it-on!
As always, we start with our Cheermeister.
The gift of a Christmas shave.
Look at that hack job!
Yes, yes, yes. Good times!
Good times.
And now, I have a little something for the love of my life.
Martha May... please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who.
Augustus...
If you agree to be my wife... along with a lifetime supply of happiness, you'll also receive this:
It's a new car!
Generously provided by the taxpayers of Whoville!
What do you say, Martha?
You got 20 seconds on the clock.
I...
These gifts are quite dazzling.
Of course they are.
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
That's what it's always been about!
Gifts!
Gifts.
Gifts, gifts, gifts.
You want to know what happens to your gifts?
They all come to me. In your garbage.
You see what I'm saying?
In your garbage!
I could hang myself with all the bad
Christmas neckties I found at the dump!
And the avarice.
The avarice never ends!
"I want golf clubs." "I want diamonds."
"I want a pony, so I can ride it twice, get bored, and sell it to make glue."
Look, I don't want to make waves, but this whole Christmas season is... stupid, stupid, stupid!
There is, however... one teeny-tiny...
Christmas tradition...
I find... quite meaningful.
Mistletoe.
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!
Somebody's fabulous!
All right, your turn! Go on!
- Let's go!
- No!
Excuse me, old-timer.
Mind if I wet my whistle?
That's my good stuff!
Burn, baby! Burn!
The Whomanity!
- Let's go! Come on!
- No, wait!
- Do something.
- Right!
Calling all units. Calling all units.
Taxi!
It's because I'm green, isn't it?
Halt!
Evening, folks. Mind if I ride along?
You might want to scooch over.
You did the right thing.
Out of the way!
That's gonna hurt in the morning.
It's gonna blow!
You fellas all right?
How about a nice hat?
Lou?
I'm hurt, Lou.
I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily.
But you and your family...
I'm so... disappointed.
Can we just get back to Christmas... the way it should be?
Grinch-less?
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
I just wanted everybody to be together for Christmas.
I quite enjoyed that.
I hope I get another invite soon.
Come on, come on!
Good thing we have a spare.
Suffering snorkelblatz!
They're relentless!
Only four hours till Christmas!
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow all the Who girls and boys... would wake bright and early and rush for their toys.
And then, the noise!
The noise, noise, noise!
They'll bang on tong-tinglers.
They'll blow their floo-flounders.
They'll crash on jang-jinglers and bounce on boing-bounders!
Then Whos young and old would sit down to a feast.
And they'll feast and they'll feast.
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!
They'll eat their Who pudding.
And rare Who roast beast!
But there's something
I just cannot stand in the least.
Oh, no.
I'm speaking in rhyme!
Blast you Whos!
And the more the Grinch thought of what Christmas would bring... the more the Grinch thought:
I must stop this whole thing.
Why, for year after year
I've put up with it now!
I must stop this Christmas from coming!
But how?
I mean, in what way?
"Christmas is goin' to the dogs
"We're scoffing down the turkey and the grog
"Things are looking very good, it's true"
Are you having a holly, jolly...
Christmas?
Wrong-o!
If you're not going to help me... then you might as well...
Then he got an idea.
An awful idea.
The Grinch got a wonderful... awful idea.
I know just what to do.
The Grinch laughed in his throat.
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.
And he chuckled and clucked... at this great Grinchy trick.
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like Saint Nick.
"You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
"You really are a heel
"You're as cuddly as a cactus and as charming as an eel
"Mr. Grinch
"You're a bad banana
"With a greasy black peel
"Just face the music, you're a monster
"Mr. Grinch, yes, you are
"Your heart's an empty hole
"Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul
"Mr. Grinch
"I wouldn't touch you with a
"thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole"
I asked for three-quarters, not five-eighths.
Stay focused!
"You know, if you asked the who's who of Whoville
"No one would deny it"
Air bag is a little slow.
But that's what these tests are for!
"You're a vile one
"Mr. Grinch
"You have termites in your smile
"You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile
"Mr. Grinch
"Given the choice between you
"I'd take the seasick crocodile"
Fat boy should be finishing up anytime now.
Talk about a recluse.
He only comes out once a year, and he never catches any flak for it!
Probably lives up there to avoid the taxes.
Merry Christmas!
Oopsie.
Forgot about the reindeer.
Did that stop the old Grinch?
No.
The Grinch simply said:
If I can't find a reindeer...
I'll make one instead.
Oh, Max!
So he called his dog Max... and he took some red thread... and tied a big horn on top of his head.
All right.
You're a reindeer.
Here's your motivation.
You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose, nobody likes you.
Then one day,
Santa picks you and you save Christmas.
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.
Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.
You hate Christmas!
You're gonna steal it!
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.
Action!
Brilliant!
You reject your own nose... because it represents the glitter of commercialism!
Why didn't I think of that?
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.
That... feels... good.
Here goes nothin', hot dog!
Wow!
This is nuts!
On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!
On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg!
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
I'm going to throw up, and then I'm gonna die!
Mommy, tell it to stop!
Almost lost my cool there.
All their windows were dark.
Quiet snow filled the air.
All the Whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care... when he came to the first little house on the square.
Welcome to Whoville, Max.
Betty?
- Betty?
- What?
Did you hear something?
It's Santa!
Go right back to sleep.
Come on, Max. It's our first stop.
The old Grinchy Claus hissed.
And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.
He'd slide down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
He's planning a double-twisting interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half... with a combo tuck and pike.
High degree of difficulty.
He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.
Blasted water weight!
Goes right to my hips.
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.
A little more stealth, please.
Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.
These stockings... he grinned... are the first thing to go.
Okay, fellas. Show time.
Then he slunk to the icebox.
Slunk?
He eyed the Whos' feast.
He took the Who pudding.
He took the roast beast.
Hike!
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash.
Why, that Grinch, he even took their last can of Who hash.
Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.
And now... grinned the Grinch...
I'll stuff up the tree.
And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove... when he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove.
Excuse me.
The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter... who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water.
Santa Claus?
What are you doing with our tree?
But, you know, that old Grinch was so smart and so slick... he thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick.
Why... my sweet little tot.
The fake Santa Claus lied.
There's a light on this tree... that won't... light on one side.
So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my dear.
I'll fix it up there... and I'll bring it back here.
Santa, what's Christmas really about?
Vengeance!
I mean... presents...
I suppose.
I was afraid of that.
And his fib fooled the child.
Then he patted her head, and he got her a drink... and he sent her to bed.
Santa?
- What?
- Don't forget the Grinch.
I know he's mean and hairy and smelly.
His hands might be cold and clammy.
But I think he's actually kind of sweet.
Sweet?
You think he's sweet?
Merry Christmas, Santa.
And when Cindy Lou went up with her cup...
Nice kid.
Bad judge of character.
...he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up.
And the last thing he took was the log for their fire.
On their walls he left nothing but some hooks and some wire.
And the one speck of food that he'd left in the house... was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse.
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most unpleasant... around each Who home, and he took every present.
Clearance sale.
Everything must go.
What now?
Martha... have you ever kissed a man who lost his tonsils twice?
No, silly!
But it's an experience that I've always longed for.
Kiss me, you fool!
What are you laughing at...
Rudolph?
It's all you, Maxie!
3,000 feet up, up the side of Mount Crumpit... he rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it.
We did it!
We did it! We did it!
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?
They'll be waking up now.
And I know just what they'll do.
All those Whos... down in Whoville... will all cry.
What an embarrassment! I've been robbed!
Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear.
I wonder who could have done this.
Tell you people one thing:
Invite the Grinch... destroy Christmas.
Invite the Grinch... destroy Christmas!
But did anyone listen to me?
- I did.
- No.
You choose to listen... to a little not-to-be-taken seriously girl... who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.
Cindy, I hope you're very proud... of what you've done.
If she isn't, I am.
I'm glad he took our presents.
- What?
- I...
- I'm glad.
- He's glad.
You're glad.
You're glad everything is gone.
You're glad that the Grinch virtually wrecked...
No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas.
Is that what I'm hearing?
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor... because it isn't about the gifts or the contests or the fancy lights.
That's what Cindy's been trying to tell everyone.
And me. She's been trying to tell me.
What is wrong with you? This is a child.
She's my child.
And she happens to be right, by the way.
I don't need anything more for Christmas than this right here, my family.
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas, you hunk of burnin' Who!
Give me a break.
Merry Christmas!
Mr. Grinch?
Mr. Grinch?
Now for the final note in my symphony... of downright nasty not-niceness!
The crescendo of my odious opus!
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.
The bellowing of the bitterly bummed out!
It'll be like music to my ears!
Then the Grinch heard a sound rising over the snow.
It started in low.
Then it started to grow.
But the sound wasn't sad.
Why, this sounded merry.
But it was merry.
Very.
Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small... were singing without any presents at all.
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming.
It came.
Somehow or other, it came just the same!
Mr. Grinch?
And the Grinch, with his Grinch feet ice-cold in the snow... stood puzzling and puzzling.
How could it be so?
It came without ribbons!
It came without tags!
It came without packages, boxes or bags!
And he puzzled and puzzled... till his puzzler was sore.
Then the Grinch thought of something... he hadn't before.
Maybe...
Christmas... he thought... doesn't come from a store.
Maybe Christmas... perhaps... means a little bit more.
Help me!
I'm... feeling!
And what happened then... well, in Whoville they say... that the Grinch's small heart... grew three sizes that day.
What's happening to me?
I'm all... toasty inside.
And I'm leaking.
Oh, Max.
I love you!
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off. Beat it!
Get out of here!
One step at a time.
No. The sleigh. The presents.
They'll be destroyed!
And I care!
What is the deal?
Wait!
This can't happen!
It shouldn't! It couldn't!
It mustn't! It wouldn't!
Not now, not then, not ever again!
No!
Oh, well.
It's just toys, right?
Hi, Mr. Grinch!
Cindy Lou!
What are you doing up there?
I came to see you.
No one should be alone on Christmas.
No!
I got you, Cindy Lou!
You did it!
Spread eagle! Nailed it!
Are you all right?
Are you kiddin'?
The sun is bright and the powder's bitchin'!
Now scoot over! It's my turn to drive!
I'd better slow this buggy down!
- We're gonna crash!
- Now you listen to me, young lady!
Even if we're horribly mangled... there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.
What is it?
Help!
- Cindy!
- Grinch?
My baby!
Grab an end.
By the way, these lights match your outfit perfectly.
This could be more difficult to negotiate.
Heads up, Whoville!
Hurry! Here he comes!
Out of the way! I have no insurance!
Yeah!
Run for your lives!
Watch out, I can't stop!
- Daddy, move!
- Dad, move it!
Thanks for the help.
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Cindy, honey!
Merry Christmas... one and all!
Cindy!
Mommy!
All right.
What do we have here?
You got me, Officer!
I did it!
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.
And I'm... sorry.
Aren't you gonna cuff me?
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.
- I'd go with the pepper spray.
- Yes, I heard him, all right.
He said he was sorry.
Besides, it looks like everything is all here and accounted for.
Help me out here, people.
Martha?
Merry Christmas, August May-Who!
I'm afraid I do have something for you!
Your ring back.
Sorry... but my heart belongs to... someone else.
No hard feelings?
Cheer up, dude. It's Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.
Your cheek is so...
I know.
Hairy?
- No.
- Greasy?
Stinky? Do I have a zit?
No.
Warm.
Fah who foraze, dah who doraze
Welcome, Christmas, come this way
Fah who foraze, dah who doraze
Welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day
Welcome, welcome, fah who Ramus
Welcome, welcome, dah who Damus
Christmas Day is in our grasp
So long as we have hands to clasp
Fah who ray-moo ya-who hee haw
Welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer
Fah who foraze
Dah who doraze, welcome all Whos
Far
And
Near
So he brought back the toys and the food for the feast.
And he, he himself, the Grinch... carved the roast beast.
Yeah!
There's nothin' like the holidays.
- Who wants the gizzard?
- I do!
Too late!
That'll be mine.
Where are you, Christmas?
I think I've found you
This time I'll make you stay
All will be singing
Bells will be ringing
Now and forever
Christmas Day
Where are you, Christmas
Why can't I find you
Why have you gone away
Where is the laughter
You used to bring me
Why can't I hear music play
My world is changing
I'm rearranging
Does that mean Christmas
Changes too
Where are you, Christmas
Do you remember
The one you used to know
I'm not the same one
See what the time's done
Is that why you have
Let me go
Christmas is here
Everywhere
Christmas is here
If you care
If there is love
In your heart and your mind
You will feel like Christmas all the time
I feel you, Christmas
I know I've found you
You never fade away
The joy of Christmas
Stays here in silence
Fills each and every heart
With love
They're makin' noise
Noise, noise, noise
How I hate their happy noise
There's only one thing I hate more
Come to think of it
And that's the people who keep
Makin' it
Feast, feast, feast, feast
They'll have more than anyone could ever eat
Me, I'm stuck here with my
Cream of wheat
There's no one here to feast with me
On this lonely Christmas Eve
Don't they know I'm up here all alone
In my cave up in the hills
How I wish that this would go away
This dreadful holiday
That they call Christmas Day
It's a lonely Christmas Eve
The streets are filled with Christmas cheer
At least it's only once a year
Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows
And carols ringing in my ear
Bundled up against the cold
Lines wherever gifts are sold
Each shop window displays a Christmas scene
For everybody young and old
Icicles on eaves troughs and tinsel on the tree
But it's a green Christmas for me
Couples skating on the pond
Makin' angels on the lawn
Five red mittens drying on the rack
And needle-shedding Tannenbaum
Red bows on the railings and snowflakes on the ground
But it's a green Christmas in this town
Green
'Cause of everything I miss
All this mistletoe, no kiss
And with every Christmas wish
There would be no greater gift
Than to have this envy lift
Carolers are at my door
Don't wanna hear them anymore
Stockings on the mantel
The snow's here every day
But it's a green Christmas anyway
Red nose on the reindeer
Tinsel on the tree
But it's a green Christmas for me
Mamma mia, I can't see anything!
Where do I go now?
Madam is right. I should buy myself some glasses...
...but I look so awful in them, and they make me look old!
I'll have to ask Madam for a little light.
How beautiful you are!
Do butterflies make you happy,
Medoro?
Giving happiness...
...is the most beautiful thing you can do in this world.
Isn't that true?
If something comes into the world...
...and doesn't make our lives more pleasant...
...it might as well not have been born at all!
How long do butterflies live,
Medoro?
They say that a butterfly knows no suffering.
It lives one day in happiness and then dies forever.
The only thing I don't like about death is that you die for too long.
It would be better the other way around.
What would that be?
If you died for just one day and then lived forever in happiness.
Have you ever died, Medoro?
Oh, I still have to finish being born.
And anyway, time doesn't exist,
Madam Fairy.
You're right, Medoro, time doesn't exist.
But let's go now.
It's getting late.
Yes. Well, I don't remember the way very well.
You don't remember or you can't see?
This is the last time
I'll ask you, Madam Fairy...
...could we have a thread more light?
Just a little?
All right, Medoro.
Thank you, Madam Fairy.
Let's go, little mice!
-Who is that?
-Get it! Catch it!
Here it comes again, over there!
We've got to catch it!
Here it is!
-Who is that?
-My persimmons!
Here it comes! I see it!
That's what it was!
It's coming this way! Catch it!
We've got to catch it!
You rascal! You scoundrel!
Yes, you really are a nice-looking frame!
And now, you know what
I'm going to do?
I'm going to make you a nice rose right here.
You don't like the rose?
Oh, I knew it.
Then we'll make a daisy!
For heaven's sake, what's that?
Such bad manners!
Whoever you are, you're really very rude.
What is this?
Who does this belong to?
Just look. What a lovely piece of wood.
Lovely, really lovely!
I'll make a nice puppet...
...one that can dance and do flips...
...well-mannered and obedient, though.
Yes, let's start working right away.
I'll make the most beautiful puppet in the world.
Come over here. You'll be the staff of my old age.
Just look at what a lovely puppet it's turning out to be.
It's as if it were making itself.
Am I hurting you?
No, it's not a very hard job.
You see how lovely you're turning out to be?
Two nice big eyes...
...some pretty black hair...
...and a cute little mouth with a little tongue inside.
WOOD:. Will you let me try on your yellow wig, Father, will you?
I've told you a thousand times to be quiet!
I should have made your tongue last!
And anyway, who told you this is a wig?
-Can you really tell?
WOOD:. You sure can.
It's a big old yellow wig that could make you die laughing.
It looks like you have cornmeal pudding on your head!
Be quiet, you impertinent boy!
Can you believe it? I haven't even finished making you...
...and already you're being disrespectful to your father!
You're starting off badly, my boy!
And just be quiet for a minute!
WOOD:. All right, I'll be quiet.
I'll be quiet.
I won't talk anymore because my fath-- What's the matter?
Oh, blessed saint Anthony!
He talks!
Yes, he talks!
I really do think
I heard him talk!
But let's try something.
-How are you?
-Fine, Geppetto. And you?
Very well, very well, thank you.
Thank goodness he doesn't talk.
Just what I was saying. How could it be possible that a puppet--?
WOOD:.
Hey, Father, close that door.
I'm all naked and there's a draft in here, mamma mia!
A puppet that knows how to talk.
WOOD:. Stop that, Father, you're tickling me. No, no, stop that!
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I present to you....
That's right.
What name shall I give you?
Well, you came from pine wood.
I'll call you Pinocchio!
PlNOCCHlO:. Nice name, it appeals!
-What a lovely puppet you are!
Your little shoes and little pants are splendid.
Now, the finishing touch.
A hat made of bread crumbs, painted by me!
-Wait!
-I like this one better!
-Wait!
-I like this one better!
Father! There are so many things in here!
What's this? What's this called?
Stop! Pinocchio, be careful!
Come here!
Where are you going, Pinocchio?
Come here! My hair!
No one knows I wear a wig!
Be careful! You're going to hurt yourself!
Here's father's chair, father's little table...
...father's whatchamacallit!
What do you see out of that window?
Can I take a look, yes or no?
Oh, good God!
Where are you going? Get down!
Careful, Father! Jump!
Bye, Father! See you later!
I should have thought of this before.
Where are you going?
It's so beautiful out there, Father!
Come and see! Bye!
Don't go outside!
It's dangerous! Torna indietro!
-What's that?
-Out of the way, puppet!
-A puppet?
-What the heck is that?
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio!
Pinocchio! Pinocchio!
Who is it?
-Get out of the way!
-Get out of the way!
MAN: You're going to pay me for that wine now!
Got you!
Got you! Finally!
Who does this puppet belong to?
Let's figure out how much there'll be to pay in damages!
Who does this puppet belong to?
It's mine! That wig is mine, thank you! It's mine.
If you only knew what I've been through! There was a goose--!
Quiet, puppet!
Pinocchio, my son?!
A fine father you are! This puppet is a real pain in the neck!
What do you mean?
I struggled so hard to make him into a respectable puppet!
Respectable? He's turned the whole city upside down! It's your fault!
He escaped from the house before I even knew it.
That's bad!
You have to be more careful!
Only an idiot lets a puppet escape from right under his nose!
Now this one's coming to jail with us. Let's go!
-Who's he?
-My son, where are you going?
No, you don't!
Are you trying to escape, too?
You come with us!
You've got some damages to pay...
...or else there's no avoiding a night in jail for you. Let's go!
GEPPETTO:
Wretched boy!
A little bird! Hey, I see you!
Come here! Come here!
There are so many of them!
Here's a nest! A nest!
It's empty!
A squirrel!
It's so wonderful to be in the world! This is really the life!
Aah....
I'm going to warm myself up a little. It's freezing.
What a great day I've had!
And now I'm so hungry,
I could eat the whole house up!
There must be some place where my father--
VOlCE: Pinocchio.
-What's that?
It is l, Pinocchio, the Talking Cricket!
No! A talking cricket?
Cricket, you don't by any chance know...
...where my father keeps the cakes, do you?
Woe to those children who rebel against their parents...
...and run away from home.
They will never come to any good in this world!
-You're not talking to me, are you?
-Yes, I am.
-Woe to you!
-Cricket, I'm getting out of here!
Because if I stay, I'll have to do what every other child does.
I mean, I'll have to go to school and to study...
...and I don't have the slightest desire to study! I just don't like it!
Poor little fool!
You should know that if you do that...
...you'll become a fine jackass...
...and everyone will laugh at you.
Hey, Cricket, why don't you shut up for a minute?
You've got an annoying voice...
...and I really can't stand to listen to it! It's really annoying!
Well, if you don't want to go to school, at least go to work.
To work? Me?
That's right! There must be some job that you like.
Yes, there is one that I like.
There's one that I like a lot.
That's a good boy, Pinocchio.
You see?
-And what is this job?
-Eating, drinking...
...sleeping, having fun...
...doing whatever I like from morning till night!
You're really a puppet, and you'll always be a puppet!
And you're a bad-luck cricket, and you'll always be a bad-luck cricket!
For your information, dear
Pinocchio, those like you...
...always end up either in jail or at the hospital.
You're really a nasty bad-luck cricket! You really are!
Those like me end up in jail or in the hospital, do they?
And those like you...
...you know where they end up, Cricket?
Where, Pinocchio?
In the cemetery!
Got you! Got you!
Hey, Pinocchio, what are you doing with that hammer? Stop that!
Got you! Got you! Got you!
Where are you?
I was joking. I didn't really want to hurt you.
-Where are you, little Cricket?
-All right, I'll trust you.
-Can I really trust you?
-I can't hear anything.
There's an echo over there where you're talking.
-Couldn't you come a little closer?
-Where?
Well, for example, here!
Right here where I'm pointing.
-That way we can talk.
-I'm coming, Pinocchio.
I'm coming, for I have a great truth to tell you.
-Those like you--
-Got you!
You fell for it! I'll teach you, with your annoying voice--
I can't stand you!
Cricket, where are you?
I don't feel like playing anymore!
I'm starving, I'm tired,
I'm dying for some sleep...
...I'm freezing, I'm starving.
Cricket, I'm starving!
What a horrible town!
What a horrible town!
What a horrible town!
Oh, God!
What is it? Father!
Dear Father!
My dear little Pinocchio, you were burning to pieces!
If you only knew what I've been through! I won't forget until I die.
What happened, Pinocchio?
It was raining. It was snowing.
And you weren't there. I was so hungry! Then the Cricket said:
"You deserve it. It serves you right. You've been a bad boy!"
And you know what I did?
I hit him with a hammer!
I did the right thing.
I said, "I'll teach you."
At a certain point, I was tired,
I was hungry, I was sleepy.
And you weren't there, do you understand?
Then I sat near the fire to get warm, and the fire burned me.
Now I'm just as hungry as ever...
...and I don't have my little suit of clothes anymore.
Would you make me a brand-new suit, Father?
Why should I make you another one?
So that you can run away again and get me sent back to jail?
I promise you that from now on I'll be good.
I'll go to school, and I'll distinguish myself!
Is that a promise?
The promise of all promises.
No joke.
-I promise you with all my heart!
-Good boy, my son.
Here, take this! Look what
I have for you! It's a pear!
It was going to be for my breakfast tomorrow morning.
-Eat it up, and may it do you good.
-What a nice pear!
-Could you peel it for me?
-Peel it?
Yes, because I really can't stand fruit peels.
-They really don't appeal!
-They don't appeal?
Father, Father!
Where have you been?
To buy you a brand-new spelling book, so you can study! Here it is!
Nice!
-But where's your jacket?
-I sold it!
-Why did you sell it?
-I was too hot in it.
I'll never forget this!
Now, you go to school and make sure you distinguish yourself!
I promise you I will!
-Pinocchio, wait!
-What?
Your little hat made of bread crumbs.
-How does it look on me?
-lt looks wonderful!
Bye, I'm off to school!
-Bye! I'll be waiting for you!
-Bye, Father!
Today I want to learn to read...
...tomorrow I'll learn to write...
...the day after tomorrow to do arithmetic. Then I'll be all set.
What's this music?
Excuse me, is that the school?
The school's in the opposite direction.
And what's this building?
It's written right there, can't you see?
I'd be happy to read it.
I don't know how to read today!
A fine ox you are! It says,
"Grand Puppet Theatre."
-Bye, I'm going to school now.
-Excuse me.
I'm not interested myself...
...but if someone wanted to go, how much would it cost to get in?
You'd need four pennies!
Would you buy my shoes for four pennies?
No!
-How about my hat, for four pennies?
-I said no! Bye!
And this spelling book, that my father sold his jacket for...
...in this freezing cold, would you buy it for four pennies?
You're going to make me late for school! That's enough!
I'll buy the spelling book from you for four pennies.
Oh, thank you!
Pulcinella!
Who's that calling me?
Were you the one who took the salami?
No, no, no, no,
I didn't take any salami, Sir!
No, I saw you, you're the one who took it!
Liar, that's not true. It wasn't me who took the salami!
-Liar!
-Thief!
In the name of the law, who's the thief here?
-It's him!
-It's him!
Silence! Celestial deities!
Do I dream or wake?
And yet, that looks like a puppet down there!
It's him in person!
The puppet responsible for all that commotion yesterday!
Wait, what's his name?
It's him in person!
It's Pinocchio!
Master, let's give Pinocchio a grand welcome!
Come on, Pinocchio, come up here...
...and let your puppet brothers give you a big hug!
All right, I'm coming!
Here I am...
...my dearest friends!
What's all this commotion?
And you, who are you?
You, who are you?
Why have you come and created this confusion in my theater?
Please believe me, most illustrious Sir, it wasn't my fault.
-I was--
-Enough!
We'll settle our score at dinner!
My apologies to the audience.
The show will be repeated tomorrow!
Curtain!
Harlequin, Pulcinella, the water's boiling.
Go get that puppet hanging on the nail!
Today I'll eat him!
Obey me! I'm hungry!
What do you mean?
Have pity, most illustrious of all illustrious sirs, Fire-Eater!
The idea of being eaten doesn't appeal to me!
Father, I wanted to go to school, I did--
Poor Father. If I die, you'll die, too, dear Father!
Ah-Choo!
That's a good sign, Pinocchio!
Fire-Eater sneezed...
...and when he sneezes it means his heart was touched.
-And so?
-So that's good.
When he is moved, his stomach closes up, and no one gets eaten.
You're safe!
Come on! Come on!
Think of a way to move him.
Make him sneeze again.
What were you saying about that poor father of yours?
Are your parents alive?
My father is, but I don't know about my mother.
What sort of work does your father do? How much does he make?
It's enough to make me cry.
My father doesn't do anything.
Most illustrious Fire-Eater of all Fire-Eaters!
My poor little father is the poor man of all poor men.
Yesterday he came close to eating a wig...
...because it looked like cornmeal pudding.
What a miserable family!
-Do you have any brothers?
-No.
-Yes, one.
-And how's he doing?
He's doing well. I mean, he's not well, not well at all!
He's ill! Very ill!
He's dead! He's dead!
Now I remember.
He died, then he died again.
He died twice.
I have a brother who's always dying.
Poor Father, he gave him a funeral, but my father's so poor...
...that there was nothing there.
No people, not even the corpse.
And a rich family that lives next to us gave a funeral...
...with seven, eight corpses, because they're rich.
And my father, not even one corpse!
Ah-Choo!
Ah-Choo!
Ah-Choo!
Pinocchio, you're one terrific boy!
Come here and give me a kiss.
Pinocchio, I really feel sorry for that poor father of yours.
Here are five gold coins.
Take them to your father and give him my best regards.
Oh, five gold coins.
Thank you, most illustrious Sir!
So you're not going to eat me?
No, I won't be eating today.
Now be quiet, or I'll make a stew out of all of you!
Good day, Pinocchio!
Good day, but how do you know my name?
We saw your father on his doorstep.
He was in his undershirt, trembling like a leaf with cold.
Poor old man!
I'll go see him right now.
From today on, he'll never tremble with cold again.
Why is that?
Why? Because I've become a grand gentleman!
A grand gentleman!
There's very little to laugh about.
If you understand anything at all...
...these are five beautiful gold coins.
Five gold coins!
-Five gold coins?
-Five gold coins?!
I'll knock him out, and we'll take off with the loot!
I'll throw a stone at him, a stone, a stone!
Hold it! Not here!
Wait! Hold it!
Mister Pinocchio!
Accept our apologies, we haven't even introduced ourselves.
I am the Fox, and this is the Cat.
Pleased to meet you, yes.
We're well-known around here for being two respectable people.
-People!
-I can see that, yes.
And you, you who are such a good puppet...
...what do you intend to do with those five gold coins?
Do you intend to keep them all for yourself?
No. I want to buy a brand-new jacket for my father...
...and a spelling book for myself.
-For myself?
-For myself!
I want to go to school and study, and earn an honest living...
...studying and working.
Goodbye!
-Studying and working!
-Studying and working!
You're really a puppet!
And to think that your five gold coins could have become a thousand!
Two thousand!
Ten thousand!
Ten thousand? But how?
We'll tell you right now!
Instead of going home, you'll have to come with us.
-With us!
-With you? Where to?
To a place where gold coins multiply.
Multiply!
-What's the name of this place?
-The Land of the Featherbrains.
Come on!
In the Land of the Featherbrains...
....there is a blessed field, called the Field of Miracles.
PlNOCCHlO: What a wonderful place! What a wonderful place!
You make a hole and put your coins in. After half an hour...
...a tree full of money comes up, and all of a sudden you get rich.
But don't let anyone know!
It's a secret, keep it to yourself.
-To yourself!
-I'll keep it to myself!
-To myself!
-To yourself?
-To yourself!
-To myself?
-To myself?
-To yourself?
-To yourself!
-That's enough!
FOX:
I wasn't talking to you!
Please do serve us.
The meat was very tasty.
My compliments!
Tasty. My compliments.
Thank you, friends!
Pinocchio, you haven't touched a thing yet! Eat your walnut!
Well, I'm not hungry.
I'm just not hungry!
Why don't we leave now?
Let's go!
No, no, no, it's still early.
We have to get a little rest!
-lnnkeeper!
-Tasty!
Show Mister Pinocchio to his room...
...and remember to wake us all up at midnight!
It's been a lovely little evening.
Get some rest now!
Rest now!
-Off to bed, then?
-Yes!
Well, then, good night!
-Good night!
-Night!
You know what?
I've changed my mind!
-No!
-No!
As soon as I pick the gold pieces, instead of keeping them for myself...
...I'll keep two thousand, which is enough for me.
And the rest I'll give to the two of you as a present!
-Good heavens, no, Pinocchio!
-No!
You're insulting us!
You've got to give the money to your father, who needs it.
The rest you can use to buy a nice spelling book. Good night!
-Book! Good night!
-Good night!
-What good people!
-lf only there were more of them!
A walnut.
Well, it's midnight.
Where are my friends?
Aren't they ready?
They left two hours ago!
-Why?
-They told me:
"Tell Pinocchio that we'll be waiting for him under the Great Oak...
...at the break of day."
Did they pay for the dinner?
You've got to be kidding! They didn't want to slight you like that!
Too bad! It would have been a great pleasure to receive such a slight!
-Here, take this.
-Thank you!
Who is that over there?
Who is it?
VOlCE: Pinocchio.
-Who is it?
It is l, the spirit of the Talking Cricket!
Cricket! You really scared me.
Weren't you supposed to be dead?
What do you want?
Don't trust those who promise to make you rich overnight.
They're either madmen or swindlers.
-Go back!
-But I want to go on!
-The hour is late.
-I want to go on!
-The night is dark!
-I want to go on!
-The road is dangerous.
-I want to go on!
Children who want to do things their own way always end up regretting it.
-The same old story. Good night.
-Good night, Pinocchio.
And may the heavens protect you from dampness and assassins.
So now I'm supposed to be in for all sorts of misfortunes?
I'm even supposed to meet up with assassins!
It's a good thing I don't believe in assassins, and I never did.
You can just imagine how scared I am of assassins!
-Your money or your life!
-The assassins!
-We've got to catch him!
-Help!
Out with your money or you'll be in big trouble!
Out with your money or you're dead, you understand?
Go get some of those dry sticks over there.
-We'll roast him!
-Let's burn him!
-Put them here, not there!
-There?
-Here!
-There, you mean!
Light the fire!
Look how it's burning!
Out with the money, puppet!
Where is he?
-Did you see him?
-I saw him!
-See you later!
-He's running away!
Get back here!
We've got to catch him!
-You're on fire!
-I am! And so are you!
Let's jump in, me over here and you over there!
-Me over there?
-Me over there and you over here!
They're going to catch me!
Help me! I'm going to die!
What's that?
If I could only get to that little house, maybe I'd be safe!
I didn't get that, over here or over there?
-Come on, jump in!
-Over here?
Hey, is anyone home?
Is anyone home?
Open up, open up right now!
Be quick about it!
Wake up! Wake up!
Thank heavens, someone is there after all! Open up!
There is no one in this house!
Well, then, you open up for me!
I am not here, either!
Then what are you doing up there at the window?
No, don't go away, lovely lady with the blue hair...
-The assassins are trying to get me!
-Now we're going to have some fun!
Please have pity...
...on a poor puppet who's being chased by assassins!
You won't get away from us now!
Out with your money or you'll be in big trouble!
Lovely lady! Help!
The coins!
-I've got them in my mouth!
-Open your mouth!
-Never!
-You're stubborn.
Farewell, puppet!
When we come back tomorrow, let's hope you'll be so polite...
...as to let us find you with your mouth wide open...
-...and, above all, dead!
-Dead.
Oh, Father!
My Father!
If only you were here!
What a shame, he was a fine puppet!
Yes, he was a fine puppet!
-Good night, Madam Fairy.
-Good night, Medoro!
Madam Fairy, there's an old man over here!
Yes, sir?
Medoro, that's you.
It's a mirror!
Well! Mirrors aren't what they used to be!
Is he dead or alive?
I think he's dead.
It is my belief that the puppet is already dead.
But if by some stroke of bad luck he were not dead...
...then it would be a sure indication that he is still alive.
I am sorry to have to contradict my illustrious colleague...
...but in my opinion the puppet is alive.
I know what sort of illness that lousy puppet is suffering from!
He'll never become a respectable boy! He'll always be a puppet!
He's a consummate scoundrel!
He's going to break the heart of his poor father...
...who's made so many sacrifices for him.
-And he doesn't even love him!
-That's not true!
Oh, Father, it's not true!
It's not true!
I love my father.
Gentlemen, if a living person is not dead...
...it's a clear sign that doctors are no longer needed.
Thank you for your enlightenment.
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Fairy.
This is the first case I've ever seen of a dead person who cries.
I've never come across this before.
We'll need to reconsider everything.
He's alive, he's dead, everything needs to be reconsidered.
He's burning.
Drink this, and in a few days you'll be all better!
-ls it sweet or bitter?
-It's bitter, but it's good for you.
If it's bitter, I don't want it!
Listen to me. Drink it!
I don't like bitter things!
They don't appeal at all!
Drink it, and when you're done,
I'll give you a lump of sugar...
...to take the bad taste away.
Well, first I want the lump of sugar.
Then I'll drink that horrible, bitter medicine!
Here you are!
Delicious!
I just-- I don't want to drink this horrible, bitter water!
No, no, and no again!
-You'll be sorry, my boy.
-I don't care.
-You've got a serious illness!
-I don't care.
-lf you don't drink it you'll die.
-I don't care!
-Aren't you afraid of death?
-Not at all afraid!
I'd rather die than drink that horrible, awful medicine!
I want to die!
What's that?
We have come to take you away, Pinocchio.
To take me away?
What? But I'm not dead!
But you will be if you don't drink that medicine right away!
But I wanted to drink it! She didn't want to give it to me!
Dear Fairy, give me the medicine right away!
Very well. This time we made the trip for nothing.
Never mind, we'll be back some other time!
This bed is great for bouncing!
I see the medicine has done you some good.
Yes. Next time
I'll take it right away!
I have something very important to do now.
Let me get my little hat.
Thank you for dehanging me, dear Fairy. Bye!
Wait, Pinocchio.
Come over here and tell me.
-What did they want to hang you for?
-For the gold coins.
And what happened to the gold coins?
I lost them.
-And where did you lose them?
-ln the forest nearby.
If you lost them in the forest nearby, let's go look for them!
Now that I remember better, much better, dear Fairy...
...I didn't lose the coins! No!
Good boy, Pinocchio!
I swallowed them, while I was drinking your bitter medicine!
-But why are you laughing?
-Because of the lie you told!
How do you know that I told a lie?
Because lies, dear Pinocchio, are of two types:
Those that have short legs...
...and those that have a long nose!
And mine, what type are they?
But, dear Fairy!
Dear Fairy, do you see what a nose I have?
It's become so long, so very long!
Everyone will laugh at me!
They will!
How am I supposed to go out?
Look what a nose I've got!
It doesn't appeal!
I don't want it, I don't want it!
The coins, dear Fairy...
...I didn't swallow the coins.
They're right here!
Good boy, Pinocchio.
You mustn't ever tell lies.
It's a nasty thing.
Yes, but, dear Fairy....
-I do love you so!
-I love you, too, very much.
I want to buy a jacket for my father, since he sold his for me.
Have him come here!
I can surprise him! Bye, Fairy!
Bye! Come back soon!
I'll be waiting for you.
How did he manage to do that?
-Maybe someone cut the rope.
-Cut the rope.
-Yes. Incredible!
-Friends!
-It's Pinocchio! It's him!
-Wait, I'll handle this!
Dearest friends, oh, friends!
You're just the ones
I was looking for!
Pinocchio, we've been waiting for you for so long!
-You know what happened to me?
-What?
Last night I met up with the assassins.
-No! Those villains!
-Those villains of all villains!
-And did they get your coins?
-Oh, no!
No, you're right. In fact, here they are. I've got all four of them!
Are we still in time for the Field of Miracles?
What Field of Miracles?
-But--
-Of course, the Field of Miracles.
Let's go right away.
Which way is it?
It's over there!
-Over here?
-Over there!
Over there!
-We're finally here!
-We are?
-This is the Field of Miracles!
-It's lovely!
-But what about the trees?
-They've harvested everything.
We're late, hurry up!
Make a hole, come on!
But where?
-Right there!
-Over there!
-Over there!
-Over here!
Over here, all right.
Over here, then.
When I get rich...
...not only do I want to buy a jacket for my father...
...but for the Fairy, too!
I'll buy the Fairy ten jackets...
...since she's the most beautiful and the kindest fairy I've met!
Enough, that's enough!
Put the coins in and cover up the hole!
All right, here they are!
Do we need to water them?
-When will they start growing?
-ln half an hour.
Take a little stroll.
You see that town over there?
It's the town of Saptrap.
Take a walk, come back in half an hour, and you'll find--
Clink, clink, clink, clink!
-And all for you!
-For you.
Lucky, lucky you, Pinocchio!
Bye!
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye!
Excuse me, Mister Farmer, has half an hour gone by?
Far too many half hours have gone by!
Mamma mia, I hope I'm not late!
What do you have to laugh about,
Cricket? Hurry up!
-ls it me you're laughing at?
-Yes, I'm laughing at you.
Money doesn't grow in fields, like beans and pumpkins.
You have to earn it honestly!
The same old lecture!
What do you mean?
You should know that while you were away...
...the Fox and the Cat took the gold coins...
...and ran off with them.
The Fox and the Cat, they took--?
Two good people like them!
I can't believe it!
I can't believe it!
That's why I can't find them!
Thieves!
Thieves! I'm going to report them right now!
There must be a judge in Saptrap!
I'll get the meanest one there is.
I'll give him first and last names.
They're going to hear from me now!
Poor Pinocchio!
One was named Cat and the other one Fox. A pair of thieves!
And I have a witness, the Talking Cricket...
...who saw them right when they took my gold coins and ran off!
A pair of thieves! The tree didn't even have the chance to grow!
Is that all?
Yes! No! I also have a feeling they stole another one of them from me...
...at the Red Crawfish lnn...
...because I ate a walnut, and they made me pay a gold coin for it.
Expensive, that walnut of mine!
In compliance with Article One of the Code of Saptrap--
Trap this sap and take him to prison!
Five years!
I'm the one that they were stolen from!
Come sap!
In you go, sap!
Well, there you have it.
I deserve it!
It serves me right!
The little Cricket told me so...
...but I'm a headstrong and peevish puppet.
From now on, though,
I resolve to change my life.
I want to become a good boy, well-behaved, obedient, honest...
...and I want to go to school and work!
-A fine sucker you are!
-Who's that?
They've tamed you, haven't they, puppet?
What's your name?
-My name is Pinocchio.
-How long are you in for?
Five years. How long does it take for five years to go by?
-lt takes years.
-How many?
Five!
Dear Fairy!
-How long are you in for?
-I get out today. I was just leaving.
This place is all yours. I'll even leave you my spelling book.
Are you a disobedient boy?
Yes, I am.
No one's going to tame me, dear Pinocchio.
I want to show you something.
The other day, instead of going to school...
...I ran away from home.
-You know what I did?
-No.
I went into a candy shop...
...and I stole all the lollipops they had!
-No!
-Yes!
And did you lick all of them?
I was just about to give the first one a lick...
...when I heard the voice of a policeman:
"Stop, don't move your tongue, thief...
...and hand over the 28 lollipops you stole!"
They confiscated them...
...and told me that they had to give them back to the owner of the shop.
But I think...
...they licked them all themselves!
There is one other thing, though, the lollipops--
There weren't 28 of them.
There were 29!
Let me see.
-You know what flavor this is?
-No!
It's out of this world.
Smell it!
-No!
-Yes! Tangerine!
Listen...
...would you let me take a lick?
Just one?
You lick there, and I'll lick here. Go ahead!
Delicious!
Listen.
When you get back home...
...are your parents...
...delicious, going to send you to school?
Remember one thing, puppet:
There's only one person who decides what I have to do.
And that's Lucignolo!
-And who is this Lucignolo?
-I am! Me!
-You?
-Yes!
Come on, Lucignolo!
Out you go! You've learned your lesson, haven't you?
Now get yourself to school!
Bye, Pinocchio!
See you in five years!
Bye, Lucignolo!
Here, this is for you.
-What is it?
-Your supper. Pear peels.
A, B, C, D, H....
At least I know the first ones.
Now, horse and...
...elee...elee...
...phan....
What's going on?
Oh, Father, dear Fairy....
-Come on, come on out!
-What's going on?
Everyone's free! Free!
-So have five years gone by?
-No, four months.
A son's been born to the King of
Saptrap. In sign of jubilation...
...there will be great festivities.
All the criminals are being freed!
Hey, but I'm a criminal, too!
-What did you say?
-I'm a criminal, too.
Oh, well, in that case, this way, please!
Long live the King!
Long live the King of Saptrap!
What I've been through! Who knows if my father has waited for me?
Will I find him at the Fairy's house?
I haven't seen him for so long.
I'm just dying to give him...
...a thousand hugs and finish him off with kisses!
Will the Fairy forgive me for the terrible thing I did to her?
Oh, let's hope so!
Let's hope so! Let's hope so.
"Here lies the Fairy...."
"Here lies the Fairy with the blue hair...
...who died of grief because of Pinocchio"!
Pinocchio! But that's me!
Oh, dear Fairy, dear Fairy!
Why did you die?
Oh, why didn't I die...
...since I'm so bad and you were so very, very good, dear Fairy?
Dear Fairy, what do you have to do to die?
If you truly love me...
...if you love your Pinocchio...
...come back to life, like you were before...
...when I could look at you because you were alive!
Dear Fairy, live again!
Live again, dear Fairy!
Live again!
Live again!
Live again!
DOVE: Tell me, boy, what are you doing down there?
Don't you see? I'm crying!
Is there a puppet named Pinocchio among your friends?
Did you say Pinocchio?
-That's me!
-Then you must know Geppetto.
Of course! He's my poor father!
Did he talk to you about me?
For goodness' sake, answer me, where is he?
He's been roaming the world for four months in search of you!
Is he far away?
Take me to him, please!
Follow me.
Thank you, my dear Dove.
I'll get to see my father again!
I'll see my father again!
Here I come, Father!
What happened?
What happened is that because of his son, who he can't find...
...a poor father got into a little boat...
...and went to look for him on the other side of the sea!
But that, but that looks like...
...that seems to be--
That is my father!
Father, Father, Father, Father!
It's me, it's your son!
Father!
-Dear Father!
-Pinocchio!
He saw me! Here I am, Father!
Father!
I'll never leave you again!
Come back, dear Father!
Father!
Father!
Father! Father!
I want to save my father!
Oh, Father! Father!
And now what?
That was a narrow escape, mamma mia!
What kind of place is this?
Are there are any towns in this place with the sea all around it?
I want to go see, just for the heck of it.
Dear Fairy, now that I've lost you and my father...
...where will I sleep at night?
It would be better, a hundred times better, if I died, too.
Yes, I want to die!
And I'm starving.
Excuse me, kind lady.
Would you give me something to eat if I carry your jug for you?
What are you doing here, puppet?
If you only knew what
I've been through!
I'm fed up with living the life of a puppet.
I want to become like everyone else!
And you will be, if you prove that you deserve to.
Really? How?
Respectable boys are obedient, but you, on the other hand--
I never obey.
Respectable boys always tell the truth.
And I always tell lies.
Respectable boys are happy to go to school.
And me, school gives me a bellyache.
School is really, it's really....
Excuse me, kind lady, but you....
How can you know that l--?
But.... But it's you!
Oh, dear Fairy, dear Fairy!
If you only knew my sorrow and the lump I felt in my throat...
...when I read "Here lies...."
I know, and that's why
I've forgiven you.
The sincerity of your sorrow made me realize that you have a kind heart...
...and perhaps there's some hope...
...that you'll get back on the right path.
Oh, yes, yes, dear Fairy.
-I want to get back on it!
-Then you'll have to obey me.
Oh, yes! I'll study, I'll work,
I'll do everything you tell me to!
And I'm telling you that tomorrow morning you have to go to school...
...and you'll go because you promised me to.
Yes, I'll go.
Oh, dear Fairy.
The house in the forest....
Hey, boys, isn't this cute?
It's mine!
That hat's mine!
It's mine. I found it on the beach and I get to keep it!
No, I'm the one who lost it.
It's mine!
-Then come and get it!
-My father made it for me.
Give me back my hat or things are going to end badly!
We're really scared!
Look how he's dressed!
Go to school, puppet, or you'll be late!
You're telling me to go to school?
Only one person decides what I have to do.
And that's Pinocchio!
-And who is this Pinocchio?
-I am!
Pinocchio!
His name is Pinocchio!
Yes, and I want my hat back!
Pinocchio...cuckoo!
Cuckoo to me?
I'll beat you all up!
A fight! My favorite!
This is the life!
My hat! That hat's mine!
It's mine, it's mine!
Take this, puppet!
Mamma mia, help me.
I don't feel very good.
-I'm dying.
-Dying?
-What happened to you, Eugenio?
-ls he dead?
Eugenio's dead! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Eugenio! It wasn't me!
Breathe! Open your eyes,
Eugenio!
Oh, get up, Eugenio! Get up!
What did you do to that boy?
Me and my classmates were just playing here...
...and at a certain point he didn't feel very good.
This boy has been hit in the head!
-Who hit him?
-Well, not me!
And what was he hit with?
-With that book over there.
-And whose book is it?
-Mine.
-That's enough! Not another word!
- I knew it!
-This boy could die.
Eugenio.
You, take this poor boy to the hospital!
And you, puppet, you're coming with us to jail!
Put him in chains!
Oh, Policemen...
...could you please cover me with your capes? I'm so ashamed!
You should have thought of that before!
Nice Policemen, couldn't we take another road to go to jail?
This is the road! Keep walking!
Stop! Stop him!
This way! This way! Faster!
What a strange-looking marten!
Hey, what are you doing on my property?
You wanted to steal my grapes, did you?
No, I'm a respectable boy!
I was going to school!
You go to school with handcuffs on? Nice school!
You escaped from jail, and you're dangerous!
I'm leaving that trap on your foot!
In fact, I really want to teach you a nice lesson!
Since...
...my watchdog has died, my poor Melampo...
...you'll take his place!
But I've never been a watchdog!
It's easy! If any thieves show up, you bark!
-But how?
-Like this. Woof, woof!
-Let's go, my pretties!
-Woof, woof!
Loud, louder!
Again!
I'm so scared! Woof!
It's so dark!
But it serves me right.
I'm afraid it serves me right.
If only I could be born again!
But it's too late now.
I'll just have to be patient!
Woof, woof, woof, woof!
Thieves! Woof!
Shh!
Melampo, it's me!
Are you an idiot?
Act like a good dog!
I beg your pardon, but I'm not a dog! I'm a puppet.
A puppet? I don't trust you.
If you're really a puppet, answer this question:
What's the best lollipop flavor of all?
I know! It's tangerine!
-Why?
-Because-- Why?
Because it's out of this world!
Lucignolo! Noble soul!
I'm so glad to see you!
What are you doing here?
If you only knew what I've been through!
What are you doing here?
They've got the nicest chickens in the area.
We can trade eight of them for two rocking horses.
Help me!
All right, no, well, but you know it's not nice to steal.
Set me free, and then tomorrow morning...
...we can go to school together.
How about it?
That's a stupid way to talk,
Pinocchio.
They've tamed you, haven't they?
I'll set you free...
...but I'm still going to take the four chickens!
I caught you in the act! Now we've got some scores to settle! Thieves!
-Run! Run!
-Thank you, noble soul!
Pinocchio?
Pinocchio?
Yes?
Come in, come on in!
But it's late. I'd better--
I wouldn't want to bother you.
You're not bothering me.
Come in!
I'm not bothering you?
Well, all right.
So, tell me, how did school go today?
Well, fine.
We learned rivers...
...and then numbers, letters.
Almost all of them:
A, B, C, H, L....
I can't remember anymore.
And then the teacher examined me...
...and he gave me a 10 out of 10.
What did he give you?
He gave me a 10....
It's not true!
It's not true! It's not true!
I wanted to go to school, but after what I've been through...
...and coming back home,
I said to myself:
"How will I be able to present myself to my dear Fairy now?
What will she say when she sees me? Will she forgive me?
She'd have to be too good to forgive me.
Who knows if she's so good that she'll forgive me?"
And then I said, "No!"
Then I said, "Maybe she will...
...because she's good and beautiful."
Then I said,
"lf she forgives me...
...that means she's the best fairy in the whole world!
If she doesn't forgive me, she's not!"
But in my opinion, she is!
So she really should forgive me!
We'll see when I get home, who knows?
Because in my life, dear Fairy...
...I've never had a quarter of an hour of peace.
Not even a quarter of an hour!
Do you see what happens when you don't keep your promises?
Yes! And I deserve a punishment.
I'm afraid I deserve one!
No one will ever punish you again.
In fact, now that you've truly understood...
...I want to give you the most wonderful gift there is.
Yes, your wish will come true.
You'll become a boy like all the others!
Would you like that?
Oh, dear Fairy, more than anything else!
-Will you become a good boy?
-I've already become a good boy.
I've learned my lesson.
This time I've learned my lesson!
I believe you, Pinocchio.
I can tell that you mean it!
Today is a day of celebration for you, Pinocchio...
...and the Fairy wanted to invite in her beautiful house of her...
...all of your future classmates and your teacher, myself.
Pleased to meet you, pleased to meet you all!
By hereby cutting the cake...
...I confirm Pinocchio's entrance into the world of good boys.
You can even choose who you want to sit next to at school.
All right. At school
I'd like to sit next to--
-One, and two--
-Wait a minute!
-What's the matter?
-Lucignolo's not here!
-Lucignolo?
-Yes!
Everyone else is here. Lucignolo is at the bottom of the class...
...and I've already decided to fail him.
He's a good-for-nothing.
It's better that he's not here.
EVERYONE:
Yes, yes, yes!
-So, one--
-No!
He's my best friend, and I love him.
He'd like to be here...
...and I'll find him.
Pinocchio, start being obedient!
You're making a mistake, because Lucignolo--
Good boy!
That does you honor.
It's only right that on the most important day of your life...
...you want your best friend next to you.
That's a beautiful thing.
Good boy!
Go and come right back.
We'll be waiting for you!
Bye! I'll be right back.
Wait for me. Bye!
Lucignolo!
Lucignolo!
What are you doing over there?
I've been looking for you for three hours.
Have you heard the great news?
Do you know about the good luck
I've had?
I'm not going to be a puppet anymore!
I'll become a boy like you, like all the others!
-Much good may it do you!
-What do you mean?
There's a party at my house.
You're the only one who's not there!
Let's go!
I can't. I'm leaving tonight...
...and I'm going far, far away.
Where are you going?
I'll live in a town that's the most wonderful town in the world!
And what's it called?
It's called Playland.
What a nice name! Playland?
Why don't you come, too?
Let's go!
No, I'm staying here with my Fairy.
Poor sucker, you're making a big mistake!
I'm not making any mistake at all.
What kind of town is it?
I'll tell you just two things.
No one ever asks you to work in that town...
...there are no teachers, no books...
...and you don't have to go to school on Sunday.
What a lovely town!
But you don't have to go to school on Sundays here, either!
Yes, but in that town every week is made up of seven Sundays!
And just imagine, vacation starts on the first day of January...
...and ends on the last day of December...
-...that falls on a Sunday!
-Exactly!
And how do you spend your days in Playland?
Playing and doing whatever you feel like from morning till night.
What do you think?
Are you coming? Yes or no?
No! I promised the Fairy
I'd be right back!
Have a good trip, Lucignolo!
Bye, puppet!
Just imagine, a place where there are no schools.
One last, one last thing.
Well, do you know for sure, really for sure...
...that vacation starts on the first day of January...
...and ends on the very last day of December?
Do you know that for sure?
For extra-sure!
He'll be back!
I'm going, I'm leaving,
Lucignolo.
Bye, farewell, this time for real.
All right. Bye, Pinocchio.
-Here it is!
-What?
The wagon that's come to get me!
It's wonderful, wonderful!
So, Lucignolo, I'll stay for another two minutes.
Then I'm leaving.
Good evening, my little dear.
Unfortunately, the wagon is full!
If it's full inside,
I'll sit out here!
And you, my love, what do you intend to do?
Are you coming with us or staying?
What did I tell you?
It's paradise!
-Bye, Pinocchio!
-Bye, Lucignolo!
Pinocchio! Pinocchio!
Mamma mia, it's an inferno!
I've got to find him right away, or it'll be too late.
Pinocchio, Pinocchio!
Dearest friends, here I am!
I'm up here! Friends!
Help! Help! Help!
Where are you, Pinocchio?
I've got to look for him.
Stop it!
A little peace and quiet.
Get out of here!
You'll all become jackasses.
Pinocchio! Where are you?
Saint Anthony!
Sacred deities!
I'll never find him!
And you, get out of this place!
How can I make you understand?
Leave! You'll all become asses!
Help! I can't breathe!
I'm suffocating!
I can't stand it!
Get me out of here!
Help! Help! Help!
Saint Anthony!
I can't take it anymore!
Oh, mamma!
It's an inferno!
Lucignolo! Everyone is asleep already?
Where shall we go?
What shall we do?
-It's time to go to sleep now!
-No, not to sleep!
Come on, I feel like doing all sort of things!
I know, but just two or three hours...
...then tomorrow morning we can start all over again!
I can't wait to start all over again!
-You like it here.
-Yes.
And to think that you didn't want to come along.
It's true, Lucignolo.
If I'm a truly happy boy today, it's all thanks to you!
You don't need to thank me.
I did it with all my heart!
Noble soul!
Lucignolo, the teacher wanted to fail you.
At my house, he said,
"I'm going to fail that one."
I know, but I forgive him.
Noble soul!
Good night, my friend!
Good night, my friend!
Thank goodness it's all over!
They're turning into jackasses.
You'll have to pay good money for them...
...because they're all tender young things, nice and fresh!
-That one's all set to go!
-I'll buy it!
-How many do you want this year?
-About 50. I want hard workers.
And make sure they can take a beating!
They can, they can!
That's a nice one!
It certainly is.
How many do you want?
I want about 50, too.
When can we take them?
In a matter of minutes.
-Would there happen to be one?
-Of course there is!
We've got them in all shapes and sizes.
All the boys turn into jackasses here.
First the ears, then the tail, then "hee-haw," just like that!
I'll take a hundred of them!
Look at this one, just look at this pretty little muzzle!
What did you think you'd become?
Doctors?
Professors?
You're all jackasses!
All jackasses!
It's already morning!
I can't wait to start all over again!
It's great being here!
Let's go, Lucignolo, let's go!
But these are....
They are....
These are two genuine ass's ears.
And they're all hairy!
Just look!
I don't want them!
I don't want them!
What shall I do now?
I'm ashamed to go out like this!
This must be one of Lucignolo's tricks!
It's all his fault, yes!
I'm going to see him right now.
I'll give him a piece of my mind!
Lucignolo, it's me, Pinocchio!
Come in, come on in!
Good morning, Lucignolo.
How are you?
Fine!
So, Lucignolo, how come you're wearing that cloth on your head?
The doctor ordered me to...
...because my knee hurts!
Poor Lucignolo!
How about you?
Me? Well, I hurt my elbow...
...and so the same doctor told me....
-Poor Pinocchio!
-Yes, I know. It's unfortunate.
Lucignolo, would you do me a favor, please?
-Gladly! With all my heart.
-Would you show me your ears?
Gladly! But first I want to see yours, dear Pinocchio!
No, then let's do this.
I'll count to--
-Do you know how to count?
-Of course!
Then you count to three...
...and on three all three of us will take them off.
All right!
One, and three!
What ears you've got, Lucignolo!
Just look at the ears you've got!
There's....
You've got something....
Lucignolo!
What's this here?
Oh, mamma mia!
It's a tail!
You've sprouted a tail!
-Do I have one, too?
-No, not yet.
What does that mean?
That I'll get one, too?
I don't know...
-...but I'm scared.
-It's disgusting!
What's happening to me?
What's happening to me?
Pinocchio, help me!
Help me, Pinocchio!
Lucignolo, Lucignolo!
Pinocchio! Pinocchio!
-You're here?
-Lucignolo.
Lucignolo, you've turned into a donkey!
Help me, I've got a tail!
Dear Fairy, help!
I've got a tail.
CRlCKET:
You deserve it, Pinocchio!
Dear Cricket, thank goodness you are here, Cricket.
If I had listened to my good Fairy...
...I would have become a respectable boy by now.
But from now on, I promise you--
What is there to promise at this point? It's too late!
You missed your chance to become a boy like all the others!
-What's going to happen to me?
-You'll become a donkey...
...Iike your friend here...
...good for pulling a cart!
No.
There's no use crying now.
-Farewell, Pinocchio!
-Lucignolo!
No, don't leave, dear Cricket!
I promise you I'll work, I'll study.
I'll do everything.
Don't leave!
Lucignolo, was that me?
Was that "mee-haw"?
Now, my respectable auditors, ladies and gentlemen...
...the humble undersigned has the pleasure of presenting...
...to this substantial public the most celebrated donkey in the world.
Pinocchio, the Little Donkey!
I beg you to observe...
...the wild game transuding from this mammal.
Admire him!
And then judge him!
That's a good fellow, Pinocchio, play dead! And that's not all!
I've also given this animal of a beast a training in dance...
...not to mention the other relative forms...
...of jumping through flaming hoops...
...and over velvet-covered poles!
Oh, my dear Fairy!
You don't bray in the face of the audience, jackass!
I beg your pardon.
I promise that tomorrow I'll learn some grammar and etiquette...
...to this hairy hoofed mammal!
Come on, Pinocchio, chin up!
Let this crowded crowd see...
...how I've learned you to jump with the whip! Chin up, Pinocchio!
Go, Pinocchio, go!
Great fall, Pinocchio, a great fall!
What are you doing, jackass?
On your feet! What's the matter?
Music, maestro.
Hurry up, bring in the clowns!
Pinocchio, the Little Donkey!
He broke his leg. Throw him into the sea! Drown him!
Pinocchio, the Little Donkey!
A round of applause!
Dear Fairy, dear Fairy!
You're the one who saved me!
I knew it! I knew it!
If you only knew what
I've been through!
But I promise you, dear Fairy, that from now on...
...I'll be a good boy, and an honest one!
Quick, Pinocchio, hurry up, swim faster!
I'll go to work, I promise.
I can't swim any faster than this!
Come on, hurry up! Faster!
Come on, faster!
Then you love me, too, dear Fairy?
When I'm with you, nothing can happen to me!
Pinocchio! Watch out!
What?
What? What's this? Dear Fairy!
Oh, dear Fairy, help!
I've been eaten!
A monster fish!
Let's hope he won't be able to digest me.
It's not fair. Right when I was about to embrace my dear Fairy again!
Who's there?
I'm so scared. It's probably full of monster fish in here.
What kind of place is this?
-Who's there?
-Who can that be?
MAN: Who is that?
-I'm so scared!
MAN: Is someone there?
-I'm a tuna fish!
And you, what kind of fish are you?
I'm not a fish.
I'm a poor old man.
My name is Geppetto.
Geppetto! My father!
I'm here because of my son...
...who I never want to see again because he's a bad boy.
And if I had him right here...
...I'd beat the living daylights out of him...
...with my own hands! Bad boy!
Oh, yes? Was this son of yours really so bad?
I put so much loving care into making him into a good boy!
I went to jail for him, you know, Mister Tuna.
-He's a bad boy.
-It's not true.
An ingrate, a liar, and he has no heart.
No heart at all.
While I'm in here suffering...
...he's probably running around somewhere...
-Father, I want my Father!
-...having a good time!
Do you understand Mister Tuna...
...what a bad boy I have?
But Mister Tuna...
...you're crying!
We tuna fish cry very easily!
But in any case, it's all over for me now, Mister Tuna.
I'll never see my son again.
But if you saw him now, what would you do?
What do you think I would do?
I'm a father, he's my son...
...and, in spite of everything,
I love him. If I had him here now...
...I'd hug him as hard as I could...
...I'd kiss him, and I'd die of happiness.
But never mind!
Father!
-Pinocchio, my son!
-I'm not a tuna fish!
It's me, Pinocchio the puppet...
...your one and only son!
Pinocchio, Pinocchio my son!
-I don't know how to swim!
-I'll help you, Father.
-Save yourself.
-I'm not going without you...
...without my father.
Oh, look, Father!
-Look!
-I'm not coming, I'm afraid!
He's getting ready for the sneeze that'll send us all the way home.
Father, let's go.
I'm not coming! I'm afraid!
Give me back my wig!
-Come and get it!
-You're the same old Pinocchio!
-Father, where are you?
-My wig!
-I've got your wig!
-Give me back my wig!
Lean on me, and I'll take you home.
I need a glass of milk so badly that I'll die if I don't get one.
There's a farmer nearby.
His name is Giangio, and he has a nice cow.
Go see if he'll let you sweat a little...
...in exchange for some milk for me.
Giangio? All right.
I'll put you to bed. Then I'll go to this farmer to get some work.
But you don't know how to do anything!
Good boy, Pinocchio.
I worked an extra two hours today...
...and so Mister Giangio gave me a penny, too.
And with that penny,
I bought myself this lollipop!
A lollipop?
Yes, but it's for supper!
For supper.
And besides, it's not all for tonight.
Half tonight and half for supper tomorrow night!
Good boy!
Tonight I'll give it three licks on this side...
...and tomorrow night three licks on that side.
-May l?
-Yes!
One...
...and two...
...and three.
Three...delicious!
Look what I've got here, the nicest carrots and eggplants in the market!
Good boy, Pinocchio!
Just two more hours--
No, Mister Farmer Giangio,
I want to keep going until tonight.
I want to earn an extra glass of milk.
My father is expecting just one.
If I bring him two,
I'll give him a big surprise!
Good boy, you're a real worker.
Even my donkey can't push like that!
What?
You mean you have a donkey?
Yes, but he's sick.
I worked him too hard...
...and now he's at the end of his life.
Just taste these carrots, sweet as cake! Bye, Pinocchio!
Let's go, Cenerina, let's go!
Come on!
You'd drink another one, wouldn't you?
Of course I'd drink another one...
...but I'm afraid I'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Father?
Pinocchio!
What a pretty donkey!
How're you doing?
Well, my pretty one?
You're not feeling well, little donkey?
Come on, cheer up!
I'm sorry you're not feeling well, little donkey. You're very pretty.
But, little donkey, but....
You know....
Actually....
I think...
...I've seen you before!
Pinocchio!
Noble soul!
Noble soul!
It's you!
It's you!
Cheer up, Lucignolo, cheer up!
Come on, Lucignolo!
Look who's here, Lucignolo!
I'm so glad to see you again!
Lucignolo, you're not well.
Come on, look, Lucignolo!
Look what I've got!
It's tangerine.
It's tangerine, Lucignolo, come on!
Out of this world!
Come on, have some more.
It's tangerine, Lucignolo!
Tangerine! Come on!
Is he dead?
You're so moved by an ass?
Well, I'll tell you, he was a friend of mine.
-He was a classmate of mine!
-Nice school!
-You had a jackass for a classmate!
-Yes.
I can just imagine the wonderful studies you've done.
Get back to work, go on!
All right!
Good boy, good boy, I'm starting to feel a lot better now, you know?
How about you? Why don't you sleep for a couple of hours?
You look tired, son!
Who, me, Father? No, no, no.
I'm a strong puppet.
You built me well, Father!
I'll get some sleep later. Now I need to make some wicker baskets...
...so I can sell them and get some money...
...and buy you a brand-new jacket!
How about it, Father?
Thank you.
Good boy.
Yes, I really do need a nice new little jacket!
If you can find it, get one with black stripes.
Yes, I like black stripes.
-What are you doing, Pinocchio?
-What?
Are you falling asleep? Don't you have to make the wicker baskets?
What? Yes, I'm going right now!
I'll do it outside so I won't bother you.
All right, Father? I'm going....
The milk, you drank it all up, didn't you?
-All of it!
-Good job, great! Bye.
Bye!
Good boy!
Good boy!
Oh, dear Fairy!
Dear Fairy!
Good boy, Pinocchio!
Thanks to your good heart, you deserve much praise and much joy.
You did it!
Dear Fairy, you've taught me so many things!
I'll never forget them!
Never!
Stay on this same path, and in the future you'll be happy.
Bye, Pinocchio!
Bye, dear Fairy!
Bye!
Goodbye, Mister Pinocchio!
Bye, Medoro, goodbye!
Bye, you rascal of a boy!
Dear Cricket, you're here too?
You're leaving?
Yes, but if you like,
I can stay!
No, no, no!
I mean, I was just asking.
I imagine you must have so many things to do. Bye.
-Bye, Pinocchio, bye!
-Let's go, little mice!
Here we go again, Medoro!
This is the last time
I'm doing this for you.
Tomorrow you're coming with me to buy some glasses!
He was a fine puppet, though!
Father!
Father!
You see this?
-Take a look!
-What is it?
Touch it, pull it.
Go ahead and pull! Pull!
It's real!
Father!
Tell me, what happened?
-How are all these changes possible?
-It's all thanks to you!
Thanks to me? Why?
Because when children go from being bad to good...
...they have the power to instill a new, cheerful, and serene air...
...in everything around them!
And the puppet?
What happened to it?
There it is, over there!
You see it?
How funny I was when I was a puppet...
...and how happy I am now that
I've become a respectable boy!
-Pinocchio?
-Yes?
Come here!
Here you go!
-What is it?
-Your books.
Go to school and distinguish yourself.
Thank you. Bye, Father!
Bye, Pinocchio!
Bye, Pinocchio!
-Good morning!
-This way, please!

Here we are, folks,
on the red carpet at the grand opening...
... of the Coolsonian Criminology Museum.
Tonight's premiere exhibit
is a rousing look back...
... at the exploits of Mystery Incorporated.
And here they are.
Folks, this crowd is going crazy over Mystery Inc.
Here you go, girls.
I got an ascot for each of you.
Hello!
Check it out! It's a Shag and Scoob quake and the whole city's shaking!
Yeah!
Come on, Scoob.
Sorry.
I consider it a privilege, sir.
- Daphne!
- Don't you two look beautiful. Thank you.
Daphne! Daphne! Daphne!
Hi! We love you! We have you tattooed on our chests! Look!
That's very sweet.
Velma! Velma!
- Sign it, please.
- We love you, Velma.
Thanks.
- I love her so much.
- May I have a word...
...with Coolsville's hottest detectives?
- Absolutely.
That's your word.
Come on, dear. We're late.
Heather Jasper-Howe at the grand opening...
...of the new Coolsonian
Criminology Museum...
...with our guests of honor, the master detectives of Mystery Incorporated.
Shaggy!
Right on!
Hello! Hello!
With all your success, will you still have time for us in little old Coolsville?
Of course little old Coolsville can solve its problems without us...
...but we'll always be here to help.
The people of Coolsville are the best in the world!
- Can you tell us a little about the exhibit?
- Absolutely.
Mystery Inc. Is proud to donate the costumes of criminals we've unmasked.
- Like The Black Knight Ghost.
- Our very first case.
The 10,000 Volt Ghost.
The Skeleton Men, and even the dreaded Pterodactyl Ghost.
We've also donated the costumes of some of our more ridiculous foes.
Like Chickenstein.
Can we get a shot of you next to The Black Night?
Ridiculous? Obviously she forgot that dude tried to pluck us.
- Remember what I told you?
- Never pick your nose in public?
No, but that's good too.
- Image is everything.
- Yes! Lmage is everything.
The whole city's watching, so try and keep a brave face.
- They're costumes.
- Right.
She's right, Scoob.
Up close, they look totally fake.
The Tar Monster scared the locals of Byzantius away to take their treasure.
But on the positive side, he'd pave your driveway for free.
Isn't that right, Velma?
Velma?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Daphne, this is Patrick Wisely.
He's the curator here at the museum.
It's very nice to meet you, Patrick.
I hope you'll be working closely with
Velma on this ever-expanding exhibit.
I know that you're a glamorous, mysterious, jet-set adventurer...
...preoccupied with international intrigue and all...
- Yes. That's me.
- I know, but...
There's a symposium coming up on syntactic reasoning in the criminal brain...
I have always found a criminal's inclination...
...to incorrectly use the interrogative pronoun in place of the relative...
...delightfully absurd.
- Me too!
- Really?
So maybe you'd want to go together?
Suppose you mean like...
Like a...
Like a date. With me.
No, I can't, Patrick.
Mystery is my mistress.
I must heed her sweet call.
Okay.
What's happening?
Oh, boy.
Daphne!
Go, Ned! Get it! Get it!
- We need to come up with a plan.
- Hiding is our plan.
In case you haven't noticed, there's an unidentified freaky object in here!
- The curtains!
- We're on them!
- Come on, you chickens! Grab those ropes!
- But chickens aren't good with ropes!
- We got him!
- Shaggy, use the ropes to tie him up!
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!
It's just a costume!
We tied it! Let go!
Sorry!
- We have to save Shaggy and Scooby!
- As usual!
Fire!
Mystery Incorporated.
This is only the first rung on the ladder of your demise.
Look out!
And this time, you'll be the ones unmasked...
...as the buffoons you truly are!
Any clues to the cause of the attack? How did the dinosaur get through security?
Where did Mystery Inc.'s plan go wrong?
A secret hatch!
The real Pterodactyl Ghost must have come through here!
A reptilian scale.
A most wonderful clue.
He stole two costumes: The Black Knight
Ghost and The 10,000 Volt Ghost. Why?
Fred, Daphne. Could you answer a few questions for the press?
Fred, I don't think that's a really good idea.
We always face the press after we've unmasked the creeps.
We looked ridiculous back there.
Don't worry about it, sweetheart.
The press loves us.
The higher the pedestal,
the harder the fall.
And Mystery Inc. Fell far
in the embarrassing debacle...
... that tarnished the reputation
of the once-great gang.
It was an utter disaster
as two of the gang's key members...
... Norville "Shaggy" Rogers
and Scoobert "Scooby-Doo"...
... caused untold damage to Coolsville's
hottest new tourist attraction...
... which took a full two years to complete.
When asked for comment, Fred Jones,
leader of Mystery Inc., said this:
Coolsville can solve its
problems without us.
I didn't say that! I mean...
I did, but that's out of context!
This is Heather Jasper-Howe,
disillusioned from Coolsville.
It's all my fault.
I'm the one who told Shaggy and Scooby to get the ropes.
No, Velma, it's my fault.
I should have checked that they were tied before I let go.
It's my fault too.
We all know how Shaggy and Scooby can be.
But it's all right.
We just need to stay strong, in control, and work fast.
Come on, gang. Let's get to the lab.
We'll figure a way out of this Jurassic jumble.
Shaggy?
- We're screwups.
- Yeah.
I guess, looking back, every time they made a plan, we did screw it up somehow.
- I just never noticed before.
- Me neither.
There's gotta be some way we can prove that we actually belong in the gang.
We've gotta do something totally unlike us.
You know, Scoob...
...we could act like real detectives!
Really?
Scooby-Doo, raise your right paw.
No, your right paw. Your other paw.
Repeat after me. From this day forward we will no longer be our goofy selves.
We will be awesome detectives.
And we will act more like Fred and Velma and Daphne.
We will be terrific and fantastic and spectacular...
...and cease to be "loser-iffic,"
"lame-tastic" and "suck-tacular. "
Suck-tacular.
Right, like, it's time to solve the mystery.
Let's kick this investigation up to an 11!
What the heck are you guys doing?
We figured the first step in solving a mystery...
...would be to wear the right attire.
I'm sorry, Daph, but your go-go boots didn't fit...
...me!
Scooby! Those so don't go with that sweater!
Really?
Clues!
Alas, what are these strange markings?
Words.
Words!
Scooby-Doo, take notes.
- Gotcha.
- Come on, you kooks.
Okay.
It's come back positive.
This is a real pterodactyl scale.
Precisely!
That masked figure was out to humiliate us.
Maybe it's someone we unmasked.
But who would be able to make a real Pterodactyl Ghost?
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.
Dr. Jonathan Jacobo.
That's right!
Jacobo wreaked havoc
in a statewide crime spree.
Jacobo stole millions...
... which he used to finance his failed
experiments trying to create monsters.
Come alive! Come alive!
You think Jacobo 's behind this?
Impossible. Three years ago
he attempted a prison escape.
So long, suckers!
Help me, suckers!
His body was lost at sea.
How about this? Jacobo's cellmate was released from prison two months ago.
Jeremiah Wickles.
The Black Knight Ghost. That was one of the costumes that was stolen.
Right! And...
Scooby-Doo! What's your conclusion?
Bunny.
It seems Old Man Wickles
deserves a visit...
... before any of our other creepy
conquests make a comeback.
Freddy, up on the right.
Old Man Wickles' ancestral manor.
Oh, man. Another creepy crib!
How come we can't ever investigate, like, a KFC or something?
Shaggy!
All right. Then again, creepy is my middle name.
Scoob!
Come on, Scoob!
Looks like a bit of a fixer-upper.
Nice job last night. Losers!
Quick, we need to think of a comeback.
What dorks.
Hey! Shut up!
That's a good one.
You are trespassing on Wickles Manor.
- Leave now or pay the price.
- What jerk makes that his doorbell?
Dude.
He just said we'd pay the price.
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy.
What could possibly happen by ringing a doorbell?
Help me!
Shaggy!
I think I pulled something.
That's what can happen by ringing a doorbell, Fred. That!
At 7 p.m., the owner
will be home to set you free.
You want to buy a box of cookies?
Excuse me.
Have you heard the Good News?
Yeah. There's cookies!
Watch the junk!
Sorry.
Oh, brother.
The lock's on a laser thumbprint scanner.
- Let me just get to my makeup.
- Daph, now?
You know what, Velma? It's never too late to learn to properly apply makeup.
Okay. The last good thumbprint should still be there, so...
...a little blush...
...a pore strip...
...and voilà.
All right, Daph!
I enjoy being a girl.
- Thank you!
- See if I can get my mechanic's job back.
- Twenty, 30, 40...
- Thanks for the cookies.
...50... Welcome!
Sixty, 70, 80...
Okay, gang. Let's, like, split up and search for clues.
Scoob and I will go this way.
Come on, Scoob.
He stole my thing that I say!
Search for clues. Search for clues.
A clue!
Shiny footprints.
The glow is similar to the pterodactyl scale.
A clue!
It looks like Wickles shares Jacobo's fascination with the supernatural.
He collects everything from Piri Reis to Aleister Crowley.
He collects dust too.
No. The dust is good.
We can tell what he's been reading lately.
Like here!
What is it?
It's an obsolete Celtic text used by secret societies in the mid-19th century.
Look. The book belonged to J. Jacobo.
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.
Maybe he gave it to Wickles before he died.
Can you read it?
It's an amalgamation of magic and science.
Here's a list of ingredients...
...on how to create your own carbon-based...
...organic, composite predators.
This is an instruction manual on how to create monsters.
Scoob.
Clues!
Those aren't clues, Scoob.
Those are just things you want.
Like, why is a toilet brush a clue?
Just because you can sing in it doesn't make it a clue. It makes it awesome.
Like, what's this?
"The Faux Ghost. "
We're in luck.
It's tonight, Scoob!
- We are detectives.
- Really?
You found an actual clue!
I found a clue!
Do the clue dance! Do the clue dance!
We're going back, we're going back!
Black Knight Ghost!
Run, Shaggy!
Let's go.
Like, lock the door!
Heavy stuff, Scoob!
Give me a hand, Scoob!
See him get through this!
Heavy!
We outsmarted that moron!
Yeah! What a moron.
Look at me.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
- Yo, metalhead!
- Yes?
Bring it.
He brought it.
Daphne! Hold him off!
I'll look in the book.
Maybe there's a formula for finding his weakness.
Here. "To find a creature's weakest point...
...take the angle between the current position of the sun...
...and your geographical point..."
- Velma!
"Add this point, 28 and a half feet up from sea level. "
That tickles.
This is bad.
"Multiply this number..."
"Add the square inches of..."
Velma!
"... the square root... "
Now it's good night, ladies!
"... your X-axis. "
"And subtract 9034. That's your Y-axis. "
Look. No hands!
Any time would be great, Velma!
I'm trying.
"Subtract one, divide by B, follow upward eight degrees north. "
Which makes his weakest point right here!
Right in the roundtables.
Run!
In your face! Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Come on, Scoob! Inside!
I'll compare the glow of those footprints to the pterodactyl scale.
We'll check out Wickles' book.
Dude, The Faux Ghost is an awesome clue. But what do we do with it?
Let's solve the mystery.
If we solve the mystery by ourselves...
...it would certainly prove to the gang that we belong.
Let's head to The Faux Ghost...
...find Wickles, and see what he knows.
But first, let's give the gang the old "slipperooney. "
Hey, guys.
Scooby's feeling kind of...
...like he's got rabies.
We're just gonna go outside to get some fresh air.
Jinkies!
What's up, Velms?
The analysis of the pterodactyl scale.
It contains randamonium, which this books says...
...is the critical ingredient needed to make monsters.
Doesn't randamonium glow, like those footprints in Wickles' mansion?
If we prove Wickles is behind this, this mystery goes down like a dot-com...
...and Coolsville digs us again.
- Where would he get randamonium?
Randamonium is the byproduct of silver mines.
Like the abandoned mining town in old Coolsville.
Then we better get to that mining town and see what's...
I'm invisible. I'm invisible.
Get rid of him!
Keep him busy.
What are you doing?
He wants to ask me on a date.
It's okay to be scared.
I am not scared.
I've fought werewolves and ghosts.
But in the end, we usually unmask them and it's a little scared man inside.
It's the same with dating.
Velma, have you ever considered that maybe werewolves and ghosts...
...are just distractions to keep you away from what really frightens you?
Intimacy with another person.
And by intimacy, I mean someone who thinks you're really hot.
But I'm more comfortable in the world of logic and facts.
And...
...I'm not hot.
Me neither.
Everybody has flaws, Velma.
The object of a healthy relationship...
...is to never let the other person know they're there.
- To museums.
- To museums.
Daph, I really like this guy.
What would you do if someone thought...
...that you were some glamorous and mysterious jet-setter?
I'd make myself one.
Who's your mommy?
My mommy?
Come on, let's solve a mystery.
- Do you have to go to the bathroom?
- No, I can't in this outfit.
Okay, Scooby-Doo, the coast is clear.
Here we go.
That's it, Scoob. The Faux Ghost.
Man, I recognize a lot of these cats.
Like, that's C.L. Magnus.
He used to dress up as Redbeard's ghost.
And that's Aggie Wilkins, a.k.a. The Ozark Witch.
These are all folks we unmasked.
If they spot us, they'll invite us to a weenie roast.
One where we're the weenies!
Hot dogs!
There's gotta be some way that we can use our awesome, fearless new skills...
...to get us in there without being recognized.
Everyone part like the Red Sea.
It's me, Shizzy McCreepy, and my brother, S.D. McCrawley.
We are in the house and ready to party.
Hey, handsome.
Hello, baby.
- Zoinks!
- Jinkies!
- Hey, gang.
- Jinkies!
- Hey!
- Yipe!
A Ghost Clown is a heck of a lot scarier than a Cotton Candy Glob!
Watch out, idiot.
- Old Man Wickles!
- Leave me alone.
No!
I just wanted to say thank you.
Your portrayal of the Black Knight Ghost was inspirational to my brother and me.
Have you done anything cool and creepy lately?
Listen, I'm not normally one for giving advice...
...but I feel sorry for you because of your brother's hideous nose deformity.
Get out of this game while you got a chance.
All of us here ain't nothing to admire.
We needed people to believe we were different than we were.
Maybe because we believed...
...that there was something wrong with who we were in the first place.
I guess you're sort of grateful to Mystery Inc...
...for unmasking you.
- Are you kidding?
If I see those twerps,
I'd tear their eyes out of their skulls.
Make them eat the one eye while watching themselves eat it with the other eye!
Bye.
Here's a clue for you.
That dude's wearing his freak hat 24/7.
I gotta take a whiz.
Don't do anything to attract attention.
Gotcha.
Hey, doll.
You wanna dance?
Groovy.
Here we go.
Shake it, baby.
Give me five!
Oh, yeah!
Everybody!
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Shaggy!
It's Scooby-Doo! The meddling mutt what helped throw us in jail!
Who, me?
No, wait, that's not Scooby-Doo!
That's S.D. McCrawley.
He's just wearing a mask.
And that's Doo's beatnik best pal,
Shaggy Rogers.
- Where?
- There.
Zoinks! Gangway!
Run, Shaggy. Wait for me!
And stay out!
That wasn't so bad, Scoob.
That was my outfit, I swear.
You know, Velma, you are as beautiful as ever.
You're just so different than I expected.
You know, I'm just...
- Oh, my goodness!
- What the heck's going on?
This cannot be good.
My museum.
Wait!
Any comments on the museum robbery?
Mystery Inc. Is investigating the two stolen costumes.
No, the one that just happened.
Where The Black Knight and Pterodactyl
Ghost stole the rest of the costumes?
The rest of the costumes?
So, what you're saying is it's all downhill for Mystery Inc.
No! You're doing that thing again where you take everything I say out of context.
You're trying to make it look like I think Coolsville sucks.
No! Don't record that!
Patrick, I'm so sorry.
It must be so hard for you.
I'm sorry, I have to go. Okay?
- I'll go with you...
- No! Just...
No, I have to figure out what's going on.
All Fred Jones had to say was:
I think Coolsville sucks!
In light of the city's recent chaos...
... Jones ' response was disheartening
to the fans who have supported them.
Perhaps it's time for the crime-solving
gang to shape up or ship out.
I'll be right back.
This is Heather Jasper-Howe for Investigative Probe Reporting.
What's with the personal attacks?
Look, I'm a huge fan. It's just my editor...
Who are you kidding?
Who are you kidding?
Don't think I don't know your game.
What do you do for the gang?
Really?
Velma's the smart one. Fred's the leader.
All you are is a pretty little face.
Why are you doing this?
Because it's my job to unmask those who pretend to be who they're not.
"Unmask those"? You sound like...
Sound like who?
The evil masked guy.
But you know that, because just as you know I'm standing here...
...you know I know who you know you are...
...which is him, who's a her, which is you.
Now I see what you do for the gang.
You're in charge of incoherent babbling.
Mystery Incorporated.
Once again, you are proven useless before my power.
Because of you, soon Coolsville...
...will be mine.
Darn it.
Thanks a lot!
The scoop of the night, gone.
Can't you do anything right?
Ned, get your camera and follow me.
Guess not.
Stop wasting my time!
You hear me? Now I want you to question all your scum-bucket friends.
Find out what they know about those stolen costumes.
Or else you'll be known as the Soiled Underwear Ghost!
I want answers. Now, go! Now!
Yes, sir!
- Sorry.
- It's okay.
Patrick.
Shaggy. Scooby.
What are you guys doing here?
We just came down here to be undercover and stuff.
Me too.
My museum got broken into again...
...so I had to come here and try and get some answers.
Gotta put on the tough-guy act, or these guys will eat me alive.
What's the matter, you don't believe me?
I'm kidding!
- It's the tough-guy act.
- That's good.
I got you.
That was a joke? That was good!
You're a lot of fun. Try it, Scoob.
It needs work.
Look, Patrick...
...we could stay here, do this all night, and something tells me you would...
...but we gotta make like your personality and split.
Okay.
Scooby-Doo. Scoob!
Hello?
Scooby-Doo, can you hear me?
Hello, Shaggy.
Wickles has led us into a terrifying ghost town!
- Ghost town?
- Yes, a ghost town!
Darn bushes yowling at me again.
- Keep quiet, Scoob.
- Okay, Shaggy.
Like, where did Old Man Nutjob go?
Through here, Scoob?
I don't know.
Oh, boy.
Run, Scoob! It's a "skelly" thingy!
Elevator.
Good work, pal!
Like, let's skedaddle.
So, what's your assessment, Velmster?
This place seems harmless enough.
I mean, whether the Evil Masked Figure could've gotten his randamonium...
...from here at the mine?
- Oh, sorry.
I was just thinking about Patrick.
He seemed so upset when he left.
- Right. So...
- And...
...he doesn't like me.
Okay. So your assessment is?
- Love stinks.
- Fred?
Do you think I'm just a pretty face?
No.
I mean, yes.
I mean, not fat!
Definitely not fat.
Is this sort of what you're looking for?
Fat? Why would you even use that word?
Never again will they underestimate us.
That's right.
I've gathered you here today for something big.
At last.
All these years of careful planning...
...have culminated in this one glorious moment.
Old Man Wickles, caught red-handed in your foul monster-making scheme.
With your ugly, evil henchmen.
Henchmen?
Young man, we're investors, and we're listening to his pitch.
So as I was saying...
...the Old Tyme Mining Town, a summer camp for kids...
...where they can have an authentic mining experience.
They can dig for 18 hours straight, just like in the golden days of yore.
They have the time of their lives, and we get free miners!
Mr. Wickles, we need to ask you about...
...your ties to recent monster attacks.
- I don't know nothing about no monsters.
Then how come there was randamonium on the floor of your mansion?
There's randamonium all over the place.
I come home with it in my shorts.
Are you continuing the work of your old pal Jonathan Jacobo?
Old pal? Jacobo?
We hated each other.
In the prison cafeteria, he used to steal my Tater Tots!
And he got the lead in My Fair Lady.
Then why did we find the monster book in your library?
Wait a second. You're the runts what vandalized my home.
Which one of you stole my toilet brush?
Gentlemen.
- I'm sorry, Jeremiah.
- What happened? I haven't finished!
Wait, fellas!
Wowee, Scooby-Doo!
I think we're onto something.
It's like a huge laboratory.
- Go ahead.
- Okay.
This place is like Clue-topia, Scoob.
Refrigerator!
Lemonade!
Check it out.
Look at those weird letters, Scoob.
Shaggy?
Scooby-Doo, you turned into a freaky monster.
You don't eat stuff that glows.
There's got to be an antidote in here somewhere.
Try this, Scoob. It looks medicinal.
Tastes like...
Strawberries.
I'm okay, Scoob.
I've got a chick's body!
I'm the Tasmanian Devil!
Check it out, dude!
I'm buff.
My God.
It seems as if I've become ludicrously intelligent.
It's awful! I long for the blissful ignorance of my former self.
Chasing cats, licking my own rear end, eating my own vomit.
Those were wonderful times.
Check out my pecs, little man!
Hush now, buffoon.
This is a highly combustible synthesis.
A what?
I'm going to transform us back!
No way, geek!
I'm gonna stay this way forever!
No!
Let's go!
Careful, gang.
This "Schwarzeneggian" oaf almost destroyed us.
Go boom.
You are embarrassing.
That was almost exactly like my freshman year in college.
What are you guys doing here?
You're supposed to be sick, Scooby.
I invented a potion.
You lied to us. We're a team.
You don't just go off half-cocked doing whatever you want.
Hey, gang.
"Beware who enters the Monster Hive.
Inside your fears will come alive. "
Oh, my.
Look! It's the costumes from the museum!
- Zombie.
- Miner 49er.
- Captain Cutler.
- I bet they're all here.
He must have used the costumes to make real monsters, which implies...
He needs the costumes to make the monsters, which implies...
He already had a Pterodactyl Ghost costume somehow, which implies...
Patrick's the one.
Velma's in love.
No, I mean the one.
The bad guy.
That's why he wanted to go out with me.
To see what we knew.
We just saw Patrick at the bad guys' hangout.
He was working both sides of Psycho Street.
I don't know who's behind this, but we don't need him...
...transforming more costumes.
Let's find a way to shut down this monster-maker for good.
Guys? What's over here?
This light is strange.
Scooby-Doo.
We're the ones that found this place.
Score one for the big guys!
Now we need to keep acting like mondo-groovy detectives. Come on.
Like, wowee.
Cool! Like, "tuneage. "
Like, what's that weird sound?
Captain Cutler!
Miner 49er!
The Tar Monster!
We have...
...to remain...
...calm.
Calm, Scooby-Doo!
You're not being calm!
I needed that.
I needed that too.
You're pushing your luck, Scoob!
You girls find anything?
- He did it.
- Scoob!
Fred, disconnect that control panel!
Maybe it'll stop the machine!
Come on, this way! Quick, the elevator!
- Like, The 10,000 Volt Ghost!
- Come on, Scoob!
We're gonna die!
- Think positive!
- We're gonna die quickly!
Wait for me!
Come on, girls!
- An exit!
- Run, Shaggy!
Stop them!
Destroy the city if you have to, but get me that control panel!
With it, they can destroy everything
I've set out to do.
Hurry up, gang.
We need to find Shaggy and Scooby.
End of the line, Mystery Inc.!
Die!
Let's book, Scoob.
Oh, boy.
Let's rip it, Scoob!
Zoinks!
I don't know.
Banzai!
We're getting rad!
Like, this pipe's ripping, Scoob!
Zoinks!
Hello.
Scooby!
Are you guys okay?
Sure. As long as you define "okay" as "in massive agony. "
We should get back to headquarters.
No! That'll be the first place they'll look for us.
I think I know where to go.
Move that worthless piece of tin!
Unlike some of you,
I have a very important meeting!
Citizens! Turn in Mystery Inc.
Your reward: We'll let you live.
My monsters can make life very unpleasant.
Find me Mystery Inc., now.
Heather Jasper-Howe with an emergency update for Investigative Probe.
A monster army has invaded Coolsville.
Angry citizens have gathered
outside Mystery Inc. 's offices in protest.
They're insisting the gang cooperate
with the Evil Masked Figure's demands.
Mystery Stink! Mystery Stink!
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have anything to say for yourself?
I beg you, Mystery Inc.
If you can hear me, turn yourselves in.
If we do, he'll get the control panel back, and the city will be in worse shape.
We'd be playing right into his hands.
Please. For our city's sake.
Sorry. You're cancelled.
The old high-school clubhouse.
We should be safe here.
We haven't been here in years.
Freddy, are you okay?
- Do you wanna talk?
- Talking's for wimps.
It's time for action.
You know, Scoob...
...this Evil Masked Figure is turning Coolsville into Ghoulsville.
And the gang is totally taking a hit for it.
Like, this is the most "our-faultiest" screwup ever, Scoob.
Still works.
Look, all my old tools.
After all our so-called success...
...we're back in this old firetrap.
Hit me, Fred.
Good throw, Velm!
- Mine.
- Gotcha!
Throw it to me!
- Go long!
- Okay.
Go, Scooby-Doo!
Dude!
It all seemed so easy back then.
We solved mysteries for the love of them, not to prove anything to anyone.
And the mysteries all seemed to unravel themselves.
Sometimes, the answers would just appear like magic.
My first multiple-resonance imaging device.
Made out of a crystal radio and old video games.
Wait a minute.
Randamonium has an algorithmic cross-currency of negative 4. 121.
With it, maybe...
Well, just maybe...
We could reverse the current and reverse the monster-making process!
All we need to do is rewire the control panel...
Bring it back to the Monster Hive and plug it into the base.
- Push the button...
- And instead of creating monsters...
...all the monsters will be destroyed.
Like, they're totally having a montage in there without us.
I'll tell you one thing for sure.
They don't need our help to figure it out.
We're screwups.
The only time we do anything right...
...is when we accidentally plow into the Snow Ghost...
...because we've accidentally glued our feet to rocket-powered roller-skates.
Eight stupid times.
Face it, Scoob.
We'll never be anything but our old goofy selves.
I wish once...
...just once...
...I could do the right thing on purpose.
You know, Scoob?
Like, be a hero...
...and save the day.
But who are we kidding, right?
Captain Cutler's Ghost.
Captain Cutler's Ghost!
They found us. Finish that in the van when we get to the Monster Hive.
- Come on, guys! In the van!
- Hurry!
Go, Fred! Hit it!
- What do we do?
- What do we do?
Fine. Let's go back!
That's the wrong way!
Shaggy! Give me a hand.
This is tied for the most terrifying day of my life.
- Tied with what?
- Every other freaking day of my life!
It's done!
Jinkies! Tweety's back.
- Shaggy!
- Yeah?
I'm putting her in cruise.
Take the wheel.
Go!
Take this!
- This is bad.
- No doubt.
- Shaggy?
- Yeah.
Who's driving?
Hello.
- Scoob.
- What?
- Turn the wheel!
- Wheel?
- Turn the wheel!
- The round thing, Scoob!
- Scooby!
- Okay.
I'm driving!
Watch out, Scoob!
You did it, Scoob!
All right, gang.
The Monster Hive is right over there.
Let's get this control panel and plug her in.
You go nowhere, knave.
You guys take the long way around.
And I'll hold him off.
- Come on.
- Go get him, Fred.
- Come on, Daph!
- I'm coming!
Not so fast!
You guys go. I'll take care of Sparky.
Just get that control panel to the Hive.
- Go!
- We've got it, Daph!
Scary.
Taste the pain, Mr. Glowy Ugly Thing.
Daph?
- Daph, are you okay?
- I think so.
Guess this is it, huh?
Oh, baby.
I'm afraid.
What a wimp, huh?
That doesn't make you a wimp.
Makes you human.
The Skeleton Men.
- He does that when he gets nervous.
- Sorry.
- Here, Shaggy, take this.
- Why are you giving this to me?
I'll distract those skeletal screwballs.
- Get this to the Monster Hive.
- Us?
You're faster than me.
Once there, just plug it into the base.
Push this button.
I fixed it so it will destroy all the monsters.
But...
...we can't.
- We're screwups.
We tried to be heroes like you guys, but we're not.
- We're just not.
- No.
Like me?
That's funny.
I always wanted to be like you guys.
You guys are so free. You're never afraid to be who you really are.
Whether you're fearful or joyful or hungry.
I think you've been heroes all along.
You just haven't known it.
Here I go.
Heroes.
Heroes.
On your knees, knave.
Can't you see we're talking?
Talking is for wimps.
You can't fool me with that macho facade.
You're just afraid to show your sensitive side.
You've touched my inner child.
And he's really mad!
Come on, Scoob.
Miner 49er!
I'll get you, you varmints!
Dead end.
Remember when we were young and you used to wear that jumper?
- What? Me? In a jumper?
- And we used to watch cable?
Do it!
Lights out.
Blackout! Blackout!
Oh, crap.
Take this, daddy-o. It's a real gas.
Come on. Let's go, Scoob!
My glasses.
Oh, brother. Not again.
I've got to consider contact lenses.
What?
Some kind of scary bat.
Wait a minute.
That's the pterodactyl.
The Pterodactyl Ghost.
What's this?
A shrine!
To Jonathan Jacobo?
But who would be so obsessed with him?
Velma.
Lose something?
Patrick.
What are you doing here?
I'm trying to solve this mystery.
Same as you.
That is what you're doing, right?
Trying to solve this mystery?
Yes.
Why are you so obsessed with Jonathan Jacobo?
- What are you talking about?
- No way, Jose.
Velma.
Stay away from me.
I know who you are.
- Velma, let go of the grate.
- So I can fall to my death?
No, so I can pull you up.
- You gotta trust me.
- No. I only trust the facts.
And all the facts say that you're the Evil Masked Figure.
What does your heart say?
I don't know.
It's beating too loud for me to hear.
Look deeper. You gotta trust me.
You saved my life.
Patrick!
Velma!
That thing just flew off with Patrick!
The best we can do for him is get that control panel back where it belongs.
Where is it?
I gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.
That's weird. It sounded like you just said you gave it to Shaggy and Scooby.
I think we lost them.
Scoob, we made it.
You should never have locked those locks.
Now you're stuck in here with me!
The Cotton Candy Glob.
- Cotton Candy Glob?
- Cotton Candy Glob?
Yes.
- No! I'll give you cavities!
- I don't see Shaggy and Scooby anywhere.
Poor guys are probably running around helpless and terrified.
This is like the greatest day of our lives, Scoob.
Finally, a monster we could sink our teeth into.
I'm kind of thirsty. I wonder if there's a Liter-sized Soda Glob anywhere?
- Come on, guys. We have to hurry.
- Come on.
We have to get this control panel back before...
Before exactly that happens.
At last I have you, Mystery Inc.
You'll never make it past my monsters.
We've taken these jerks before, gang.
Let's do it again.
- Fred!
- It's not them you need to worry about.
Now you are stuck in my trap.
Daphne!
Daph!
Gotcha!
Go! Daphne!
Run, Velma! Run, Velma!
Shaggy! Here!
Come on!
Soon your friends will be dead...
...and Coolsville destroyed.
My revenge will be final...
...and there's nothing you can do about it.
Help, Velma!
Daphne?
- Shaggy?
- Scoob...
Dude.
- Like, frostbite never felt so good!
- Stop them!
- Go long, Scoob!
- Okay.
Here, doggy-doggy.
Rail glide!
- Watch this!
- Roll barrel!
Hang time!
End of the line, Doo!
Come here, you worthless mutt!
Scoob!
You can do it, buddy!
You can't do this to me!
Who do you think you are?
Scooby...
...Dooby...
...Doo!
No!
My monsters!
You did it! You saved us all!
I know.
Do you know the identity of the Evil Masked Figure behind it all?
If our hunch is correct, the Evil Masked Figure is...
No!
Heather Jasper-Howe.
But she was at the museum when the Masked Figure was on the roof.
You almost had me there, didn't you?
Lucky for her, she had an assistant helping her with her evil plans.
Ned.
When I realized
she was the Evil Masked Figure...
... he quickly changed into her costume.
But why did she do it?
Because Heather Jasper-Howe is actually...
...Doctor Jonathan Jacobo.
The original Pterodactyl Ghost.
But how do you know this?
A photo, taken of Jacobo in front of the Coolsonian.
Jacobo supposedly died a year before construction even began.
So Jacobo survived that fall off the prison wall.
He adapted the false Heather Jasper-Howe persona to turn the press against us.
Then he framed Old Man Wickles...
...by putting that book and
The Black Knight Ghost in his mansion.
As if you getting the lead in My Fair Lady wasn't enough!
I was an excellent Eliza!
You were too act-y.
And stealing my Tater Tots!
You kept saying you felt puffy!
And the real identity of Ned is...
Ned.
I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for those meddling punks...
...and their dumb dog!
- You were a dude this whole time?
- Of course, dummkopf.
But we cuddled.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen, Velma, I know that must have seemed very suspicious...
...but you've got to believe me that I had nothing to do with...
I trust you.
Listen, Patrick.
I'm not glamorous or mysterious.
But one thing that's true is...
...that I like you.
Very much.
And I would like to go out with you again.
But this time, I will go as myself.
Yeah, I'd like that, more than anything.
Okay.
Mystery Inc.! Mystery Inc.!
They're cheering for us again.
Yep.
I always thought that was the best thing in the world.
I guess I found something a little bit better.
- Can we get your photo in this?
- Yes.
Yikes! A monster!
- Like, Scoob, it's me, man!
- Shaggy!
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
Sing it up, Ruben.
Everybody.
Come on, Shaggy.
Get down.

Five thousand years ago...
a fierce warrior known
as the Scorpion King...
led a great army on a campaign...
to conquer the known world.
After a vicious campaign
which lasted seven long years...
the Scorpion King and his army
were defeated...
and driven deep into
the sacred desert of Ahm Shere.
One by one, they slowly perished
under the scorching sun...
until only the great warrior himself
was left alive.
Near death...
the Scorpion King made a pact
with the dark god Anubis...
that if Anubis
would spare his life...
and let him conquer his enemies...
he would give him his soul.
Anubis accepted his offer
and spared his life.
Anubis gave the Scorpion King
command of his army...
and like an evil flood,
they washed away...
all that lay before them.
When his task was done...
Anubis forced the Scorpion King
to serve him for all time.
His army was returned
to the sands from whence they came...
where they wait, silently...
to be awakened once again.
Alex?
What were you thinking, a mummy had come back to life?
I'll tell you a story some time.
What are you doing down here?
I told you to wait for us in the temple.
It's dangerous down here.
- But I saw your tattoo.
- You saw what?
On a wall by the entrance.
There's a cartouche just like it.
With the pyramid and the eye... and the two kings and everything.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Okay. Well, I'll be up to take a look at that in a minute.
In the meantime, I want you to wait for us up there.
Pick up your stuff, and I'll see you up in the temple.
Go on.
And what should I do?
I don't know. Surprise me.
- Build a better mousetrap.
- Okay.
While your mother goes and desecrates another tomb.
Go away.
- Those are poisonous, you know.
- Only if they bite you.
What was all that about?
Nothing.
Alex wanted to show me something.
I swear... the kid gets more and more like you every day.
You mean more attractive, sweet... and devilishly charming?
No, he's driving me crazy.
Now, where were we?
Hammer and chisel.
All right, all right!
Let's do it your way.
Thank you.
Ever since I had that dream... this place is all
I can think about.
Ever since you had that dream,
I haven't had a decent night of sleep.
I feel like I've been here before.
I know I've been here before.
Evy, nobody's been here before, not in at least 3,000 years.
Except for these guys.
Then how do I seem to know exactly where I'm going?
Let's go.
Knock, knock. Anybody home?
You two check out that stuff, see if it's there.
I'll sort out the O'Connells.
If you move that fast enough, you can almost write your name.
I just had a vision.
It was like my dream, but it was real.
It was like I was actually here in ancient times.
Well, if you actually were here... could you show me how to open this thing?
Hold this.
- Now you're starting to scare me.
- I'm starting to scare myself.
What is this?
Look at the state of this rubbish.
The Egyptians never had a clue.
Look at that stuff.
It's all chintz and stuff.
Look at that.
Cheap pottery, this.
Ancient rubbish.
Jacques, something's hit me head!
Shut up, Spivey.
This place is cursed.
We do not want to wake the gods.
That's the emblem of the Scorpion King.
He's supposed to be pure myth.
No trace of him has ever been found before. No artefacts.
No archival evidence.
Maybe they didn't want anybody to find him.
- Let's open this.
- Evy, I don't know.
- I don't have a good feeling about this.
- It's only a chest.
No harm ever came from opening a chest.
Right, and no harm ever came from reading a book.
- Remember how that one went?
- Come on. We can't stop now.
Just remember,
I was the voice of reason here.
For once.
Rubbish.
Dreck. Chintz.
God, that hurt!
Hon? Let's do it your way.
The bracelet of Anubis.
I'll take care of this.
Oh, my God.
It's a bit late for that!
- Put it in your rucksack.
- Let's leave it here.
- It's a bit late for that!
- What's it say?
"He who disturbs this bracelet... shall drink from the Nile."
That doesn't sound too bad.
Jacques is gonna make a nice fillet out of you, my son.
Spivey! Jacques!
Let's get the hell out of here!
Come on.
This is bad, Evy.
- We've had bad before.
- This is worse.
Mom? Dad?
I can explain everything.
The Book of the Dead gives life.
And the Book of the Living... takes life away.
I thought that was my job.
We're getting close.
Did you acquire it?
We're getting very close.
We found him.
We found him! We found him!
Step aside there.
Out of the way.
Imhotep.
It's him. It's Imhotep.
Now we must raise those that serve him.
Get out of my way.
Get out of the way.
Get out of my way or I'm gonna shoot you in the face.
He means it.
He shot someone before.
Give it to me.
The opportunity passed us by.
- We need that bracelet.
- We need it before it opens.
Enough.
My dear Hafez...
I told you
I should have handled it.
I did not want your past history... to cloud the issue.
Don't worry. We know where it is.
We'll take care of it.
No, we'll take care of it.
I have a different chore for you now.
Where is the bracelet?
It's on its way to merry old London.
Then London is where we must go.
I think the bracelet
is some sort of guide... to the lost oasis of Ahm Shere.
Evy, I know what you're thinking... and the answer's no.
We just got home.
That's the beauty of it.
We're already packed.
Why don't you just give me one good reason?
It's just an oasis... darling.
A beautiful... exciting... romantic... oasis.
The kind with the white, sandy beach and the palm trees... and the cool, clear, blue water?
We could have some of those big drinks with the little umbrellas.
- Sounds good.
- Sounds too good. What's the catch?
Supposedly it's the resting place of Anubis's army.
You see? I knew there's a catch.
There's always a catch.
How did I know that?
And let me guess.
It was commanded by that Scorpion King guy?
Yes, but he only awakens once every 5,000 years.
And if someone doesn't kill him, he's gonna wipe out the world.
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.
The last known expedition to actually reach Ahm Shere... was sent by Ramses the Fourth over 3,000 years ago.
- He sent over a thousand men.
- None of them was ever seen again.
- How did you know?
- I didn't, but that's always the story.
- Did I mention the pyramid of gold?
- Twice.
Alexander the Great sent troops in search of it.
- Hooray for him.
- So did Caesar.
- Look what happened to his career.
- And Napoleon.
Yeah, but we're smarter than him.
- Taller too.
- Exactly.
- That's why we're gonna find it.
- Because we're taller?
- That's why I love you.
- Nice try.
Mom!
What do I do with this chest?
Sucker weighs a goddang ton.
Alex, watch your language.
Rather weighty, this.
Evy, that first weird dream of yours was exactly six weeks ago, right?
Yes, but what's that got to do with anything?
It just happens to coincide with Egyptian New Year.
That's right.
What a coincidence.
Maybe.
All I'm saying is let's be cautious.
If anything happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.
You and Alex are the only thing that matter to me.
Well... the Bembridge scholars have been begging me... to run the British Museum.
Cripes, how do you get this thing off?
Have I kissed you today?
I hate it when you do that.
Why?
- Makes me agree to anything.
- Anything?
Those knickers are not mine.
Jonathan.
Alex, behave yourself for five minutes, all right?
You betcha.
- Happy to be home?
- Couldn't be happier.
It's the Year of the Scorpion.
- Neat.
- Thought you might like that.
So I killed the mummy and his minions and stole his sceptre.
Oh, you're so brave.
And rich.
Did I mention rich?
What do you think I'm doing here?
- Sorry, we must be in the wrong house.
- You said this was your house.
- I didn't.
- Call me!
- You're not Sheila's husband?
- No.
If you work for Johnny,
I was gonna pay him back on Tuesday.
I don't know any Johnny.
We are looking for the bracelet of Anubis.
Oh, good for you. Good thing to have, the old bracelet of Anubis.
Where is it?
Ah, you're looking here for the bracelet. I see.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Mr. O'Connell, you try my patience.
Mr. O'Connell? Hold on a minute.
You've got the wrong ma...
That bracelet.
Now I remember.
- I lost it in a card game.
- For your sake, I hope not.
It can't be.
- Where's your wife?
- My wife?
You mean Evy.
I think she went off to Baden-Baden or Tibet or something.
The girl's a free spirit.
Did I mention I was single now?
Egyptian asps are quite poisonous.
It's downstairs.
There's a safe.
The combination is 3-20-58.
393-something.
It's in the safe downstairs.
I told you!
And your point is?
- I told you so you wouldn't kill me.
- When did we make that arrangement?
Jonathan, I thought I said no more wild parties.
Well, when you're popular...
I'm serious. If you've lost that key, you're grounded.
I haven't lost it. I just can't find it.
There's a difference.
Well, you better start finding it then.
I will, Mom.
There's nothing to worry about.
Good evening.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
I'm looking for the chest, of course.
Give it to me now.
Get out of my house.
Whoa, Mom.
- Maybe not the best idea.
- Alex, get back there.
Definitely not the best idea.
I think it's time to yell for Dad now.
- I will kill you and take it anyway.
- I think not.
Ardeth.
What are you doing here?
Perhaps explanations are best kept for later.
Ardeth Bay.
Lock-Nah.
Hey, folks, knowing my brother-in-law... he probably deserves whatever you're about to do to him... but this is my house.
I have certain rules about snakes and dismemberment.
Shoot him!
Whoa, Mom!
- Where did you learn to do that?
- I have no idea.
That I learned from your father.
I'll take that.
Not bad for a Medjai.
Let go!
- What's in the chest?
- The bracelet of Anubis!
They must not get the bracelet.
Get it and get out of here!
Mom, look out!
Evelyn!
What'd you do this time?
I haven't done anything to anybody.
- Lately.
- Come on!
Rick!
Look out, Rick!
Dad! Dad!
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
What the hell are you doing here?
Scratch that. I don't care.
Who are those guys and where are they taking my wife?
My friend, I'm not sure... but wherever this man is... your wife will surely be.
Hey, I know him.
He's the curator.
- He works at the British Museum.
- Are you sure?
Better believe him. He spends more time there than he does at home.
Okay, you're here.
The bad guys are here.
Evy's been kidnapped.
Let me guess.
They once again removed the creature from his grave.
Not to point fingers, but isn't it your job to make sure that doesn't happen?
That woman with him knows things no living person could possibly know.
She knew exactly where the creature was buried.
We hoped she would lead us to the bracelet. She obviously did.
Now they have it.
I wouldn't get too nervous just yet.
Is that gold?
When I stuck it on,
I saw the pyramids at Giza.
Then whoosh... straight across the desert to Karnak.
You have started a chain reaction that could bring about the next apocalypse.
You, lighten up.
You, big trouble.
You, get in the car.
I am sorry if I alarmed your son, but you must understand.
Now that the bracelet's on... we have
7 days before the Scorpion King awakens.
We? What we?
If he is not killed, he will raise the Army of Anubis.
- I take it that's not a good thing.
- Oh, he'll wipe out the world.
The old "wipe out the world" ploy.
Whomever can kill
the Scorpion King... can send his army back to the Underworld... or use it to destroy mankind and rule the Earth.
They dug up Imhotep 'cause he's tough enough to take out the Scorpion King.
That is their plan.
Alex, I got a big job for you.
Stay here and protect the car.
- I could do that.
- Protect the car?
Come on. Just because I'm a kid doesn't mean I'm stupid.
- I know.
- Dad!
If you see anyone come running out screaming, it's just me.
Maybe you should stay here and watch him.
Now you're talking.
- You want the shotgun?
- No, I prefer the Thompson.
If I were to say to you, I'm a stranger travelling from the east... seeking that which is lost...
Then I would reply that I am a stranger travelling from the west.
- It is I whom you seek.
- Then it is true.
- You have the sacred mark.
- What, that?
That got slapped on me in an orphanage in Cairo.
That mark means you're a protector of man... a warrior for God, a Medjai.
Sorry.
You've got the wrong guy.
Mr. Hafez.
They found him.
Imhotep.
Do not be frightened.
I am not afraid.
You know... a couple of years ago, this would've seemed really strange to me.
Lord Imhotep will be much pleased.
Where is it?
Where is the bracelet?
I think I know.
At the very top of the gold pyramid, there was a huge diamond.
How huge?
It was so big, it would reflect the sun... and wink at distant travellers... beckoning them to their deaths.
Get off! Get off!
Oh, my God.
You wait!
I'll put you in your grave again.
Our thinking was, not if we put you in your grave first.
Burn her!
You bast...
- Open it! Open it!
- I'm trying!
- Hurry up!
- Come on, come on!
- You broke it!
- Be quiet!
If there's gonna be any hysterics, they'll come from me!
Go, go, go!
Oh, no. Not these guys again.
What are we gonna do?
You're asking me?
I'm only eight years old!
Honey, what you doin'?
These guys don't use doors.
Where the hell's Jonathan?
- Alex!
- What's the matter with my car?
I was forced to find an alternative means of transportation.
- A double-decker bus?
- It was his idea.
- Was not!
- Was too!
- Just go!
- It was too!
No, not my car!
Oh, I hate mummies.
- Glad to see me now?
- Just like old times, huh?
Turn, turn!
No! Get out of the way!
Look out!
Great driving, Uncle Jon.
Yeah.
You all right?
This was my first bus ride.
- What would I do without you?
- Are all librarians this much trouble?
Jeez, get a room.
Let me go!
Silence!
Stop!
Please do not fear for your son, my friends.
They cannot hurt him, for he wears the bracelet of Anubis.
Alex is wearing the bracelet?
When he put it on, he said he saw the pyramids at Giza, the temple at Karnak.
At Karnak, the bracelet will show him the next step of the journey.
If we don't get to Karnak before them, we won't know where to look for him.
Seems to me... like we need a magic carpet.
When Lord Imhotep last encountered the O'Connells... they sent his immortal soul to the Underworld.
As powerful as he will become, he is still vulnerable.
Only with the Army of Anubis will he be invincible.
He will need your help.
Keep this with you always.
The Book of the Dead!
What a bright little child.
Your mother must be missing you terribly.
If you wish to see her again, you'd better behave.
Lady, I don't behave for my parents.
What makes you think
I'm going to do it for you?
Silence!
Because your parents wouldn't slip poisonous snakes into your bed... while you were sleeping.
Lord Imhotep wishes to meet the boy.
Now we shall see how brave you are.
Hey, watch the suit.
Ow! Me fingers.
Nice.
Very nice.
Did you acquire what we asked?
We acquired it, all right.
You know what?
We had to kill two of those guards at the mausoleum to acquire it.
This chest is cursed.
It says there is one... the undead... who will kill all those who open this chest.
Yes, and the creature will suck them dry then become whole again.
We've all heard this story before.
Yeah, but I heard the Yanks who found it nine years ago all died.
Horrible deaths, they were.
- So with that in mind...
- We want ten.
Quiet!
The agreement was for five.
Well, we want ten or we'll take it elsewhere.
- If you...
- Ten will be just fine.
Follow me, gentlemen.
Get in.
It is you who are the chosen one... you who will take me to Ahm Shere.
What if I don't?
What if I get a little lost?
You have strength, little one.
You are your father's son, but I know something you don't.
This bracelet is a gift... and a curse.
The sands of time... have already begun to pour against you.
Yeah, I already heard this part.
From the minute
I put the bracelet on... seven days do I have before the Scorpion King wakes up.
Did you also hear that if you do not enter the pyramid... before the sun strikes it on that very morning... that the bracelet will suck the life out of you?
That part I missed.
Hey, wait a minute. That means
I've only got five days left.
Then I believe it will be best if we do not get lost, don't you?
My dad is going to kick your ass.
I do not think so.
In here, gentlemen, you shall receive your just rewards.
No tricks now, woman.
We're not givin' up this chest till we're satisfied.
Don't worry.
There is much satisfaction to be had.
What's going on?
This place is cursed.
- What is it with you and curses?
- He ain't happy without a good curse.
"This is cursed. That is cursed."
Give it a rest, will ya?
Christ!
He wants you to open the chest.
Open the chest!
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?
- This is the magic carpet?
- It'll be fine. He's a professional.
Izzy!
He definitely remembers you.
He's a little shy.
Jonathan, get our bags.
- Oh, my hands are full.
- Now.
- Right. I'll get the bags.
- I'll deal with the flight details.
- Honey, you're not a subtle man.
- We don't have time for subtle.
Izzy, come here.
- Doesn't look happy to see you.
- Never turned me down yet.
Whatever it is, whatever you need,
I don't care. Forget it, O'Connell.
Every time I hook up with you,
I get shot.
Last time I got shot in the ass.
I'm in mourning for my ass.
- Remember that bank job in Marrakesh?
- Bank job?
- It's not like it sounds.
- It's exactly how it sounds.
I'm flying high, hiding in the sun.
The white boy here flags me down, so I fly in low for the pick-up.
The next thing you know,
I get shot.
I'm lying in the middle of the road with my spleen hanging out... and I see him waltzing up with some belly dancer girl.
Belly dancer girl?
- Izzy, I think you and I should talk.
- As long as I don't get shot.
Quit your whining.
You're gonna get paid this time.
Have you looked around here any?
What do I need money for?
What the hell am I gonna spend it on?
I'm gonna keep this short.
My little boy's out there.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get him back.
If you give me that gold stick, you can shave my head... wax my legs and use me for a surfboard.
Didn't we do that in Tripoli?
Say, by the way, when did you lose your eye?
I didn't. I just thought it made me look more dashing.
Come on. Get to work.
- You're not catching me at my best.
- Oh, I'm sure I am.
I knew it.
I'm gonna get shot.
These are the commanders of the 12 tribes of the Medjai.
Horus.
Pet bird.
My best and most clever friend.
He will let the commanders know of our progress so that they may follow.
If the Army of Anubis arises... they will do all they can to stop it.
- Are you sure Izzy is reliable?
- Yeah, he's reliable-ish.
- Isn't she beautiful?
- It's a balloon.
It's a dirigible.
- Where's your airplane?
- Airplanes are a thing of the past.
- Izzy, you were right.
- I was?
Yeah, you're gonna get shot.
She's faster than she looks.
And she's real quiet.
Perfect for sneaking up on people, which is a very good thing.
Unless, of course, we go with your approach... barging in face first, guns blazing, gettin' your friends shot in the ass.
Why can't you people ever keep your feet on the ground?
O'Connell does not want to believe, but he flies like Horus to his destiny.
Yes, very interesting.
Tell me more about this gold pyramid.
It is written that since the time of the Scorpion King... no man who has laid eyes upon it has ever returned to tell the tale.
Where is all this stuff written?
Hello!
Got it.
Pretty nice, eh?
This is all I have left in the world.
The rest of my fortune was lost... to some rather unscrupulous characters, actually.
If the curator reacted the way you say, it must be very important.
If I were you,
I would keep it close.
My friend, the gods couldn't take this away from me.
- That's mine.
- No, it's not!
Keep your hands off it.
I want him back, Rick.
I want him in my arms.
I know.
We taught him well.
He's smarter than you.
He's tougher than me.
- I love him so much, I just can't...
- I know. We both do.
Alex knows that.
I'll get him back, Evy.
I promise.
I know you will.
- Are we there yet?
- No.
That was amazing.
Perfect aim.
What are you talking about?
I missed.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Make it quick.
Hurry up.
- Hey, reading material!
- Now!
I can't go when someone's watching.
I don't trust you.
You'll look.
Darn!
Oh, my God!
Doesn't anyone around here know how to flush a toilet?
Karnak.
If a man does not embrace his past, he has no future.
Look... even if I was some sort of sacred Medjai... what good does that do me now?
It is the missing piece of your heart.
If you embrace it and accept it, you can do anything.
Sounds great.
Listen, what can we expect from our old friend Imhotep?
His powers are returning quickly.
When he reaches Ahm Shere, even the
Scorpion King won't be able to stop him.
Evy, I know you haven't been yourself lately with these dreams and visions...
No, they're memories from my previous life.
Honestly, I'm not losing my mind.
It all makes perfect sense now.
- That's why we found the bracelet?
- Exactly.
- I was its protector.
- Now do you believe, my friend?
Clearly, you were destined to protect this woman.
Right. She's a reincarnated princess, and I'm a warrior for God.
Your son leads the way to Ahm Shere.
Three sides of the pyramid.
This was all preordained thousands of years ago.
And how does the story end?
Only the journey's written, not the destination.
Convenient.
How else do you explain
Evy's visions?
That it is your son who wears the bracelet?
- How do you explain your mark?
- Coincidence.
My friend, there is a fine line between coincidence and fate.
Don't even think about it.
Hold on there, partner.
When the time comes...
I shall truly enjoy killing you.
But until that time... you'd better be a little nicer to me.
Now, where's my water?
No ice?
Make sure he doesn't move!
They've gone.
We've lost them.
Alex left us his tie... and he made us a little sand castle.
It's the Temple Island of Philae.
- They've gone to Philae.
- Attaboy, Alex. Come on!
The great temple of Abu Simbel.
That's the Blue Nile down there.
We must be out of Egypt by now.
In ancient times, all this still belonged to the upper kingdom.
The oasis must be around here somewhere.
Don't worry. We'll find him.
He's a smart kid.
He'll leave us a sign.
Surprised to see me?
Leaving bread crumbs, huh?
We're in trouble!
Horus, fly!
Izzy, come hard right!
Starboard! Starboard!
Was there a little something you forgot to mention?
People?
Ahm Shere.
Right.
He's back!
Hang on!
Well, that's not good.
Hang on!
Mom?
Dad?
We're gonna go get my son.
Then we're gonna want to get out of here fast, so make this work, Izzy.
You don't understand. This thing was filled with gas. Not hot air, gas.
I need gas to get this thing in the air.
Where am I gonna get gas around here?
Bananas? Mangoes?
Tarzan's ass?
Maybe I could finagle it to take hot air.
But do you know how many cubic meters
I'd need? It's too big!
If anybody can fill this thing up with hot air, Izzy, it's you.
Come to Daddy.
So, Rick, what's the plan?
Let's find some higher ground.
- I must go.
- Where?
To tell the commanders where we are.
- If the Army of Anubis arises...
- I need you to help me find my son.
Then first I shall help you.
Thank you.
Look. Roman legionnaires.
And here, turn-of-the-century French.
Napoleon's troops.
What in the name of Anubis did this?
- You hear that?
- What?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
My word!
I say, chaps, look at this.
Shrunken heads.
I'd love to know how they do that.
Just curious.
You any good with that?
Three times Fox and Hound's grand champion. You any good with that?
You'll know soon enough... because the only way to kill an Anubis warrior is by taking off its head.
I'll remember that.
Try to remember to... just keep it tight in the shoulder and... lead the target a little bit, and then... squeeze the trigger... don't pull it.
I won't miss.
Pyramid.
Cripes, I'm in trouble now.
Now may I kill him?
- Retrieve that bracelet.
- With pleasure.
Something is coming.
That's my husband and my son down there.
Make me proud.
Today's that day, Evy.
Where's the boy?
The Black Book!
Let's go!
There you are!
The time has come, my little friend.
Let go!
- Dad!
- Alex!
Time to remove that bracelet, my good son.
Behind you!
- Let's go.
- Thank God for that.
The two of you must sacrifice yourselves for me.
You shall be rewarded in heaven!
Nice shootin', Tex.
- What were those creepy pygmy things?
- Just the local natives.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. It was nothing.
Come on, Mom. Come on, Dad.
We have to get to the pyramid.
I have to get the bracelet off now!
Leave it on.
Looks good on you.
No, you guys, you don't understand.
It'll kill me if I don't get inside the pyramid before the sun hits it... today!
Oh, my God.
Time to go!
I thought you said it was nothing!
Where's Jonathan?
Look! There's a burial ground!
We're safe! We're safe!
They'll never cross those sacred stones!
- You are sure?
- Yes, of course I'm sure.
Sorry. My mistake.
- Wait for me!
- Hurry up, Jonathan!
Wait for me!
- What's that for?
- Just something in case of an emergency.
Let's go, Alex.
Run! Come on, Alex, faster!
Dad! The bracelet!
Come on! Come on!
You know... it's not easy being a dad.
Yeah, but you do it really good.
Thanks.
They made it.
Thank God.
Yes. Great.
Fabulous.
- She's going to be all right, isn't she?
- She'll be fine.
Take him.
Mommy's fine.
It's okay.
Your mother's going to be fine. Okay?
You're real strong.
You're gonna make it.
You're fine.
What do I do?
Take care of Alex.
Sweetheart, no.
I love you.
Come back, Evy.
Come back.
Stay here.
Try to think of it like this, Alex.
She's gone to a better place.
- Like it says in the good book.
- The book!
- What?
- That's it.
- That's it!
- That's what?
Come on, Uncle Jon!
That's it! The book!
You're too late, O'Connell.
I have released the Army of Anubis.
Lord Imhotep shall soon kill the Scorpion King... and take command.
Not after I get through with him.
You realize, of course, that this can only be done... by someone who can actually read ancient Egyptian.
I don't know about you, but I'm a tad rusty.
- Now where?
- We go right.
How do you know?
Basically,
"This way to the Scorpion King."
Mum taught me.
This just might work.
It's time someone taught you a lesson, wench. Come on.
This is for my sister.
Is that all you've got?
Hurry up, Alex!
Uncle Jon, I don't know what this last symbol is!
What's it look like?
It's a bird. A stork!
I know that one!
I know that one!
Then what is it?
That's it!
Why don't you pick on somebody your own size?
Oh, my God.
- Evy!
- Take Alex. Go and help Rick.
- But, Mom...
- No "buts."
Come on.
I'll be just fine.
- We did it, Uncle Jon!
- Right, partner.
Now let's go help your dad.
That's a little something new.
My lord!
Save me! Save me!
Okay, now I'm a believer.
It's a spear!
The golden stick thing!
It's a spear!
Really?
Doesn't look like a spear!
That's because it opens up into one!
Yes? And?
It opens up into a spear!
- Twist it!
- Push!
You have to pull!
Jonathan, quick!
Throw it!
Kill the Scorpion King!
Send his army back to the Underworld!
Step aside, Alex.
I'm a professional.
Go to hell, and take your friends with you!
Get out of here!
Just get out of here!
Hang on, Rick!
Let's go up!
This whole damn place is gonna get sucked up! Let's move up! Go!
Go, Alex!
Rick, we're trapped!
Get your butts moving! Hurry up!
I haven't got all day!
You're next! Go!
Jonathan! Hold on!
- Pull him up!
- Pull me up!
Wait! Wait!
Let me down! Let me down!
- It's not worth your life, you idiot!
- Yes, it is! Yes, it is!
Right.
Pull me up! Pull me up!
- O'Connell, you almost got me killed!
- At least you didn't get shot.
Thank you! Thank you!
O'Connell, who the hell have you been messing with this time, huh?
You know, the usual.
Mummies, pygmies... big bugs.
I thought
I almost lost you there.
For a moment there, you did.
Would you like to know what heaven looks like?
Later.
- Oh, please!
- Oh, please!
- That's half mine, you know.
- What?
- That's half mine.
- What are you talking about?
You took my gold stick!
I swear on the head of my wife, I have no idea what you're talking about.
You ain't got a wife!
I don't have your gold stick either!
I was dreamin'.
Dreamin' my dick was out and I was checking to see if that infected bump on the head of it had filled with pus again.
If it had, I was gonna name that bump after my ex-wife Priscilla and bust it by jackin' off.
Oh, man.
Or I'd like to think that's what I'd do.
Dreams let you think like that.
Truth was, I hadn't had a hard-on in years.
Oh, man.
My God, man.
How long have I been here?
Am I really awake now, or am I just dreamin' I'm awake?
How could my plans have gone so wrong?
When the hell are they gonna serve lunch?
Considerin' what they serve, why the hell do I care?
If Priscilla discovered I was alive, would she come and see me?
Would we still wanna fuck?
Or would we merely have to talk about it?
Is there, finally and really, anything to life other than food, shit, and sex?
Well, goddamnit.
How could I have gone from the "King of rock and roll"to this?
Old guy in a rest home in East Texas with a growth on his pecker.
And what is that growth, man?
Cancer? Nobody's talkin'.
No one seems to know... or wants to.
Makes you wonder, doesn't it, what kind of life this old guy had?
What kind of life he had, you know.
His kids, his grandkids, his legacy.
Look at him now.
Oh, who gives a shit?
Well...
Make you comfortable.
No.
I'm gonna squish you, cockroach!
Help me.
You know, I was thinkin'...
What? You gonna get all weepy on me again?
No. I was merely gonna suggest that you use some of this here deodorizer and spray it on that corpse because she's smellin' pretty ripe.
Good idea.
Excuse me, miss?
You gonna throw all that stuff out?
Yeah.
Could I have one of them pictures of Bull?
Maybe his... his Purple Heart?
I mean, he was pretty proud of that.
And maybe that... that tin of chocolates there?
I suppose.
The revealin' of her panties wasn't intentional or unintentional.
She just didn't give a damn.
She saw me as so physically and sexually non-threatenin', she didn't mind if I got a bird's-eye view of her love nest.
It was the same to her as a house cat sneakin' a peek.
I felt my pecker flutter once like a pigeon havin' a heart attack... then it laid back down and remained limp and still.
'Course, these days, even a flutter was kind of reassurin'.
- Here.
- Thank you.
Say...
Bull your kin?
My daddy.
Never seen you here before.
I've only been here once before.
When I checked him in.
That's three years ago, wasn't it?
You and him friends?
No, we just roommates. I mean, he never felt good enough to say much.
I just hated to see what was left of him go away so easy.
Seemed like an all right guy.
Mentioned you a lot.
You're... you're Callie, right?
Yeah.
Well... he was all right.
But not enough so you'd come and see him, though.
Don't lay some guilt trip on me, mister.
I did what I could.
I mean, if it hadn't been for Medicaid or Medicare... whatever that stuff was... he'd have been in some ditch somewhere.
And I sure didn't have the money to take care of him.
My own daughter...
Lost long ago to me... if she knew I lived, would she come and see me?
Would she even care?
You could've come and seen him.
They don't charge you for that.
Mind your own business.
I was busy.
Well, well, well.
If it isn't my favorite patient.
How are you this morning, Mr. Haff?
I'm all right.
But I prefer Mr. Presley or Elvis.
I keep tellin' you that.
I don't go by
Sebastian Haff anymore, okay?
I'm not tryin' to hide anymore.
Well, of course I knew that.
I forgot.
Good morning, Elvis.
Did you know we have a celebrity here, Miss Thomas?
Elvis Presley. You know, the rock and roll singer.
I thought he was dead.
Well, actually, Elvis is dead.
Mr. Haff knows that. Don't you, Mr. Haff?
Hell, no. I'm right here.
I ain't dead.
Yet.
Now, Mr. Haff!
I don't mind calling you "Elvis."
But you're a little confused and you like to play sometimes.
You were an
Elvis impersonator, remember?
You fell off the stage and broke your hip... when was it?
Twenty years ago.
It got infected and you were in a coma for quite a while.
You came out with a few... problems.
Look, I was just impersonatin' myself.
I couldn't do nothin' else.
I don't have any problems.
You're tryin' to say my brain's messed up, aren't you?
Why would you wanna be somebody else?
I got tired of it.
I was hooked on pills, you know.
I wanted out.
And this boy Sebastian Haff... he was an Elvis imitator.
He was the best of 'em.
He took my place.
Problem is, he had a bad heart.
He liked drugs, too.
Liked them more than I did.
So it was him that died, not me.
I just took his place.
But why would you want to leave all that fame, Mr. Presley?
All that money?
I don't know.
'Cause they got old.
The woman I loved... Priscilla... she was gone.
The rest of the women... were just women.
I mean, the music wasn't mine anymore.
I wasn't even me anymore.
Just this thing they made up.
And my friends...
Well, they were suckin' me dry.
So I took a little road trip down to Nacogdoches... to check out this Sebastian Haff.
It's all right, boys.
Just wait here.
Oh, my God.
I didn't think you'd really...
It's all right, boys.
Just another freak.
Let's split.
- Sorry, man.
- King, I got it. I got it.
It's all yours, baby.
So I signed everything over to Sebastian.
Except for enough money to sustain me if things got bad.
I was determined to make myself a new life.
A better one.
But me and Sebastian, we had us a deal.
If I wanted to trade back, he'd let me.
It was all written up in the contract.
The thing was...
I lost my copy in a barbeque accident.
But that wasn't so bad, either.
I was makin' new friends and enjoyin' myself.
Cheers!
Oh, my God.
Did you see that thing?
It just went up like that.
- Now, Elvis.
- Yes?
Don't carry it too far.
You may just get way out there and not come back.
Oh, fuck you.
Shit.
Get old, you can't even cuss someone and have it bother 'em.
Everything you do is either worthless or sadly amusing.
Well...
I've got what I want.
The clothes can go to Goodwill or Salvation Army.
Very well. And I'm sorry about your father. He was a nice man.
Yeah.
It was nice to meet you, Mr. Presley.
- Get the hell out.
- Now, now.
I'll be back later to do that little... thing that has to be done. You know.
Elvis!
Poor Bull.
In the end... does anything really matter?
No one here ever listened to me.
Except this one guy... only, he was certifiable.
That's where they took a piece of my brain.
They got it back in D.C. in that goddamn jar.
I got a little bag of sand up there now.
Jack... no offense, but...
President Kennedy was a white man.
That's how clever they are!
They dyed me this color.
All over!
Can you think of a better way to hide the truth than that?
I was livin' simple.
The way Haff had been.
Going from town to town doin' the Elvis act.
Only, I felt like I was really me again.
Can you dig that?
We're diggin' it, Mr. Haff...
Mr. Presley.
Women were throwin' themselves at me
'cause they could imagine I was Elvis.
Only, I was Elvis playing
Sebastian Haff playing Elvis.
It was all pretty good.
I didn't mind the contract being burned up.
Didn't even try to go back and convince anybody.
Then I had the accident.
I was gyratin', see, takin' care business, and then my hip went out.
I'd been havin' trouble with it.
Damn. It's cold in here tonight.
No way. That's it.
This time, I make it.
No more piss or crap in the bed.
Shake it out...
There we go.
Man... that is one big bitch cockroach.
All right, man. Let's go.
Damn.
Hot damn!
Got you, you six-legged bastard.
Even a big bitch cockroach like you should know...
Never... but never fuck with the King.
Hey! Is anybody out here?
I think we got some major bug problems in this place, man!
Oh, man...
Hey, Jack?
Hey, man, you okay?
What the Sam Hill is that?
Mr. Kennedy?
Hey, man... you're on the floor.
No shit.
Who are you?
Look, I'm...
Sebastian. Sebastian Haff.
Did you see him go by in the hall?
He scuttled like.
- Who, man?
- The one they sent.
- Who's "they"?
- Oh, you know who.
No, Jack, I don't.
Come on, man.
Lyndon Johnson.
Castro, maybe.
They sent somebody to finish me off.
I think maybe it was Johnson himself.
Real ugly.
Real goddamn ugly!
Look, man,
President Johnson's dead.
Shit. That ain't gonna stop him.
Get his feet.
So, you say you heard a... a noise?
Well, a sound's a sound, you know?
I mean, I heard something.
It was like a... I don't know.
Like a... like a scuttling.
- A scuttling sound?
- Yes, sir.
Were you awake or were you in bed when you heard this noise?
I was in bed first, then I was awake
'cause the damn bugs woke me up.
You got bugs all over this place.
Bugs... well, Mr. Haff, what kind of bugs have you been seeing?
Look, do I look like an ichthyologist to you?
Big damn bugs, all right?
The size of my fist. The size of a peanut butter and banana sandwich.
What do I care?
I got a growth on my pecker.
Okay, Mr. Haff.
Don't worry about a thing.
We'll call the exterminator tomorrow and we'll take care of the problem.
Good. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's time for that little thing again.
A doll like this handlin' me without warmth or emotion...
Twenty years ago.
Just twenty, man.
I could've made with the curly-lip smile and had her eatin' out of my asshole.
Doctor says this cream ought to do the trick.
Corticosteroids.
Should heal the inflammation, stop the pus.
Where'd my youth go?
Why didn't fame hold off old age and death?
Why the hell did I leave the fame in the first place?
Do I want it back?
Could I have it back?
And if I could... would it make any damn difference?
Mr. Haff!
Lord almighty.
You old rascal.
I think you better take a cold shower, Mr. Haff.
There'd been two presidential elections since I had a boner like that one.
What gave here?
Then I realized what gave.
I was thinkin' about something that interested me.
Not my next meal or goin' to the crapper.
I'd been given a dose of life again.
You get in there with me,
I'll take that shower.
You silly thing.
Come on, now.
Why don't you pull on it a little?
You ought to be ashamed.
Where at? Where at?
I haven't seen my kids.
It's an ambush!
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.
It's an ambush!
Tonto, my boots, Tonto!
That's my friend Kemosabe.
We used to play cards together.
- My boots!
- Now he doesn't even know who I am.
Daddy.
Baby?
Sebastian. Sebastian! It's loose!
What's loose?
It. Listen.
Jesus Christ. What's that?
I thought it was Lyndon Johnson, but I was wrong.
I've come across new evidence to suggest another assassin.
Assassin?
He's after another target tonight.
Come on, I wanna show you something.
I don't think it's safe if you go back to sleeping.
For chrissake, man.
Just tell the administrators.
Suits and white starches?
No, thank you!
I trusted them when I was back in Dallas, and look where they got my brain and me.
I'm thinkin' with sand here.
I mean, I pick up some waves, maybe, from my brain, but someday, who knows.
Somebody might just disconnect the battery at the White House.
Oh, yeah. That's something to worry about, all right.
Listen here. Listen.
I know you're Elvis.
There was a rumor, you know, that you hated me.
But I thought about that.
If you hated me, you could've finished me off the other night.
What I want from you is that you look me straight in the eye and assure me you had nothing at all to do with that day in Dallas, and that you did not know
Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby.
Look, man...
I had nothing to do with Dallas.
And I knew neither
Lee Harvey Oswald nor Jack Ruby.
Good. May I call you Elvis instead of Sebastian?
You may.
Excellent.
You wear glasses to read?
Well, I wear glasses when I really want to see.
Get them. Come on.
Come on.
Right down the hall.
The walker was swingin' along easier now.
Not even like I needed it.
Damn, this here Jack was a nut.
Maybe I was nuts, too... but there was an adventure goin' on.
It's in here.
In here.
That's it?
We're investigating a scuttling in the hall, trying to figure out who attacked you, and you bring me here to look at stick pictures on the shit house wall?
Look close.
It's Egyptian.
Right-a-reen-o.
Hey, you're not as stupid as some folks made you out.
- Thank you.
- Now, I copied this down yesterday.
I came in here to take a shit because they hadn't cleaned up my bathroom.
Saw that on the wall, took it back to my room, looked it up in my books, and I wrote it all down.
Now, this top line translates roughly into,
"Pharaoh gobbles donkey goobers."
And the bottom line,
"Cleopatra does the nasty."
Say what?
Well, pretty much.
That's the best I can translate it.
All right, so, one of the nuts in here... present company excluded... thinks he's Tutankhamen, comes in here, writes hieroglyphics.
Big deal! What's the connection?
Why are we standin' here in the toilet?
Well, I don't know what the connection is, exactly... not yet.
But that thing caught me asleep last night.
And I came awake just in time.
He had me on the floor.
I had his mouth over my asshole.
A shit-eater?
I don't think so.
He was after my soul.
Now, you can get that out of any major orifice of a person's body.
I read about it.
Yeah? Where, man? Hustler?
The Everyday Man Or Woman's
Book of the Soul by David Webb.
And they got pretty good movie reviews in there about stolen soul movies in the back.
Come on. I'll show you.
I think that there might be some sort of electrical problem in the gardener's shed.
That light... looks like it's shortin' out.
This whole damn place is fallin' apart.
But you don't have to think about that.
Mrs. Biddlestein is waitin' on her enema.
All right. All right. I'm comin'.
Just let me finish my cigarette, first.
God.
Here's an ugly son of a bitch.
Damn! Hey, Jack.
What it says here is that you can bury some dude, and if he gets the right tanna leaves and spells said over him and such bullshit, that he can come back to life thousands of years later, man.
But hold on, now.
To stay alive, he has to suck on the souls of the livin', and that if the souls are small, his life force doesn't last long.
Small.
What's that mean?
Read on.
No, never mind.
I'll tell you myself.
But first, would you like a Ding Dong?
I don't mean mine.
I mean a chocolate Ding Dong.
Of course, mine would be chocolate now that I have been dyed.
You got Ding Dongs, man?
I got Paydays and I got a box of Baby Ruths.
Oh, mama!
Which will it be?
Let's get decadent.
I'll take a Baby Ruth.
All right.
Now... small souls... are those that don't have much fire for life.
You know a place like that?
Man, if souls were fires, they couldn't burn much lower than in here.
Exactamundo.
What we have here at Shady Rest is an Egyptian soul sucker of some sort.
You know, a mummy hiding out.
Coming in here, feeding on the sleeping.
It's perfect, you see?
We're small souls, so we can't provide him much.
But if that thing comes back two or three times in a row and wraps his lips around some elder's asshole, that elder is going to die pretty soon.
And who would be the wiser?
Asshole.
A mummy can't be getting too much energy from all this... not like with big souls... but the prey is easy.
With new people comin' all the time, he can keep this up forever... this soul robbin'.
That's what they brought us here for... to get us out of the way until we die.
And those who don't die first from disease or just plain being old, he gets.
Look, that's all well and good, Jack, but there's one thing that still throws me.
How does an ancient Egyptian wind up in an East Texas rest home, and why is he writin' on the shit house walls, man?
Well, he went in to take a crap, got bored, started writing on the walls.
He probably wrote on pyramid walls centuries ago.
Come on. What would he crap?
It's not like he'd eat.
Well, he eats souls.
So, I assume that he would crap soul residue.
By that, I would mean that if you die from his mouth, you don't go to the other side where the souls go.
He digests souls until they don't exist anymore.
And you're just so much toilet water decoration.
And speaking of toilets...
This is how I figured that whole thing out.
He's just like anybody else when it comes to taking a dump.
He wants a nice, clean place with a flush.
They didn't have that in his time.
No, no.
Don't go out in the hall.
- That's all right. I'm not asleep.
- That don't mean he won't hurt you.
"He" my ass. There isn't any mummy from Egypt.
Nice knowin' you, Elvis.
Asshole.
Kemosabe was dead of a ruptured heart before he hit the floor.
Gone down and out with both guns blazing.
Soul intact.
Once again, we got scolded.
This time, we got quizzed about what had happened to Kemosabe, but neither of us told the truth.
I mean, who was gonna believe a couple of nuts?
Elvis and Jack Kennedy explaining that Kemosabe was gunning for a mummy in cowboy duds?
Some kind of Bubba Ho-Tep?
So, what we did was... we lied.
Life sure is fleetin', you know?
- What?
- Life. I'm saying it's fleetin'.
One minute you're here, and the next minute you're gone...
Shit! Shit! Come on!
Come on. Move it!
Come on. Get it!
Nonchalant. Nonchalant.
Nonchalant.
Get it in there.
You are one fuckin' idiot.
Mr. Haff?
Mr. Presley?
Now, now, Mr. Presley.
You are looking much stronger, but you shouldn't be out here too long.
It's time for your nap.
And it's also time for us to do that little... you know.
You fuck off, you patronizing bitch!
I'm sick of your shit! I'll lube my own crankshaft from now on.
You treat me like a baby again,
I'll wrap this goddamn walker right around your head!
How in the hell did that mummy do that?
Well... what the hell.
Where did old Bubba Ho-Tep go?
Where did he come from?
How the hell did he get here?
Wait a minute.
Under the bridge.
I saw him under the bridge.
Come on, mama.
It's a cancer.
They're keepin' it from me 'cause I'm old, and to them, it don't matter.
They think age will kill me first, and they're probably right.
Well, suck them!
I know what it is, and if it isn't... it might as well be.
Station KROP is proud to present the Elvis Presley movie marathon.
It's 24 hours of Elvis in the roles he made famous.
Watch that two-fisted Hound Dog out-strum, outrace, out-fight, and outwit the bad guys.
And at the same time, watch the King slay the girls.
Shitty pictures, man.
Every single one.
Here I was complainin' about loss of pride and how life had treated me, and now I realized...
I never had any pride.
And much of how life had treated me had been good.
The bulk of the bad was my own damn fault.
Should've fired Colonel Parker by the time I got in the pictures.
Old fart had been a shark and a fool, and I was an even bigger fool for following him.
If only I'd treated Priscilla right.
If I could've told my daughter I loved her.
Always the questions.
Never the answers.
Always the hopes... never the fulfillments.
I had the woman who calls herself my niece come get me.
She took me downtown this morning to the newspaper morgue.
She's been helping me to do some research.
- Research on what, man?
- On our mummy.
You know somethin' about him?
I know plenty.
Now, one of the lesser mummies, on loan from the Egyptian government, was being circulated all over the United States.
You know, museums, stuff like that.
What do you mean?
Like King Tut or whatever?
No, more like King Tut's brother.
His mummy was flown or carried by the train from state to state.
When it got to Texas, it was stolen.
Stolen?
Evidence points to it being stolen at night by a couple of guys in a silver bus.
Bus? Hey, I've seen that!
Anyway, the thieves broke into the museum, stole it in hopes of a ransom, when in comes the worst storm in East Texas history.
Let me guess.
The bus was washed away, see?
'Cause I think I saw it today.
It was way back in the creek.
The mummy was imprisoned by the debris.
Look here... how'd it come back to life?
And how did I end up inside its memories?
Speculation broadens here, but from what I've read, some mummies get buried without their names... a curse put on their sarcophagus.
Hey, now, maybe our boy's one of them.
I mean, when he's in the coffin, he's just a dried-up old corpse, but when the bus got washed away, maybe it overturned or broke open, and now he's free of coffin and curse.
He's free from imprisonment, but he still needs souls.
Now he's free to have them.
He can just keep on feedin' unless he's finally destroyed.
So, what do we do, Jack?
Changing rest homes might be a good idea.
I can't think of much else.
But I will say this...
Our mummy is a nighttime kind of guy.
So, I'm gonna go and sleep now.
I'll set my alarm for just before dark, then I can get myself a couple of cups of coffee.
Damn straight.
If he comes in here tonight, I don't want him slappin' his lips on my asshole.
Yes. Consider it.
He's got the proverbial bird's nest on the ground here.
What do I really have left in life but this place?
It ain't much of a home... but it's all I got.
Well, goddamnit.
I'll be damned if I let some foreign, graffiti-writin', soul-suckin', son of a bitch in an oversized cowboy hat and boots take my friends' souls and shit 'em down the visitors toilet!
In the movies,
I always played heroic types.
But when the stage lights went out, it was time for drugs and stupidity and the coveting of women.
Now it's time.
Time to be a little of what I had always fantasized bein'... a hero.
Hello?
Mr. Kennedy?
Ask not what your rest home can do for you.
Ask what you can do for your rest home.
Hey, you're copying my best lines.
Then let me paraphrase one of my own.
Let's take care of business.
Just what are you getting at, Elvis?
I think you know what I'm gettin' at, Mr. President.
We're gonna kill us a mummy.
Two bottles of rubbing alcohol.
Check.
Don't even have to toss 'em.
Look here.
Found this in the storage room.
I thought they kept it locked.
They do. I stole a hairpin and picked the lock, baby.
Great.
Matches.
Check. Even scrounged up a cigarette lighter.
Good. Uniform.
Big check on that, baby.
Well, I got a nice pair of shoes to go with this.
Check.
Scissors.
Check.
All right.
Now, I got my chair oiled and ready to roll.
That's good, man.
We could use some wheels.
And I picked some words of power from my book of magic.
I don't know if they'll stop a mummy, but they're supposed to ward off evil.
I wrote them down.
One for each of us.
Well, we'll use what we got, baby.
All right, 2:45 a.m., we hook up right back here.
No, at the rate we travel, maybe we ought to start at 2:30.
Say, Jack?
Do we know what the hell we're doin', man?
No. But they say that fire cleanses evil.
Let's just hope that they... whoever they are... is right.
Check on that, too.
All right, synchronize watches.
And... mark.
Now, the two key words for tonight are "caution" and "flammable."
And also...
"watch your ass."
What's that you got hanging around your neck?
That's my medicine bag.
Indians used to wear 'em into battle.
Full of all kinds of lucky stuff.
See here?
Mucho mojo.
That's my daughter.
I know.
We weren't there for our kids when they needed us, were we?
Man, if I could just talk to her again... tell her I love her... try and make things right somehow.
No time for regrets, Elvis.
We were the best fathers we could be under the circumstances.
Yeah, I guess, no time for regrets.
We got business to take care of.
Look here.
Top it off with this.
I stole it from the gardener when he wasn't lookin'.
It's gonna be one hell of a barbeque.
Let's do it, amigo.
Hey, Jack?
I just got one last question.
Marilyn.
Come on, man.
Marilyn Monroe?
What was she like in the sack?
That is classified information.
Top secret!
But between you and me...
Wow!
You old dog.
Watch your back, Jack.
Gotta hump it.
Shit... when Bubba Ho-Tep comes out of that creek bed, he's gonna come out hungry and pissed.
When I try and stop him, he's gonna jam this paint can up my ass and jam me and that wheelchair up Jack's ass.
Shit.
Hey, Jack.
Don't make me use my stuff on you, baby.
Damn!
Where did he go to?
Hey! You stay put!
I'll flush him out!
You be careful, man.
No, Jack!
Oh, man.
Come and get it, you undead sack of shit.
Sorry, man.
Mr. Kennedy?
The President is soon dead.
So, now... it's up to you, Elvis.
You got to get him.
You... got to... take care of business.
That's right, man.
T.C. B...
It's just you and me.
Mr. President.
"You nasty thing from beyond the dead...
"No matter what you think or do, good things will never come to you.
"And if evil is your black design,
"you can bet the goodness of the Light Ones... will kick your bad behind"?
For chrissake...
That's it?
That's the chant against evil from the Book Of Souls?
Yeah, right, boss.
And what kind of decoder ring comes with that, man?
Shit, it doesn't even rhyme well!
This is dog shit.
It's time for A-C-T-l-O-N.
Come on, baby.
Here we go.
I was goin' out.
And if I did, not only would I be one dead son of a bitch, but so would my soul.
I'd be just so much crap.
No afterlife, no reincarnation, no angels with harps.
Whatever lay beyond would not be known to me.
It would all end right here for Elvis Aaron Presley.
Nothin' left but a quick flush.
T.C.B., baby.
Your soul-suckin' days are over, amigo.
I felt somethin' inside gratin' against somethin' soft.
I felt like a water balloon with a hole poked in it.
I was goin' down for the last count.
And I knew it.
But I still have my soul.
It's still mine.
All mine.
And the folks up there at Shady Rest... they have theirs, too.
And they're gonna keep 'em.
Every single one.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

There are many Pokemon in the world that nobody's seen yet, and are known only from legends.
This book has many such Pokemon, drawn from the author's imagination.
The one you're searching for is this one, right?
Yes. Papa's been always looking for the mysterious Pokemon, "Unknown".
I...
I like this one here.
The Pokemon of Illusion, Entei.
Me's favourite.
Entei's strong and kind, just like you, Papa.
Papa's like Entei, huh?
I hope so.
All right! Papa's Entei!
It's Entei!
All right, let's go!
A mail?
It's probably for you.
You should hurry and look at it.
This is John.
Boss, we found clues relating to Unknown in the ruins.
Please come as soon as possible.
Clues relating to Unknown?
I figured you'd have to go to work.
Sorry, Me.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Papa...
Good night, Me...
It's here, Dr. Sully.
This writing's unlike anything we've seen before, but it's safe to assume it's about Unknown.
Incredible.
You're likely the only one who can make any sense of this.
What's...
The Unknown...
Boss?
Boss?
Dr. Sully?
Doctor!
The young miss is truly alone now...
Are you back, Papa?
Me-chan...
Young miss...
Papa...
Did you send me mail?
Unknown?
Papa...
Are these for me?
I feel lonely, Papa...
Unknown...
Wanna play with me?
What's...
- Young miss!
- Those are Unknown!
Hey!
Papa...
Papa... come back...
Were you the one who called me?
Entei?
I am... Entei.
Papa... You're Papa, right?
You became an Entei and came back, Papa!
Papa...
I am Papa...
If that is your wish.
Away from his home in Masara Town,
Satoshi and his friends aim to enter the Johto League.
Their journey continues today.
You're a Pokemon Trainer, right?
Yeah. I'm Satoshi, from Masara Town.
I want to be a Pokemon Master.
I'm Takeshi, miss.
What's your name?
I'm Lynn.
Well? Want to battle?
Well?
What are you gonna do, Satoshi?
Obviously, it's common courtesy to accept a battle!
Thanks.
Show me your power as a Trainer!
OK!
Let's battle!
OK!
OK! Let's move on!
OK!
Together, we'll be all right!
OK!
Though the wind's changing
OK!
That dream won't!
Up 'til now, we've been going on in a daze and although we hadn't noticed
The key to the door leading to the new world is in getting something unknown
Golden Smile and Silver Tears
Delight and frustration are always changing faces and making everyone stronger!
OK!
Follow mel!
OK! If we cry out in triumph, we can't lose!
OK! Even if we break through the wall
OK!
This journey won't end!
Though I'd begun to give up there was no reason to do so
The morning sun burns brightly on my journey and asks me
"that much is fine, right?"
Golden Sun and Silver Moon
The sun and moon are always changing faces and protecting everyone!
Therefore...
OK!
Swallow your fear!
OK!
A prideful move, "Bravado!"
OK! Though I don't know their names or voices
They're waiting for me!
I'll face them some clay!
Let's go!
OK!
Open the next door!
OK!
A prideful move, "Recklessness!"
OK!
We cry and laugh together
My friends are fine!
I believe in my friends!
OK!
You guys are pretty strong.
We've gotta train more.
No, we had some trouble too.
This was your 5th fight this week.
Aren't you tired?
Yeah...
Lynn-san, would you happen to know where the nearest Pokemon Center is?
There's one just past this forest, in Greenfield.
By "Greenfield", you mean...
The place known as the number one vacation spot for girls in Johto?
Bingo!
I'm going there too.
Greenfield...
A green field of peace.
The wind that blows through it can calm the hearts of both people and Pokemon.
I want to go there at least once!
The number one vacation spot for women.
Lots of girls...
Greenfield"s just past that hill.
It's a good thing we chased Pikachu all the way here.
We reached the sought-after Greenfield, but... what's this?
Green?
More like light.
So is this some sort of treasure?
Pearls before swine.
Or somethin' like that...
- That's right!
- Sonansu!
You came out on your own again?
Get back in there.
Junsa-san...
- Ready?
- OK.
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.
Greenfield, a town known for its lush green, has been turned into a deep and dark atmosphere, which not even 100 soldiers can penetrate.
We believe this may be related to the disappearance of Prof. Sully Snowdon, but we cannot confirm it.
Sully Snowdon?
Dr. Sully was known throughout the world for his research on legendary Pokemon.
Wasn't Dr. Sully one of your students, Dr. Okido?
He was indeed a splendid student.
On that note,
I was sent his article in a mail...
- Those are...
- Unknown.
Unknown?
Dr. Okido, have you seen what's on TV?
Just saw it. I was just about to go over to the scene.
I'll go too!
You knew Sully-kun too, didn't you?
His daughter's still very little, so I'm worried.
Got it.
Go get ready to leave.
Yes.
Those taking action have just arrived at the Greenfield Pokemon Center.
We've been waiting for you, Dr. Okido.
Doc...
Oh, Pikachu!
- Mom!
- Oh, Satoshi.
- What? You guys are here, too?
- It's been a while, Dr. Okido.
I figured you'd come.
- I see you've been doing well, Satoshi.
- You too, mom.
Papa...
I want a Mama, too...
If that's what you wish, Me.
Long ago, Dr. Sully used to study under Dr. Okido.
Didn't you say he used to help you with your homework?
Yeah.
He visited Masara Town a few times since...
I see, it was him back then.
That's Dr. Sully's house.
I'm really worried.
Geez...
What's wrong, Pikachu?
What?
A Pokemon?
It's the first time I've seen one of these.
Who are you?
Mama...
You are... Mama.
You are Mama!
I am... Mama...
I am... Mama.
Hey, wait!
Mom, Pikachu!
Get lost!
Pikachu, you all right?
Don't go, Satoshi!
You don't know what's in there!
Why? Why mom?
I brought her...
The one you wished.
Mama...
Mama!
I am... Mama...
Mama, it's me, Me.
Me...
Mama...
Now I can be with Papa and Mama forever.
Yes.
If that is what you wish.
Your world keeps growing.
It's pretty...
If you're happy, then I'm happy.
The Pokemon that kidnapped Satoshi's mom?
That's Entei.
Entei?
It's known only from legends.
There's one more thing about this case.
Another mysterious Pokemon.
You mean Unknown, right?
Then one you've been researching.
Unknown is within these ruins...
I see...
It's as I thought.
Eyewitnesses on Greenfield, the source of the crystalisation, state that the legendary Pokemon
Entei has kidnapped a woman.
- Mama! Wait!
- However, details are still unknown for now.
We are broadcasting live as a bulldozer is being called to break through the crystals!
You can't!
Don't destroy it!
Dr. Sully's disappearance, this mysterious crystalisation. Even Entei's appearance.
All of this was caused by the Unknown.
There doesn't seem to be any other possibility.
A mail?
Papa and Mama came back to me.
I'm happy.
I want things to stay as they are!
Nobody come in!
Me-chan...
She must be safe, since she could send me a mail...
But it's odd.
Isn't her dad missing?
Yeah.
And by "Mama... "
It's puzzling.
Your back's so big, Papal
- Having fun?
- Yeah.
I can't wait for them to solve the puzzle!
Will you come with me, Pikachu?
Wait, Satoshi!
I'll go, too!
Don't leave me behind!
Kasumi, Takeshi...
What...?
Satoshi-kun, take that Pokegear with you.
Lynn-san...
You might as well have a way to communicate with the Pokemon Center, right?
I'll tell Dr. Okido about it for you.
Thanks.
Water doesn't seem to crystalise...
Yeah, so if we follow the river, we should reach the Snowdon home.
Those guys never give up.
Aiming for outer space, we're Team Rocket!
Going from above is better than from below.
And our goal is the castle's treasure!
This rocks!
What?
- Isn't that the thing we saw on TV?
- Entei, right?
This suc...
Isn't it cruel to dump us like this so suddenly?
Well, we managed to get in...
But what is this place?
There doesn't seem to be any treasure here.
Besides, you'd keep a treasure with you constantly.
- Then the treasure's in that tower?
- But how would we get there?
We have to go down, then back up...
Going down and up again...
- Isn't there an elevator?
- Of course there ain't one.
Who was that?
Nobody.
We're the only ones here.
We can see our house in there, Mama!
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes...
Something resembling a flame was just spotted above the Snowdon home, but we can't confirm it.
The rescue squad's set to arrive tomorrow morning, but...
Hm?
Is that a... Pokemon?
All right, Fushigidane and Chicorita.
Use Vine Whip!
Togepy, stay still for a while, okay?
Satoshi?
What do you think you're doing?
Um, actually...
It looks like someone's trying to get in our home...
Satoshi...
- That's too dangerous!
- What is, mama?
Nothing...
The thing on his back is a Pikachu, right?
Ah! He has a Fushigidane and a Chicorita, too!
Is he a Pokemon Trainer, Mama?
Yeah...
Maybe he has other Pokemon, too!
Right, Papa?
Papa?
Good work, guys.
Thanks to you too,
Fushigidane and Chicorita.
You really came through for us!
Are you guys all right?
Lynn-san?
Satoshi, you were just on TV!
Sorry, Dr. Okido.
But I...
I'm not going to tell you to come back when you're already there.
Just save your mom and hurry back!
Right.
Satoshi-kun, this is John.
Did you see any Unknown?
- Not yet.
- I see.
According to Dr. Sully's research,
Unknown can sense the feelings of others.
What do you mean?
They can sense the feelings in the hearts of humans, and turn them into reality.
The feelings in the hearts...?
The Unknown are reacting to what they're feeling from Me-chan's heart.
I'm sure that crystal tower was created from the Unknown reacting to her heart!
Hinoarashi, Flamethrower!
All right!
One more time, Flamethrower!
- Good job, Rokon!
- All right, let's swap fighters!
Water Gun!
All right. Now, Pikachu.
Let's go, guys.
Hitodeman, good work!
Great job, Waninoko.
What?
Is this the power of the Unknown?
The one that Dr. Okido warned us about?
Probably.
Either way, we've got to keep moving!
What's going on?
It's the world that the Unknown created from Me-chan's heart!
This is...
Ouch, oww!
And here I thought we'd finally reached the bottom...
Are these Pokemon?
I dunno, but we're better off not goin' near things we know nothin' about!
Well, yeah, but we have to go through here to reach the other tower!
Then we'll just have to sneak by!
- Quietly...
- Quiet steps...
- Stealthy steps...
- Soft steps...
- Quiet steps...
- Stealthy steps...
Looks like the guy from before and his friends got inside the house.
Should I kick them out?
I want to face them in a Pokemon battle!
- But can I do it?
- You can.
If that is what you wish.
That's right! I can do it!
I'm still little, but...
When I grow up...
I can do it, right?
This is the first time
I've been in a Pokemon battle!
You can do it, Me.
I can do it, right?
Entei?
You're Pokemon Trainers, right?
What about it?
Want to battle?
I don't know who you are, but I don't have the time right now.
You're so boring.
Hey, Entei!
Where'd you take my mom?
Only me and my parents are here!
- That's right.
- What?
Satoshi...
Your name is Me, right?
Oh, you know who I am?
Me-chan's supposedly much smaller than that!
This is Me-chan's world, as created by the power of the Unknown.
That girl can make anything.
And she can be anything!
No way...
Are we gonna battle or not?
All right!
- I'll be your opponent, miss!
- All right.
Takeshi?
Entei came from up there.
So your mom should be there, too.
Let's go, Satoshi.
Finding your mom's our first priority!
Let's go, Pikachu!
We'll use three Pokemon.
You're free to switch out at any time.
Understood.
Go, Zubat!
I'm counting on you.
Mokoko, go!
Zubat, use Supersonic!
It's working!
Zubat, Wing Attack!
Here it comes!
Dodge it!
Good job! Here it comes again, use Headbutt!
Now! ThunderShock!
Return, Zubat!
You did your best...
We did it!
That was amazing, Mokoko!
The match just started.
Go, Rokon!
Then here.
How about this one?
A Himeguma, huh?
A cute Pokemon for a cute lady.
It's not just cute.
DynamicPunch
Himeguma, Explosive Punch!
Quick Attack
Rokon, Lightspeed Strike!
Himeguma, Fury Swipes!
Pokemon created from Me-chan's heart...
They're not just for show... they're strong!
Soft steps, quiet steps...
Is there really a treasure in a place like this?
What are you on about?
We can't go back empty-handed now!
Return, Rokon!
- You're pretty strong!
- You too.
But I'm training to become the world's #1 Pokemon Breeder!
A Trainer needs to raise his Pokemon well.
Good point.
You're right!
Yeah, that smile!
That's a nice smile!
You're a strange one.
Gomazo, Rollout attack!
Just because it's small doesn't mean you should let your guard down!
Is this picture book yours?
Yeah.
- Papa read it to me all the time...
- I see...
You can have it if you want, Mama...
Me-chan, have you always been alone?
Did you feel lonely?
A little...
But it's all right now.
Mama and Papa are here...
So, who's gonna battle me now?
Then, Takeshi...
Me will never lose.
Is Entei an illusion too?
- I want to battle a stronger Trainer.
- What?
- Leave this to me, Satoshi.
- And you are?
The world's most beautiful girl, Kasumi!
At one point,
I was to be Hanada Gym's Leader!
- You're a Gym Leader?
- Don't look down on me.
You don't have to be an adult to be a Gym Leader?
You can do it.
You can do anything.
That girl's real body is probably with your mom!
Hurry up to where she is!
I'm from Hanada Gym, so I'll be using Water-types!
Then I'll use
Water-type Pokemon, too.
I see.
You can do anything here, huh?
Let's battle!
Here I go!
Kingdra, please!
Go, My Steady!
All right!
Use Headbutt now!
Tosakinto, Fury Attack!
Tosakinto, you did your best...
We did it, we did it!
This one's next.
Not bad.
This makes no sense.
Don't think about boring logic, just act!
Aimin' for outer space, we're Team Rocket!
Just keep aimin' higher!
Or somethin' like that.
Tackle!
Mantine, Whirlpool!
He's trapped!
Bubble Beam!
Hitodeman, Rapid Spin!
- Well?
- Amazing!
Take Down Mantine,
Charge attack!
Hitodeman, Tackle!
This is fun!
This is so fun!
Seeing you laugh makes me happy.
Thank you, Papa.
Satoshi...
- Are you all right, Mom?
- I'm fine.
But you're still risking yourself as much as always.
It's because I'm your son.
Me-chan?
And the Unknown?
Aren't they here?
If you mean the Pokemon that brought me here, he left a while back.
That was Entei.
This tower and Entei were created from Me-chan's heart, by the Unknown.
No way...
Either way, we've got to leave.
Right.
Wake up...
Wake up, Me-chan.
What's wrong, Mama?
Listen, Me-chan.
I'm not your real mother.
I'm Satoshi's mama, not yours.
Do you remember me, Me-chan?
We met in Masara Town.
Please, come with me.
Mama...
You can't stay here!
No...
No...
No!
Mom... Mom!
- Are you OK, Mom?
- Yeah...
Over here, mom!
What's wrong, Me?
Papa, that boy wants to take Mama away!
- Satoshi!
- Mom! Mom!
Leave her and go!
I'd never do that!
She's my mother!
She's Me's mother here.
- You don't get to decide that!
- Get out.
If you don't leave on your own,
I'll make you leave!
We'll see about that!
Waninoko, I choose you!
- You intend to defeat me?
- I won't lose to an illusion!
Waninoko, Water Gun!
I'm an illusion, you say?
Nonsense!
Return, Waninoko!
If water won't work, let's try fire!
Go, Hinoarashi!
Hinoarashi, Flamethrower!
Return, Hinoarashi!
He's strong...
Do you still think I'm an illusion?
You're an illusionary Entei created by that girl's heart!
No...
No!
I'm an illusion, you say?
I'm...
I am...
This girl's father!
Pikachu!
Pikachu!
Me-chan, do you remember?
Your real papa and mama?
Me-chan!
We made it!
Here too?
- A battle?
- With us right in the middle...
Pikachu!
Lizardon!
You came, Lizardon!
Thank you!
Satoshi!
Are you all right?
What is he?
- My friend.
- Friend?
My Pokemon are all friends that I made during my journey!
Friends...?
It doesn't matter how many you have!
- We too...
- ... are your friends!
Takeshi! Kasumi!
I'm gonna say this before you ask "What's that?"
- Musashi!
- Kojiro!
And Nyarth!
We're your friends from Team Rocket!
Team Rocket?
Why are you...?
Actually...
Somehow...
...our hands just reached out.
We've been around each other for a while.
Come on, Me-chan.
Come with us.
My friends are here!
Go away!
Lizardon!
Papa!
Do you really think you can be
Me-chan's real father?
As long as she wishes it,
I will be Me's father!
Me!
Lizardon, Flamethrower!
One more time, Lizardon!
Papa!
Lizardon, Fire Spin!
Entei, please!
Listen to me!
If you really care about Me-chan, then listen to me!
You can't stay here with that girl!
It's just wrong!
Even if it is wrong,
I will grant Me's wishes!
Lizardon!
If you keep her here, she'll always be alone!
Lizardon...
This is the end!
Stop it!
Stop, Papa... No more!
No more!
I lost to you, Me-chan.
Your Gomazo's Rollout was really strong!
Your Mantine's Whirlpool, too!
You could be a Gym Leader one day!
After a battle's over, those of us who love Pokemon...
We're all friends.
Let's go outside.
- Even if you fight when outside...
- You can make friends.
Lots of them.
Let's go, Me-chan.
It's warm...
Papa?
I became your father to make you happy.
If your happiness lies in the outside world...
I...
- Wha...?
- What now?
This way!
Lizardon, take care of Me!
Hang in there!
Everybody hurry!
- What's going on, doc?
- It's the Unknown!
They can't stop their power now that it was unleashed!
The crystalisation's even spreading here!
Satoshi, you have to stop the Unknown from running wild!
The crystalisation's spreading further!
Even the Pokemon Center's being engulfed by crystals!
Run away!
- Y-Yes!
- Hurry!
These are the Unknown...
How do we stop them?
There's a barrier protecting them!
Lizardon, you go!
We did it!
I'm counting on you, Pikachu!
Thunderbolt
100.000 volts!
Are you all right, Pikachu?
This is really bad!
There ain't no treasure here, let's go home!
Guess you're right...
Excuse us...
We're blocked!
Somebody do something!
Please stop, Unknown!
Me.
I'm glad...
That I got to be your father.
The last thing I can do for you...
...is to get you out of this place!
I was born from your dreams.
So if you believe in it, there's nothing I can't do.
Papa...!
Me...
Me!
Me, you have to believe in Entei!
That your Entei can't lose!
Good luck, Papa!
Me...
Me!
Me...
Me!
Papa...
Thank you for calling me Papa.
I'll go back to your dreams.
Papa...
- This is the real...
- Greenfield!
It's beautiful!
Hey, is everybody safe?
Dr. Okido!
Thank you...
Let's go meet them, Me-chan.
Everybody was worried about you!
- Come on.
- Yeah!
Me-chan!
Young miss!
Well? What do we do now?
The police are down there.
We can't go down...
That's right!
Sonansu!
In any case...
That's one less lonely girl!
But there's another in here!
A young lonely girl.
Musashi!
A young, lonely man.
Kojiro!
Next one's always alone!
Me, as the wind blows in Greenfield!
Even if you're alone, we're your friends!
Whatever the reason...
This rocks!
Before long, the rain will stop falling.
Someday, the clouds will disappear.
Lift your face, and you should hear my voice calling you
Since shining tears point to a smile
Someday, someone will be given wings for this sadness
Rub your cheeks, let the sunlight rain on you
You remembered to smile, right? You've replied o someone's voice with it, right?
Since a small smile points to happiness
One day, you'll be wrapped up in that pleasure.
When you get wings that make sadness go away, a rainbow is born
From a lonely color towards a warm color.
This is the gradation of feelings
Anywhere there's a warm glow...
What's real solitude actually like?
There's nothing to say,
since you should already know...
If you come across a day when someone sheds their tears,
That time around, let's grant wings for that sadness
When you get wings that make sadness go away, a rainbow is born
From a lonely color towards a warm color
This is the gradation of feelings
Anywhere there's a warm glow...
SubRip-Fixes by VaVooM
What is it that makes a man a man?
Is it his origins, the way things start?
Or is it something else, something harder to describe?
For me, it all began in 1944.
Classified mission off the coast of Scotland.
The Nazis were desperate.
Combining science and black magic...
...they intended to upset the balance of the war.
I was 28, already a paranormal advisor to President Roosevelt.
I could never have suspected that what would transpire that night...
...would not only affect the course of history...
...but change my life forever.
All right, men, let's go. Move!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's fan it out.
Your men...
...they'll need these.
Are you a Catholic?
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.
Well, you're gonna need one of these.
I abhor the use of violence.
Thank you. I wouldn't want you to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.
All right, you guys, let's move, move, move, move!
Come on boys, let's go!
This way! Left, right!
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!
We're close!
You're wasting our time. There's nothing here but sheep and rocks.
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!
The remains of Trondham Abbey, built on an intersection of ley lines...
...the boundaries between our world and the others...
What a load of crap!
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard the word "parabnormal."
Paranormal.
Move it!
Hold the line.
Come on!
Sweet Jesus.
They must be here for the sheep.
The freak in the gas mask...
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.
Hitler's top assassin and head of the Thule Occult Society.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
No matter what happens tonight...
...this book will guide you back to me.
I will not leave you.
I grant you everlasting life...
...youth...
...and the power to serve me.
Ilsa! Grigori!
It's time.
Five years of research and construction, Grigori.
Five years!
The führer doesn't look kindly on failure.
There will be no failure, general.
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.
I'll deliver one.
What I will do tonight can never be undone!
What I will do tonight can never be undone!
I will open a portal...
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:
The Seven Gods of Chaos!
Our enemies will be destroyed!
And from the ashes...
...a new Eden will arise.
Get down!
I was taking a picture.
You do that again and I'll carve you a new one.
Listen, the portal is open.
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Look out!
Get down!
It's almost over.
No, it's not.
The portal's been open for too long.
Something may have come through.
Have your men search the area thoroughly.
Spread out over that way!
Sir! Something up here!
He's gone.
For now.
When you said something came through...
From where?
I don't see them!
Do you really, really believe in hell?
There is a place, a dark place...
...where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return.
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?
That's Russian, right?
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.
Rasputin?
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...
...he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed...
...castrated and finally drowned.
And yet, we saw him here tonight.
Professor Broom.
Careful. Be careful.
- What the hell is that? An ape?
- No.
It was red. Bright red.
Lower your light, you're scaring it.
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!
No, it's not an ape.
It's got a big stone in its hand.
I think that is its hand.
Look at the size of that whammer.
No, wait! Wait!
A blanket. Get me a blanket.
Come on. Come on. It's safe.
Jump down.
Come on. Jump down.
It's a boy.
It's just a baby boy.
Move to the left.
There we were, an unready father for an unwanted child.
The boys gave him a name that very night.
In retrospect, perhaps not the most fortunate.
But nevertheless, a name we all came to use.
We called him Hellboy.
Look at the birdie.
Speculation about the origins...
Evidence that Hellboy...
So, what is it exactly that you say this agency does?
I kid you not. It hunts monsters.
The claim, of course, that this creature...
...works for the FBI as a monster hunter.
What you seek is in there.
This is a sacred place.
Give me my gold.
We shouldn't be here.
Master.
Your eyes.
What did they do to your eyes?
- Have you told him yet?
- No.
We should.
Malignant sarcoma.
In the lungs...
...the spine...
...liver.
- Approximately...
...how long?
- Maybe six weeks.
I can arrange for hospitalization and pain management.
- Make the time more bearable.
- No.
I'd rather be at home.
I have some arrangements to make.
For my son.
You can always get a second opinion.
That won't be necessary.
Hurry up!
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!
Tom Manning is the head of special operations at the FBI.
He joins Pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.
There. That's the tail.
And these are the horns.
I have a question.
In the pictures of aliens, UFO, the yeti, Hellboy...
...why is it they're always out of focus?
Why don't you tell us...
...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell the American public one thing.
Now, this Bureau for the...
Paranormal Research and Defense.
There is no such thing.
"Waste Management Services"?
What is it?
John Myers, FBI.
Transfer from Quantico.
Look at the birdie, son.
- Hello. I'm John...
- You are late. That's what you are.
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.
- I'm going to...
- Section 51. I know.
Watch your hands and elbows.
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.
Hello?
Turn the pages, please, if you don't mind.
Please.
The pages.
These? You're reading these?
Four books at once, every day...
Four books at once, every day...
Four books at once, every day...
...as long as I'm there to turn the pages.
My name's Broom.
My name's Broom.
Professor Trevor Broom.
Sir, I'm John...
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.
T stands for Thaddeus, mother's older brother.
Scar on your chin happened when you were 10.
You still wonder if it's ever going to fade away.
- How did it...?
- He.
Not "it."
Abraham Sapien.
Discovered alive in a secret chamber...
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.
His name was taken from this inscription...
...stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.
April 14, 1865."
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.
Hence, Abe Sapien.
Rotten eggs.
A delicacy. Abe loves them.
How does he know so much about me?
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.
"Unique." That's a word you'll hear frequently around here.
Sir, where am I, exactly?
As you entered the lobby, there was an inscription:
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails."
There are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.
Make no mistake about that.
And we are the ones who bump back.
1937, Hitler joins the Thule Society...
...a group of German aristocrats obsessed with the occult.
1938, he acquired the Spear of Longinus...
...which pierced the side of Christ.
He who holds it becomes invincible.
Hitler's power increases tenfold.
1943, President Roosevelt decides to fight back.
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.
1958, the Occult Wars finally come to an end...
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.
1945, you mean.
Hitler died in '45.
Did he, now?
Myers, this is Agent Clay.
Take his lead.
He'll make the introductions.
You're not coming?
I handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.
Make me proud.
They're not speaking.
Professor Broom had him grounded.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?
Oh, yeah. That was weird.
Yeah. Right.
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.
He gets fed six times a day.
He's got a thing for cats.
You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend.
He never goes out unsupervised.
Who?
I hate those comic books.
They never get the eyes right.
Hellboy.
He's real.
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.
What's with the hair, Clay?
Finally got them implants, huh?
It'll fill in.
Who's the squirt?
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
I don't want him.
What, you get tired of me, Clay?
The candy. Give him the candy.
Oh, sir, I...
I have these for you.
Father's back?
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.
I wanted to see her.
- Nobody's business.
- It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Myers, huh?
You got a first name, Myers?
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.
John. John Myers.
Well, John'll do.
- Stare at what?
- His horns. He files them to fit in.
What you looking at, John?
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Code red.
Hey, hey, hey.
Warning. Code red.
They're playing our song.
Come on, champ, let's go fight some monsters.
We're here at the Machen Library...
...where just hours ago, an alarm was triggered.
The N.Y.P.D. Has yet to issue a statement.
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.
And now here comes a garbage truck.
A large garbage truck.
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.
One sheet of glass between them and us.
Story of my life.
Outside.
I could be outside.
You mean, outside with her.
Don't get psychic with me, fella.
Nothing psychic about it.
You're easy.
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.
Liz left us, Red.
Take the hint.
We don't take hints.
Civilians in bedroom.
Okay, guys, let's sync up our locators.
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.
Six guards dead.
I thought we checked this place.
Fakes and reproductions.
Apparently, not everything was fake.
Father.
The entity is still in there.
Video surveillance shows a 16th-century statue was destroyed.
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.
The statue, however, was hollow.
A reliquary.
A prison.
The Vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough...
...to include it on The List of Avignon, of which, by the way, we hold a copy.
Perfect job for these babies.
Made them myself.
Holy water, clove leaf, silver shavings, white oak. The works.
Behind this door, a dark entity.
Evil, ancient and hungry.
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.
You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.
We'll definitely need more info on this one.
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.
No. He likes it that way.
The whole "lonely hero" thing.
Hey, Stinky.
Kitchen's closed.
What you having?
Six library guards, raw, plus belts and boots.
Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out.
Red, I found something.
This entity's name is Sammael, the desolate one.
Son of Nergal, brother of...
Listen, Sammy...
...I'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.
So, what do you say we work this out in a nice, peaceful...
Oh, crap.
That's it for you, Sam.
Red, you need to hear the rest of the information.
No, he's taken care of.
No, listen to this.
"Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows...
...son of Nergal, hound of resurrection..."
See...
...I don't like that.
What? Hound of resurrection?
"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc..."
Cut to the end. How do I kill it?
Doesn't say.
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!
I'm going around the back.
Oh, crap.
Child.
All grown up, I see.
That voice.
It was the first lullaby you ever heard, my son.
I ushered you into this world.
I alone know your true calling, your true name.
Name this.
- That thing. That thing.
- What do you think you're doing?
- What do you think you're doing?
- Helping you. I...
Nobody helps me!
It's my job.
You want to help? Here.
Load this.
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.
Jesus, what's that on your arm?
Oh, crap.
What the hell is that thing?
Let me go ask.
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.
Why, you little...
Wait!
We're heading toward civilians.
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.
Red means stop!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Stay here.
Sammy, you got a leak.
Waiting for me, chunk-face?
What the...?
- I'm on your side.
- Sure.
That's right!
Open wide!
Son of a...
Yuck!
Screw this.
I'm fireproof.
You're not.
Hey, Myers.
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
How's your arm?
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?
I just fried Stinky.
Listen...
...tell Father I'll be home...
...but he shouldn't wait up.
No. No, wait, wait.
Yeah, I gotta go with you.
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?
Bye.
Damn it.
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.
Die in peace...
...and be reborn again and again.
Only seven more days till the eclipse.
The child will be there, and so will we all.
Won't we?
There's a big, red man down there.
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.
Not Santa.
Well, who, then?
I brought beer.
Oh, Red, your arm.
You better get that looked at.
I wanted to see you.
Every time the media gets a look at him, they run to me.
I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
- I thought you like being on TV.
- I do.
So how many escapes this year alone? Five.
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red, has a tail and is government-funded.
I know where to find him.
- I'll get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.
Don't touch anything.
I need to touch it to see.
- See what?
- Past, future.
Whatever this object holds.
Is he serious?
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.
Professor, they were here.
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.
This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.
Also, make sure it's all locked up over there in the annex.
Roger that.
Kroenen!
Move.
Move!
There he is!
We'll cover him from here!
All right, don't move! Put that down.
Put down the weapon!
Get them.
Drop the weapon.
On the ground!
Last warning!
Take him out!
Now, ready the welcome, my love.
Salt gathered from the tears of a thousand angels.
Restraining the essence...
...of Sammael, the hellhound.
The seed of destruction.
This I can promise, Sammael.
For each one of you that falls...
...two shall arise.
- Professor.
- I'm all right.
Professor.
You...
You are very sick.
I don't want Hellboy to know.
Sixty years ago, they tried to destroy the world.
They're back.
In my lifetime, they're back...
...to finish the job.
We miss you at the bureau.
Abe's crazier every day.
Father's still mad at me.
Come back, Liz.
- Come back.
- No. No, H.B.
No, not this time.
I don't like it here...
...but I haven't had an episode in months.
And you know what?
I'm learning to control it.
I'm learning where it comes from.
For the first time in my life...
...I'm not afraid.
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.
The Nanny Squad.
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.
Sir, may I go first?
Hang on a minute.
He barely knows him.
Then he should make it his business to change that.
Listen, H. B...
...I've got a chance out here.
So if you really care about me...
...you won't come back.
Yeah...
...I gotta go too.
Lots to do.
What took you so long?
Come on, time to go home.
Tape you up.
What are you, a Boy Scout?
- Nope, I never was.
- Well, you could have fooled me.
Hey, Red.
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.
This is nothing.
You know what'll kill me, don't you?
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.
You were burned by some organic acid.
I'm lucky that way.
- I worry about you.
- Me?
Well...
...I won't be around forever, you know.
Damn!
Could you please be a little careful?
Big baby.
How long was it latched onto you?
I don't know. About five seconds.
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?
Touched you five seconds, laid three eggs.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
The stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs.
They are very sensitive to heat and light.
They need a humid, dark environment to breed.
Did you ever lose track of him?
Well, let's see.
There was that moment when
I had the train on top of my head.
We can't risk it.
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks with a group of agents.
Search the whole place top to bottom.
Find those eggs and destroy them.
"Elizabeth Sherman."
I don't like the term "fire-starter."
I just don't.
And "pyrokinesis" sounds like some psychosis or something.
I don't know.
Maybe that's right.
Not being able to let go.
It's scary.
I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.
You hear about so and so...
...who just lost control and just exploded.
Well, they're lucky it isn't true.
With me, it is.
My master is calling your name now, my girl.
You must return to the child.
So once again...
...dream...
...of fire.
Hey, freak!
Get back here, freak!
- Let's get her!
- Get her!
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!
Freak!
Oh, no! Not again.
Oh, no! Somebody!
Help me!
Help me, somebody! Help me!
How many buildings does she have to burn down?
She belongs here.
That's not what she feels.
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.
Professor, the girl you're...
Professor, that girl you're talking about...
Hey, Boy Scout...
Hey, Boy Scout...
...think twice.
No, listen, I read her file.
- "Read her file."
- She blames herself...
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.
I could talk to her.
I think I could bring her back.
Just what was it that landed you this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?
What was it?
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?
What is your area of expertise?
He doesn't want me with him.
I know that much.
- You're doing fine.
- No, I'm not.
Look, he respects Clay, not me.
I'm really sorry, okay?
I'm not your guy.
I'm dying, Agent Myers.
Like any father, I worry about him.
In medieval stories, there is often a young knight...
...who is inexperienced...
...but pure of heart.
- Come on.
Look, I am not pure of heart.
Yes, you are.
Rasputin is back for him.
What I ask of you...
...is to have the courage to stand by him when I am gone.
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.
But you will help him...
...in essence...
...to become a man.
Pull that down.
She was making great progress...
...and now this.
We'll be closed for months.
And it put a big dent in our Thorazine supply.
She's been like this since it happened.
Are you sure you want to go in?
Miss Sherman?
I'm Agent Myers, FBI.
Miss Sherman?
Can I call you Liz?
It's a beautiful name.
Sixty percent of all the women in the world are named Liz.
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.
John T. Myers.
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau.
No special precautions, no security escorts.
Just you and me in a taxi like regular folks.
That doesn't sound like him.
Well, Miss Sherman, he's asking you back...
...but it's entirely your choice, you know?
Choice, huh?
That's cute.
I've quit the bureau 13 times.
I always go back.
Where else would I go?
Over here.
You said those eggs need it dark and humid?
Well, they hit the jackpot.
The subway lines, they all converge right around here.
Right below us is the old Vandeveer reservoir.
It was abandoned in the mid-30s.
There's a pulse.
There. A cistern on the other side.
Most of the eggs are there.
There's no way in.
We should go back and request a special permit, type 2...
You guys coming or what?
We lead a charmed life.
Here you are, doctor.
This should cover your tail fin.
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Remind me why I keep doing this.
Rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
This doesn't really look like doll's hair.
Be honest, Red. What do you think?
I'm thinking about doing it myself.
Hey, you guys find anything?
No eggs yet, Red.
What, are you on a lunch break?
Nothing here.
Red's on the move. I'll cover him.
Damn it, Red.
Hey, it's Abe.
Oh, God.
Bring your toy over here.
Oh, man.
Oh, Jesus.
There's only one. I'll fry him quick.
Two. There were two.
Red?
Red. Come in, Red.
What's your 20? I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?
It's like Swiss cheese in here.
Sit tight, pal, I'm on him.
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.
Didn't I kill you already?
You goddamn monster!
Oh, crap.
It's for you!
You shouldn't hurt people!
You missed.
Hey, chunk-face.
You can do better than that, big monster like you.
My kittens! Please!
My kittens! Please!
Somebody, please, get my kittens!
Somebody, please, get my kittens!
Second date.
No tongue.
My kittens. Careful with them!
Lady, give me a break!
Thank you.
My job.
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.
Buddy, don't take another step.
Buddy, don't take another step.
Clay.
Man down. I need an ambulance right away. Do you read me?
Hang in there, pal.
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!
Feels good to be outside.
It's been so long.
You know that's...
That's not safe Miss Sherman.
Please stay in the car.
No, no. Miss Sherman. Please, can you come down, Miss Sherman?
Nice view.
Hey, a smile, huh?
Yeah, that's good.
Here.
Damn.
- You'll have to take another one later.
- Yeah.
He'll make it.
Not everyone was so lucky.
We had two agents die today.
Clay probably won't survive the night.
- Not now, Manning, please.
- My problem with you:
You're reckless.
These men trusted you to lead them as a team.
Where were you?
I knew those men better than you did.
- That makes it all right, then.
- No, it doesn't make it all right.
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.
You have an insight.
You know monsters.
What are you trying to say?
What are you trying to say?
This whole thing is a farce.
This whole thing is a farce.
Because in the end...
...after you've killed, after you've captured every freak out there...
...after you've killed, after you've captured every freak out there...
...there's still one left.
You.
Hey, Manning.
I wish I could be more gracious, but...
Welcome back.
It's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.
Then I shall be on my way.
Oh, you should have a look around.
We made some changes around here.
I want that thing locked up, starting now.
Right now! Do you...?
Now, you hear me?
- Locked up!
- Nothing's changed.
Home sweet home.
Liz?
Liz!
You did it, buddy. You did it!
Myers?
Pop?
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, what's that on your wrist?
This?
- It's something I learned in therapy.
- Yeah?
I'm depressed, one rubber band.
I'm impatient...
...two rubber bands.
Maybe...
Maybe I should get you a fresh pack.
Yeah, maybe two.
Yeah, maybe.
I'm gonna put these over here, okay?
One minute. One minute.
Hey, Myers...
...you're a talker.
What's a good word, a solid word, for "need"?
Well...
..."need" is a good, solid word.
Too needy.
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.
Nachos.
Oh, my God.
Look at them all.
Who had babies?
Liz, there's something I need for you to hear, and it's...
Will it take long?
Because I'm actually going out.
Out?
"Out" out?
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
Are you going alone?
No, Myers is taking me.
Hey, your chili's getting cold.
Not hungry.
Is there something you'd like me to hear?
- It's just a list. It's not finished.
- Okay.
Well, then, later.
See you.
- Anything else you need?
- Not from you.
Well, good night.
Goodbye.
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.
Born in Munich, 1897.
Suffered from a masochistic compulsion...
...commonly known as surgical addiction.
Both eyelids surgically removed...
...along with his upper...
...and lower lip.
The blood in his veins dried up decades ago.
Only dust remains.
What horrible will...
...could keep such a creature as this alive?
Oh, no.
Come on, Red.
Jesus.
Damn it, Red. Not again
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?
Do you want anything else?
The shop's closing.
Here we go.
Listen about...
I admire him. He's a force of nature.
What are you two talking about?
What is so fascinating, so important?
No. He's determined, unstoppable.
Some people would call that cocky.
- He's just strong.
- Yeah. That he is.
Hey, I've got yours.
My uncle, he used to say we like people for their qualities...
...but love them for their defects.
He loves you, you know.
What about you?
I don't know. I grew up with him.
But now every time I see him,
I get confused.
There's hardly a day that goes by that he's not in my mind.
Even now...
...I feel like he's here.
Hey, wait up.
You like doughnuts? I got two.
- Thanks. That was nice.
- I got a cookie, as well.
- Sugar?
- No. No sugar. Thank you.
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.
- I got some milk here.
- No. I'm okay. I don't take milk.
Told you.
She took his picture.
Damn!
She took his picture.
She took his picture.
She took his picture.
Oh, crap.
It's freezing, isn't it?
Coffee's warming me up.
Well, what do we do now?
Newark, New Jersey, entertainment capital of the world.
- You sound like a game-show host.
- Hi.
Hey.
You're Hellboy.
I'm on a mission.
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?
I lived with my uncle most of my life.
Then I went to Quantico, went to top of my class. I'm nothing like...
Don't tell anyone, huh?
Attaboy.
Sir, he left his locator.
- Shall we send out some scouts?
- Enough, enough, enough.
He'll never change.
A child.
Always a child.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
Moscow.
Who wants us in Moscow?
- My mom baked them.
- She's laughing.
She's sitting on a park bench, and she's laughing.
That's it. I'm done.
They don't look like spies.
Are you kidding me?
Look at this guy.
Those shady little eyes, that phony grin.
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.
Yeah, the old yawning trick.
Watch his arm.
First he wants my job, then he wants my girl.
Hey, we all have a side that we try to hide.
God...
Hey, what the hell?
Hey! Hey, who threw that?
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Nice shot.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
It's Rasputin's mausoleum.
I see the puppet.
But where is...
...the puppeteer?
Very good, Professor Broom.
It was you.
The scraps of paper...
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.
Bread crumbs on the trail.
Like in a fable.
They both distract him...
...and guide him exactly where I need him.
Moscow.
His destiny.
And the last clue...
...will be left by the late Professor Broom.
You raised the child.
Nurtured him.
So in return...
...I will permit you...
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.
He will open the portal...
...and bring about the end of the world.
If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...
...none of this would have come to pass.
But then, how could you have known?
Your God chooses to remain silent.
Mine lives within me.
Every time I died and crossed over...
...a little more of the master...
...came back with me.
He disclosed to me the child's true name.
Would you like to know it?
I know what to call him.
Nothing you can do or say...
...can change that.
I call him...
...Son.
I'm ready.
It'll be quick.
Just go there and tell her how you feel.
My mom says that...
Look, it's not...
It's not that easy, okay?
Plus, you're 9.
You're not old enough to be giving me advice.
- All right, stand by.
- Who are those guys?
Liz, I'm sorry. It's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.
- No!
- Wait, what happened?
- No!
- It's okay.
No, not him.
- Would you take her?
- Something's wrong.
He hasn't spoken to anybody in three days.
Not a word.
He won't eat, he won't sleep.
I've never seen him like this.
Never.
Should I stay?
With him, I mean?
Listen, I'm not much of a problem solver.
Three decades,
I've only completed two sides.
But I do know this much.
If there's trouble...
...all us freaks have is each other.
And I'm stuck here.
So...
...take care of the big monkey for me, will you?
I have accumulated many objects of great interest...
...preserving our heritage.
Many, like me, believe Mother Russia...
...to be very close to a historic rebirth.
"Rebirth"?
I like that.
Twenty tons of stone.
This thing fell from the sky into Tunguska Forest.
June 30th, 1908.
The Romanovs took possession of it immediately.
I've wanted it for ages.
You're aware, of course...
...there's no way you'll get it out of Russian territory.
He is aware.
Our guests are coming in.
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
That's the only clue we have.
We've collected and destroyed thousands of eggs...
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.
We leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment.
Hellboy's coming.
I'm not pleased about that, but I'll be in charge this time.
We either wrap this up or I'm closing this freak show for good.
Hi.
Hi.
I'II...
...come to Moscow...
...if you're still going.
I am.
But I have something to say.
I understand what you don't like about me.
I do.
What I am...
...makes you feel a little out of place...
...out there.
- Red, I don't...
- Listen.
I'm not like Myers.
He makes you feel like you belong...
...which is good, really.
I wish I could do something about this.
I can't.
I can promise you two things:
One, I'll always look this good.
And two...
...I'll never give up on you.
Ever.
I like that.
This engraving here represents Sammy. Text reads:
"One falls, two shall arise. Sammael."
We'll have to nail them all at once, and the eggs.
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.
Cable pulls the safety pins.
Kaboom.
Easy to clean, easy to use.
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.
"Sparky"?
Who came up with that? Myers?
Yeah, we're leaving the main road, so hang on.
This better be the place or I'll puke.
You better come out and see.
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.
It's practically a city.
And it stinks, and it's muddy.
I think we go back, we check into the hotel, we regroup.
After breakfast.
I think what we have to do here is we have to make a grid.
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.
Let me ask for directions.
Where are you going?
Come on, baby, find me a talker.
Hi there.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
What do you want?
This is ridiculous.
I run this show, not him.
This guy's nothing but trouble.
- Ten minutes, we're out of here.
- Will you shut up...
...and let him do his thing?
Anybody got a PowerBar?
Hey, there he is.
Sixty feet further, comrades.
And three rows in.
What the hell is that on his back?
This here is Ivan Klimentovich.
Say "hi," Ivan.
Go that way, Red Monkey!
Gotcha.
Ivan says there's a whole network of tunnels down here.
Goes on for miles.
Stay close, everybody.
You better be right about this.
We'll be all right as long as we don't separate.
Hey, Sparky.
Tell everyone to turn their locator belts on. Anybody sees anything...
I'll say "Marco."
Polo.
- Are you sure about this?
- On a scale of one to ten: Two.
Don't worry, Boy Scout, she'll take care of you.
She's a tough one.
Come on.
Ask your buddy how far this thing goes.
How you doing up there, Ivan?
If I had legs I'd kick your ass!
Would you mind holding this guy for a while? He is so negative.
What the hell is that?
Something big.
- Lime, come with me.
- Right.
No, no, no. Stay put!
Stop!
You listen to me.
Listen to me!
I'm in charge.
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!
Lime, let's go!
Stay put!
And you! I am not afraid of you!
I'm in charge! We go back!
I was better off dead!
Oh, crap.
Music.
Really went deep.
Hey, what's wrong with you?!
You killed my father.
Your ass is mine.
What are you laughing at, you Nazi son of a...?
Don't even think about it.
That's all for you, pinhead.
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- Having a...
You never light a cigar that way.
You use a wooden match.
Preserves the flavor. You see?
Thank you.
Thank you.
So he thinks you and I...
That's why he's mad at me.
But it's not true, right?
What?
Well, that, you know, you feel that way about me.
You want to know that here? Now?
Yeah.
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.
Hey, wait up.
Have you found them yet?
I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.
Okay, good.
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.
Liz, wait.
Oh, my God.
Let's back out real slow.
Let's back out real slow.
Myers, ready your grenades.
Marco. Marco. Marco.
Get your big, red butt over here.
I'm coming for you, kid!
No piggybacks!
Get off me, you...
Liz, no!
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!
What do you want me to do?
- Hit me.
- What?
Hit me.
Now!
You should be running.
They are all here.
All of them.
Just the way it was promised.
This one's awake.
Thank you for this.
"And I looked...
...and beheld an angel.
And in his right hand, the key to the bottomless pit."
And in his right hand, the key to the bottomless pit."
These were the words I heard as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.
And now, the door.
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...
...so that they might at long last enter our world.
You are the key, the right hand of doom.
Your stone hand.
What did you think it was made for?
Open the locks.
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!
Silence.
Imagine it.
An Eden...
...for you and her.
No.
No?
In exchange for her soul, then?
Open the door.
No.
As you wish.
No!
Liz!
Her soul awaits on the other side.
If you want her back...
...open the door and claim her.
Your true name is inscribed around the locks that hold you.
You cannot break them...
...no matter how strong you are.
The eclipse has begun.
Your true name...
...say it!
Become the key.
For her.
Anung un Rama.
Repeat it.
Anung un Rama.
Open the final lock.
Remember who you are!
Believe me, I have lived long enough to know...
...not a tear will be shed for this world!
You have a choice.
Your father gave you that.
No, you don't!
Open it!
Do it!
What have you done?
I chose.
You will never fulfill your destiny.
You will never understand the power inside you.
I'll just have to find a way to live with that.
Child.
Look what you've done.
You've killed me...
...an insignificant man.
But you have brought forth...
...a god.
Myers, let's go.
Hell will hold no surprises for us.
I took a grenade belt.
The damn thing's broken.
Keep her safe, will you?
Whatever happens, don't leave her alone.
I won't.
You're okay, Myers.
Stick around.
Hey, Red.
Just pull the cable.
I didn't get you anything.
Are you going to be okay alone?
How big can it be?
Damn!
Damn.
Oh, this is gonna hurt.
Gonna be sore in the morning.
She's got no pulse.
She's not breathing.
Liz?
I was so foolish.
Red.
In the dark...
...I heard your voice.
What did you say?
I said, "Hey...
...you on the other side...
...let her go.
Because for...
For her I'll cross over.
And then you'll be sorry."
What makes a man a man?
A friend of mine once wondered.
Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?
I don't think so.
It's the choices he makes.
Not how he starts things...
...but how he decides to end them.
Hey, guys? I'm still here.
Hello?
There is this theory.
Given an infinite universe
And infinite time... all things will happen.
That means that every event is inevitable including those that are impossible. that's as good explanation for all this as anything else.
Now, a lot of stories start in bars, so that's where we are going to stars this one.
Not because that I was there.
I wasn't.
But because it is a damn good introduction to a very unique... fellow.
Legends of every major culture all contain some sort of character whose purpose is to grand wishes. except Americas.
The Arabs have Jinni's...
The Irish have Leprechauns...
The Chinese have dragons and monkeys...
The Europeans have ferries and wood sprits.
Who do we have?
Santa Claus?
Santa Claus just brings presents.
He doesn't grand wishes.
Satan.  He grants wishes.
Zak, Satan predate American culture.
He doesn't grand wishes, he makes deals.
All right, I give up.
- What do we have here?
- No one.
That's my thesis.
Our culture is unique in having no such mythology.
Oh, you're wrong my friend.
Excuse me?
There is a fella in America, who grants wishes.
And only one to a customer.
And who is this fella?
O.W. Grant.
That's his usual name.
He's got many others.
And he's an elusive sun of a bitch.
You'd get easier time finding a Jinni.
So how come, we've never heard of this O.W. Grant?
You haven't heard O.W. Grant,
'cause America, is a much younger place than
Ireland or Arabia.
Not too many people have had the chance to meet up with him.
Let me guess.
You have.
I met him out at Interstate 60.
Accidental. That's his way.
Folks don't find him, he finds them.
He just kinda happens in to them, and they don't know who he is or what he does... until he does it.
And mostly messes with them, plays tricks,
'cause that's his way too, but sometimes... if he takes a shine to you... he'll play it strait.
Now, one story says that his daddy was a Leprechaun... came over here with Irish.
Now, midgets are notorious skirt chasers
This leprechaun goes and knocks up a Cheyenne Indian...
Cheyenne get the land taken away in the end up with the immortal, nomadic half-breed with magical powers.
- Interstate 60, you said?
- Hmmmn
So, what does this O.W. Grant look like?
Red bow tie.
He smokes a pipe, curved in the image of a monkey.
Maybe you'd be better of writing your theses without mentioning O.W.
He'd probable rather not have people knownin' about him.
You got it.
Good night.
Hey Quincy, check this out
There is no Interstate 60.
I 65, 64, 66, and 69.
No I 60.
I guess tonight's everybody's fool-of-shit night.
Guy with a red bow tie and a monkey pipe, who grants wishes...
Right.
No, damn it, look,
I need, that bid in before twelve...
Yeah it's critical, just...
Right, call West...
Holy shit!
Broken jaw.
I'm sorry mister,
I didn't see you.
Are, are you OK come on?
Are you all right?
Jesus.
Don't!
Stop!
Oh man!
My bike!
Look, I'm sorry.
I'll pay
Oh God damn it!
Oh God damn it!
Look at my suit.
Oh shit...
Oh fuck.
I've got a sails meeting at 11 o'clock.
This is a fuckin' disaster.
My phone is my fuckin’ life line.
God damn it!
Oh I say everything happens for a reason.
May I guess,
I just needed a new bike.
I, for one, did not need this shit in my life.
Not today.
Of all fuckin’ days!
Oh God damn it!
I wish, this had never happened!
I wish, it hadn't happened... I wish, it hadn't happened!
Was that your wish?
If you had a wish, you wished, this hadn't happened?
Fuckin’ A right!
Granted!
Mr. Baker.
How did you know my name?
Damn it, I need the bid in before 12... yeah it's critical... look, just call West have him fax the timesheet to the main office...
Get it there by ...
Speak up, I can't hear you.
Some people just don't know what to wish for.
As for my part in this story, well, it began on a Tuesday.
September 18th.
My birthday.
My 22nd birthday to be exact.
Oh, I'm Neal Oliver.
And this mess, is my apartment in St. Louis. Missouri.
Where at this particular moment
I was at MajorDecision.com.
Should I wear a tie to lunch?
Damn.
Happy birthday Neal...
Sweet
Truth.
You are not mad, that I'm bailing on you tonight?
No, no no no.
I mean how cool it you be for you, to bomb your psyche-test because of some stupid concert
No aah. You have got to wait until lunch.
That's your family rules.
But you can open this.
I intercepted your snail mail.
It's the reality check.
I'm game over on the art scholarship.
We should at least open it.
I can tell a rejection by weight.
You are the wrong sex, the wrong colour and your family has too much money. I'm sorry.
Just don't, don't mention anything to my old man, please.
You are so weird.
What?
Well, you actually suppose to cut your grapefruit in half and eat it with a spoon not peel it, and eat it like an orange.
Oh look... it's her.
Again.
Should I be like jealous?
Oh, maybe if she was real.
So, I had another dream about her, last night.
She was in jail... it's got to mean something.
I'll tell you what it means.
You saw her once somewhere and made a subconscious impression, the impression came back to you in a dream, so you drew her which made the impression stronger.
You dream, you draw, you draw, you dream
Now it's a vicious cycle.
So quit drawing her, and it'll end.
Well, thank you Karl Young.
Fact is, I enjoy drawing her.
But, am I...
Am I any good at this Sally?
'cause today is the deadline of the Conrad Competition.
Should I even enter these?
Don't ask me Neal.
I don't want to be judgmental.
But I do know, that just because you enjoy doing something, doesn't necessarily mean that you should make it your career.
Here,
No worries.
As I said it all started on my 22nd birthday.
Specifically here.
At my traditional birthday lunch.
As always, my father had picked the restaurant.
Attending with the usual suspects.
Sally, who my parents actually liked maybe even more than I did.
My dad. Daniel.
Attorney at law.
My mom Marlene.
The attorneys wife.
And my sister and best friend Nancy.
Put on earth by the grace of God, to keep me from going insane.
So what did you wish for?
Please tell me that it was something about us.
I'm guessing...
He wished to go skydiving again.
God forbid.
Oh no, no. Neal you didn't.
Why, if I tell her, it won't come true.
Actually that's no wife's tail.
The truth is, you should always tell your wish.
Kinda Carma thing.
Put it out there, project it.
Then it just might come true.
Never heard that before.
Oh, it's true.
Believe me.
I know.
I'll cut this for you.
OK, so now you have to tell us.
Yeah, come on, tell us Neilo.
I wished for... an answer.
An answer, OK an answer to what?
An answer to my life.
Here it is.
Happy birthday son.
Your admission to the Bradford Law Fellowship.
Just do the interview next month, on October 15th, and you're in.
It's all arranged.
By me.
And you can take that to the bank.
Dad, I told you,
I wasn't sure yet.
Well, I can be sure for the both of us.
Last candle gone.
Take it with you.
That is, if you want your wish granted.
Thanks.
Oh, cool.
That's my colour too. Thank you.
Sable brushes.
Nance.
You are the best Nance.
You are welcome.
As for last.
Happy birthday son.
Isn't it perfect?
Fire engin red.
You have no idea, how hard it was to find a red convertible in this town.
Fule injected. 160 horses.
Csr phone.
Yeah, I even got you special plates.
Oh boy, I would have killed for a car like this, when I was your age.
Aw, you know I thought it was high time for an image change, and what better way to start.
Now, you see, the engine is a 2.5 litre dual overhead cam, inline...
As usual, it was all about him.
His idea of cool.
Red was his colour. Not mine.
It was his pet phrase on the licence plates.
Clearly he was excepting me to become him.
Well? Isn't it the best present, you could ever get?
It's awesome.  Come on Neal, take me for a ride.
Well, son...
Neal!
Oh my God!
Son!.
Somebody call 911.
Neal, Neal, are you all right?
Talk to me son.
Neal.
Get better soon honey,
Love Mom + Dad, XO
St. Louis’s finest thin crust
You're all right Neal?
Yeah, yeah, just... it only hurts when I think.
They want to keep me overnight, to log some tests in the morning make sure, my perception is like worked, yeah.
You're goddess, Nance.
I know.
So, what's your perception of a dad who buys you the gift, he wants for himself?
About the same as toxic wastes.
Your perception is fine.
That is one hell of a way getting out of answering dad about the car.
Mom and dad are going to be here soon, what are you gonna tell them?
Lies.
The truth is just gonna piss him off.
Well maybe that's a good thing.
No, no.
Because then I' gonna get the hole riff, about how I'm letting him down
It's just easy if I role with it.
And maybe someone will steal it.
First a little visual warm up?
I'll hold up a card, you name the suit.
I'm gonna go faster and faster.
So, see if you can keep up.
OK.
Diamond.
Club.
Spade.
Heart.
Diamond.
Spade.
Diamond.

Diamond.
Club.

Heart.
Club.
Spade.
Heart.
Did I pass?
No.
But a few people do.
Black harts, red spades?.
Come on, that's like cheating.
Aah, experience has conditioned you, thinking that all hearts are red, and all spades are black.
Because their shapes are similar.
It's easier for your mind to interpret them... based on that passed experience, than open to an idea that they can be different.
We see what we expect to see.
Not necessarily, what's really there.
Children who have never played cards always pass this test.
Makes you wonder how many other things are right in front of you, sight, sound, smell that you can't experience, because you've been conditioned not to?
The good news is ...
If we'll do the test again you will pass.
Once you are aware, that there can be black hearts and red spades, you'll be able to perceive them.
Your brain is wired, just like the Interstate highways system.
It's easier to go from one well to go from one well travelled place to another but the places in between, off the highway ...
Even though they're there, most people just zip right pass them.
Well, that's cool trick
But there aren't any card games with red spades and black hearts.
Well, how do you know?
Mr. Oliver.  I'm Dr. Craig.
You ready to take some tests?
Yeah.
Well, that was some warmer back to you got there, that guy Ray.
Who?
Ray.  You know, that guy, who was ju ...
He just left.
You know, the tricked cards.
No, there is no one on staff, named Ray.
No, he was just here.
Wacky guy, with the cards... with the light-green lab coat.
The staff wears blue here, not green.
But we can test your colour perception.
Dropped seven of harts.
Come on in son.
So, how's that new car?
- Awesome?
- Yeah dad... it's very awesome.
What is on your mind, son?
I'm not so sure about this Bradford thing, dad.
Seams little too easy, you know.
I spent years working very hard, so it would be easy for you.
What? You want to work nights in that warehouse for the rest of your life?
Come on dad, that just so I don't have to ask you for cash.
Son, let me give you some Daniel Olivier philosophy.
And you can take it to the bank.
When ever someone offers you an advantage, take it.
And this program is an advantage.
It will get you to any law school in the country.
America needs another lawyer.
Another good lawyer.
We can always use one of those.
- That was costs 30 Gs ?
I outbid two major collectors to get it.
It's a lot of money for a drop cloth.
That shows you how much you know.
That is Franklin Samuel original.
He's a name artist.
If you ever sell anything, the operative would been if, maybe... maybe... your opinion will count.
Look dad,
I'm just not sure, OK?
I thought about, maybe taking some time off.
Time off for what?
Sort of take stock, you know, try figure some things out.
Waste your time with your art?
It's a hobby son.
Would you live it that?
Look, I got you into Bradford, because Prat's on the board, and he won't be next year.
So if you don't take advantage of it now, there won't be a next time.
Why not just go thru the program?
If you ultimately decide, law school is not for you, then, I'll... live with it.
But at least you'll be Bradford fellow and that's something you can always take to the bank.
Then you can, you know... figure things out.
So you're going Bradford, ha.
- I thought you weren't sure.
- I'm not.
I think it would be stupid, not to at least give it a shot.
Can't let down the old man.
Bought you off with a fancy car?
He's maximizing his options, Frank.
It's very mature.
We should be supportive, not judgemental.
Look for the good in your fellow man.
The warm wind of romance blows around you.
With good health, prosperity will follow.
October 15th.
That's the day of my Bradford interview.
Let me see that.
OK, you got me.
It's blank.
What the hell?
I would never get on that shit, never.
Just, leave everything behind, not know where are you going.
I can't believe that you would Neal.
Just, leave your friends,  and your family, and for what?
Hey, earth to Neal.
What's the matter?
Sally my fortune.
Didn't it say:
October 15th, are you sure?
Obviously it didn't.
At the restaurant, when I showed it to you, isn't that what it said?
Why do you make such a big deal about this?
Because it is bugging me.  That's why.
You're just projecting your anxiety, about your decision, and that is natural.
It's OK. You'll do great.
Because that's who you are.
Here.. Just take a nice deep breath, relax.
Sally, listen to me.
What are the chances?
That of all cookies in that kitchen, that exact one ended up on a plate, that was taken to our table, and I picked it?
It was blank, Neal.
The fortune was blank.
You projected.
I projected?
Right.
That was the politically correct way to say I was seeing things...
Well, a lovely thought.
I worked graveyard shifts at the grocery warehouse, filling orders for the trucks to take to the various stores in the morning.
I liked it for three reasons.
I'd gotten the job on my own.
It paid enough that I didn't have to ask the old man for cash.
And it annoyed Daniel that his son was even working at such a low-class job.
I hear you are quittin’ to become some big shot lawyer in your new fancy-ass car, hmmm?
Well, lucky do.
Hey, Curby.
Get the kid a brake.
You just remember that no matter how hard shit you think you are,
It's always gonna be more the same.
Just another High School.
- High School?
- Hell yeah.
Everything in life is like high school.
They're just changin’ names.
You take this place.
Instead of principle, we've got boss.
Instead of teachers, supervisors.
Instead of assignments, they give us work orders and if you fuck up them work orders, you get fired.
Instead of expelled.
Oh yeah, names are different, but it is exact same shit.
High school.
Damaged goods.
Well, store can't sell them.
Guess I'll just have to take them off their hands.
Is he right, Otis?
Is everything more the same?
Yeah, if you look at it like that.
I mean, look at me,
I show up here, see the same people, take shipment to the stores, see those same people, eat at the same places, see those same people... but not really.
See.
I like seeing those people.
Well most of them any way.
If I want something different,
I can make it different, go a different way.
Eat at a different place, do an Interstate gig.
See I never went to high school...
Look at them.
In the morning they will get up, and go to the store.
And the paste will be on the shelves where it always is, and not one of them will give a moment's thought as to how it got there.
Holy shit.
That's her.
I must have seen her on the billboard, and that's how she got in my dreams.
You dream about her?
Yeah, yeah, Yes.
Pretty silly, huh.
Maybe it means something.
Like what?
Like the thunderbolt, you know, love at the first sight.
Come on Otis, that's just fairytale stuff.
That's how I met my wife.
Spotted her in a crowd at the river front,
4th of July fireworks.
Couldn't take my eyes of her.
Fireworks were up there, but I was staring at her.
And I just knew.
Well. See, all my girlfriends, are always a reaction to the one I had last.
Janet was so opinionated about my art, it drove me crazy.
So I found Sally, who refuses to be judgemental about it.
Meanwhile she's trying to psychoanalyse me.
So she is not the one either.
Maybe you should go after her?
Girl like that. She's a model, she's probably got guys fallen all over her
Guys with big portfolios.
Yeah, I think it's kinda childish idea.
Chasing a dream.
Hi, your billboard on Delmar & Wicker's, the one on the side of the building?
Yeah, whose ad agency is that?
No, no, no... Next to the Casino Queen billboard.
The girl with the phone, says: "There is another choice."
Blank?! No, no It can't be blank.
I was just there.
I just saw it.
No, I just saw it!
Hey, what is the sign on the right said?
What, are you nuts?
It's blank, man.
Neal Oliver.
Your appointment has been scheduled on tomorrow.
September 25th. 10 AM. 555 Olive Street.
Suite 1300.
No rescheduling.
Neal Oliver, your appointment...
- Who is this?
Hello?
Hello?
10 AM. 555 Olive Street.
Suite 1300, no rescheduling.
Morning, Mr. Oliver.
Wasn't sure that you'd actually show up.
Not everyone does.
Ray?
I've got a job for you.
If you want it.
Drive cross country.
Deliver a package.
Right, what the hell is going on here Ray?
Because I'm seeing things on signs...
In fortune cookies...
I mean, in weird messages...
Black Hearts, or red Spades.
I told you, you can see them now.
What's it all about?
It's all about you, Neal.
It's all about you.
Here's the job.
Misspelled Denver.
Did I now?
OK, so why me?
Why not FedEx?
What's in here, any way?
Can't really say.
You can't really say, because you don't know, or you do know, and don't want me to know?
Either way, the result is the same.
So what's this job pay?
Can't really say.
What's the catch?
Or you can't say that either?
Alwayes wanted the answers, aren't you?
Consider it, an interesting way to break in the new century.
Or simply, a way to break in that new car.
Before the Bradford interview.
How do you know about that?
Open it.
Sit down.
Here'e the deal.
If you walk out of here with that package, you agree to deliver it.
You don't loose it, you don't open it, and you don't try to find out what's inside it.
You'll be compensated on the other end.
Go by way of Interstate 60.
Delivery date is October 2nd.
So you'll have time to visit some towns, meet some people.
See what's out there.
Pick up some travellers' tales.
High way experiences.
Episodes of the Road.
This is too surreal.
I mean, you, this office, the 13th floor of a building that has no 13th floor
My alarm clock's gonna go off any second.
Rise and shine.
You're awake Neal.
Could be you're awake for the first time in your life.
It's our standard form.
And I'll need you to seal it with the drop of your blood.
Blood?
Of course.
I'm the DEVIL.
Just kidding.
Tradicionally, a man means what he says, he'll put his blood where his mouth is.
All right.
Oh, one more thing.
There's a killer out there.
So be careful
Now you tell me?
After I sign?
The journey of life always includes a possibility of death.
This killer, what does he look like?
-Who said it's a man?
- It's a woman?
It's not this Robin Fields, is it?
I know... you can't really say.
I didn't mispell the name of that town.
You'll find it.
Just go west on Interstate 60.
Look, we've been over this.
There is no Intestate 60.
There's US 60.
But there is no Interstate 60.
Look... there's got to be.
Well look at here. Here is 70.
The next major route south is 40.
So if there was an I 60, it would have to be some where between 70 and 40.
But, as you can see, it's not there.
It simply doesn't exist.
Where do you find a highway, that doesn't exist?
Well, I decided to look where it'd be if it did exist.
Ray said that you don't find hidden places, by sticking to the well travelled routs
So, I skipped well travelled Interstate 55, and went south on Boob Dylan's highway 61.
And there she was again.
Telling me, I was right.
I was fast becoming a believer in signs.
It's you I'm delivering this package, isn't it?
You're Robin Fields.
Now it makes all sense.
Cool. Very cool.
Very, very cool.
You are the waiter, from my birthday party
O.W. Grant.
Neal Oliver.
It's a strange coincidence, seeing you here again.
Only if you believe in coincidence.
I prefer inevitability.
Every event is inevitable.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't happen.
Right.
Oh, I forgot to give you, your birthday present.
Remember your wish?
An answer.
- Yeah
- That's great.
Yeah, gets greater.
Go on, go ahead. Try it.
Yes or No questions.
OK, hmmm...
Eight ball, is there an Interstate 60?
I told you, it'd get greater.
Who are you mister?
The O.W stands for One Wish.
That's what I do.
I grant wishes.
One to a customer.
Your was more interesting, then most.
Open ended.
Signifies thought instead of greed.
That's what I get most of the time. gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme this, gimme that...
Usually money, or sex, or easy living.
How I deliver.
Yeah, that depends on what mood i'm in.
Eight Ball, is this guy bull-shitting me?
Come on.
Let's find that road.
Now, one young couple wished to be married.
Live happily ever after.
So I blew up their car.
At the church, on the way to the honeymoon.
Another guy. He wanted great perfect sex every day, with his choice of gorgeous women. No pregnancies.
So...
Everyday there is a FedEx delivery... of a skin magazine... box of tissues.
There's the Stop sign.
Turn right.
There is a sign post, up ahead.
Son of a bitch.
I found it.
It was inevitable.
So, I thought all Interstates were divided highways, with limited access.
No, when highway doesn't officially exist.
The rules don't apply.
OK, so how is it, we're on a highway, that is on any map, going to a towns, that presumably don't exist?
Well, there are unlisted phone numbers, right?
So, why can't there be unlisted highways and towns?
I don't buy it.
There's got to be a better explanation, than that.
Better explanation.
OK. How about it's a... parallel dimension.
Or you're in a dream.
Or it has something to do with your wish.
Or... you're in a coma from when that bucket hit you.
Or maybe... just maybe...
You're dead.
Well?
Well, what do you want kid?
I just gave you not one explanation, but six.
All reasonable.
You want an answer, pick one.
It want change anything.
You, you took a job, and now you got to do it.
Yeah, but it could change something.
So, what if I'm dead?
What if I'm dead, right now.
There is no reason, why shouldn't drive on oncoming traffic, right?
OK, go ahead.
Try it.
But that's way you accelerated in way of the big semi, coming at us, which should be in about 25 seconds, I figure.
Come to this.
Now, if you are dead...
Then, this is the after life, and you made a deal with a guy, sealed in blood, who knew everything about you, even what you are going to say, before you said it.
Now who do you think, that guy might be?
And... do you think it is a good idea to piss him of?
Maybe you got a point.
Maybe I do.
Oh, I love this highway.
Me?
I consider myself an artist, too.
I see life, as.. art appreciation.
You know, some artist can't stand the sight of their work once it's finished.
Me, I'm one of my own biggest fans.
And one of my favourites, will be coming through that door... any moment..
Now.
Yeah, can I take your order?
15 double-cheeseburgers, please.
15 double-cheese to go.
Oh, not to go.
I'll eat them here.
Hold the order.
You're going to eat 15 double-cheeseburgers, all by your self?
Yeah.
Why, they are real big?
You think 15 to many?
Way to many.
All right. Twelve then.
Even dozen.
Look, are you drunk or something, mister?
Well I don't know.
Can you get drunk on six beer?
Hay fella.
I've got a hundred says that you can't eat six double-cheese, as much less twelve.
So, what you're saying is, they're really big cheeseburgers?
My hundred says you can't eat six double-cheese.
Well, I'm kinda hungry. maybe you're right.
Twelve is to many burgers.
I'll tell you what?
Make it two double-cheese, three orders of fried chicken, one BLT, two ham & Swiss on rie, chicken fried steak,
Turkey club, and two bolls chilli extra onions.
And one piece of each of those pies.
One piece of each of these pies?
Anything else?
Three order onion rings.
That's much more sensible lunch, than twelve double-cheeseburgers.
Oh, and hold the pickles.
100 bucks.
If you can finish all that food, in one hour.
Without getting up from that counter, and without losing your lunch.
I'm not much of a betting man.
Two to One odds then...
No, no, I'll give you Three to One.
That's 300 to mine... against 100 to yours.
Well, what the Hell.
It's only money.
Hal...
You better hold onto this money.
Sure.
Yeah, I'll take some of that.
Eight Ball, is this guy gonna really eat all that food?
Can I hmm...
Can I get on this action?
Ask him.
No I like long shots.
You're crazy your knees.
My money just ass good, right.
Hell about me.
Sir, you want to drink anything with that?
There's your order.
All right. It's 13:10.
On your mark... Get set...
Wait.
Ketchup, please.
Thanks.
All right... What's the trick?
Trick?
Where is the food?
Can't all be in your stomach.
Actually, I don't know.
The fact is, I always loved eating.
More than anything.
Go into a restaurant, want to order everything on the menu.
But, I was always frustrated, by the small capacity of my stomach.
Well, 17 years ago,
I made a wish...
And amazingly enough it came true.
Now I have, what you might call, a black hole in my belly.
Onely I have to keep eating like this, six or seven times a day.
Gets expensive.
So, I travel a lot, and take advantage of guys like you to pay for it.
That's a good one.
Excuse me, mister.
I've got to know one thing.
Do you still love eating?
No... now it's a drag.
Listen kid...
Nobody minds money taken by that guy, he gave us good show for our money.
But I draw a line over what you did.
What did I do?
I just bet the right horse, that's all.
You run on it. I know a hustle when I see one.
I played a hunch, I swear to God.
I've never seen that guy before in my life
But your friend, there has.
Haven't you fella?
Oh, I wont deny it.
Now, get back the money you stole, son.
Look sir, I won a couple of bets.
If that's such a crime why don’t we call the police.
I am the police.
Sorry about that.
That's all my money.
Hit the rode, fellas.
OK, so what's your game Mr Grant.
'cause it seems like you know exactly what's gonna happen, just before it happens, and it's just like fucking with me!
Oh, don't take it personal kid.
I fuck with everybody.
That's what I do.
If I tie highly recommend it as an unending source of amusement.
And as far as knowing what's gonna happen.
Well... on this highway, the past, the present, the future, the "What if some maybe's, the roads not taken", could all converge, get jumble up.
I just happen to be tuned into it.
That's all.
So what are you?
Like an Angel or God, or something?
Just, picking up certain people to give him a wish?
No... no, just a guy who likes to mess with peoples heads.
I'm a Joker... in life's deck.
But, why do it?
I enjoy it.
You should always find something to do, that you enjoy.
Although I will admit I have been considering a career change.
Job in a convenience store...
Or maybe becoming... a male prostitute.
You're gay?
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- Yeah.
Fact is I'm a virgin.
I always will be.
My penis... was cut off in a very weird accident, when I was nine.
Yeah, right.
You want to see it?
Yeah... show me.
Holy shit.
Oh, God...
Oh, let me tell you, the world is very different pace, when you're not constantly thinking about sex. or responding sexually to everything...
Yeah.
I go to guess that'd would be.
Wait, how would you know?
How would you know, what it's like to not have something, you never had?
Now you're thinking.
You'd be surprised, how many people take that statement on faith.
Sounds right, so they just except it.
As I say.
Messing with peoples heads, can be a lot of fun.
You should try it.
Some nice scenery coming up ahead.
Hello then... you're going my way?
If you're going west.
Then, that's my way.
Hey, why don't you hop in the back, because huggy here is gonna wanna take a good luck at me, and if I'm in the front, he'll have a better view.
And if you're in the back... so will you.
I'm Laura.
Neal.
Oh, and that's Mr. Grant.
So, where you going Laura?
Me?
Oh, I'm going to a... find a perfect fuck.
Wow, that's an interesting destination.
Yeah, ever been there?
- Can't say that I have.
- Me either.
But so far the trip's been pretty exciting.
Only, how will you know, when you've gotten there?
That is the problem.
It's actually become my obsession, but you don't need to here about it.
Sure, sure I do.
The first time, wasn't that great.
I'm thinking:
This is it?
This is what all these songs are written about?
I mean, talk about hype.
Second time was a little bit better.
Third time, now that was a hot time.
Forth time, not as good as the third time.
But once I've done it enough to have all these expiriences to compare, just drove me nuts.
I mean, what if the best one was right around the corner?
You know, how much better, would the perfect one be?
So this became my quest.
No, there is times, when wish I've gone to the convent.
But my obsession, becomes your opportunities.
You little stun muffin.
You want to take advantage of a girl that can't say no?
Any guy turned you down before?
Not unless he was gay.
OK...
What number would I be?
But I have got a very, very good hearing about you, and there's something very, very special.
- I think I'm gonna pass, Laura.
- What do you mean, you will pass?
Guys don't pass.
Oh, I'm clean, there is no disease, if that's what you're worried about.
I've got condoms... all best kinds.
Come on Neal... stick it to me.
I'm not doing it. Period.
So, you just.
You are not man enough?
You meet a real woman and you turn in to a wuss?
Think you want measure up, hmmm?
Well, you'll never know, will you?
Because if I don't do it...
I want be number 2000 and whatever.
I'll be number One.
That one guy.
Guy you will remember for the rest of your life.
You stay up at night, thinking about me, wondering,
Was he the One?
The answer is yes.
I am the perfect fuck.
The one you never had...
Perfect on every way...
Look, stop it, stop it...
This is Zen thing, it's amazing...
I've never been perfect in anything before.
Well, you can fuck me.
A mind fuck, and it was terrible.
It was good for me.
What about you Mr.?
I'll bet, you're a real man.
You're man enough to be in my book?
Oh, Hell yes.
Put me down in there.
But I sometimes got little troubles... getting excited.
Let me take care of that baby.
Now, that's a museum you'd really appreciate.
What is it? A bunch of bogus paintings
Stop in Renburg.  Have a look.
You'll find it very... thought provoking.
450 mile to  Danver.
Quarter tank of gas, and no money.
Well, when Columbus set sail, he didn't know if it had any wind.
Stop!
Help. Stop!
Jesus lady...
Help my, please, my son... took my car and run off.  I think he's in Banton.
Will you take me there?
I've got to find him.
Look I'm sorry, but I'm not going that way.
I'll pay you... $53.
It's all I have just take me to Banton.
Help my find my son, please.
You need money.
She shows up.
Coincidence?
All right lady, hop in. I'll take you.
- Thank you
Well, I'll hop out.
You're gettin' in tune with the highway.
Say, that's important.
Good luck Neal.
Hey, wait a minute. Am I gonna see you again?
Always wanting an answer.
Well, maybe you'll find it in Banton.
I'll pay you the rest, when we'll find Philip.
Oh, I'm Susan Ross.
Neal Oliver.
- So, how old is Philip, Susan?
He's my baby.
He's all I have.
He's run away before, but he's always come back.
God I am so scared...
What if I never find him?
- Well, did you call the Police?
- They say I should look in Banton
It's not like I've been a bad mother. it's just... so hard when you're all alone.
We're gonna find him Susan.
We'll find him.
It is illegal to sell, consume, or transport Euphoria,
beyond the city limits, under penalty of law.
Be warned, it is highly addictive.
Even in small doses.
Withdraw from Euphoria, has known to cause injury and death.
All responsible citizens, are urged to avoid this drug at all costs, and stay in the Euphoria-free zones.
Euphoria is legal in Banton, and is distributed within the Banton city limits.
- However ...
What kind of town is this?
 it is illegal to sell, consume ..
Maybe we should talk to the Police?
Come on.
16-year-old, in town with legal drugs, and a rave.
Sorry, but I don't think he'll be at the library.
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes...
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes.
First timers?
Are you aware, that Euphoria is being distributed inside, that it is dangerous, and addictive substance, and it is strongly advised not to partake of it?
Well, how can we not be?
Go on.
You'll need this.
No, thanks.
Don't be stupid.
This is the answer.
This is to everything.
And you really need it.
Susan!
He's over here.
Philip.
Oh, thank God, we've found you.
Please, let's go home.
Chill ma, I am home.
See this? This is the place.
The happiest place on earth.
You can't stay here.
You have to come home.
But Mom!
Who's this?
New stud boyfriend?
Sure can pick 'em.
- You've got school.
- Fuck school.
I've got Euphoria.
Here, try some mom, the best.
Philip.
You can't stay here.
Yo, I'm in legal age here.
I can do anything I want.
I want... Euphoria.
You stole my car.
It's in the impound yard. Take it.
I don't want it.  Eat it.
No, you take me there.
Go away. Leave me alone
Hey, what's a matter with you?
What's going on her?
Hey, now break it up.
Philip come home.
- That's it.
- Philip! Philip! Please come home.
The fact is ma'am, here your son's legal age.
He wants to stay...
He can't be forced to leave.
And...
He wants to stay.
No, they all do.  They're addicts.
But he's just a boy.
He didn't know what he was doing.
Oh, no no.
He knew.
They all knew, that's why there are all those warnings posted all over town.
Yeah, but if this drug is so addictive, why is it legal?
Son...
This town had serious drug problem.
And all the problems that go along with it.
We tried everything.
Punishment for dealing, punishment for using.
More enforcement, tougher enforcement, jail, hell, public humiliation.
But, it all came down to one thing.
Some folks...  just wanna get high.
So...
We came up with a radical solution...
Euphoria.
Synthetic drug.  Potent, legal, and totally addictive, and we warn everyone, not to use it.
But like I said, some folks just wanna get high.
One hit of this, and you are hooked.
And we own them.
Camp controls the supplies so of course we can set the prize, and we made it very affordable.
Live in our camps, eat our food, and ... you know, just do a couple of off jobs, pick up spome trash, mow the lawn, clean some toilets, and you get your Euphoria.
And at night, man... party till you drop.
The thrall is so intense, that everybody pays the price.
It's an incredible achievement, really.
Drug so powerful that it sublimates the sex drive.
You know, how many rapes we had here last year?
None.
Are you saying Philip's going to be cleaning toilettes for the rest of his life?
With no sex drive?
He'll never marry.
I'll never have grandchildren?
It's ironic, isn't it?
Americans fought a war for freedom... another one to end slavery.
What someone would choose to do with their freedom?
Become slaves.
But they're human beings.
They have rights.
They didn't know what they be given up.
They made a choice.
But look at them.
They seem miserable to you?
They live a simple, happy life.
No decisions... no responsibilities...
No problems...
They found their answer.
You so sure, that your life is better than theirs?
It's like they’re animals.
Oh yeah, we're all animals.
Just that, some of us have different priorities.
That's all.
Whatever your priorities are,
Banton is a really nice place to live.
No, it's a nightmare.
Please, I want my son back.
I'll do anything.
All right than.
It comes down to three choices.
One.
You move here to the Euphoria free zone, and that way, you at least have the chance to see him.
Hell, some parents end up having their children work for them.
Kind of perverse pay back.
Two. You go home.
Try to find something else to make your life worth a while.
Or three...
Join the party.
What should I do?
You're smart... tell me what to do.
I don't know.
I guess, if it was me...
I'd want to see my boy.
But he doesn't want to see me.
Oh, my God...
It's wonderful...
I... feel so... beautiful...
I never knew, I can be so... happy.
Well, how about you son?
You want some?
No thanks.
I'll pass.
It's Ives here.
We've got a rookie in my office, and I've short shifted the cleaning gall again.
Send in the zoo keeper.
- Roger that
Well, guess you'll need a hotel room for the night.
Plus, you get... a 300 dollars finders fee.
Finders fee?
Yeah, for her.
You've just increased our labour-pool.
We pay for that, around here.
What's the matter son?
Somebody offers you an advantage... take it.
I took the room, but not the money.
I couldn't.
And even then I didn't sleep very well.
I never got the rest of the 53 bucks, but, given the dynamics of Interstate 60,
I wasn't concerned.
I knew something would be just down the road.
It was inevitable.
What did concern me, was whether something else was inevitable.
Eight Ball, should I be worried about this.. killer?
Can you be more specific?
Figures.
The inevitable something down the road, was 20 miles ahead, and he was quite the character.
What's the deal there, mister?
Hey, Bob Cody.
I don't drive.
And I don't like to hitch-hike.
When hitch-hike, I'm at the mercy of the driver.
But when I pay for the ride, I'm the employer, and I call the shots.
That's how I like it.
So.. you wonna work for me?
Well, I'm going to Danver.
I wouldn't mind making some money.
Good. I'm going to Renburg.
It's on your way.
Here's mine proposition.
You pay for gas, pay for your meals.
No alcohol while you're on payroll.
I pick radio stations.  I initiate all conversations.
I'll pay you ten dollars cash every hour.
And the mileage money, when we get to Renburg.
In all other matters...
You play straight with me, I'll play straight with you.
So, we have a contract?
We have a contract.
So, who is my new employee?
Neal Oliver.
Mr. Oliver, you may call me Mr. Cody.
Or Sir.
You got it, Sir.
He was going to Renburg.
The museum of art fraud was in Renburg.
Coincidence?
I knew then that I'd had to check out that museum.
It was inevitable.
Mr. Cody had rather unique tastes in audio stimulation.
The choice is clear. The Orient 620.
The American made car, for American made drivers...
See, that's a lie.
Orient engines are made in Japan.
Guilt Signal.
The movie everyone's talking about...
That's another lie.
We're not talking about it.
We're the United State's Post Office.
We care...
Oh, that's the biggest whopper of all.
You know, sometimes only that chairman will do.
I get no kick from champagne...
(Frank Sinatra's - Kick out of you)
There's an advert I can't figure.
What's warmer, the weather, the water... girl?
She's pretty, though.
She's Robin Fields.
She's gorgeous.
Sir.
Well, you know her?
Not yet.
I'm meeting her in Danver.
You're a lucky man.
Yeah, to be honest, I'm a little nervous about it...
Cos', you know, what am I gonna say?
How do you start a conversation with the girl of your dreams, without coming off like a total dork?
Don't say anything.
Let her start.
That's, a good idea.
Sit back.
Listen to sweet musical tones of her voice.
Son, you got a bag.
Yes sir, I do.
 I get a kick out of youuuuuuuuuu....

Now there's a sign that's telling the truth, for a change.
Yeah, looks like a motel to me.
No, Frontier... ever hear of
Frederick Turner Mr Oliver?
No sir.
Well, he was an historian.
About a hundred years ago, he came up with the theory about the Frontier.
Said, the Frontier was a... safety valve for civilization.
Place for people to go, to keep them from going mad.
So... wherever were folks, who couldn't fit in with ways things were...
Nuts, malcontents, extremists...
They'd packed up and head for the frontier.
So America got started.
All the crackpots and trouble makers in Europe, packed up, and went to a frontier, which became, The Thirteen Colonies...
When some people couldn't fit in with that, they moved further west.
Which is why all the nuts eventually ended up in California.
Turner died in 1932, so ...
He was around long enough to see what would happen to the World, when we ran out of frontier.
Some people say, we had a frontier in the mind.
And they go off and explore the wonderful world of alcohol, and drugs, but, that's no frontier.
It's just another way for us to fool ourselves...
And we've created this phoney frontier with computers.
Which allows people to think they’ve escaped...
Frontier with access fees...
What about Space?
The final frontier?
Ah, Star Trek isn't Space.
That's television.
Find fuckin' frontier, that is.
Besides, how many folks can just pack up, and go to space?
Naah, the frontier is right here.
Interstate 60.
That's why it was put here.
Give people, who wanted a little different, place to go.
Is that really true Mr Cody?
If it isn't... it should be.
Excuse me... Excuse me...
Excuse my...
Can you help me out mister?
Will work for food, eh?
OK...
Here's an apple, food.
Now, I'd like you washed that man's windshield.
Work.
Hey man.  I ain't gonna wash his windshield for no apple.
Oh, excuse me.
It doesn't say "might work for food",
It doesn't say "restricted menus", it says
"will work for food".  This is food,
That's work.
What's the problem?
I ain't doin' it, that's all.
Now, let's be honest.
You don't want to work.
You just want a hand out, so you can buy booze.
And nothing wrong with that.  Drinking... that's a great human tradition.
And if you'd been straight about it,
I'd bought you some Chevas.
But by holding up that sign.
You made an employment agreement.
Which I intend to hold you to.
Now...
There's the apple, you wash that car.
Fuck you man.
I don't want your fuckin’ apple, so I don't gotta wash that fuckin’ car.
Here's what I think of your fuckin’ apple.
Well, now since you've took my food.
You gotta wash that car.
Wash it.
- Mr. Cody, this is really unimportant.
-Yes it is.
This jerk out here lying in writing?!
I don't tolerate lying from any one!
Especially not in writing.
You!
Watch the damn car.
You, shot the fuck up!
Or I'm gonna cut you.
You all get out of here, now!
I'm gonna call the sheriff.
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
You see, I've got lung cancer.
I'm terminal, six months to live.
Only...
I'm not going out in a hospital.
It's dynamite.
Enough to take out everything in radius of 150 yards.
I don't take two farts in a martini, if I go now or later.
But if you do, you'd better wash that car.
OK, OK mister... I'll clean it for you.
No!
He's got to do it.
What are you nuts?
Wash the windshield.
Clean it!
Wash the car.
OK, OK! I'll wash it, all right!
Turn it of.
You'd rather call the sheriff, and have that guy shot through the head. He's crazy.
I've got much simpler solution.
Grab your cote, and snatch your hat.
Leave your worries on the door step.
Just direct your feet, to the sunny side of the street.
Say what you mean, mean what you say.
You know, if everybody followed that rule, there would be a lot less trouble.
Now, we still have a contract Mr. Oliver.
Sure hope, you're not thinking of breaking that contract.
Thinking about it?
Yes.
Doing it?
No, sir.
That's a very honest response.
That's a breath of fresh air.
Cigarette?
No, Thank you sir. I don't smoke.
I like cigarettes.
Package says they cause cancer, and they do.
Say what you mean, mean what you say.
Nor, for one, for cigarettes,
I don't know where I'd be today.
I used to be in advertising.
I got paid for lying.
And one day, a little boy died because of one of those lies.
Well, that fried me.
So, when I got my nicotine death sentence,
I decided to make the rest of my time count.
Put and end on some of those lies.
Now, for the first time on my life,
I'm fulfilled, I'm content.
Lung cancer.
Is now without its benefits.
I couldn't decide if he was for real, or bluffing.
Totally sane or completely nuts.
Maybe the dynamite was fake, or the detonator was.
Or... maybe not.
As Grant would say, lots of answers, all of them reasonable.
I did know that I liked it.
That was for sure.
Sunny side of the streeeeeeeeeeeeeeet......

Mister Oliver.
You're one of the best employees I've ever had.
I'm giving you a tip.
And my card.
You ever want to work for me again.
You call that number.
It's mine direct line.
- Good luck with that girl.
- Thank you sir.
The Museum of Art Fraud was only three blocks away.
That Interstate 60 dynamic was clearly at work again.
And my own curiosity was definitely piqued.
Oh, you must be Douglas.
Oh, thank goodness,
I'm so glad to see you.
I didn't think you were coming.
I mean, the agency called to cancel.
I'm Mrs. James. The owner.
Hi Mrs. James...
And today we're viewing the originals, and right now...
I know you're confused...
But if you do as I say,
I'll give you a hundred dollars.
Late Mr. James was most proud of five original masterpieces in this room.
Rarely seen, and per his wishes never photographed.
Monet...Cezanne...
Van Gogh... Renoir...
Degas...
Each is valued in the millions.
No less then Bill Gates and
Warren Buffet have attempted to buy them.
Of course they're not for sale.
Now if we can proceed this way...
Now, take the paintings down very carefully, remove them from the frames.
And then, after that... put them on the easels out here.
Today you're going to be my nephew Edward.
Now, just follow my lead, and go with the flow.
This way please.
Welcome ladies and gentlemen...
Welcome to our gallery of affordable reproductions...
It was my late husband's request,
That none of his five original masterpieces, ever be photographed or reproduced in any book or catalogue.
So, we offer these copies...
Rendered by my nephew Edward.
At the modest cost of $350 a piece.
And if you have any questions, please, don't hesitate... to ask either one of us.
How long did it take you to do them?
How long?
I knocked them out all in a week.
I can tell.
Some of your brush work is rather uneven...
Well, you get what you pay for.
It's decent craftsmanship, perhaps a little slick.
Lacks the artist's sole.
Yeah, but I'm just an amateur.
It's shameful.
Cezanne would roll over in his grave, to see such a mockery of his work.
Well, let's be glad for both our sakes, that he won't see it.
Well, you've heard it from the experts.
You have no talent whatsoever.
Well, I've never been more flattered.
My late husband’s desire.
Was that his masterpieces be owned by people who will enjoy them.
Not trophy collectors.
Thus our charade.
But do you know, in eight years
I have yet to sell a painting.
Why don't you donate them to an art museum?
Oh, upon my death, clones of them will be donated.
Clones?
Oscar was an art collector, dealer.
Technical genius... and a practical joker, and wealthy enough to indulge in his most outrageous whims.
He developed a process where by, he could duplicate a painting almost on a molecular level.
He would borrow a grate master from a museum, and duplicate it, and often send back the copy.
And he was never found out.
A Stary Night... the original.
The one in New York is a clone.
This Monet... the art world thinks that the original is in Paris.
Unbelievable.
So there're all originals?
So what one do, with a collection like this?
You tell everyone they're fakes.
And so, just before he died, Oscar created this.
The Museum of Art Fraud.
The worlds grates art museum.
Masquerading as a cheap tourist attraction.
Oh, my God... that's...
My husband... Oscar Warren James.
Of course.
I must say, I was feeling pretty damn good.
Hell I was feeling inspired.
I wanted to deliver the package, and then I wanted to go out and paint.
And I wished I could go back in time, and enter a piece in Conrad Competition.
But... I'd had my one wish.
And I couldn't look back.
Hot and Cool.
I'm getting warmer, I'm getting colder.
Of course.
Eight Ball, that girl is not in Danver and her name is not Robin, isn't it?
Is she in Morlaw?
So, if I go there, will I find her?
So there it was...
The proverbial fork in the road.
My job. The word I'd given.
The contract I'd signed.
Versus the lovely Lynn.
The girl of my dreams.
Her musical voice in my head, leading me ...
Where?
So what did I do?
I did what any self respecting hopeless romantic would do.
I rationalized.
Five days to go 158 miles.
I got time to chase a dream, right Eight Ball?
Good answer.
Drivers Licence.
What did I do, officer?
Nothing.
You're served.
You're being sued by Mr. J.J. Madison, for your responsibility ... in a hit and run kill of his pat cat Snickers, three weeks ago in front of the Courthouse.
But I've never been here before.
I was in St. Louis three weeks ago.
Tell it to the judge.
I'm just process serving.
Meanwhile I suggest you head to the town and hire yourself a lawyer...
You're gonna need one.
But first... park your car in that lane over there, by the lake, you can get sued for polluting the air.
Hey Mr., I'm really good, check it out
Stanford, class of 88.
Suma cum laude, but more important I know the angles.
You don't need a lawyer.
You need a good lawyer, and that's me.
Parkinson, and that's the only name you need to remember.
These other guys...
- I'm uninterested.
- Valerie McCabe. Year of 91.
I've got special rates for visitors.
And I know I can win your case.
You don't even know my case.
The Madison case?
Happens to visitors all the time.
Fact is, J.J Madison doesn't even have a cat.
He's allergic.
I can have it thrown out in no time.
Wait. He never had a cat?
So why he's gonna sue somebody for it?
Because he can.
What?
Every adult citizen of Morlaw, is a lawyer.
So everybody sues everybody else.
It doesn't matter if there is a cause.
It's how we make sure that everybody makes a living off the profession.
Yeah, but that's insane.
I can sue you for that.
You just made a defamatory remark about this town.
Hey, are you looking at my legs.
I can sue you for that too.
Sexual harassment.
Is there anything you can't sue me for?
Hire me. That way everything between us is subject to attorney-client privilege.
I'm $75 an hour. First hour is free.
Well, at least you know my case.
All right. You're hired.
I’m suing you Valerie...
For the sexual enticement or the appearance thereof of the potential client on the public thoroughfare.
He only hired you, because he found you sexually attractive.
Hurry. My office.
We can get lots a dozen more law suits, just walking down the street.
This will be essential.
Shouldn't make more then a couple of weeks.
Weeks?
No, no, no.
I have to be in Danver on October 2nd.
It can't take that long.
That's not long.
Long is our City limit sign.
We've been trying to get knew one put up for five years now.
But we forgot a file an environmental impact report, and as metal in signpost ... is a potentially hazardous substance.
We're in court over that.
And another lawyer is challenging the census figure on the sign.
And another lawyer said we had to do another land survey to determine the exact city limits, so we know precisely where to put the sign.
So we brought an Surveyor.
But he got sued for smoking, and wasn't enjoined from finishing the survey.
I say we're at least two years, from a new sign.
And you chose to live here?
I wouldn't live anywhere else.
Every day is a new challenge.
A new precedent.
A new interpreting of the law.
It's an intellectual feast.
So if everyone who lives here is a lawyer,
How do you live?
I mean, who runs the grocery store...
Who does your dry cleaning...
Who fixes the shitter, when it breaks?
Well, we all moonlight on a law related jobs.
Police, bailiffs, court reporters...
But those other trivial things, you mentioned?
They're done by people like you.
Awaiting trial.
It's the only way they can afford their legal fees.
Now, I can get you a hearing on Monday October 1st.
Meanwhile...
We'll have to call witnesses, to testify as your character.
You know, Family.
Friends.
So, that you can qualify for your employment program.  It'll help keep cost down.
So tomorrow morning, why don't you get me their names and numbers,and I'll subpena them.
Well, even if they could get here...
Wouldn't they get sued too?
Of course.
But you'll identify them, and their problems will fall on your shoulders, which means more work for me.
I have those phone numbers
They're in my car.
I'm gonna go get them.
And I'm gonna make few calls, and be right back.
No you won’t.
Fred... Mr. Oliver is a potential fugitive.
- Lock him up.
- Lock me up?
Of course.
We lawyers have to protect out livelihood.
Hey, you can't do this to me.
I have rights.
I know you do, sweetie.
I'm here to protect them.
I couldn't even blame the Eight Ball.
It said a meeting was possible.
Yeah, right...
A meteor wiping out Morlaw was possible too.
Probably more possible than ever meeting Lynn.
Lynn!
Over here!
I'm gonna get you out!
I'm gonna get you out!
In order to get her out,
I had to get me out.
But jailbreak, was clearly not happening.
Ditto for a tunnel job.
I needed an answer, and my Eight ball was in the car.
Damn it.
There had to be a way, to blow this thing wide open.
And then I knew.
My lawyer needed a character witness.
I needed a witness who was a character.
Please, state your name and occupation.
Robert Wilson Cody.
I'm... what you might call it an axe grinder.
Mr. Cody... please, tell the court how you know the defendant.
He was my employee.
And how would you characterize him?
Honest. Trustworthy. Intelligent.
Ask him if he's aware that the charge against me is a lie, and that everyone here knows it.
It's immaterial.
He can only testify as the character.
Just ask him.
The judge will pull it immaterial.
You ask him... or I'll fire you.
Mr. Cody...
Are you aware that the charge against Mr. Oliver is not only a complete lie, but that the judge, the plaintiff and every citizen here know it?
Objection! Immaterial.  It has nothing to do with the character of the accused.
Sustained.
Wait a minute miss...  You'rer saying that this is a trumped-up charge...
And you're all in on it?
Immaterial.
The witness is ordered to ignore the question.
Well, I'm not going to ignore it, your honour.
If, what she says is true, that's a very serious matter.
Well, serious or not, it's immaterial to this hearing.
Next question.
Oh, judge, I asked her a question... and I want an answer.
You don't ask here questions Mr. Cody.
You answer them.
And if you wont do what I told you to do,
I will hold you in contempt.
Hey, I'm not answering any more questions, until somebody answers mine.
Why don't you tell me judge... are you in on a lie here?
I fine you 500 dollars for contempt.
Answer my God dam question, judge.
1000 dollars and 90 days in jail.
Bailiff, sergeant,
Put Mr. Cody in a cell.
Hold the go, boys.
This is dynamite.
We'll all go with a bang, if anyone takes another step towards me...
Gentlemen, just drop your guns.
Everyone else, stay seeted.
Judge... stick your finger up your nose.
I'm not kidding.
I'm terminally ill and I'll gladly take you all with me to hell right now.
Judge! I said, stick your finger up your nose.
You'd better do it judge.
I know this buy...
He says what he means; he means that he says.
I'm glad we understand, who's in charge now.
So judge..
This whole deal was a lie.
Is that right?
Keep that finger in your nose.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Yes... sir.
All right.
Show our hands...
How many here knew that it was a railroad job against Mr. Oliver?
Liers... Lawyers.
Mr. Oliver...
How do we teach these... liars a lesson?
Now, read it judge.
By this order, all legal actions, charges, fines and fees, against any non citizen of Morlaw, in any matter pending before any Morlaw court,
I here by dismissed, and I declare an unconditional amnesty.
Thank you.
Bailiff.
Make a few hundred copies of that, and post it all over town.
You know this is an interesting town...
I think I might just stay here.
Any problem with that judge?
No... no problem.
Sir.
Lynn?
Hi... I'm Neal.
I'm the guy who got you out.
Yo, please to fuckin’ meet you, Neal.
Man, I've been so fucked up in here, for so long,
I thought,
I was never getting the fuck out.
Yo bitch!  I want back my fuckin’ cloths, you cocksucker's confiscated.
I shouldn’t be fuckin’ wearin’ this,
I'm on leash no more.
Hey, handsome...
What you looking at me like that for?
I just didn't expect you to talk that way.
What, something wrong with the way I fuckin’ talk?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I mean, YES.
Yes.
You make Mike Tyson sound like an Oxford graduate.
What do you like fuckin’ dissin' me?
You like saying that I never went to fuckin’ school, something?
Yes... that's exactly what I'm saying...
Don't worry.
It's just an act.
Well, it sort of a test, see.
Guys are always so eager to score points on me they would be like: Oh, no...
Lynn, no, the way you talk is charming.
Unique, refreshing, a breath of fresh air, yeah.
Air from the sewer, is more like it.
Me, I would... never go out with somebody who talked like that.
I'm glad you wouldn't either.
I hope you have a car.
I had to sell mine to pay my legal fees.
I have a car.
So, how many guys did told you that you sound cheap?
You're the first.
You know, you're better looking than I've expected.
Ditto.
Wait a minute... you've been expecting me?
Of course...
That's how the stories always go... the handsome prince rescues princess from the dungeon.
That was the point of the messages.
The messages?
Billboards.
My last name is Linden, by the way.
See, I knew somebody would figure out eventually.
At least that's what he told me.
Who?
O.W. Grant.
See, I made a wish to meet the right guy.
Although if I'd have known that I'd spend a year in jail waiting. Maybe I wouldn't have.
The prince has to undergo tests and challenges, so that the princes will be convinced that he's worthy.
And you passed mine.
So what's yours?
What? My test?
Come on. Everybody has the sympatica test.
Do you cut your grapefruit in half or peal it?
My? I peal it.
Favourite cartoon character?
Spider-man.
Thin or thick cross pizza?
I go for thin every time.
We're three to three.
I can't bel...
OK, Close encounters?
I would get on ship, no question.
What's wrong?
This is just... it's all to perfect.
I mean, you know...
You are.
You know, when something seems too good to be true?
Hold that thought.
You see?
I'm not that perfect.
Right. Right.
I feel much better now.
Ditto.
So, you actually wished for mister-right?
What can I say? I'm human.
Humans have certain needs.
Like companionship.
And you.
Did you wish for me?
Well, actually I wished for this.
Gives my answers.
But are they the right answers?
So far.
This were your billboards.
Obviously, I don't need them any more.
Maybe it's time for the... you know...
Happily ever after part.
Not quite.
I still have a job to finish.
Tomorrow October 2nd Danver.
Danver.
What's wrong?
Grant gave me an envelope.
He said if anyone was ever went to Danver I should open it.
I don't know if these message if for me or you.
Neal... don't go.
I gave my word, to this guy that I deliver this package. I have to.
Eight Ball, should I go to Danver?
Are you serious?
I'm serious.
You mean, you didn't sleep at all?
No, I couldn't.
I was possessed, by the views.
I love it.
- You're not just saying that?
- No.
It's got soul... passion...
Take me with you.
- What about the letter?
- Screw it. I want to go with you.
Eight Ball, should I take Lynn with me to Danver?
Bad idea.
Is that, because it's dangerous?
The killer, does it have to do with the killer?
I don't care if it's dangerous, or what this thing says.
I still want to go with you.
No, Lynn.
It would get me crazy...
I'm not  gonna risk losing you, not after I just found you.
What if I lose you?
Lynn you can't go.
The Ball is never wrong.
I'll come back, I promise.
Eight Ball, I will come back for her, won't I?
Yes.
You will come back for me.
Am I nuts?
The girl of my dreams, and I leave her behind, because of this stupid toy.
- What's up, officer?
- Just got word, there's a killer in the area.
Orders are to close the road.
What's this killer look like?
It's coming over the radio now.
The murder suspect is white, male, last seen driving a red BMW convertible,
along Interstate 60.
This vehicle has a white pains, splattered on the trunk lid.
You best turn around son.
It's not safe for you here.
It was ten miles before my heart rate was back in a double digits, and I can think straight.
Then I realised...
Eigtht Ball, is Lynn in danger from this killer?
Cellular service, is not available in this area.
Beamers suck. Jeep rule!
Oh, shit...
Oh shit...
Damn punks, and their paint again!
Calling the sheriff.
Here watch where they go.
- No, no, no. Please don't call the sheriff
- The hell I wont.
I'm sick of those punks making trouble around here.
Hey, come back with my binoculars!
Eight Ball, am I the killer?
Latest reports, indicate the suspect is carrying a murder weapon in a square box, wrapped in brown paper.
Once again, suspect is carrying a murder weapon in a square package in a ...
Oh no.
Shit!
Eight Ball, is the murder weapon in this box?
Should I open it?
Shit.
If it is a murder weapon,
I'm gonna get my finger prints all over it.
Eight Ball, I really need an answer right now.
What should I do?
Damn you!
Yes or No questions.
Come on Neal. Think. Be logical...
He called the cops...
So, which ever way they're going,
I've got to go the opposite way.
Well, it's got to be one way or the other.
Right Eight Ball? I mean, I got two choices here, so it's got to be one or the other. Right?
Take it to the Bank.
Sorry dad.
No, there is another choice.
Sheriffs and police in two counties have closed up Interstate 60 in both directions
 with the attend of boxing in the suspect, who was last seen driving red BMW convertible,
with white paint splattered on the trunks lid.
I knew this wasn't my kind of car.
What were the chances?
What were the chances, that the killer would be in a car, just like mine, and I get white paint on mine, just like his?
Now Grant would say, it was inevitable.
That at least once in a infinite universe, events would happen that way, and this was that time.
But Grant also said, on this highway, the past and the future, and what ifs and maybes can all get jumbled up.
So, I had to see for myself.
Hey! Get away from there!
Who was he?
They say he was some law student from St. Louis.
Went nuts, and killed his old man.
I love this highway.
Eight Ball, I've got a lot of questions.
Was that guy in the car...
What the hell I'm asking you for?
Robin Fields?
Is anybody here?
I'm here.
Ray?
- Delivery is for you.
- No, no, no.
I wouldn't hire you, to deliver package to myself.
It's for my cousin.
Here he is now.
Robin Fields.
One of my many synonyms.
Cousins?
You set in my car, with your own package.
- Why didn't you take it?
- Well, you made a deal.
What kind of guy would I be if I caused you to... violate your blood oath?
And, besides, it's the fact that you lost all your money... and you went to jail... you left to girl... ditched your car...
All, to bring this to me?
Makes it far more valuable.
Now it has... stories to go with it.
Well ...
Don't you want to know what's inside?
I did before, but... doesn't really matter now... 'cause, whatever it is... won't be as good as the stories.
Well seing as you understand that.
I'll open it.
You're not gonna light it?
I don't need to.
So, how's that new car?
Awesome?
Dad...
What's my favourite color?
Blue.
Why would you buy me a red Beamer?
Red's a great colour.
Specially for a convertible.
You know, my BMW's suppose been a great source of joy to me, so I just thought...
Happy birthday dad.
In the future, if you want to buy me a gift...
Buy me something I want.
Not something you want.
Son... it's a gift...
And if you don't accept it...
I will take it as a personal insult.
Well, in that case we're even.
Because I consider the gift itself, to me and to who I am.
How would you like it, if I bought you an easel and a paint box for your birthday?
I never thought of it that way.
Perhaps I could've given it a little more thought.
Thank you dad.
Apology accepted.
Now the Bradford thing.
I'm not going there.
- 'Cause I'm not going to law school...
- But son?
No buts, Dad.
This is your life, you made it, it works for you.
I've got to find something that works for me.
I'm sorry if you don't approve, but you can take that to the bank.
Well, I don't approve.
And it's time you face the truth about your art.
It's mediocre, look...
Neal... great news.
That piece, you entered in the Conrad Competition...
There's a very interested buyer, who wants to talk to you about it right now.
Come on. I'll take you.
No dad... that thing...
It's crap.
You got ripped off.
And it's upside down.
I must be feeling Alzheimer’s.  I don't remember entering anything into Conrad Competition.
You left it in motel.
I took the liberty of entering it for you.
Thank you, Mr...
Conrad...
Oh, you're welcome mister Oliver...
You're Neal Oliver...
I just love your painting.
Excuse my, I'm sorry...
I've just got this...
Major déjà vu about you.
No, no, no.
It's OK, I did too.
Big time.
I just love this...
It's got soul... passion...
- I'm...
- Lynn Linden.
Yeah, I know.
I'm with Danver publishing, we do.. prints, posters, and art books.
Well, it's maybe a little presumptuous of me, but would you consider doing a serious of motels, cafes, gas stations... all in this style?
It's exactly what I was thinking.
- My brother is really talented.
- Oh, he's gonna be fine.
Just fine.
He's got a great future ahead of him.
They both do.
Say... you have a birthday coming up, don't you?
Well, how do you know that?
Don't forget to make the wish.
"In the fourth month of the Year of the Snake...
...a child shall be chosen...
...to meld the two halves of the sacred medallion together as one.
And at his touch...
...the reborn shall be endowed...
...with extraordinary supernatural powers."
You've done well.
As agreed.
Pitiful.
Many people would pay more...
...to be the keeper of such a book.
The only pitiful thing in this room...
...is your life.
Okay.
Actually...
...you have been quite generous, yeah?
It's nobody you know, okay?
It's fish. See?
Happy now?
Cheers.
In English, please.
Stop wasting time, Giscard.
Pull around the back.
Inspector.
Positive ID on Giscard.
Kwun Yum Temple.
- And he's got company.
- Copy that.
Hold your position.
Pai Gow.
It's our guy.
All right, men.
- And Snakehead?
- Snakehead was not confirmed.
We should wait.
My intelligence says he's here...
...and Giscard is his number one.
We're going in.
I did not agree to this.
- We are supposed to be partners.
- This is an Interpol operation.
The Hong Kong
Police Department's...
...involvement is strictly a babysitting service.
You don't like it, take it up with your boss.
It's true.
Tell him we found it and we're in.
Full force, men.
Razor-sharp and all that.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
That's a temple. It's a holy place.
You cannot take guns in there.
Oh, right. Well, don't worry, Eddie, because you see these guns?
They're holey guns.
Because they make a rather big holey.
Holey. Do you get it? Holey.
All right.
Move out, men!
Move. Left, right, left, right.
Go, go, go.
Come on, keep up.
Inter...
Freeze!
Damn.
Keep up. Keep up. Keep up.
Interpol! Freeze!
The medallion.
You cannot come in he...
You will give me what I want.
What's that?
Check it out.
- Go that way.
- Got it.
Peter?
Eddie.
Interpol! Fre...
What the he...?
You okay?
This way, men.
Follow me. Down here.
It's the cops!
We've gotta go now!
I need more time.
- We haven't finished yet.
- It's too late.
- We'll try again later!
- Hong Kong Police!
Jai!
Hang on!
Eddie!
Snakehead! Upstairs!
Right!
Damn!
Four months' work!
What did he want in the temple?
He's a smuggler, Eddie. I don't know.
Perhaps he's found a buyer for black-market Buddhas. The point is...
...you let him get away.
Watson.
I also saw his face.
Interpol's all over me, and I can't stay here any longer.
You must bring me the boy in Dublin.
I trust you will make my continued...
Just bring me the boy.
Good job.
Okay, this is what I want.
All right, notify the team...
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
Got it. The Sea Horizon.
- Where are you keeping the boy?
- In a safe place.
Very good. Take me to him.
Up there. Okay.
- Where is he?
- Over here.
Wait. Put him down. Put him down!
Untie him. Don't hurt him.
Careful. Be careful.
Inspector, what's going on?
Snakehead's men.
Yes. Hello.
It's the boy.
Good morning, sir.
Show me the boy.
Oh. Of course.
That's him.
Treat him like a prince.
No problem, sir. We are ready to go.
Attention! This is the marine police.
You are ordered to stand down!
Prepare to be boarded.
Attention!
- Showtime!
- This is the marine police.
You are ordered to stand down!
Prepare to be boarded!
This is the marine police.
Look out!
Let's go!
Quickly! Go! Go!
Are you ready?
I'll cover you.
The boy!
Wave bye-bye!
We've interrogated the prisoner, Inspector.
The boy's been taken to Snakehead in Ireland. Repeat, Ireland.
Time for vacation.
Call me in Ireland.
Bring me back a snake head.
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes.
I'm Inspector Eddie Yang from Hong Kong.
Yes. You have an appointment to the commander.
Nicole.
Inspector Eddie Yang.
I knew there couldn't be two of you.
Nice.
You clean up well.
Thank you.
Come on.
It's been a long time.
Three months.
I was assigned overseas and...
Oh, yeah.
You were gonna call me.
- I didn't know you'd been assigned...
- To Ireland?
- Yes.
- Well, you missed a few beats, Eddie.
I am now the official liaison...
...between the local Interpol office and
Southeast Asian security forces.
Maybe if you stayed in touch like you promised...
Nicole.
I should have called.
I'm sorry.
That's worth something.
Not a lot, but something.
Commander?
Inspector Yang is here to see you.
Yes.
I'm Hammerstock-Smythe.
Delighted to meet you, inspector.
Likewise, commander.
Commander, I was just...
What the bloody hell is he doing here?
Hello, Watson.
You're not telling me he'll be working on this case?
Watson, we need all the help we can get.
Yes.
You remember this boy?
Yes, I saw him in the temple. So?
- Who's he?
- One moment.
Yes, I recognize him.
This is Lester Wong.
Snakehead's number two man.
That's privileged information, eyes-only, need-to-know and all that.
- I need to find him, Watson.
- Yes, well, I'm sorry, my friend...
...but that's classified.
We've received a tip-off...
...that Snakehead does have a new shipment arriving tomorrow in Ireland.
- Maybe the boy will come with it.
- Where?
We don't know.
Go back East, Eddie.
Stick to what you know.
- Watson!
- What?! I mean... Sorry. What?
Any more nonsense like this...
...and you will be off the case, and the inspector here will be in charge of it.
Satisfied?
You've only been here five minutes.
Watson!
You are in my filing cabinet.
Yes.
I was just getting these.
I think we're in trouble.
Yes, I think everything is in order.
What do you think?
Is it? Well, yes.
- Well, let me have it checked out.
- Yes, sir.
Watson, wait.
- Let's put Hong Kong behind us.
- I'm sorry, is somebody talking to me?
We were partners.
We were good together.
- You need me.
- Really? What do you want me to do?
Just welcome you back with open arms?
We had a good thing going, and you left!
Watson.
It just wasn't for me anymore.
I thought you understood.
Oh, I understand.
I understand that you didn't like me always being on top.
Okay, you can be on top.
Whatever you want.
Let's just do it together. Okay?
No, but you have fun doing it by yourself. All right?
You think because of the way...
Thank you.
Think we...
Well, we're not.
I'm a man!
Yes. No, there's nothing wrong when two people love...
...one another.
It's a good thing. I...
That's your fault, that is.
Now, I'm gonna go home and cook dinner for my wife!
So on a scale of one to 10...
...how did that go?
About a seven.
Below zero.
I think I know just what you need.
Dinner.
Dinner?
Yes, dinner.
We need Watson for this investigation, Eddie.
He's stubborn, but if we can catch him off guard...
...maybe loosen him up,
I think we can work it out.
I'll just be myself.
One more thing.
Watson's family...
...they don't know that he's an Interpol agent.
- What do they think he is?
- A librarian.
- A librarian?
- Yes.
Hi.
- Nice apron.
- Thanks.
Look, you can't just turn up and barge in.
Darling, I was wondering if you saw my spatula.
- Charlotte, hello.
- Hello.
- Please. Please come in. Please.
- Thank you.
Arthur, you didn't tell me we were having guests.
- Please, welcome.
- Didn't know myself.
- We're librarians.
- Librarian?
Charlotte, this is Eddie Yang from Hong Kong.
Are you staying for dinner?
- Yes.
- No. Absolutely not.
Thank you.
See what you've done to my chops?
What's that called?
Now?
"Lamb a la victim."
Right. Well, yes. Come on.
You know the score.
You eat, you work.
What brings you to Dublin?
- Right. I was looking for...
- Looking for a rare book.
Yes, actually, we were wondering...
...if Arthur would help us find this rare book.
Oh, well, unfortunately, I'm looking for that book myself, so...
Maybe we could find it together.
But I'm head librarian, though, right?
Right.
You need help checking in?
I already checked in.
Okay.
Here. Directions.
Where to meet Watson tomorrow.
He told me to give them to you.
Why can't he just pick me up?
It's Watson.
"Privileged information, eyes-only, need-to-know and all that." So...
Okay.
Okay.
Nicole.
Yeah?
Tonight was fun.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
- Is this place far away or close by?
- Far away.
- Hop in the car and I'll take you.
- Thank you.
What are you doing?
Move.
Move! Move! Get out of the way!
- Oh, my!
- Sorry.
Did you see that?
What are you doing?
Open this door!
Hey, what's going on?
Now, mind yourself.
Come on.
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?
I haven't even done any...
Say it!
Talk! Where's the boy?
Let me out of here or I'll kick your ass.
Speak English! You are hard to understand!
- You ever hear of police brutality?
- Sounds like fun.
One more chance until you kick the can.
You mean, "kick the bucket."
- What?
- You mean, "kick the bucket."
If you say so.
What kind of music you like?
Okay, okay, okay.
Just let me out and we can talk about this, all right?
He's coming on a boat. I don't know what time. A freighter.
- He'll be coming into the docks.
- A boat!
Look, just let me out of here!
Do you know how long I've been waiting here for you?
What's the matter? You sound like an obscene phone call.
You're out of shape.
You should keep fit.
Right, but let's not waste any more time, shall we?
Pier 5. Well, that must be the ship, if Giscard's telling the truth.
Let's hope so.
It's all we've got to go on.
Now, these are very dangerous people, all right?
Do you have a gun?
No, are you going to give me one?
No, get your own bloody gun.
And remember,
I'm head librarian, all right?
- All right?
- Yes.
Right.
Here's the plan.
I'll circle around to the left.
You circle ar...
You circle arou...
And I'll just bloody talk to myself.
Then you go straight through.
Go around.
Welcome, Chosen One.
Excuse me.
You're under arrest.
Come on! He went this way!
Have you seen him?
There.
Watson, come on!
Where's the boy?
- We couldn't find him.
- Find him!
Shoot him.
You okay?
Go, go, go, go! Get the boy!
Interpol! Freeze!
- Hello?
- Hello, it's me.
Me, who?
Eddie! Where are you?
I'm trapped inside the container with the boy.
Stay right where you are.
I'm on my way.
What color is it?
I don't know.
Watson.
- Eddie's in a container.
- Which one?
I have absolutely no idea.
There! There!
It's Eddie.
Eddie.
Eddie, it's Nicole. Just hang on.
Watson, get over here.
I need your help!
Nicole!
Oh, my God!
Don't be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
We'll be all right.
We got control of the container. We believe that there's bodies inside.
I need an oxygen tank and a stretcher. Now!
Eddie, please don't leave me, Eddie.
Eddie, come back to me.
Eddie, please.
- You all right?
- Please.
Eddie, come back.
Nicole...
...he's gone.
Come on.
God bless, Eddie.
God bless.
Nicole.
- We've got work to do.
- You sure?
I'm sure.
Let's go.
I'm sorry...
...I wasn't there when you needed me most, my friend.
That was nice.
Thank you. I...
- What's wrong?
- Who are you?
What's the matter?
Who are you? What...?
What are we doing here?
Where's my clothes?
Watson.
Watson.
- Watson!
- Get away from me!
It must be fake.
Well, it certainly looks like you.
My nose isn't that big.
It's really me.
Are you sure?
Don't you think I recognize my own thing?
It's cold in here.
Let me take a look.
- What's happening to me?
- All right.
Let's just...
...stay calm.
I'm sure there's a perfectly rational explanation for this. Think back.
You were on the boat, in the container.
What happened?
Lights everywhere.
- The boy.
- The boy?
- Medallion.
- Yes.
I have it. It was in your pocket.
What's this?
Wow.
Where did you go?
Excuse me, nurse.
We're from Interpol.
Would you mind if we have a few moments with the boy?
You know, the man outside says you're not eating.
You should eat to gain strength.
How are you feeling?
Feeling. Feel.
Feeling.
Bit bumpy out there on the ocean waves?
Bit rough?
Out there?
Out there on the high seas?
Bumpity-bumpity?
Excuse me. We have to take him for a checkup now.
Yes, yes, yes.
Wait.
I think this belongs to you.
Half for me?
Nice lad.
You okay?
That nurse...
Yeah.
Her boots...
No.
Her boots.
Oh, boots.
Nurses don't wear boots.
Watch out!
- Get out of my way!
- Sorry.
- Get the boy.
- Stop him.
What the heck?
Give me that!
There he goes!
Come here.
- I got him. I got him.
- There he is.
He's mine. I've got him.
Let's go.
Jai!
- Clear all exits.
- Right, sir.
Watson, are you there?
I'm not here.
What happened?
Snakehead's men.
They were here for the boy.
- I'm gonna keep him with me.
- Good idea. Keep him safe. Yes. Yes.
Watson, you did all this alone?
No, Eddie is...
I mean, I think I mentioned that Eddie wasn't the only one with a black belt.
So you're all right?
Perfect.
- Great.
- Okay. I'll see you back at the...
Yeah. I'm gonna do a couple of press-ups and meet you back there.
Yes. Yes.
You just take care of the boy.
- Eddie, listen...
- Watson, something wrong.
Snakehead's men got away again, but at least the boy is safe.
I mean, something wrong with me.
Hit me.
- What?
- Go on, hit me.
No, I can't do that.
It's okay, I don't mind.
Well, I mind. I mean...
A chap could break a finger, you know.
Okay.
Use this.
- No, thanks. I went before I came out.
- No, hit me with this.
- For real?
- Yes.
God.
There you go. All right?
Harder.
I can't do this. This is ridiculous.
- The queen hits harder than that.
- How...
How dare you.
Oh, my God. Are you all right?
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, my friend.
Did it hurt?
Of course it hurt.
But nothing.
I was shot before...
...but I was okay.
Shoot me.
Go ahead.
No, I think the embalming fluid has gone to your head.
- This is ridiculous.
- Give me the gun.
- Absolutely not.
- I'll show you.
You know how many forms I have to fill out if I fire my gun? Absolutely not.
- This is how accidents happen.
- Look.
Amazing.
No blood.
Amazing.
Incredible.
- See?
- I mean, still...
That's incredible. I mean, just...
- Stop that.
- I'm sorry.
That was below the belt. I'm sorry.
That's what I mean.
Can one of you explain this latest failure?
Why you couldn't retrieve one small boy?
Sir...
...this might sound crazy...
...but I emptied a whole clip into that
Chinese cop and he still wouldn't die.
What Chinese cop?
That's Eddie Yang.
He's supposed to have died yesterday, drowned in that container.
Then it's true.
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.
Professor. Doctor. Doctor.
Thank you for being here.
We've come across something very interesting.
Have you ever seen this before?
- Doesn't ring a bell. Doctor?
- I've seen that before.
- The fish is the sign of life.
- That's interesting.
- And the snake is the sign of...
- Whoa.
The medallion.
You're gonna love this.
Now, it should have a serpent on one side.
And a fish on the other.
If what you have is real, that is the Holy Grail of Eastern mythology.
And maybe the secret to eternal life.
Sweet!
- Where'd you get the medallion?
- I recognize the fish.
- You got it from a kid, didn't you?
- Yes.
The legend says every thousand years...
...a child is chosen that can bind the halves together...
...and restore life to the dead.
You get that kid and the medallion...
...you're a god.
- That's nonsense.
- So where's the other half?
- Wait!
The ancient texts say that if you want superhuman strength...
...and immortality, you need both halves.
The only documented case of a genuine resurrection...
You can't weigh it, measure it, smoke it.
Look, ancient texts aren't fairy tales.
Thank you, professor. Doctor. Doctor.
- Cheerio, for now.
- Good luck.
Why would a young boy have something like this?
This Snakehead chap, is he after the medallion or the boy?
By the way, take good care of that kid.
The medallion can not only give life, it can take it away.
Okay, I'll cover the front door, call in for backup.
You go to the rear to Nicole's apartment as fast as you can.
Got it.
Sorry.
You know, for a little person, you sure do eat a lot.
Still going?
What did you have?
Okay.
Here we go.
Try that.
That good?
You don't like... You're not...
One of my culinary skills...
...other than peeling fruit, of course...
...just so happens to be a toasted...
...peanut butter and jelly sandwich...
...which, I might add, Eddie could eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Then again, he didn't really have any choice.
- Why?
- Because I can't cook anything else.
I just can't believe that he's really gone.
He's not gone.
Jai...
...do you not understand that Eddie's not coming back?
I pulled him back.
Okay...
Jai, Eddie's...
He...
Just hold on.
See?
Oh, my God.
Eddie?
Eddie.
Jai!
No!
Eddie!
You see? I told you he wasn't dead.
The boy, sir.
Yes.
Welcome...
...my old friend.
So...
...a quick, painless death...
...followed by resurrection...
...immortality...
...and powers beyond your dreams.
Are you sure?
His order is ruled by reverence for life.
My death before him must be reversed.
And if it isn't...
...kill him.
And then who would bring you back,
Chosen One?
Pitiful mortal.
So...
...I have no further use for you, Chosen One.
You're not immortal.
What?
To become immortal, you need both halves of the medallion.
Where's the other half?
Tell me!
- Nicole.
- Eddie.
It's me. I'm fine, really.
I just...
I still don't understand, Eddie, because I was there...
...and I saw you, and...
- Nicole, it's me.
You see, it's just that I was at the container and you were dead.
I mean, you were dead.
Nicole, the boy uses the medallion to give life.
That's why Snakehead took him.
With the boy and the medallion, he could...
He could become like you?
Yes, but he needs the whole medallion...
...and he only has half.
Look...
...this is a touching reunion.
We're all glad that Eddie's amongst the living...
...but we still haven't found
Snakehead's helicopter.
Get online. Find anything that was in the air in the last hour.
I don't care if it was a bird, a plane or bloody Superman.
No offense, old chap.
Eddie.
If he needs the other half, he's gonna come looking for you.
If he is looking for me...
...he'll be looking for my partner.
Me?
My family.
My family.
Cool.
See, that's not normal. I mean, that's not natural. What...?
Eddie, take my bike!
Thank God.
They're all right.
Charlotte?
Charlotte? I have something
I have to tell you.
Yes, dear?
Eddie...
Watson! They're here!
Go!
Go!
Charlotte, where are you going?
This is no time for cleaning.
Take your shield!
Watson!
- Are you all right, love?
- Yes, I'm fine, dear.
Catch!
Here. I'll lead them away.
Your wife?
What the...?
There you are. Quick. Quick.
That's a good boy.
Now, listen. Guns are very dangerous things, all right? Right.
How dare you shoot...
...at my...
...wife!
My Lord.
Where'd he go?
We meet again...
...Eddie Yang.
Where's the boy?
My guest is no concern of yours.
All that matters is that you have the other half of the medallion.
Don't run, Eddie!
You can't hide from me!
The medallion is mine!
You think it's a game?
Well, let's play!
We're the same, you and I.
What a pity. What a waste.
You don't know what powers you have.
Destiny calls.
He's sleeping. At least, I think that's what he's doing.
He doesn't even look like he's breathing.
The boy!
Oh, God, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Eddie, you're all right.
The boy's in danger.
He's going to kill him. Right?!
Snakehead has taken the boy to Raven's Keep.
I told you everything I know.
I did.
We need to move fast.
Of course I can fly this thing.
I built it myself.
You take the bike.
I'll guide you from the air.
I'm driving.
That's Raven's Keep.
It's five miles away.
You should wash your hands.
Come on.
Nicole.
Be careful.
You too.
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Where's the boy?
- Let's get out of here!
- Move!
You cowards!
Watson. Watson!
Are you crazy?
Be careful.
Interpol. Freeze.
Jai, are you all right?
There she is! Get her!
Excuse me.
You looking for something?
Interpol! Freeze!
Interpol! Freeze!
Interpol! Free...
Jai, thank God.
You're in danger.
It's over.
You're safe now.
I don't think so.
No, it's all right.
Run!
For your lives.
It's not nice to take things that don't belong to you.
Fetch.
My brother...
...don't be sentimental.
It's so unnecessary.
It's so human.
So normal.
You and I will live forever.
We are the lords of time.
We can take whatever we choose.
I mean, what difference can a single human life like hers make to us?
We are immortal.
Let me show you.
Eddie, use the medallion to end the life that it gave.
Can you?
It's your turn.
What's that for?
That, Eddie Yang, is for not catching me.
And that, Eddie Yang, is for not catching me.
Interpol! Freeze!
Isn't that lovely?
Of course...
...when he came back, he was naked.
I mean, completely starkers.
Not a stitch.
I'm not complaining, mind you.
Listen, I have this cough.
I think it's quite serious.
Honestly, I could snuff at any point.
I don't suppose you'd consider a rub on your medallion?
I really am. Hello?
It's very bad...
Very bad. You...
Please, the med... One quick rub.
That's all. Oh, the medallion.
Quick. Give me the medallion.
Give it.
All right.
It was only a tickle anyway.
Come with me.
Wait!
Nicole! Eddie!
You can't leave me here.
Goodbye!
Okay, that wasn't scary at all.
He walked through a vortex to the next universe.
I'm going this way.
- Quiet on the set. Are cameras ready?
- Cameras are ready.
Jackie, Claire. And action.
I'm sorry.
Can you overlap that line for me?
Eddie Yang. I knew there couldn't be two of you.
- Will you say action, or am I just...?
- I did. Okay, here we go.
And action.
Three months and not so much as a phone call?
That made me so nervous.
I slapped you so hard.
- Come on! Oh, my God!
- In the middle...!
- I got slapped for nothing!
- I'm so sorry.
- I am so sorry. I'm so sorry.
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, no!
- Claire.
Jackie, I'm so sorry.
That rea... That hurt me.
- You should continue filming!
- Oh, I didn't know!
- Now I got another one!
- Oh, no!
- That was really bad.
- Try it again.
Let's go.
Let's move.
Take one.
Eddie.
All those things that I said...
I was right there.
- Seven, take three.
God bless, Eddie.
Action!
Cut!
Cut.
Take one.
You... Now, how...?
It's Giscard.
- Really? What about Snakehead?
- Snakehead is not here yet.
Is he not here?
What about Ken?
- Yeah. Ken is...
- Pete? Pete?
Pete is just right beside me.
That's it. We're fine.
- Now, that's...
- Somebody let Jackie in.
Here's the plan.
We have to...
Whoops.
I got it wrong.
It's this way.
Oh, sorry. It's the other way.
Oh, damn.
Oh, I missed.
Watson.
- Cut. Print.
- Phone.
- A-camera.
- Action.
Watson. So many things are going on.
- Marker.
- Come on.
- Marker.
- One more.
Watson.
Sorry. What? It's... No, you... No.
- Again.
- Sorry.
Marker!
- Cut.
- Cut!
I want ice cream.
Cut!
Cut!
Slate X67, take one coming up.
- A-marker.
- Like a woman.
That's it. That's it. Okay.
It's just down there.
Down.
Then the bottom.
Then the bottom.
- Sorry, Jackie.
- What's this? "The bottom."
- Marker.
- Move!
Wait, wait!
Oh, shit.
Nicole, the boy used the meda...
Very good. Cut. Cut.
The dog barking.
Yeah, I heard it.
Go. Go away.
And action.
Interpol! Freeze!
Cut.
A-camera.
In case of emergency...
...the exits are here...
...here...
...and here.
- I slapped you.
- Again.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God!
- It was meant to be fake. Sorry.
- You do on purpose.
Are you doing on purpose?
Try it again, Claire.
A little harder.
It drives me crazy.
No, no, not tomorrow.
The day after tomorrow. Right.
You, me, Gary, Brad.
We'll be teeing off at...
Well, I like Gary.
Dr. Dandewar,
I'm kind of in a bit of a hurry.
We'll be teeing off at 7:30, and if you're not there because of Gary, well, come on, you know. I gotta go.
Am I missing something?
Why did Dr. Cho order a head X-ray when the man was bitten on the hand?
The patient was in a bar fight.
He was communicative when he was admitted at 6:00.
That's 6:00 a.m.
This morning. That's when
I started my shift.
Where's the patient now?
I'd like to see him.
They moved him.
I'm sure one of the night nurses can tell you...
Page me when you find him.
Sure.
I'll do that.
Hey, Cora, can you do me a favor and locate a patient for me?
Hey, Ana. Sure.
Edward Solomon?
Yeah.
Aren't you off?
An hour ago.
Here he is.
They had him backward.
Solomon Edward.
He's upstairs in I.C.U.
From a bite?
I don't know what from.
Toxicology is gonna work him up in the morning.
Okay, I'm gonna get outta here.
Can you do me a favor?
Can you page Dr. Dandewar and let him know?
Sure.
Thanks.
You talk to Luis about Sunday?
I will. Night, Cora.
Night.
Hey.
Hey, Ana?
Let's go.
It's starting early.
Great.
Let's go!
Let's go!

I can go backwards.
Let me see.
Hey, that's amazing!
Maybe tomorrow after work
I'll do a few backward laps around the block with you, okay?
Okay.
All right. Careful now,
I gotta pull in.
Say hey to your mom for me, okay?
Okay.
Hey.
Hey, you.
You're late.
You missed it.
They just cut the mailman loose.
ANA: No, Richie?
The chubby one?
Oh, my God.
He had such a sweet voice.
I can't believe that.
Hey, you.
How'd it go today?
Not bad. You?
Good. I'm trading shifts with Cora, so if I take Sunday,
I can have a three-day weekend at the end of the month.
Is that okay?
Sunday?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think Cora's got this new guy she doesn't want me to know about.
Really. Wow. Lucky her.
I thought maybe you'd gone out with the girls or something.
What? And miss date night?

MALE REPORTER: Is it a virus?
MAN: We don't know.
FEMALE REPORTER:
How does it spread?
Is it airborne?
MAN: Airborne is a possibility.
We don't know.
MALE REPORTER: Is this an international health hazard or a military concern?

Are these people alive or dead?
MEDIC: Hold him down!
We don't know.
FEMALE REPORTER:
Is that true?
Now, listen, we lost a teleprompter.
WOMAN: Yeah, but I've just spoken with the President.
He's been in constant contact with both the C.D.C., as well as F.E.M.A.
SOLDIER: Stay back, right there!
A U. S...
God, they're here!
MAN: And I looked and behold, a pale horse.
And its name, that sat on him, was Death.
And Hell followed with him.
Say something.
Please.
All right! Okay!
Put the guns down!
What are you doing?
Come on. He's a cop!
Come on.
Put the gun down!
I thought you were one of them.
You do not wanna go that way.
What's that way?
Officer, sir, you do not wanna go that way.
What's that way?
It's pretty bad.
What about Fort Pastor?
Maybe if you had wings.
The road's thick with those motherfuckers that way.
How do you know?
We just tried.
Come on.
Back when there was eight of us.
We're going to the mall.
Shit.
Damn.
Hurry up!
Back up!
Open the door!
Lights.
Here.
No?
No.
Come on.
Sit right there.
We need to make sure this place is safe.
I'm gonna see if the doors over this way are locked.
I'll check down there.
Maybe, Officer, you could go down that direction. Check for...
All right. Okay.
Maybe it's better you stay here with the gun.
Andre and I will check around.
All right, baby,
I'll be right back.
No, no, just stay right here, okay?
Stay right here.
Shatterproof, asshole.
Shit!
Hey, what happened?
Come on, move!
You all right?
Move!
LUDA: Which way?
Here. Elevators.
Let's go! Let's go!
Can I see that arm?
We need to suture that.
Yeah.
You okay?
KENNETH: Yeah.
Find someplace else.
Look, we just need a place...
Maybe you didn't hear me.
There is no place else.
Well, that's tough shit,
'cause this is our place, and you can't stay here.
Yeah, and you already trashed Metropolis.
Look, dumbass.
My wife is pregnant.
We can't run anymore.
His arm.
Those things are down there.
Well, these are all your problems, not mine.
If I put my foot up your ass, would that be your problem?
Hey, asshole, I'm the one pointing the gun at you.
He is a cop, C.J.
So what?
ANA: We're not going to cause any trouble.
Just let us stay here for a little while.
Please.
Okay.
Come out of there slowly, and give your weapons to Bart and Terry.
Don't do it.
You must be out of your fucking mind.
You can take your ass on over to Quality Inn if it's still there, Shaq.
Huh?
Wanna do that?
Let's go.
Hey, don't give him that gun.
Fuck.
Smart move.
MAN ON TV: They're everywhere.
Nobody seems to know what's going on.
There's a lot of blood.
We have bodies.
There's a slew of fires.
We're back to a live picture now.
All right.
Can I get one second here?
Ma'am, are you American?
All right.
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
Get your own little TV.
Come on. Let's go.
Excuse me, please.
Is there a restroom?
No. You're staying here.
So then why don't you tell us which spot in here you'd like us to take a piss.
All right. It's around the corner, that way.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?
She's not going anywhere alone. Come on.
Oh, well,
"She's not going any..."
This is a fucking nursery school.
Terry, go with them.
MAN ON TV: Hi. I'm Bill Vibert with 23V Cable News.
I'm at one of the collection depots waiting on an interview with Sheriff Cahill.
I understand you're having a difficult time killing these things.
Just shoot them in the head.
They seem to go down permanently when you shoot them in the head.
Then you gotta burn them.
We gotta burn...
Danny! Danny!
Put another round in that woman over there!
Look, she's a twitcher.
"Twitcher"?
Now that is one cool motherfucker.
The bleeding's not gonna stop on its own.
I need to stitch his arm.
What are you, a fucking doctor?
No, I'm a fucking nurse.
I know some of these people that we're putting down...
First Aid kit's in the security office.
What are you gonna do?
It's gotta be done.
Huh? What did I tell you, boys?
Get those bodies off the truck!
Haven't got all day here!
America always sorts its shit out.
You know, you're lucky.
They could have bitten it off.
Yes, I believe you're referring to a report that came in this morning.
But that report was completely...
REPORTER:
What can you tell the people out there watching TV that don't know what to do?
What I would suggest is that you come to Fort Pastor.
And if you can't make it here, we have multiple search-and-rescue teams out there and they will find you.
My brother's there.
He's waiting for me.
What's the hold up, darling?
Hmm?
So what's the plan?
The plan is you drink a nice tall glass of shut the fuck up.
MICHAEL: Okay.
That's one idea.
What about locking this place down?
'Cause sooner or later, they're going to get in here.
Mmm.
That's good.
Like I hadn't thought of that.
MICHAEL: Hey, no doubt.
And you probably already thought about putting a sign up on the roof.
Because, you know, there's still planes in the air.
Might be good.
Let them know we're alive.
We can get some paint from Case Hardware.
We need some office doors to board up the weak spots.
That's a solid plan.
C.J., is it?
Yeah.
All right, C.J.
All right, everybody, listen up.
I'm gonna give everybody a job to do, and I expect you to do all of it.
I don't wanna see any half-assing.
You know what?
Why don't you start off by cleaning up that mess you made in Metropolis?
Hey, C.J., look.
Terry, take a look at Ben Cozine.
Hey, Ben. Ben!
Look at him.
BART: Look, he's a twitcher.
TV says you gotta shoot them in the head.
TV said a lot of things that aren't true.
Well, fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.
Let's go.
Let's get to work.
Holy shit.
TERRY: Let's do it.
BART: All right.
Let's pick him up then.
All right.
Ready? One, two...
BART: On two.
All right.
One, two...
What are they?
I don't know.
Why are they coming here?
KENNETH: Memory, maybe.
Instinct.
Maybe they're coming for us.
ANA: Hey, look over there.
There's someone on the roof.
C. J: Yeah, his name's Andy.
He's alone.
He may as well be on the Moon.
ANA: Poor guy.
What's he pointing at?
MICHAEL: Helicopter.
ANDRE: Hey, it's coming.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Please!
What's he doing?
Where's he...
No, no. I mean, they saw us.
So, I mean, they're gonna be coming back, baby.
Don't worry.
I mean, they're gonna send somebody or something.
ANA: It's safe here.
We'll just wait for them to come back.
I don't want anybody sneaking around and stealing shit.
Comprende?
Sweet dreams.
Those assholes are gonna get us killed.
We have to do something.
I'm not doing anything to create problems for Luda and me.
The helicopter's coming back soon.
I hope so.
And what's that supposed to mean?
It means it might come and it might not.
We don't know.
What do you mean it not come back?
You said it was coming back!
We have to get to hospital.
Hey, baby, listen, listen.
Don't worry. This guy, he doesn't know shit.
All right?
It's coming back.
Hey, my man. You know,
I hear you talking a lot.
You know, you're always saying something.
Who the fuck are you that we should listen, huh?
What are you, like, in Special Ops?
You in the Marines?
What the fuck do you do?
I sell televisions at Best Buy.
ANDRE: Wow.
Hey, Officer, how you like following a guy that sells TVs?
About as much as I like following a guy who steals them.
I'm not following anyone.
I'm going to Fort Pastor to get my brother.
They seem to need to feed on warm flesh.
Some basic skills remain.
They don't seem to have much, if any, reasoning power.
And how does this spread?
These guys are so full of shit.
They've been saying the same damn thing all day.
MAN ON TV: Everybody they kill gets up.
Tell me something
I don't know, asshole!
I've just been informed that we are going off the air...
BART: Wanna hear something that sucks?
...and switching over to the Emergency
Broadcasting System.
You guys know that chick at Dairy Queen?
I don't know when we'll be back on the air.
The fat one?
Yeah.
She was coming over tonight.
I would have tapped that shit for sure.
Bart, dude, everybody's dead, okay?
Your mom's dead.
Your brother's dead.
That fat chick at Dairy Queen?
Dead!
It's been a pleasure to report the news to you in these past 26 years.
God bless you.
Yeah.
God bless America.
That sucks too.
Hell is overflowing.
And Satan is sending his dead to us.
Why? Because you have sex out of wedlock.
You kill unborn children.
You have man-on-man relations.
Same-sex marriage.
How do you think your god will judge you?
Well, friends, now we know.
When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth
What the hell...
Hey, dumbass.
It's the timers.
It's? :00.
Terry.
Go shut them off.
It's Bart's turn.
You're the trainee, man.
Shit rolls downhill.
I wish somebody was working at Hallowed Grounds.
How hard is it to make a cup of coffee?
I wanted a soy mocha latte with foam.
Faggot.
What are you doing?
What's the news?
Bad.
Hey. Hey!
Hey!
What?
The bathroom in here is fake. It doesn't work.
I'll tell C.J.
I'm telling you.
You're the type of cat that goes to church and all that kind of shit, right?
Yeah, I do all that kind of shit.
So what you think? Hmm?
What is this?
Is this the end of times?
'Cause if it is,
I'm telling you,
I'm fucked.
No, I'm serious.
I've done some bad things in my life, man.
Oh, I get it.
You saw hell yesterday.
Now you're scared of going to hell for all the bad things you've done.
I'll tell you what.
Go in the stall, say five Hail Marys, wipe your ass, and you and God can call it even.
You think I feel like I deserve to be here?
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I don't.
And I'm cool with that.
But you see, that's not it.
'Cause I feel like
I'm here for another reason.
I feel like I'm here to bring that baby on this earth.
And give it everything that I never had.
I just want the opportunity to change things.
Shit!
C. J!
How did you get out?
And who gave you permission to loot the goddamn stores?
What are we gonna do about that truck?
We're not going to do anything about that truck.
There's people in there.
Yeah? How do you know they're not all fucked up like everybody else out there?
Well, for one thing, they're driving a truck.
Oh, and shooting guns.
If we start letting people in here, then we're gonna let the wrong ones in.
And then I'm dead.
You know what?
I don't wanna die!
Who are the wrong ones?
Nobody here is sick.
And I intend on keeping it that way.
I just think we should...
I did not ask for your opinion, lady!
Now, if you wanna argue with me, you can argue with this.
MICHAEL: Hey, hey, take it easy.
Shut your fucking mouth.
Get the gun outta my face.
You can't just turn them away, C.J.
You'll kill them.
Tough shit. Self-defense.
I'm not killing anybody.
You know what?
I'll kill you.
No, no, stop it, C.J.
Don't do this!
Shut up!
I'll kill each and every one of you to stay alive.
You hear me?
I said get the fucking gun outta my face!
You got quite a mouth on you.
Somebody should show her how to use it.
Is there a holding cell in there?
Yeah, back of the security room.
That's real good, man.
You're gonna get us all killed, dumbass.
Fucking traitor!
BART: Get off me.
I hope you got a good plan.
Come on.
Hey! Up here!
Can't see a damn thing.
Me neither.
Why's he backing up the truck?
Through here!
Hey!
Shit.
Fuck. We gotta go out there.
Man, you better throw that bullshit right out your head.
I'm not going back out there.
That's not part of the plan.
Change of plan.
I'm gonna open the door.
No.
Okay.
One, two, three.
No. Don't do it, man.
Come on, man.
Thanks.
Yeah.
ANDRE: Shoot them in the head!
I don't see anybody.
Get back inside!
They're fine!
Get back inside!
Here you go.
There's six more people inside the truck.
Andre, look!
MONICA: Thank God.
I couldn't stay in that fucking truck anymore.
ANA: All right, anybody who's injured, let's get you into
Metropolis right away.
I'll come take a look at you.
Let me take a look at her.
Can you help me with...
Sir, what's your name? Sorry.
Glen, yeah, sure.
Just give me a second to collect myself, okay?
Thanks.
If you wanna just go wait for me in there,
I'll take a look at your leg.
Here. I'll hold this.
Just go and wait there.
My arm!
It's okay, ma'am.
We're gonna make you nice and comfortable, all right?
The rest of you, we've got plenty of food and water.
Help should be along soon.
Help? Did you hear that from the same jackass who told us to go to St. Verbena?
The church downtown?
Yeah.
That's the first place I went.
Some dipshit on the radio said it was safe there.
He was wrong.
Is that where you picked them up?
Well, I get this call on the C.B.
From that guy Glen saying all these folks are in the chapel.
He's a priest?
No, he plays the organ.
I was in the neighborhood, so I picked them up.
Well done.
Thanks.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
When you two fellows are done blowing each other, maybe Davy Crockett can tell us the deal here.
Well, we haven't heard much since the TVs went out last night.
KENNETH: Excuse me.
Whose rig is that?
It's mine.
You mind if I borrow it?
I'm not using it,
Officer.
Keys.
They're in the cab.
Truck's not gonna make it to Fort Pastor.
No, forget the truck.
That place is fucked, man.
Bloodbath city.
How do you know?
We just came from there.
Is everyone there dead?
Or dead-ish.
Is everyone there dead?
Yeah, in the sense that they all, sort of, fell down, and then...
I gotta look for myself.
You're not gonna make it.
...got up and...
I'll get as far as I can.
Right now it's about one foot out that door.
...started eating each other.
I'll take my chances.
Don't be an idiot.
Please, there's people here right now who could use your help.
Fuck y'all.
It's nice to see that you've all bonded through this disaster.
Hey. You need anything?
No, we're fine.
Don't worry about us.
He's got a bite on his hand.
She's cold.
That's good, right?
ANA: I don't know, it's weird.
I've never seen an infection this bad that didn't come with a fever.
That guy's arm looks pretty bad over there.
You should probably check it out.
All right.
Stay with her for a minute.
Here. Want me to take a look at that?
I'm fine. Really.
They don't hurt much at all.
Tucker could use you more than I could.
His ankle's cut pretty bad.
Here. I'm just gonna clean it up a bit.
TERRY: You okay?
Ma'am, can I get you something?
Like a glass of water?
Ana! Ana, come here!
Anyone know her name?
Died without a name?
Damn.
Guys, do you wanna move into the other room?
Holy shit!
Holy shit!
Oh, shit.
I think it's the bites.
Frank said she was walking on her own when she got in the truck five hours ago.
The bites killed her.
The bites brought her back.
How do you know?
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse.
She was gone.
Then... Yesterday
I saw the same thing happen to somebody else.
I think that's why it spread so fast.
All right.
So who else in the group is bitten?
Frank, for sure.
How about the one with the foot?
Tucker?
He says no, he fell.
So, it's Frank.
Tall guy, right?
Right. So we have to quarantine him right away.
Where exactly do we do that?
I don't know.
There must be someplace to keep him in here.
Then what?
I don't know, but...
It's too dangerous to keep him on here.
I'm sorry. What are we talking about here?
Are we talking about killing him?
Would you rather we waited for him to die, and then he tries to kill us?
Yes. No.
You can't kill him.
Ana...
He's got a daughter!
I'm sorry.
I don't think there's any other choice.
He's right.
Michael, you can't do this.
What if I'm wrong?
You've seen it happen before.
Frank,
Michael's coming to shoot you.
What are you talking about?
You're infected.
You're gonna become one of them.
Is this true?
Are you gonna kill me?
You've been bitten.
It's only a matter of time.
No, no, no!
Leave my dad alone!
Go away!
You can't do this!
You have to understand that she's lost everyone.
Her mother, her two brothers.
I'm all she's got.
Well, Michael, what are you waiting for?
Go ahead, kill him.
Hey, kill Tucker, too.
Wait a minute.
I was never bit.
We can't be sure.
Do it, Michael.
Are you sure it's the bite?
No.
She's sure.
I'm sorry.
Hey.
Hi.
You okay?
Let me see your arm.
It hurts.
It's already starting to heal.
Andre, I can't have baby here.
Why not? People have been having babies for millions of years.
All on their own.
No hospitals.
Wait.
Oh, yeah.
It's moving.
I felt it.
ANDRE: So now we gotta come up with a name for this baby.
I want Russian name.
Don't start that again.
African name.
Please?
Come here.
Give me a hug.
FRANK: Sweetie,
I'm so proud of you.
I couldn't ask for anything more in a daughter.
I love you, baby.
I love you too.
Time to go, honey.
No.
Terry, come on, man.
Open the door.
Shut up.
C. J: Come on, man.
Don't tell me to shut up.
Just come open the door.
BART: I got you this job.
Come on.
You want...
...every...
...single second.
Ana.
I'm glad you didn't do it.
C. J: Okay, okay.
Here's a good one.
"Top Ten Ingredients
To A Successful Relationship."
All right, I'm gonna skip to the top three.
Number three,
"He listens to me."
Number two,
"He tells me he loves me."
And number one...
Oh, it's "trust."
Number one's trust.
Holy shit. He got him.
So, who do we have next?
Yeah. Burt Reynolds.
Tell him to get
Burt Reynolds.
STEVE: Oh, my goodness.
Man, he's good.
It barely even looked like him.
Oh, oh. Rosie O'Donnell.
Tell him to get Rosie.
Oh, yeah. Rosie.
No, too easy.
Give him something hard.
You guys had really rough childhoods, didn't you?
A little bit rocky?
Hey, sweetheart.
Let me tell you something.
You have my permission.
I ever turn into one of those things?
Do me a favor, blow my fucking head off.
Oh, yeah.
You can count on that.
I guess the first time
I knew I was gay...
I was 13.
This guy...
Todd.
He was building a deck in our backyard.
Okay? Just, please, stop.
I remember he had the most astonishing blue eyes.
Oh, my God!
I'm in hell.
Hey, Andre.
How's Luda doing?
She's fine.
Hey, where's that lemon stuff?
It's all gone.
Steve likes to put it in his booze.
Try the vanilla stuff.
All right.
I'd like to drop by and check on her, just to see how she's doing.
No, thanks. She's fine.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's okay, hon.
We understand.
Thanks.
Before that I worked in a stationery store.
And I drove a snowplow.
Fixed copiers.
God, it's such a shame that this whole end of the world thing's holding you back.
Okay, worst job.
I know which job
I was the worst at.
Being a husband.
That's not a job.
It sure is.
You guys just haven't met the right girl.
Yeah, I tried it three times.
I got pink slips every time.
What were you best at?
Being a dad.
I think
I was best at that.
KENNETH: Everybody calm down.
NORMA: Are they inside?
MICHAEL: No.
This place have generators?
ANDRE: It's all right, baby.
Baby, please.
You gotta be quiet. Okay?
It's gonna be all right.
Our baby's on the way.
It's coming.
That's it. It's in employee parking, level three.
They keep them in a pen near the parking shuttles.
Have fun.
Hey. Wait a minute.
You're coming too.
No, I'm not.
I said I'd tell you where the generators are.
I never said I'd show you.
Did you think
I was gonna leave you two up here?
You come with me, or you go back in that cell.
All right.
I ain't going anywhere without a gun.
You're not getting a gun.
Trust.
Primary ingredient in any relationship.
Have at them, cowboy.
Asshole.
Bart, get the chains.
Shit.
Are we ready to roll?
You coming with us?
No, you're coming with me.
I've done this before.
Know how to use that?
This one's the dangerous end, right?
Now it is.
This is level one.
We gotta walk down to three.
What the fuck was that?
I just saw something.
You didn't see shit, Bart.
Shut the fuck up.
Oh, shit.
Here it comes.
Jesus Christ!
It's a fucking dog.
Come here, boy.
At least you know nothing's down here.
It would've eaten him.
See? I told you
I saw something.
MICHAEL: What's wrong, boy?
There's nothing wrong.
That dog's just fucked up.
Run!
BART: Wait, C.J.
Wait up! Wait!
It's locked!
It's fucking locked!
No! No!
KENNETH: Come on! Let's go!
C.J.!
I'm out.
C.J.! Matches!
Breathe.
You're doing good.
Breathe.
You're doing good, baby.
I'm sorry.
Thanks.
Okay. That's the last.
I'm gonna go check on Luda.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I'll go.
You sure?
Yeah.
Take them some candles.
Okay. Let me know if they need anything.
Okay. I'll have a little smoke on the way.
See you.
Bye.
It's coming.
I see it.
Guys?
Oh, my God.
It's a girl.
You wanna kill Luda?
You wanna kill my family?
Norma? Come on, Norma.
What happened?
Son of a bitch shot me.
Get away from her.
ANA: Wait.
Just wait.
She died of the gunshot.
She wasn't bitten.
She's gonna wake up though, right?
ANA: No.
No. If she was one of them, she'd be up by now.
Terry.
Yeah?
Hold this.
Oh, God.
Somebody should say something.
Yeah.
MICHAEL: Glen?
No.
You worked in the church.
I played the organ.
C. J: Come on, man.
You must've heard the priest say something about life and death.
It was a job.
I don't believe in God.
I don't see how anyone could.
Somebody should say something.
Nothing to say.
Been to a lot of funerals.
Folded the flag and given it to a lot of wives, and fathers, and kids.
I told them how sorry I was.
But that's not what
I was really feeling.
In the back of my mind,
I was always saying,
"Better them than me."
But I don't believe that now.
Because now I realize there are some things worse than death, and one of them is sitting here waiting to die.
I don't wanna die here.
I saw a couple of buses in the garage.
We could fix them up.
We could reinforce them.
Then get as far from here as possible.
And then what?
Oh, I have an idea.
While we're at it why don't we swing by the marina, and hop in my boat, take it for a pleasure cruise, you jackasses.
Wait a minute.
That's a good idea.
There's islands out in those lakes.
There's not a lot of people on them.
I was kidding.
How far is the marina?
Oh, my God.
You're serious?
I think it's a damn good idea.
How about the rest of you?
Kenneth?
Yeah, it's a good idea.
We have to pick up Andy.
He's part of the group.
Excuse me, not to shit on anyone's riff here, but let me just see if I grasp this concept, okay?
You're suggesting that we take some fucking parking shuttles and reinforce them with some aluminum siding, and then just head on over to the gun store where we watch our good friend Andy play some cowboy-movie, jump-on-the-covered-wagon bullshit?
Then we're going to drive across the ruined city through a welcome committee of a few hundred thousand dead cannibals.
All so we can sail off into the sunset on this fucking asshole's boat?
Head for some island that for all we know doesn't even exist?
Yeah.
Pretty much, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm in.
We have 12 of these shotgun shells,
26 of those pussy nine mils and 16 of those.357 Magnums.
ANA: Yeah? Well, it's still not very much, so...
Hopefully we'll get to the dock and there won't be too many of them.
Well, it's nice to see you busting your ass today.
Oh, that's sarcasm.
That is awesome.
Yeah, you know,
I would love to help, but a captain never works alongside his men.
You guys, have a good one.
What a total dick.
Guys, where'd Chips go?
Chips?
NICOLE: Where'd you go, Chips?
I can't find him.
Chips, come here.
Come on, Chips.
Come on, Chips.
NICOLE: Chips, come on, boy.
Where'd you go, honey?
NICOLE: There you are.
Come on. There's my boy.
Don't you ever leave me again, okay?
Ever, ever.
Hey. Kenneth wants everyone upstairs for a meeting.
Come in here first.
I want you to see this.
When those things are on the side of the bus, this'll get them off.
Cool, huh?
Wow.
That might be the most romantic thing anyone's ever shown me.
I'm trying here.
Yeah, I know.
It's not just about him starving, Steve.
If we go to pick him up and he doesn't have his strength, then we're going to be carrying him. It's...
TUCKER: She's right.
He's a hell of a shot too.
We're going to need him.
Tucker, I'm not saying we don't need him.
There's no point in arguing about this.
We need a solution.
We need to get some food over there.
STEVE: Okay. I have an idea.
We draw straws and the loser runs across the lot with a ham sandwich.
ANA: Could you be a bigger prick?
STEVE: I think so.
But, you know, that's irrelevant.
My question to you is, what's your plan?
Come on.
MICHAEL: We're not going to leave him on his own to die, all right?
I got it.
MICHAEL: We gotta get over there anyway.
Shut up.
Because we need more ammunition, all right?
I have an idea.
Stop, it's hurting him.
No! He's not safe.
Nicole, they're not interested in him.
I promise.
Look at me.
They want us.
Chips is gonna be fine.
See? Look.
He's walking right by them.
They're not even paying attention to him.
KENNETH: The walkie's in the bag, right?
TERRY: Yeah.
Let me see.
There he is. Good boy.
Good boy, Chips.
Okay. He's there. He's in.
Give me those.
KENNETH: Oh, man.
What?
KENNETH: No.
What?
No. Oh, man.
They got him. They got him!
Try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?
Andy, can you hear me?
Andy?
ANDY: Can you hear me? Hello?
Is this working?
I'm dinged up pretty bad, but I think I'm gonna be okay.
Where are you hurt, Andy?
Goddamn, those bastards bite hard.
I just have to stop the bleeding.
It's really going.
Easy, boy, easy.
Is this Ken?
Is that you, man?
Yeah, it's me, brother.
Hey, man.
Good to hear your voice.
I guess we're going to meet up close pretty soon, huh?
Oh, shit. Hang on.
Oh, Jesus, he got me good.
Now, you just hang in there.
You got the food, right?
Yeah.
Do we tell him?
Hey, this dog got a name?
See, Nicole, Chips...
Nicole?
What the hell's that?
Oh, my God! It's Nicole!
Shit.
That idiot's going after the fucking dog.
She made it. She's in.
NICOLE: You guys?
I found Chips.
I got him. He's okay.
Nicole, how's Andy looking?
I don't know. There's a lot of blood in here.
It's everywhere.
There's blood everywhere.
Wait a minute. I see him.
He's on the roof.
He's writing something.
What's it say?
Guys?
Tell her to get out.
Guys?
What's wrong?
Nicole, baby, how's the truck?
I'm not going back out there.
Chips, be quiet!
Tell her to get the hell out now!
Honey, listen to me.
You need to find a place to hide.
Can you do that?
What do you mean?
What's going on?
MICHAEL: Nicole.
Oh, here's Andy.
Oh, my God!
No! Tell her to get out!
Nicole, listen to me.
I'm in a closet.
But he's outside.
He's trying to get...
MICHAEL: Nicole?
Nicole?
Help me! Please, you have to help me!
I'm gonna die!
We need to do something, now.
Tucker, listen. When we come back through here, we may have company.
You need to stay here and make sure that fire door stays open.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Why does he stay here, while I go on the suicide mission to rescue Terry's already dead girlfriend?
Fuck you, man.
We don't know that.
You know what, asshole?
Either way we gotta get over there and get the guns and get out of this parking lot, all right?
Michael, it's okay.
Let him stay.
Yeah.
Steve, don't fuck this up.
Yeah. Totally.
C. J: All right.
That's it.
MICHAEL: Are you sure?
I ain't a plumber, but I'd say we're pretty much at the end of the line here.
C. J: Go! Go!
Through here!
C. J: Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry!
What do you need?
TERRY: Here.
Damn it.
Come on. Hurry up.
All right.
C. J: Oh, shit.
Nicole?
KENNETH: Andy.
I'm sorry, brother.
MICHAEL:
Nicole, are you in there?
NICOLE: I'm here! I'm here!
KENNETH: Get as much ammo as you can.
You got a plan?
Uh-uh. You?
How about a barbecue?
How do we know if he hits it?
Oh, shit.
TERRY: C.J.! Over here!
Hurry up!
Over here!
Go! Get down!
TUCKER: Look out!
C. J: Come on, Tucker!
Come on!
Oh, shit!
TUCKER: My leg!
C. J: I got you, Tucker.
Go! Go!
Shit.
Go!
MICHAEL: Let's go!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
NICOLE: Terry, come on!
Hurry! Hurry!
Goddamn Steve Markus!
NICOLE: Steve, come on!
Steve!
NICOLE: Open the door!
Open the door!
TERRY: Steve!
Fucking kill him!
TERRY: Come on!
Open the door, Steve!
Let's go!
KENNETH: Move!
Go!
C. J: Move it, guys! Move it!
MONICA: Where are you guys going?
Let's go right now.
We're going.
MICHAEL: Go! Go!
ANA: They're right behind us!
KENNETH: Come on, move!
They're right behind us!
I like this song.
Everybody in!
Hey, there you are.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Give me the keys.
ANA: Prick.
What?
I'll deal with you later, motherfucker!
Wait a minute! Nicole!
Man, get in!
I'll take the gun. Okay.
GLEN: Okay, let's get out of here.
Hold on!
Oh, Christ!
C.J., now! Go!
They're trying to turn us over!
Hit them with the saw!
STEVE: Come on, damn it.
C. J: Give me the shotgun!
Holy shit.
There's still one hanging on.
Which fucking side?
Right side.
GLEN: I got him.
You gotta drive faster, man.
Hard left! Hard left! Here!
Whoa! Stop! Stop, guys!
What?
We lost them. Back it up.
Back it up! Back up!
Kenneth, are you there?
Kenneth?
ANA: Kenneth, are you there?
Kenneth, are you okay?
What the fuck?
What are you doing?
Fucking nursery school.
C.J.!
Ana, no. Everyone's dead.
Steve took off.
What?
C. J: Let's go! Come on!
Steve!
I got him.
Damn.
Watch out!
Come on! Come on!
TERRY: Open the door!
Hurry up!
Come on!
Guys, get in!
KENNETH: Let's go.
Where's Ana? Ana!
Ana!
Get in! Get in!
What the hell were you doing?
Hold on!
NICOLE: Come on, boy.
Go.
Kenneth! Here.
Go to the end of the dock.
KENNETH: C.J., come on.
Do it, man. I'll catch up!
There it is.
MICHAEL: Terry, get the bowline.
Shit.
C.J.!
It's jammed! Fuck!
Come on!
Bitch! Shit!
Come on.
It fucking figures.
Okay, let's go. Let's go.
I can't go.
What?
Downtown when they jumped on us.
Oh, no, Michael. No.
I have to stay here.
Wait. You can't.
Not you. Please.
I'm sorry, Ana.
I can help you.
MICHAEL: No, you can't.
You can help them.
MICHAEL: Stay on the boat.
I can help you.
It's okay.
It's gonna be all right.
No.
It won't.
Hey.
It will.
You sure you wanna do this?
Yeah.
I think I'll just stay here awhile.
Enjoy the sunrise.
I run a tight ship.
Where did you get that thing?
TERRY: I found Steve's camera.
Put that down. Help us.
TERRY: Kenneth, fucking shoot it! Shoot it!
TERRY: Christ!
TERRY: Shit.
Get that damn camera out of my face.
Doesn't look like there's anyone there.
Terry, put the camera down while I dock the boat.
TERRY: Nicole, what is it?
NICOLE: Chips, no!
TERRY: Oh, shit!
KENNETH: Stay behind me!

Hmm.
Well.
Maybe when you have children of your own who need braces, and you can't afford them because half your husband's pay goes to the federal government,
- you'll regret that.
- My husband's pay?
[Laughs]
I'm not gonna squeeze one out till I'm, like, 30.
Will you still be working at the Yarn
Barn? Great place to raise kids!
That's really funny.
A year of partying's enough.
She's going to Harvard next fall.
Mom, I haven't gotten in yet.
You think Dukakis will provide for this country till you squeeze one out?
Yeah. I do.
- Can I squeeze one out?
- Not till eighth grade.
Excuse me.
Donnie, you're such a click.
Whoa, Elizabeth.
A little hostile there.
Mom and Dad should pay a therapist
$200 an hour to listen to you so we don't have to.
OK. Wanna tell Mom and Dad why you stopped your medication?
- You're such a fuck-ass.
- What?!
- Please.
- Did he call me a fuck-ass?
- Hey.
- That's enough.
- Go suck a fuck.
- How does one do that?
- Want to know?
- Yes.
We will not have this at the table.
[Mom] Stop!
[Elizabeth stifles a laugh]
- What's a fuck-ass?
- [Dad laughs]
[knock at door]
[softly] Hi.
I'm reading. Get out.
Where do you go at night?
Will you get out of my room?
Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons'?
- You came to ask me that?
- No.
I stopped rolling houses in sixth grade.
What happened to my son?
I don't recognise this person.
You start taking the goddamn pills!
[Door slams]
Bitch.
Our son just called me a bitch.
You're not a bitch.
You're bitching, but you're not a bitch.
[Sighs]
I want to be a president who makes sure
we never again do business with a Panamanian dictator.
- That we never again funnel aid...
- Dukakis.
- Son of a bitch.
- Panama is friendly.
- I talked to Panama's president...
- Tell him, George!
...about cleaning up their money-laundering.
Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence...
[clock chimes]
[ghostly voice] Wake up.
I've been watching you.
Come closer.
Closer.
28 days, six hours,
42 minutes,
12 seconds.
That is when the world will end.
Why?
[Buzzing]
[car drives off]
[sighs]
[rumbling and crashing]
[glass shatters]
[alarm]
[panting]
Son?
Son? Donnie Darko?
Donnie Darko?
- What's going on?
- Who is it?
It's Eddie Darko's kid.
I'm sorry about this. He's a local kid.
- Guess he was sleep-golfing.
- [Both laugh]
Watch out for that drool spot.
Are you all right, son?
Let's stay off the links at night, OK?
I'm sorry, Dr. Fisher. It won't happen again.
- I hate kids.
- Let's golf.
[Sirens]
[girl] Donnie! Donnie! Donnie!
What happened to your house?
- No-one's allowed through...
- This is my house!
He's OK.
[Girl] Donnie, we know you're OK!
[Reporter] Channel 6 News.
We have just arrived on the scene...
Wait a minute. Here's your brother.
- Oh!
- It fell in your room.
Watch yourself down there!
Mrs. Darko? I'm Bob Garland. I'm with the FAA.
- You're what?
- I'm with the FAA.
We'd like to speak to you and Mr. Darko privately.
- In private?
- Please.
All right.
And... here.
- You got it.
- OK.
We have arranged for you to stay at a hotel, get some sleep.
- We will take care of things here.
- Thank you.
[Dad] Kids, we're going to a hotel.
They don't know where it came from.
[TV announcer] Transportation authorities have begun a search...
Frankie Feeder.
...no airline will claim...
You remember him?
From high school.
Hmm.
He died.
- On his way to the prom.
- Mm.
- Remember?
- Mm-hm.
They said he was doomed.
Mm.
Jesus.
They could have said the same thing about Donnie.
[TV news continues]
If it fell from a plane, then what happened to the plane?
They don't know, Samantha.
Mrs. Farmer will bring you home after practice.
Bye, honey.
Donnie. Good luck.
Oh, my God. Tell me everything.
- I'm not allowed to.
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Cherita.
- Shut up.
Darko cheats death, uh?
You're like a celebrity, man.
I kept calling you. Where you been?
We stayed at a hotel.
My dad saw you at the golf course.
You sleepwalking again?
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Now you're famous, have a smoke.
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad?
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
- Goddamn right I will.
- So grotty.
Hey, Cherita. You want a cigarette?
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
Go back to China, bitch.
Just leave her alone.
Some good shit, huh?
It's a fucking cigarette.

"There would be headlines in the papers."
"Even the guys who ran the betting at the wrestling and the barrow boys would hear with respect how Old Misery's house had been destroyed."
"It was as though this plan had been with him all his life, pondered through the seasons, now in his 15th year crystallised with the pain of puberty."
What is Graham Greene trying to communicate with this passage?
Why did the children break into Old Misery's house?
- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.
Joanie, if you had actually read the story, which at 13 pages would have taken you all night, you would know the children find a great deal of money in the mattress.
But they burn it.
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your recent brush with mass destruction you can give us your opinion.
Well, they say when they flood the house and tear it to shreds that destruction is a form of creation, so the fact that they burn the money is ironic.
They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.
They wanna change things.
[Door opens]
May we help you?
I just registered. They put me in the wrong English class.
You look like you belong here.
Um, where do I sit?
Next to the boy you think is the cutest.
- [Excited voices]
- Quiet. Let her choose.
Joanie, get up.
The construction guys say it'll take a week to fix the roof.
That airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
- They still don't know?
- Know what?
Where it came from.
No. Apparently they can't tell us what happened yet.
Something about a matching serial number that got burned.
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
We're not supposed to tell anyone what nobody knows?
Yeah.
But you tell...
What's your doctor's name?
- Dr. Thurman, Dad.
- Yes.
You tell Dr. Thurman whatever you want.
- Dad.
- What?
Dad!
[Dog barking]
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.
[Whispers]
Well, what did she say to you?
- I made a new friend.
- Real or imaginary?
Imaginary...
Would you like to talk about him?
- Frank.
- Frank.
- What did Frank say?
- To follow him.
- Where?
- Into the future.
And then what happens?
And then he said...
Then he said the world was coming to an end.
Do you think it is?
No.
That's stupid.
[TV] For my entire life I was a victim of fear.
Love.
I was feeding fear through food.
Fear.
Finally I looked in the mirror.
Not just in the mirror. I looked through the mirror.
In that image I saw my ego reflection.
I thought ten-year-olds normally wet the bed.
- [Snorts]
- Shh!
The solution was there all the time.
I'm not afraid any more!
All over America, people have come together to join hands.
People who believe that human life is absolutely too important,
too valuable and too precious to be controlled by fear.
Hello.
My name is Jim Cunningham.
Welcome to Controlling Fear.
[Frank] Wake up, Donnie.
"And the prince was led into a world of strange and beautiful magic."
Hey, guess what!
I can't believe it!
The school is closed today because it's flooded.
- No way.
- Yes.
Holy shit! That's the best news I've ever heard.
My God. Is this ever gonna stop?
Eventually, yes. But I've got
12 classrooms full of water, all coming from a busted water main.
- What else?
- What else?!
Principal Cole, I'll show you what else.
- Unbelievable.
- That's solid bronze, isn't it?
How did this happen?
The boys' locker room was flooded.
They found faeces everywhere.
- What are faeces?
- Baby mice.
Hey.
Has anyone ever told you that you're sexy?
- I like your boobs.
- [Boys laugh]
Hey.
Hey.
School's cancelled.
Do you want to walk me home?
Sure.
- Don't look so freaked.
- I'm not.
Check your backpack.
Those guys love to steal shit.
- Why did you move here?
- My parents got a divorce.
My mom got a restraining order against my stepdad.
- He has emotional problems.
- Me too. What kind does he have?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Oh. Did he go to jail?
No, he fled. They still can't find him.
Mom and I had to change our names.
I thought Gretchen Ross was cool.
I was in jail once.
I accidentally burned down this house.
It was abandoned, but still...
I got held back in school,
I can't drive till I'm 21.
But I'm over all of that. I...
I'm painting and stuff. Writing.
I want to be a writer. Maybe a painter.
Maybe both.
I'll write a book and draw the pictures.
Then maybe people will understand me. Change things.
Donnie Darko?
What the hell kind of name is that?
It's like some sort of superhero.
What makes you think I'm not?
Look, I should go.
Monnitoff wants me to write this physics essay.
Greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
If it's Monnitoff, that's easy. Antiseptics.
The whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.
Before antiseptics there was no sanitation.
- Especially in medicine.
- You mean soap?
I'm really glad school was flooded today.
Why's that?
You and I would never have had this conversation.
You're weird.
Sorry.
No, that was a compliment.
Well, look, um...
You wanna go with me?
[Laughs nervously]
Where do you wanna go?
I mean, like, go with me. You know...
That's what we call it here.
- Going together...
- Sure.
OK. Where are you going?
I'm going home.
So stupid!
I'd like to try something new this time.
Have you ever been hypnotised?
No.
When I clap my hands twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
Yes.
So, tell me about your week.
I met a girl.
- What is her name?
- Gretchen.
We're going together now.
Do you still think about girls a lot?
Yeah.
How are things going at school?
I think about girls a lot.
I asked you about school, Donnie.
I think about fucking a lot during school.
What else do you think about during school?
- Married With Children.
- Do you think about your family?
I turn down the volume and think about fucking Christina Applegate.
I asked you about your family, Donnie.
No. [Laughs]
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.
Sam Bylen.
[Clears throat]
Donald Darko.
Daye Dennis.
Hey, you fuck.
Did you tell them I flooded the school?
- I didn't say shit.
- They think I did it.
If you're innocent, you have nothing to worry about.
Fuck you! Know what I think?
I think you did it.
[Coughs]
Beer and pussy. That's all I need.
We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?
- Mm-hm.
Not some tight-assed Middlesex chick.
A cute little blonde that'll get down and dirty with the guys.
- Like Smurfette does.
- Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Smurfette fucks the other smurfs.
Why did Papa Smurf make her?
Because all the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
OK, she fucks them while Vanity watches. OK?
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get in on the action.
He does. He films the gangbang.
Later on he beats off to the tape.
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't create
Smurfette. Gargamel did.
She was sent in as Gargamel's spy, to destroy the smurf village.
But the overwhelming goodness of smurf life transformed her.
And as for the whole gangbang scenario, it just couldn't happen.
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have... reproductive organs under those little white pants.
That's what's so illogical about being a smurf.
What's the point of living if you don't have a click?
Dammit, Donnie, why you gotta get so smart on us?
- [Car horn]
- Grandma Death.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Stay off the road, Miss Sparrow.
I'll have to call social services.
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch.
Yeah.
- How old is Grandma Death?
She does the same thing every day.
Just walks back and forth, back and forth to the mailbox.
And nothing ever in there.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.
- Mail, mail.
- Here it is.
This could be it. Oh!
No dice, Grandma. Sorry.
Someone ought to write that bitch.
[TV announcer] Authorities continued their search
for a suspect in the school vandalism.
The school has asked for donations to help restore its mascot,
known only as the Mongrel.
In cooperation with the county police, we have begun investigating the cause of the flooding and our suspects include several of our own students.
I want to know why this filth is being taught to our children.
[Breathing heavily]
Kitty, I would appreciate if you would wait...
Dr. Cole, not only am I a teacher, but I am also a parent of a Middlesex child.
I am the only person here who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
[Frank] Don't worry.
You got away with it.
I have in my hand Graham Greene's The Destructors.
This short story is part of my daughter's English assignment.
In this story, several children destroy an elderly man's house from inside out.
How can you do that?
[Laughs nervously]
And how do they do this?
They flood the house by breaking through a water main.
[Frank] I can do anything I want.
And so can you.
We pay good money for this school.
It's our children.
I think this garbage should be removed.
Excuse me.
What's the real issue?
The PTA doesn't ban books.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that pornography is being taught.
- It's meant to be ironic.
- You need to go back to grad school.
Why did you make me flood the school?
They are in great danger.
Kitty, do you even know who Graham Greene is?
I think we have all seen Bonanza.
Well, uh... while we are on other topics...
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel?
[Samantha] Who are you talking to?
I was just taking my pills, Sam.
[TV] It is time to breathe.
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.
Thank you, Jim Cunningham.
Now let us begin lifeline exercise NO.1.
Please press stop now.
As you can see, the lifeline is divided into two polar extremes.
Fear and love.
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum and love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- Duh!
- Excuse me?
"Duh" is a product of fear.
Now, on each card is a character dilemma which applies to the lifeline.
Please... Take this.
Thank you.
Please read each character dilemma aloud and place an X on the lifeline in the appropriate place.
Cherita?
"Juanita has an important math test today."
"She has known about the test for several weeks but has not studied."
"In order to keep from failing her test,
Juanita decides that she will cheat on the math test."
Good. Good. Very good.
Um, Mr. Darko.
"Ling Ling finds a wallet filled with money."
"She takes the wallet to the address inside but keeps the money."
[Sighs] I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.
Place an X in the appropriate place.
No, I know what to do. I don't get this.
You can't lump things into two categories.
The lifeline is divided that way.
Life isn't that simple.
Who cares if Ling Ling returns the wallet and keeps the money?
It has nothing to do with fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest human emotions.
OK. But you're not listening to me.
Other things need to be taken into account.
Like the whole spectrum of human emotion.
You can't lump everything into two categories and deny everything else.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Donald.
Let me preface this by saying that your Iowa Test scores are... intimidating.
So... let's go over this again.
What exactly did you say to Mrs. Farmer?
I'll tell you what he said.
He asked me to forcibly insert the exercise card into my anus.
[Laughs then coughs]
[woman] These are modern times.
My political attitudes are forthright.
If there's a vice presidential candidate worthy of my vote, it's Dan Quayle.
Nobody cares about responsibility, morality, family values...
Kitty...
Excuse us, please.
He's suspended from after-school activities for six months.
Ever since this jet engine fiasco
I don't know what's gotten into him.
Rose, our daughters have been on the dance team together for two years and I respect you as a woman.
But after witnessing your son's behaviour, I have doubts about your...
Our paths through life must be righteous.
I urge you to go home and look in the mirror, and pray that your son doesn't succumb to the path of fear.
[Elizabeth] Do you remember that weird gym teacher Mrs. Farmer?
Yeah.
My brother told her to shove a book up her ass today.
And then my parents just bought him all this new shit.
I know. I wish a jet engine would fall in my room.
[Frank] I can show you the way.
[Bells chime]
Yeah.
[Boys laugh]
- Dr. Monnitoff?
- Donnie.
Um, I know this is gonna sound kinda weird, but uh... do you know anything about time travel?
Ah! A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man.
So, according to Hawking, a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space time.
So to travel back in time, you have to have a spaceship that can travel faster than light.
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.
The principles of time travel are there.
You've got a vessel, a portal.
The vessel can be anything.
Probably a spacecraft.
- Like a DeLorean.
- Any metal craft.
I love that movie, the way they shot it.
It's so futuristic, you know.
Listen... don't tell anybody I gave you this.
The woman who wrote this used to teach here.
She was a nun many years before that.
Then overnight she became this entirely different person.
She up and left the church, she wrote this book.
She started teaching science.
Right here in Middlesex.
The Philosophy Of Time Travel.
Roberta Sparrow?
That's right.
[Laughs] Come on.
Roberta Sparrow.
Roberta Sparrow...
Grandma Death.
It's called The Philosophy Of Time Travel.
What does philosophy have to do with time travel?
- Let me see.
- Guess who wrote it.
Roberta Sparrow?
Huh! She wrote a book!
Grandma Death wrote a book.
That's a terrible nickname.
We almost hit her with the car.
She lives in that piece of crap house and you know she's loaded.
- She's...
- You're right.
She used to be known for her gem collection.
Kids... used to go up there and try to steal stuff from her.
She became a total recluse.
I didn't know she was alive till we damn near knocked her down.
[Donny] She was standing in the road, frozen, so I got out of the car and walked over to see if she was OK.
She leaned over and whispered in my ear.
- What did she say?
- Frank wants me to talk to her.
He asked me if I knew about time travel.
She wrote a book about it, so it can't be a coincidence.
What did Roberta Sparrow say to you?
She said every creature on earth dies alone.
How did that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
She died when I was eight.
She crawled underneath the porch.
To die?
To be alone.
Do you feel alone right now?
I...
I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just...
I've just never seen any proof, so I...
I just don't debate it any more.
I could spend my whole life debating it over and over and I still wouldn't have any proof, so I just... I just don't debate it any more.
[Laughs] It's absurd.
The search for God is absurd?
It is if everyone dies alone.
Does that scare you?
I don't want to be alone.
His tapes have made me realise that for the last 39 years I have been a prisoner of my own fear.
- Fear?
- [Sighs]
Rose, you have got to meet this Jim Cunningham.
I can't believe he's single.
[TV] It has been a disappointing night for these Super Bowl champions.
Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines, water dripping off his glasses.
He'll be thinking, "What went wrong tonight?"
- Here's the kick.
- [Men groan]
And it's no good.
We need a quarterback. And a miracle.
We need to go for a safety.
Mark Rypien has some big shoes to fill.
He sure does.
You guys want anything?
I'm gonna get a beer.
[TV commentary continues]
[TV announcer] Good evening, ladies and ghouls.
Join us at the Middlesex pavilion hall
for the Middlesex Halloween Haunt.
[Ghoulish laughter]
[laughs]
[aeroplane]
What if you could go back in time and take all the pain and darkness and replace it with something better?
- Images?
- Yeah. Like a Hawaiian sunset or the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful...
You know, we've been going together for two weeks.
Yeah.
Well, I uh...
Do you wanna kiss me?
Uh...
- I... Sorry...
- Donnie, wait. I just...
I just want it to be at a time when it...
- When what?
- When it reminds me of...
When it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?
Yeah.
And right now there's some fat guy staring at us.
Thank you for seeing us at such late notice.
We both felt it was time to come in and discuss...
What I think is going on with your son?
Yes.
Um... Well, he's uh...
You know about his past, and he was suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher.
I'm not sure that's a good example.
He had just cause to insult...
Rose, let me just lay out what I believe is happening here.
Donnie's aggressive behaviour... his increased detachment from reality... seem to stem from his inability to cope with the forces in the world that he perceives to be threatening.
Has he ever told you about his friend Frank?
Frank?
The giant bunny rabbit.
What?
I don't recall him ever having mentioned a rabbit.
Donnie is experiencing what is called a daylight hallucination.
This is a common occurrence among paranoid schizophrenics.
What can we do?
I would like to do more hypnotherapy.
And increase his medication.
[Thunderclap]
Whatever will help him, really, because that's why we're here.
We just would like him to experience some... relief.
So if you think that more medication will do that, then I think we should give it a try.
[Bells chime]
Donnie Darko.
I know.
[Both laugh]
[music and applause]
- Good morning, you Mongrels.
- Good morning.
Is that all the gusto you can muster?
Good morning!
Good morning.
Now, that's a tiny bit better.
But I can sense some students who are afraid to say good morning.
[Students] Good morning!
That's what I like to hear!
Entirely too many young men and women today are completely paralysed by their fears.
They surrender their bodies to the temptation and destruction of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.
Now, I'm gonna tell you a little story today.
It's a heartbreakingly sad story about a young man whose life was completely destroyed by these instruments of fear.
A young man searching for love in all the wrong places.
His name was Frank.
Um, my stepsister...
I sometimes worry that she eats too much.
- Shut up, Kim.
- Sweetheart, please.
- What can I do when I grow up?
- That's a hard one.
How do I learn how to fight?
"How do I learn how to fight?"
Son, violence is a product of fear.
- Learn to truly love yourself.
- OK.
- Get up here.
- OK.
All right.
- Good morning.
- [Jim] Good morning.
Um, how much are they paying you to be here?
Excuse me?
What is your name, son?
Gerald.
Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Are you telling us this so we buy your book? It's the worst advice I heard.
You see how sad this is?
Want your sister to lose weight? Tell her to get off the couch and exercise.
No-one knows what to do when they grow up.
It takes a while to find that out. Right, Jim?
And you.
Yeah, you.
You sick of some jerk picking on you?
Maybe you should lift weights or do karate.
Next time he tries, kick him in the balls.
[Gasps]
[Jim laughs] Son.
Do you see this?
This is an anger prisoner.
A textbook example.
See the fear, people?
This boy is scared of the truth.
Son, it breaks my heart to say this, but I believe you are a very troubled and confused young man.
You were searching for the answers in the wrong places.
You're right, actually. I am pretty troubled and pretty confused.
And I'm afraid. Really afraid. Really afraid.
But I think you're the fucking Antichrist.
[Shocked gasps]
Get him out of here!
Who do you think you are?
[Whistling and cheering]
It's amazing.
The man thinks he's telling the truth.
Everything he says is a fucking lie.
Everything he says.
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a chud.
- Everything...
- Are you OK?
- Yeah...
- Sit down. Calm down.
You ever hear of Grandma Death?
Who?
The Philosophy Of Time Travel.
What is this?
She wrote it.
I'm...
I've been seeing stuff.
Like a lot of really messed-up stuff.
Chapters in there describe what
I've seen. It can't be a coincidence.
[Monnitoft] Each vessel travels along a vector through space time, along its centre of gravity.
Like a spear?
- Pardon?
- A spear coming out of your chest.
Um... sure, yeah.
For the vessel to travel through time, it's got to find a portal, in this case a wormhole...
Could these portals just appear anywhere, any time?
I think that's highly unlikely.
What you're talking about is an act of God.
If God controls time, time's pre-decided.
- I don't follow.
- Every living thing has a set path.
And if you could see your path or channel, you could see into the future.
Like... a form of time travel.
You're contradicting yourself, Donnie.
If we were able to see our destinies manifest themselves visually, then we would be given a choice to betray our chosen destinies.
The fact that this choice exists would make all pre-formed destiny come to an end.
Not if you travel in God's channel.
Um... I'm not going to be able to continue this conversation.
- Why?
- I could lose my job.
OK.
[Birdsong]
[laughs]
Now you know where he lives.
And they grow out of our chest... solar plexus?
Like she described in the book.
The way they moved and smelled...
Like they're workers.
Assigned to each one of us.
They just... They're like liquid.
I followed it... into my parents' bedroom.
What did you find?
Nothing.
So we call them IMGs.
Infant Memory Generators.
So you buy the glasses for an infant and they wear them when they sleep.
But inside the glasses are these slide photographs, and each one is of something peaceful or beautiful, whatever the parents want to put inside.
What effect would this have on an infant?
Well, nobody remembers their infancy.
Anyone who says they do is lying.
We think this'll develop memory earlier in life.
Yeah.
Did you consider that darkness is part of infants' natural development?
No.
Yeah.
What if the parents put in pictures of Satan?
Dead people, crap like that.
Is that what you'd show your kids?
Uh, well, I mean... didn't your dad stab your mom?
Ha ha ha ha!
Get out.
Gretchen!
Gretchen. Gretchen.
I'm sorry about those guys.
- Two for Evil Dead, please.
- Two dollars.

Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?
Why are you wearing that stupid man's suit?
Take it off.
What happened to your eye?
I'm so sorry.
Why do they call you Frank?
It's the name of my father... and his father before me.
Frank?
When's this gonna stop?
You should already know that.

[Police radio]
Captain, looks like we got another room back here.
[TV announcer] The blaze was extinguished sometime after 8 p.m.
Firefighters discovered what has been called a "kiddie porn dungeon."
Cunningham, who has become a celebrity for his books and tapes,
was arrested this morning...
Oh, my God!
Arson has not been ruled out as the cause of the fire.
A group of Cunning Vision employees...
Dad played golf with that guy.
...denied alleged links to a child pornography publishing circuit.
In a vicious statement, Cunningham attacked fire department officials,
claiming a vast conspiracy.
[Dr. Cole] Karen, we don't think the methods you've used are appropriate.
What exactly about my methods do you find inappropriate?
I don't have time for a debate.
I believe I've made myself clear.
You call this clarity?
You don't have a clue what it's like to communicate with kids.
And we are losing them to apathy.
To this prescribed nonsense.
They're slipping away.
I am sorry that you have failed.
If you'll excuse me, I have another appointment.
You can finish out the week.
[Screams]
Good afternoon.
It gives me great pleasure to announce that the school dance team has been invited to perform on Ed McMahon's Star Search '88 in Los Angeles, California.
No, it was ridiculous...
I'll call you back.
- Rose.
- Kitty.
I'm sure you're aware of the horrible allegations against Jim Cunningham.
I saw it on TV.
Something about a kiddie porn...
Oh, please! Don't use those words!
It's obviously a conspiracy to destroy an innocent man.
I am going to spearhead the
Jim Cunningham defence campaign.
Rose, I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning.
The girls are scheduled to leave for Los Angeles in the morning.
As their coach, I was the obvious choice to chaperone them...
But now you can't go.
- Yes.
- Hm.
Now, believe me, of all the other mothers,
I wouldn't dream of asking you.
But none of the other mothers are available to go.
I don't know, Kitty.
It's a bad weekend. Eddie's in New York.
Rose, I don't know if you realise what an opportunity this is for our daughters.
This has been a dream of Samantha's and all of ours for a long time.
I made her lead dancer.
Sometimes I doubt your commitment to Sparkle Motion.
Elizabeth will be in charge.
She'll drive you to therapy.
And if you need anything, promise me you will call Dr. Thurman.
OK.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.
What do I tell the others when they ask about you?
Tell them everything is gonna be just fine.
What's "cellar door"?
[Sighs] This famous linguist once said that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history, that "cellar door" is the most beautiful.
"Cellar door"?
I promise that one clay everything's gonna be better for you.
Shut up!
- I want to talk about your past today.
- No.
I want to talk about you and your parents.
They didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel, being denied these Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You did it again?
I flooded my school and I burned down that pervert's house.
[Laughs]
I only have a few clays before they catch me.
Did Frank tell you to do these things?
I have to obey him. He saved my life.
I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone, and then... and then I won't be able to figure out what this is all about.
I won't be able to know his master plan.
Do you mean God's master plan?
Do you now believe in God?
I have the power to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
How is time travel possible, Donnie?
Time's up, Frank said.
When is this going to happen?
Soon.
[Sobs] Soon.
What is going to happen?
[Sobs] Frank is gonna kill.
Who is he going to kill?
[Breathes heavily]
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him!
The sky is going to open up.
If the sky were to suddenly open up, there would be no law.
There would be no rule.
There would only be you and your memories.
The choices you've made and the people you've touched.
If this world were to end, there would only be you and him.
And no-one else.

Hey.

NARRATOR:
On the clearest of nights when the winds of the Etherium were calm and peaceful
[Creaking] the great merchant ships with their cargoes of Arcturian sura crystals felt safe and secure
Little did they suspect that they were pursued by pirates
And the most feared of all these pirates was the notorious
Captain Nathaniel Flint
Fire!
[All gasping]
Aah!
Like a Candarian zap-wing overtaking its prey--
[Door creaks]
WOMAN:
James Pleiades Hawkins l thought you were asleep an hour ago. l thought you were asleep an hour ago.
Mom, I was just getting to the best part.
Please?
Oh, can those eyes get any bigger?

Flint and his band of renegades swooped in out of nowhere
[Jingling]
Ha ha ha ha!
And then. gathering up their spoils vanished without a trace
-Ooh!
-Ooh!
NARRATOR: Flint's secret trove was never found but stories have persisted that it remains hidden somewhere at the farthest reaches of the galaxy stowed with riches beyond imagination-- the loot of a thousand worlds
JIM AND NARRATOR:
Treasure Planet
OK. Blow your nose.
How do you think
Captain Flint did it, Mom?
How'd he swoop in out of nowhere and vanished without a trace? l have no idea.
Come here, you, you li--
I'm gonna get--oh!

OK, now it's time for this little spacer to go to sleep.

Back off, sir!
Thank you, Delbert. l will take it from here.
Well, Sarah, if you insist.
Ahem. Don't ever let me do that again.

Trying to run a business while raising a felon like-- felon...fellow... fellow like Jim.
Managing it?
I'm at the end of my rope.
Ever since his father left well. Jim's just never recovered
And you know how smart he is
He built his first solar surfer when he was eight!
And yet. he's failing at school he is constantly in trouble and when I talk to him. he's like a stranger to me
I don't know. Delbet
I've tried everything--
[Engines sputtering]
Hey, Mister?
Mister, you're OK in there, right?
[Growling]
Aah!
[Coughing]
He's a-comin'.
Can you hear him?
Those gears and gyros clickin' and whirrin'... like the devil himself!
Uh, hit your head there pretty hard, didn't ya?
He's after me chest... that fiendish cyborg and his band of cutthroats.

But they'll have to pry it... from old Billy Bones' cold, dead fingers afore I--argh!

Oh, my--
Uh, come on, give me your arm.
That's it.

-Mom's gonna love this.

Thanks for listening, Delbert.

It's going to be OK.
You'll see. l keep dreaming one day
I'll open that door... and there he'll be just the way he was.
A smiling, happy little boy, holding a new pet... and begging me to let him keep it.

I'm afraid the old Benbow Inn has burned to the ground.
Ahem. Well, certainly a lot of trouble... over that odd little sphere.
Those markings baffle me
Unlike anything
I've ever encountered

DOPPLER: Even with my vast experience and superior intellect it would take me years to unlock its--hey!

Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
This is us, the planet Montressor.
[Gasps]
That's the Magellanic Cloud!
Whoo! The Coral Galaxy!
Oh!
DOPPLER:
That's the Cygnus Cross and that's the Kerian Abyss.
Wait. What's this? What's this?
Why, it--it's...
Treasure Planet.
No!
That's Treasure Planet!
DOPPLER: Flint's trove?
The loot of a thousand worlds?
You know what this means?
It means that all that treasure is only a boat ride away.
Whoever brings it back would hold an eternal place... atop the pantheon of explorers!
He'd be able to experience--
[Click]
Whoo! What just happened?
Mom, this is it. This is the answer to all our problems.
Jim, there is absolutely no way--
Don't you remember, all those stories?
That's all they were--stories!
With that treasure... we could rebuild the Benbow a hundred times over!
Well, this is-- it's just--oh, my.
Delbert, would you please explain how ridiculous this is?
It's totally preposterous... traversing the entire galaxy alone.
SARAH: Now at last, we hear some sense!
-That's why I'm going with you.
-Delbert!
I'll use my savings to finance the expedition.
I'll commission a ship, hire a captain and a crew.
You're not serious.
All my life I've been waiting for an opportunity like this... and here it is screaming,
''Go, Delbert! Go, Delbert!''
OK. OK! You're both grounded!
[Sighs]
JIM: Mom. look l know that I keep messing everything up... and I know... that I let you down.
But this is my chance to make it up to you.
I'm gonna set things right.
Sarah?
If I may?
You said yourself, you've tried everything.
There are much worse remedies... than a few character-building months in space.
Are you saying this because it's the right thing... or because you really want to go? l really, really, really, really want to go... and it's the right thing.
[Sighs]
Jim... l don't want to lose you.
Mom...you won't.
I'll make you proud.
DOPPLER: Well. uh. ahem
There we are then.
We'll begin preparations at once.
We'll begin preparations at once.
Jim, my boy, soon we'll be off to the spaceport.

Well, Jim, this should be a wonderful opportunity... for the two of us to get to know one another.
You know what they say, familiarity breeds, um... well, contempt, but, in our case--
Look, let's just find the ship. OK?
[Clank]
-Second berth on your right!
-You can't miss it.
Hey, thanks.
It's the suit, isn't it? l should never have listened... to that pushy two-headed saleswoman.
This one said it fit, that one said it was my color. l didn't know what to do. l get so flustered. Ooh!
Oh, Jim! This is our ship!
The R.L.S. Legacy!
Whoa!
OFFICER:
Stow those casks forward!
Heave together now!
How cool is this?
[Squishing noise]
Sorry about that. l didn't mean--
[Angry farting noises]
Allow me to handle this.
[Pfft pffft pffft]

[Chuckling]
[Eek pfft]
I'm fluent in Flatula, Jim.
Took two years of it in high school.
[Pffft]
Flatula? Cool.
Good morning, Captain.
Everything shipshape?
Shipshape it is, sir, but I'm not the captain.
The captain's aloft.
[Meow]
Mr. Arrow, I've checked this miserable ship... from stem to stern, and, as usual, it's...spot on.
Can you get nothing wrong?
You flatter me, Captain.
Ah, Dr. Doppler, I presume?
Uh, um, yes. l--
-Hello! Can you hear me?
-Yes, I can! Stop that banging!
If I may, Doctor, this works so much better... when it's right-way up and plugged in.
-Ooh!
-Lovely. There you go.
If you don't mind, l can manage my own plugging!
I'm Captain Amelia... late of a few run-ins with the Protean armada.
Nasty business, but I won't bore you with my scars.
You've met my first officer, Mr. Arrow.
Sterling, tough, dependable, honest, brave, and true.
Please, Captain.
Oh, shut up, Arrow. You know l don't mean a word of it.
Ahem, excuse me. I hate to interrupt this lovely banter... but may I introduce to you,
Jim Hawkins?
Jim, you see, is the boy who found the treasure--
Doctor, please!
[Growls]
I'd like a word with you in my stateroom.
Doctor, to muse and blabber about a treasure map... in front of this particular crew... demonstrates a level of ineptitude... that borders on the imbecilic... and I mean that in a very caring way.
Imbecilic, did you say?
Foolishness, I've--
May I see the map, please?
Here.
Hmm. Fascinating.
Mr. Hawkins, in the future... you will address me as ''Captain'' or ''Ma'am.'' ls that clear?
Ugh...
Mr. Hawkins?
-Yes, ma'am.
-That'll do.
Gentlemen, this must be kept under lock and key... when not in use.
And, Doctor, again... with the greatest possible respect... zip your howling screamer.
Captain, I assure you l--
Let me make this as monosyllabic as possible. l don't much care for this crew you hired.
They're...how did l describe them, Arrow? l said something rather good this morning before coffee.
''A ludicrous parcel of driveling galoots,'' ma'am.
-There you go--poetry.
-Now, see here--
Doctor, I'd love to chat-- tea, cake, the whole shebang-- but I have a ship to launch... and you've got your outfit to buff up.
Mr. Arrow, please escort these two neophytes... down to the galley straightaway.
Young Hawkins will be working for our cook, Mr. Silver.
What? The cook?
That woman! That...feline!
Who does she think is working for whom?
It's my map, and she's got me bussin' tables?
I'll not tolerate a cross word about our captain!
There's no finer officer in this or any galaxy.
[Whistling]
ARROW: Mr Silver?
Why, Mr. Arrow, sir.
Bringin' in such fine and distinguished gents to grace my humble galley.
Had I known,
I'd have tucked in me shirt.
Heh heh heh heh!
A cyborg!
May I introduce Dr. Doppler?
The financier of our voyage.
Love the outfit, Doc.
Well, thank you.
Um, love the eye.
Uh, this young lad is Jim Hawkins.
Jimbo! Uh...
Aw, now, don't be too put off by this hunk of hardware.
[Humming]
Whoa!
These gears have been tough getting used to... but they do come in mighty handy from time to time.
[Humming]
Mmm!
Here, now, have a taste of me famous bonzabeast stew.
[Sniffing]
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
Mmm! Delightfully tangy, yet robust.
SILVER: Old family recipe
Aah! ln fact, that was part of the old family!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, ho! I'm just kiddin', Doc!
Uh, yeah, well...
I'm nothin' if I ain't a kidder.
Go on, Jimbo. Have a swig.
[Giggling]
SILVER: Morph!
You jiggle-headed blob of mischief!
So that's where you was hiding!
[Chattering]
[Belch]
Wha--? Ha!
What is that thing?
''What is that thing?''
SILVER: He's a morph
I rescued the little shape-shifter on Proteus 1
[Cooing]
Aw, he took a shine to me.
We been together ever since.
Right? Yeah. Nice boy.
We're about to get underway.
Would you like to observe the launch, doctor?
Would l?
Does an active galactic nucleus have superluminal jets?
I'll follow you.
Mr. Hawkins will stay here in your charge, Mr. Silver.
[Cough]
Beggin' your pardon, sir, but--
Captain's orders! See to it the new cabin boy's kept busy.
-Aw, but, no, but--
-No, you can't--
[Both sigh]
So, Captain's put you with me, eh?
Whatever.
Well, who be a humble cyborg to argue with a captain?
Yeah.
You know...these purps... they're kind of like the ones back home on Montressor.
You ever been there? l can't say as I have, Jimbo.
Come to think of it, just before I left... l met this old guy, who was, um... he was kind of looking for a cyborg buddy of his. ls that so?
Yeah.
What was that old salamander's name?
Oh, yeah. Bones.
Billy Bones?
Bones? Bones?!
Mm-mmm.
T'ain't ringin' any bells.
Must have been a different cyborg.
There's a slew of cyborgs roamin' this port.
[Whistle on-deck]
ARROW: Prepare to cast off!
Eh, off with you, lad, and watch the launch.
There'll be plenty work a-waitin' for you afterwards.
[Humming]
[Chattering]
We best be keepin' a sharp eye on this one, eh, Morph?
We wouldn't want him strayin' into things he shouldn't.
We're all clear, Captain!
Well, my friend. Are we ready to raise this creaking tub?
My pleasure, Captain.
All hands to stations!
ARROW: Smatly now!
Come on, you scurvy scum!
I'll race you!
Loose all solar sails!
[Grunting]
Come on!
ARROW: Heave up the braces
Brace up
[Crackling]
Ooh. Oh.
Mr. Zoff, engage artificial gravity.
[Poomp poomp poomp pooomp]
[Clank]
[Clatter]
South by southwest,
Mr. Turnbuckle, heading 2-1-0-0.
Aye, Captain. 2-1-0-0.
Full speed, Mr. Arrow, if you please.
Take her away!
[Revving]
Brace yourself, Doctor.
[Snidely] ''Brace yourself.''
Aah! Oof!
Whoa.
[Woooo]
[Woooo]
Upon my word, an Orcus Galacticus.
Smile.
Uh, Doctor, I'd stand clear--
Ha.
SILVER: Ah. 'tis a grand day for sailing. Captain and look at you
You're as trim and as bonny as a sloop with new sails and a fresh coat of paint
You can keep that kind of flim-flammery... for your spaceport floozies,
Silver.
Spaceport floozy, spaceport floozy--
You cut me to the quick,
Captain. l speaks nothing but me heart at all times.
MORPH: Nothing but me heat
And, by the way, isn't that your cabin boy... aimlessly footling about in those shrouds?
Yep, it--oh...
A momentary aberration, Cap'n, soon to be addressed. Jimbo! l got two new friends
I'd like you to meet.
Say hello to Mr. Mop and Mrs. Bucket.
Heh heh heh heh!
Yippie.
Yeah, I got your Mr. Mop.
Watch it, twerp.
[Murmuring]
What are you looking at, weirdo?
Yeah, weirdo.
[Hisssss]
Cabin boys should learn to mind their own business.
Why? You got something to hide, bright eyes?
Maybe your ears don't work so well.
[Grunts] Yeah. Ahem.
Too bad my nose works just fine.
Why, you impudent little--
[Crew shouting]
Go ahead! Slice him! Dice him!
[Poot poot phoot]
Any last words, cabin boy?
Mr. Scroop... you ever see what happens to a fresh purp... when you squeeze real hard?
ARROW: What's all this. then?
You know the rules.
There'll be no brawling on this ship.
Aye, aye, sir.
Any further offenders will be confined to the brig... for the remainder of the voyage.
Am I clear, Mr. Scroop?
Transparently.
SILVER:
Well done, Mr. Arrow, sir!
A tight ship's a happy ship, sir.
Jimbo, I gave you a job.
Hey, I was doing it until that bug thing--
Belay that! Now, I want this deck swabbed spotless... and heaven help you if l come back and it's not done.
Morph?
Keep an eye on this pup... and let me know if there be any more distractions.
OK Aye-aye
[Chattering]
[Sighs]
[Crew grumbling]
[Crew grumbling]
So, we're all here, then.
-Excuse me.
-Fine.
Now, if you pardon my plain speaking, gentlemen... are you all... stark-raving, totally blinking daft?!
[Chatters]
After all me finagling getting us hired... as an upstanding crew... you want to blow the whole mutiny before it's time?
The boy was sniffing about.
You just stick to the plan, you bug-brained twit.
As for the boy,
I'll run him so ragged... he won't have time to think.
[Morph laughs]
[Coughs]
[Sighs]
Well, this has been a fun day, huh?
Making new friends like that spider psycho.
Spider psycho, spider psycho.
Heh. A little uglier.
Mwah-ha-ha-ha!
Pretty close.
SILVER: Well thank heavens for little miracles.
Up here for an hour... and the deck's still in one piece.
Um, look, l, uh...
What you did...
Thanks.
Didn't your pap ever teach you... to pick your fights a bit more carefully?
Your father's not the teachin' sort.
No.
He was more the taking off and never coming back sort.
Oh.
Sorry, lad.
Hey, no big deal.
I'm doing just fine. ls that so?
Well, since the captain has put you in my charge... like it or not,
I'll be pounding a few skills... into that thick head of yours to keep you out of trouble.
-What?
-From now on...
I'm not letting you out of me sight.
You can't do--
You won't so much as eat, sleep... or scratch your bum without my say-so.
Don't do me any favors!
Oh, you can be sure of that, my lad.
You can be sure of that.
You can be sure of that.
Heh heh heh heh!
Put some elbow into it.
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that's held in your arms
And what do you think you'd ever say
I won't listen anyway
You don't know me
And I'll never be what you want
Made of pain
And what do you think you'd understand?
I'm a boy. no. I'm a man
You can take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what's never shown
Yeah. you stand here on your own
They don't know me
'Cause I'm not here
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things h don't feel
Want to hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change
They're the ones that stay the same
They don't know me
But I'm still here
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted. h could be
Now you know me
And I'm not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can't break me
As long as I know who I am
They can't tell me who to be
'Cause I'm not what they see
Yeah. the world is still sleeping
While I keep on dreaming for me
While I keep on dreaming for me
And the words are just whispers and lies
That I'll never believe
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things h don't feel
Want to hold on and feel I belong
Whoa!
How can you say h never change?
They're the ones that stay the same
I'm the one now
'Cause I'm still here
I'm the one son still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
[Song fades]
[Pulley squeaking]
[Grunts]
Oh, ho ho!
You having a little trouble there?
Oh, get away from me.
[Laughing]
Oh, Jimbo.
If I could maneuver a skiff like that when I was your age... they'd be bowing in the streets when I walked by today.
Bowing in the streets.
-Oof.
-Oof. l don't know.
They weren't exactly singing my praises when I left home.
-Heh. Whew.
-Whew.
But I'm gonna change all that.
Are you now? How so?
Uh, I got some plans.
Gonna make people see me a little different.
Ooh.
Sometimes, plans go astray.
Not this time.
Hmm.
Ooh...
[Chatters]
Oh, thank you, Morphy.
So, uh, how'd that happen anyway?
You give up a few things chasing a dream.
Was it worth it?
Heh.
[Sighs]
I'm hoping it is, Jimbo. l most surely am.
[Screams]
[Ship groans]
What the devil?
Good heavens.
The star Pelusa... it's gone supernova!
Evasive action, Mr. Turnbuckle!
Aye-aye, Captain.
All hands, fasten your lifelines!
[Shouting]
Mr. Arrow, secure those sails!
Secure all sails!
Reef them down. men!
Yeah, baby! Ba-boom!
Ha ha ha ha!
-Aah!
-Silver!
Whoa. Thanks, lad.
[Yelling]
Captain, the star!
It's devolving into a...
[Gasps] a black hole!
We're being pulled in!
Ohh!
No, you don't, you--
Blast these waves!
They're so deucedly erratic!
No, Captain.
They're not erratic at all.
There'll be one more in precisely 47.2 seconds.
Followed by the biggest magilla of them all!
Of course! Brilliant, Doctor!
We'll ride that last magilla out of here.
All sails secured, Captain!
Good man!
Now release them immediately!
Aye, Captain.
You heard her, men.
Unfurl those sails
-What?!
-But we just finished...
-Tying them down!
-Make up your blooming minds!
Mr. Hawkins... make sure all lifelines are secured good and tight!
Aye-aye, Captain.
Lifelines secured, Captain!
Very good!
Gaah! Whoa!
Oof!
[Gasps]
Aah!
DOPPLER:
Captain. the last wave!
Here it comes!
Hold on to your lifelines, gents!
It's gonna be a bumpy ride!
[Whimpers]
[Boom]
Oof!
[Crew cheering]
[Sighs]
Captain! That--oh, my goodness.
That was-- that was absolutely-- that was the most--
Oh, tish-tosh.
Actually, Doctor... your astronomical advice was most helpful.
Well, uh, uh--thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, I have a lot of help to offer anatomically-- amanamonically-- as-astronomically. [Slap]
Well, I must congratulate you,
Mr. Silver.
It seems your cabin boy... did a bang-up job with those lifelines.
[Both chuckle]
All hands accounted for,
Mr. Arrow?
Mr. Arrow?
I'm afraid Mr. Arrow has been lost.
His lifeline was not secured.
No, I checked them all. l--l did. I checked them all.
They were secure. l swear.
Mr. Arrow was a...
Ahem. Fine spacer... finer than most of us could ever hope to be... but he knew the risks, as do we all.
Resume your posts.
We carry on.
[Whimpers]
[Ship creaking]
It weren't your fault, you know?
[Sighs]
Why, half the crew would be spinning in that black abyss--
Look, don't you get it?! l screwed up!
For two seconds, l thought that maybe... l could do something right, but--
Aagh! I just--
[Sighs]
Just forget it. Forget it.
Now, you listen to me,
James Hawkins.
You got the makings of greatness in ya... but you gotta take the helm and chart your own course.
Stick to it, no matter the squalls... and when the time comes you get the chance... to really test the cut of your sails... and show what you're made of, well, I hope I'm there... catching some of the light coming off ya that day.
[Sniffles]
[Sobs softly]
There, there.
Lad, it's all right, Jimbo.
It's all right.
Now, Jim, l, um... l best be getting about my watch... and you best be getting some shut-eye.
[Chattering]
Getting in too deep here,
Morphy.
Next thing ya know, they'll be saying I've gone soft.
[Crew snoring]
[Crew snoring]
[Muttering]
[Poomp phem poom-poomp]
[Poooomp]
[Pfft-pfft-pfft]
[Phooomp]
Uh--oh! Oh! Ugh!
[Sighs]
Morph?
Morph, knock it off.
It's too early for this.
Ow! Hey, Morph!
Pbbbt!
[Laughs]
-Hey, come back here!
-Come back here!
Gotcha, Morph!
[Sighs]
That's it, you little squid.
You little squid.
You little squid.
Squid. Squid. Squid. Squid.
Ungh! Unh!
Ha! Busted!
Look. what we're saying is we're sick of all this waiting
There's only three of them left
We are wanting to move.
We don't move till we got the treasure in hand.
SCROOP: h say we kill 'em all now l say what's to say!
Disobey my orders again... like that stunt you pulled with Mr. Arrow... and so help me, you'll be joining him! and so help me, you'll be joining him!
Strong talk, but I know otherwise.
SILVER: You got something to say. Scroop?
It's that boy.
Methinks you have a soft spot for him.
SAILORS: Yeah
Now, mark me, the lot of ya. l care about one thing, and one thing only!
Flint's trove.
You think I'd risk it all for the sake... of some nose-wiping little whelp?
SCROOP: What was it now?
''Oh. you got the makings of greatness in ya ''
Shut your yap! l cozied up to that kid to keep him off our scent.
But I ain't gone soft.
ONUS: Land ho!
Ha ha ha! There it is!
Feast eyes and click heels if you got 'em.
Where the devil's me glass?
Jimbo.
Playing games, are we?
Yeah.
Yeah, we're playing games.
Oh, I see. Well, I was never much good at games.
Always hated to lose. [Click]
Hmm.
Me, too!
Yaaah!
Right-o...
SILVER: Ohh blast it all
[Blows whistle]
Change in plan, lads!
We move now!
[Cheering]
Strike our colors, Mr. Onus.
With pleasure, Captain.
[Roars]
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.
Pirates on my ship?
I'll see they all hang.
Doctor, familiar with these?
[Gun powers up]
Oh, I've seen-- well, I've read--
Uh, no. No. No, I'm not.
Ooh.
[Laughs]
Mr. Hawkins!
Defend this with your life.
Morph! Give me that!
Oh, you're taking all day about it.
Oh! Stop them!
DOPPLER: Aah, aah, aah. Oof!
Ooh hoo hoo!
Hey, you!
To the longboats, quickly!
Unh!
Rrr-yeah!
[Cocks gun]
Morph! No!
AMELIA: Chew on this, you pus-filled boils!
[Screaming]
Did you actually aim for that?
You know, actually, I did.
[Gears turning]
Oh, blast it.
Doctor, when I say ''now'', shoot out the forward cable.
I'll take this one.
JIM: Morph. here! Morph!
Morph!
Morphy, come here. [Whistles]
Morph. Morph. Bring it here.
Morph, come here.
Come here. Come here, boy.
Come to your dad.
Come here, boy. Morph!
-Come on!
-Morph! Morph, here!
-Morphy!
-Morph!
[Groans] Ohh.
[Powers up]
[Beeping]
[Sighs]
Now!
Whoa!
Unh!
Jim!
Parameters met.
Hydraulics engaged.
That's it! Come to papa!
Hold your fire!
We'll lose the map!
Captain!
Laser ball at 1 2 o'clock!
-Whoa!
-Aah!
[Creaking]
Ow.
Oh, my goodness.
That was more fun than l ever want to have again.
[Chuckles]
That's not one of my... gossamer landings. Unh!
Captain!
Oh. Ooh.
Oh, don't fuss.
Uh-uh--
Slight bruising. That's all.
Cup of tea, and I'll be right as rain.
Mr. Hawkins.
The map if you please.
Ah.
[Giggling]
Morph!
[Giggling]
Morph!
Morph, where's the map?!
Are you serious?!
It's back on the ship?
Stifle that blob and get low.
[Engine whining]
CAPTAIN AMELIA:
We've got company
We need a more defensible position.
Mr. Hawkins, scout ahead.
Aye, Captain.
-Unh!
-Steady, steady.
Now, let's have a look at that.
[Wind whistling]
[Morph chattering]
[Rattling]
[Gasps]
Shh. shh.
[Powers up]
-Aah!
-Aah!
Oh, this is fantastic!
A carbon-based life form come to rescue me at last! l just want to hug you and squeeze you... and hold you close to me.
All right. OK.
Would you just let go of me?
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
It's just I've been marooned for so long. l mean, solitude's fine.
Don't get me wrong.
For heaven's sakes, after a hundred years... you go a little nuts!
Ha ha ha!
I'm sorry. Am l... l am, um...
My name is, uh...
[Cuckoo cuckoo]
B.E.N.! Of course, I'm B.E.N.
Bioelectronic Navigator. Oops.
-And you are?
-Jim.
Oh, what a pleasure to meet you, Jimmy.
-It's Jim.
-Anyway...
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry, OK? l got to find a place to hide, and there's pirates chasing me.
Oh, pirates!
Don't get me started on pirates! l don't like them. l remember Captain Flint.
This guy had such a temper.
Wait, wait, wait.
You knew Captain Flint? l think he suffered from mood swings, personally.
I'm not a therapist, and anyway... but l--you let me know when I'm rambling.
But that means--but wait.
But then you gotta know about the treasure?
-Treasure?
-Yeah, Flint's trove?
You know, loot of a thousand worlds.
It's--well, it's... it's all a little-- little--little fuzzy.
Wait. l--l r-r-remember. l do. l--treasure!
Lots of treasure buried in the centroid-- centroid--centroid of the mechanism.
And there was this big door opening and closing... and opening and closing... and Captain Flint wanted to make sure... nobody could ever get to his treasure... so I helped him...
[Sputtering]
Aah! Data inaccessible! Reboot!
JIM: BEN ? BEN ? BEN !
Reboot! Aah! And you are?
Wait, wait, wait!
What about the treasure? l want to say Larry.
The--the centroid of the mechanism, or--
I'm sorry. My memory isn't what it used to be.
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.
I've lost my mind. Ha ha!
I've lost my mind.
You haven't found it, have you?
Uh, my missing piece?
My primary memory circuit?
Look, B.E.N., I really need to find a place to hide, OK?
So I'm just gonna be, you know, moving on.
Oh, uh, so, well, then... l guess, uh... this is good-bye, huh?
I'm sorry that
I'm so dysfunctional.
So, uh, go ahead and... l do understand. l do. Bye-bye.
[Whines]
[Sighs] Look, if you're gonna come along... you're gonna have to stop talking.
Huzzah! Ha ha ha!
Oh, this is fantastic!
Me and my best buddy are lookin' for a...
[Clears throat]
[Whispering] Being quiet.
And you have to stop touching me.
Touching and talking.
That's my two big no-nos.
OK. Now, I think that we should--
Say, listen, before we go out on our big search... um, would you mind if we made a quick pit stop at my place?
[Chuckles] Kind of urgent.
JIM: BEN. I think you just solved my problem
BEN:
Uh. pardon the mess. people
You'd think in a hundred years... l would've dusted a little more often... but, you know, when you're batchin' it... you tend to, uh, let things go.
Aw, isn't that sweet? l find old-fashioned romance so touching, don't you?
How about drinks for the happy couple?
Oh, uh, ooh. Uh, no.
Thank you, we don't drink... and, uh, we're not a couple.
Ahem.
Look at these markings.
They're identical to the ones on the map. l suspect these are the hieroglyphic remnants... of an ancient culture.
CAPTAIN AMELIA: Mr Hawkins stop anyone who tries to approach. Ohh!
Yes, yes. Now listen to me... stop giving orders for a few milliseconds and lie still.
Very forceful, Doctor.
Go on. Say something else.
BEN: Hey. look! There's some more of your buddies!
BEN: Hey. look! There's some more of your buddies!
Hey, fellas!
We're over here, fellas!
Oh! Uhh! Ooh! Ohh!
Stop wastin' your fire!
SILVER: Hello. up there!
Jimbo?
If it's all right with the captain...
I'd like a short word with ya.
No tricks, just a little palaver.
Come to bargain for the map, doubtless.
Pestilential...
-Ugh!
-Captain.
That means...that he thinks we still have it.
Ah, Morphy! I wondered where you was off to.
[Groaning]
Ooh.
Oh, this poor old leg's downright snarky... since that game attack we had in the galley.
[Chuckles]
Ahh.
Whatever you heard back there... at least the part concerning you... l didn't mean a word of it.
Had that bloodthirsty lot thought I'd gone soft... they'd have gutted us both.
Listen to me.
If we play our cards right... we can both walk away from this rich as kings.
-Yeah?
-Ha ha ha.
You get me that map... and, uh... an even portion of the treasure is yours.
[Chuckles]
Boy.
You are really something.
All that talk of greatness... light coming off my sails... what a joke.
Now, just see here, Jimbo-- l mean, at least you taught me one thing.
Stick to it, right?
Well, that's just what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make sure that you never see... one drabloon of my treasure!
That treasure is owed me, by thunder!
Well, try to find it without my map, by thunder!
Oh, you still don't know how to pick your fights, do you, boy?
Now, mark me.
Either I get that map by dawn tomorrow... or so help me,
I'll use the ship's cannons... to blast ya all to kingdom come!
Morph, hop to it.
Now!
Oh, blast it!
Gentlemen... we must stay together and... and...ohh.
And what? What?!
We must stay together and what?!
Doctor, you have wonderful eyes.
She's lost her mind!
Well, you gotta help her.
Dang it, Jim. I'm an astronomer, not a doctor. l mean, I am a doctor, but I'm not that kind of doctor. l have a doctorate.
It's not the same thing.
You can't help people with a doctorate.
You just sit there, and you're useless.
It's OK, Doc.
It's all right.
Yeah, Doc! Jimmy knows exactly how to get out of this.
It's just Jimmy has this knowledge of things.
Jim, any thoughts at all?
Without the map, we're dead.
If we try to leave, we're dead.
-If we stay here--
-We're dead!
We're dead! We're dead!
Well, I think that Jimmy could use a little quiet time. Heh.
So I'll just slip out the back door.
-Back door?
-Oh, yeah. l get this delightful breeze through here... which I think is important... because ventilation among friends--
Whoa What is all this stuff?
You mean the miles and miles of machinery that run through the entire course of the inside of this planet?
Not a clue.
Hey, Doc! Doc! I think l found a way out of here!
No, no. Jim, wait.
The captain ordered us to stay--
-I'll be back.
-Cannonball!
Woof.
[Snoring]
-So, what's the plan?
-Shh. B.E.N., quiet.
[Whispering] OK, here it is.
We sneak back to the Legacy, disable the laser cannons... and bring back the map.
[Muffled] That's a good plan. l like that plan.
The only thing is...
I'm wondering, how do we get there?
On that.
MORPH: Ooh.
Oop? [Poink]
-Aah!
-BEN. shh!
Sorry. sorry Sorry
OK, I'll get the map.
You wait here.
Roger, Jimmy. I'll neutralize laser cannons, sir!
B.E.N.! B.E.N.!
Yo-ho. yo-ho. a pirate's life for me
[Humming]
[Sighs]
Disable a few laser cannons.
What is the big deal?
All we gotta do is find that one little wire.
[Gasps] Oh, mama.
[Sighs] Yes.
[Alarm blaring]
Bad, B.E.N. Bad.
OK, fixing.
That stupid robot's gonna get us all...killed.
Cabin boy.
Aah!
[Growling]
[Squealing]
[Powers up]
BEN:
Whoops OK. don't panic
Breathing in breathing out
[Ship creaking]
-Aah!
-Hmm?
[Poink] Raah!
This has gotta be cannons.
[Rumbling]
Maybe not.
Rraar!
[Thud]
[Grunting]
Heh heh.
Come on, come on, come on.
No!
[Snickers] Oh, yes.
Do say hello to Mr. Arrow.
[Gasps] Rraar!
Tell him yourself!
Aah!
Back you go, you naughty plug!
Oh!
Unh! [Gasping]
[Rattling]
[Coughing]
Morph?
[Chirrups]
BEN:
Laser cannons disconnected
Captain Jimmy, sir!
Gee, that wasn't so tough.
Doc! Doc, wake up! l got the map.
Fine work, Jimbo.
Fine work indeed.
[Muffled yelling]
Thanks for showing us the way, boy.
Aah!
[Morph yelping]
What's this sorry stack of metal?!
Not the face!
You're just like me, Jimbo.
Ya hates to lose.
[Chuckles]
What the devil's the...
Open it.
I'd get busy.
[Crew murmuring]
Oh, the powers that be.
Would you look?
Ha ha ha ha!
Tie him up and leave him with the others till we--what?
You want the map... you're taking me, too.
[Grunts]
Hmm.
[Chuckles]
We'll take 'em all.
Unh.
[Chattering]
It's OK, Morph. It's OK.
Jimmy, l--l don't know about you... but I'm starting to see my life pass in front of my eyes.
At least, I think it's my life.
Was I ever dancing with an android named Lupe?!
B.E.N., shh.
This isn't over yet.
SILVER:
We're gettin' close. lads l smell treasure a-waitin'.
[Laughs]
Huh?
SILVER: Where is it? l see nothing! One great, big stinking hunk of nothing!
What's going on, Jimbo? l don't know. l can't get it open.
We should've never followed this boy!
Hey!
SILVER: I'd suggest you get that gizmo going again. and fast!
Let's rip his gizzard right out right now!
Throw him off the cliff!
[Rumbling]
Oh, have mercy.
JIM: The Lagoon Nebula?
But that's halfway across the galaxy.
JIM: A big door opening and closing
Let's see.
Kinapis.
Montressor spaceport.
So that's how Flint did it.
He used this portal to roam the universe stealing treasure.
But where'd he stash it all?
SILVER: Where's that blasted treasure?!
Treasure! Treasure!
It's buried in the--
Buried in the centroid of the mechanism.
What if the whole planet is the mechanism... and the treasure is buried in the center of this planet?
[Shouting]
[Boing]
And how in blue blazes are we supposed to get there?
Just open the right door.
[Alarm beeping]
Wait for me! Wait for me!
[Gasps]
[Cheering]
The loot of a thousand worlds.
CREATURE: We are going to need a bigger boat!
[Laughing]
This is all seeming very familiar.
I can't remember why
B.E.N., come on.
We're getting out of here, and we're not leaving empty-handed.
But--but, Jimmy! Jimmy!
A lifetime of searching.
And at long last... l can touch it.
Do you know what's strange? l can't tell you how frustrating this is, Jimmy...
'cause there's something just-- it's nagging at the back of my mind.
Aah!
-Captain Flint?
-ln the flesh!
Well, s-sort of, except for skin, organs... or anything that--that--that resembles flesh... that's not there.
And yet it's so odd. you know?
I remember there was something horrible
Flint didn't want anyone else to know but h--h just can't remember what it was
Oh, a mind is a terrible thing to lose!
[Sobbing]
B.E.N., l think I just found your mind.
Hold still.
Aah! Jimmy, your hands are very, very cold.
Whoa!
Hello.
You know, uh, Jimmy, l was just thinking... l was just think--
It's all flooding back!
All my memories!
Right up until Flint pulled my memory circuits... so I could never tell anybody about his booby trap!
[Crash]
-Speaking of which...
-Huh?
Flint wanted to make sure... that nobody could ever steal his treasure... so he rigged this whole planet... to blow higher than a Kalepsian kite!
[Jingling]
[Yelling]
Run, Jimmy! Run for your life!
You go back and help the captain and Doc!
If I'm not there in 5 minutes, leave without me. l am not leaving my buddy Jimmy.
Unless he looks at me like that.
Bye, Jim!
No! No! Oh, no! Oh, no!
No! Aah!
-Aah!
-Aah!
[Crew yelling]
Come back here, ya blighters!
[Rumbling]
All my life, I dreamed of an adventure like this.
[Sighs] I'm just sorry... l couldn't have been more helpful to you.
Oh, don't be daft.
You've been very helpful.
Truly. l feel like such a useless weakling... with abnormally thin wrists.
Excuse me, brutish pirate.
[Belches]
Yes, you. I have a question. ls it that your body is too massive... for your teeny-tiny head... or is it that your head is too teeny-tiny... for your big, fat body? l pummel you good!
Yes, I'm sure you will, but before you do... l have one more question. ls this yours?
Uhh...
Yes!
Morph, we are so out of here!
[Cackling]
SILVER: Ah. Jimbo!
Aren't you the seventh wonder of the universe?
Get back! l like you, lad, but I've come too far... to let you stand between me and me treasure.
Aah!
Oh, no, you don't!
[Chattering]
What?
Jimbo.
Reach for me now!
Reach! l--l can't!
Aah! l...
Oh, blast me for a fool!
Aah!
[Groans]
Silver, you gave up?
Just a lifelong obsession, Jim.
I'll get over it.
BEN: Aloha. Jimmy!
Hurry, people!
We got exactly two minutes... and thirty-four seconds till planet's destruction!
You're doing fine, Doctor.
Now ease her over gently--gently!
Aah! We were better off on exploding planet!
Take us out of here, metal man!
Aye, Captain!
Captain, you dropped from the heavens in the nick of--
Save your claptrap for the judge, Silver!
[Chuckles]
Missile tail demobilized,
Captain!
Thrusters at only 30% of capacity.
30% ? That means we're--
We'll never clear the planet's explosion in time.
-We gotta turn around.
-What?
There's a portal back there.
It can get us out of here!
DOPPLER: Pardon me. Jim. but didn't that portal open onto a raging inferno?!
Yes, but I'm gonna change that.
I'm gonna open a different door
Captain, really, I don't see how this is possible--
Listen to the boy!
One minute, twenty-nine seconds till planet's destruction!
-What do you need, Jim?
-Just some way to attach this.
All right. Stand back.
Stand back, now.
There you go.
There you go.
OK. Now, no matter what happens... keep the ship heading straight for that portal.
BEN: Fifty-eight seconds!
Well, you heard him!
Get this blasted heap turned 'round!
Doctor, head us back to the portal.
Aye, Captain.
Go to the right! The right! l know, I know!
Will you just let me drive?!
Twenty-five seconds!
No! No!
Come on, lad.
Seventeen seconds!
BEN: Seven sixfivefour three...two...
Wow! Yeah!
SILVER: You done it. Jimmy!
You done it, boy! Ha ha ha!
Didn't I say the lad had greatness in him?
[Cheering]
Unorthodox, but ludicrously effective.
CAPTAIN AMELIA: I'd be proud to recommend you to the interstellar academy
They could use a man like you
Just wait until your mother hears about this!
Of course, we may downplay the life-threatening parts.
Jimmy, that was unforgettable! l know you don't like touching... but get ready for a hug, big guy, 'cause I gotta hug ya!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey, you hugged me back.
Oh, I promised myself l wouldn't cry.
[Sobbing]
BEN:
Does anyone have a tissue?
[Morph squeaking]
-Morphy, we gotta make tracks.
-l know.
JIM: You never quit. do you ?
Ah, Jimbo! Ha ha! l was merely checking to make sure... our last longboat was safe and secure.
Mmm.
Well... that should hold it.
Heh heh heh. l taught you too well.
If you don't mind, we'd just as soon avoid prison.
Little morphy here, he's a free spirit.
Being in a cage, it'd break his heart.
[Squeaks]
Ohh!
What say you ship out with us, lad?
You and me,
Hawkins and Silver... full of ourselves and no ties to anyone!
You know, when I got on this boat... l would've taken you up on that offer in a second... but, uh, l met this old cyborg... and he taught me that l could chart my own course.
That's what I'm gonna do.
And what do you see of that pal of yours?
A future.
[Chuckles] Why... look at ya, glowing like a solar fire.
You're something special, Jim.
You're gonna rattle the stars, you are.
[Clears throat]
Got a bit of grease in this cyborg eye of mine.
[Sniffles]
[Sobbing]
Oh, hey, Morph.
I'll see ya around, OK?
See ya around.
[Sniffs]
Morphy, I got a job for ya. l need you to keep an eye on this here pup.
Will ya do me that little favor?
Aye-aye, Captain.
Oh, and one more thing.
[Chuckles]
This is for your dear mother... to rebuild that inn of hers.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
Stay out of trouble, ya old scalawag.
[Laughs] Why, Jimbo, lad... when have I ever done otherwise?
[Laughing]
Oh! [Giggling]
[Cheering]
[Yawns]
[All gasp]
[All cheer]
[Playing music]
[Crying]
[Laughing]
[Song starts]
It's good to see the sun and feel this place
This place I never thought would feel like home
And I ran forever
Far away
And I always thought
I'd end up here alone
Somehow the world has changed
And I've come home
To give you back the things they took from you
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know where you are
When I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
And I found something that was always there
Sometimes it's got to hut before you feel
But now I'm strong. and I won't kneel
Except to thank who's watching over me
And somehow h feel so strong
And I've begun to be the one
I never thought I'd be
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
Now it's all so clear
And I believe
That everything's been opened up to me
And I feel you now
I'm not alone
I always know
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
And when I feel the sun
I always know where you are
And when I see myself
I always know where you are
Where you are
She looks at me every day.
Mary Jane Watson.
Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.
But she can never know.
I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.
A life she can never be a part of.
Who am I?
I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.
And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.
Parker. Parker!
No, no, no, stop! Stop!
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.
Come on, 21 minutes ago, in comes order.
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.
I told you,
I don't understand that language.
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.
Then, not only am I receiving no money for these pizzas...
...but I will lose the customer forever to Pizza Yurt.
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.
This is your last chance.
You have to go 42 blocks in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.
Go!
Hey, what, are you stupid?
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!
I'm gonna get it!
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.
See you.
Way to go, Spidey!
Pizza time.
You're late.
I'm not paying for those.
Elevator.
Joe's 29-minute guarantee is a promise, man.
I know to you, Parker, a promise means nothing. But to me, it's serious.
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.
You're fired.
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?
Dogs catching Frisbees?
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?
- Boss.
- Not now.
The Bugle could show another side of New York for a change.
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.
He won't let me take any more pictures.
You turned the whole city against him.
A fact I'm very proud of.
Get your pretty little portfolio off my desk before I go into a diabetic coma.
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.
Please, isn't there any of these shots you can use? I need the money.
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.
All right, Mr. Jameson.
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."
I told you, he's not a menace.
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.
That's outrageous.
Done. Give this to the girl.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Hi.
Hey, Pete.
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.
- Right.
- Sorry.
Hey.
Chin up, okay?
Watch it, jerk!
Dr. Connors. Sorry.
Where were you headed, Parker?
To your class.
My class is over.
See me standing here?
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.
Then be here.
Look at you, Peter.
Your grades have been steadily declining. You're late for class.
You always appear exhausted.
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.
I know. I'm planning to write it on Dr. Otto Octavius.
Planning is not a major at this university.
Octavius is a friend of mine.
Better do your research, Parker.
Get it done, or I'm failing you.
Surprise!
Well, say something.
What's the occasion?
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!
Whether you want to remember it or not.
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.
Long time, no see.
So how's the play?
I read a great review.
It's going fine. It's going good.
She's brilliant in it.
Harry sent me roses.
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.
I've been busy.
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?
The less you see of that man, the better.
Now, let's all go into the other room and have something to eat.
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
So how are things going at Oscorp?
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.
We're about to make a breakthrough on fusion.
How lovely, Harry. Your father would be so proud, rest his soul.
Thank you.
We're actually funding one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?
You'd introduce me?
You bet. Octavius is gonna put Oscorp on the map...
...in a way my father never even dreamed of.
M.J., could you give me a hand?
She's waiting for you, pal.
What do you mean?
The way she looks at you or doesn't look at you.
However you want to look at it.
I don't have time for girls right now.
Why, are you dead?
I've been kind of busy.
Taking pictures of your friend?
Could we get off that subject?
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.
Then be honest with me.
If you knew who he was, would you tell me?
Peter, don't you understand how I feel?
I want this guy dead.
The same way you want the guy who killed your Uncle Ben dead.
I'm sorry. I don't mean to rag on you on your birthday.
You're my buddy, you know that.
You're family, Pete.
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.
Thank you, Harry.
May.
Oh, what, Ben?
Wait.
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.
Everybody's gone, aren't they?
Did they have a good time?
I'm sure they did.
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.
And be careful. I don't like that scooter thing you drive around.
I'm worried about you.
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.
Oh, my. You did?
Oh, well.
So?
I'm a little behind.
Everybody is.
Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'm tired, and you better start back home.
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.
You need it more than I do.
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!
You can take this money from me.
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!
And don't you dare leave it here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just that I miss your uncle Ben so much.
Can you believe that it's two years next month since he was taken?
I think to myself at times...
...were I to face the one responsible for what happened, I'd...
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.
Now...
...you better take the rest of your cake home.
Hey.
Hey. You're still here.
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.
The photographer liked my face.
I was only supposed to be in the catalogue.
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.
Your dream came true.
How about yours?
I'm fine.
I wish you'd come see the play.
You're the one who always encouraged me.
I plan to.
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.
Oh, boy, yeah.
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?
Nothing.
Do you want to say something?
I...
...was...
...wondering if you're still in the Village.
You're such a mystery.
Peter.
What?
Happy birthday.
I'm seeing somebody now.
- Therapy.
- No.
A person, a man.
You mean, like a boyfriend?
Well, like I like him.
What?
Nothing.
That's good, you know?
Companionship...
May be more than that.
More?
I don't know.
I'm coming to see your play tomorrow night.
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.
Don't disappoint me.
I won't.
Rent.
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?
Can I spend it?
I have a paycheck due this week and...
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...
If promises were crackers, my daughter would be fat.
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.
And don't try to sneak past me. I have ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.
Hello?
Rent?
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.
It's not about the prizes, Harry.
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.
Who do we have here?
This is my good friend
I called you about.
He got me through high-school science.
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...
I know what you're doing here...
...but I don't have time to talk to students now.
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!
Interesting fellow, your friend.
I won't take much of your time.
Now I remember you. You're Connors' student. He tells me you're brilliant.
He also tells me you're lazy.
I'm trying to do better.
Being brilliant's not enough, young man. You have to work hard.
Intelligence is not a privilege, it's a gift.
And you use it for the good of mankind.
Otto, your lunch is ready.
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.
I always fell asleep in physics class.
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.
Excuse me.
Is that it?
Yes. My design to initiate and sustain fusion.
I understand you use harmonics of atomic frequencies.
Sympathetic frequencies.
Harmonic reinforcement?
Go on.
An exponential increase in energy output.
A huge amount of energy.
Like a perpetual sun providing renewable power for the whole world.
It's all so amazing. If it works, it could change the way we live.
It is amazing, and it will work.
Are you sure you could stabilize the fusion reaction?
Peter, what have we been talking about for the last hour and a half?
This is my life's work.
I certainly know the consequences of the slightest miscalculation.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to question you.
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.
You can sleep soundly tonight.
Otto's done his homework.
Come to the demonstration tomorrow, and you'll see for yourself.
And you need to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.
Did Edison sleep before he turned on the light?
Did Marconi sleep before he turned on the radio?
Did Beethoven sleep before he wrote the 5th?
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found the curves of quickest descent?
Rosie, I love this boy.
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well...
I don't really know.
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.
Love should never be a secret.
If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside...
...gonna make you sick.
I finally got lucky in love.
We both did.
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.
I met him on the college steps, and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.
He was studying science, and I was studying English literature.
That's right. I was trying to explain the theory of relativity.
And Rosie was trying to explain T.S. Eliot.
Time present and time past
- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present
- In time future
- In time future
I still don't understand what he was talking about.
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.
T.S. Eliot is more complicated than advanced science.
But if you want to get a woman to fall in love with you, feed her poetry.
Poetry.
Never fails.
A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie
Brightest green were all her garments
And her hair was like the sunshine
Day by day he gazed upon her
Rent!
Where is my money?!
You seem jittery tonight.
You never know who's coming.
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.
How'd you do that?
Work out, plenty of rest.
You know, eat your green vegetables.
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.
Come on. Go.
Keep it steady.
It's a web.
Go, Spidey, go!
We got trouble!
Get me down!
I am more than content with what Mr. Moncrieff said.
His voice alone inspires one with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
I mean, no.
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.
Whatever.
Shoelace.
You might want to...
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be seated after the doors are closed.
It helps maintain the illusion.
I understand.
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.
But not to come late.
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...
Listen, can't you...?
A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man
A- does whatever a spider can
A- spins a web, any size
Catches thieves a-just like flies
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man
You sure you don't wanna come tonight?
Yeah, I'm sure.
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.
May I have an autograph, please, miss?
What are you doing here?
You hungry?
Starved.
What was that?
Okay.
How you doing?
Good.
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...
...PR firm in the building...
...and I just wanna say I think the image you have is fantastic.
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.
I think you could do more than print though.
I think you might wanna try some TV, you know?
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?
How about a children's book?
You could...
Like Charlotte's Web, but without the pig. That kind of thing.
How about a line of hammocks?
Because it's kind of a web thing.
You could do a men's cologne called Thwip.
Let me give you a card.
I don't have any pockets.
Yeah.
Well, we're right in the building.
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.
Thus, the second-order term...
...in the expansion of the exact order...
...is identical to the second order...
...calculated from first-order perturbation energy.
Since we are free to choose an arbitrary origin for our energy...
Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.
Hi, M.J.
This is Peter.
I was on my way to your show and...
Well, I was on my bike...
Are you there?
I really was planning on it all day.
And...
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.
Bingo.
It's amazing, isn't it?
How complicated a simple thing...
... like being someplace at 8:00
can become.
Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.
Somebody has to talk to that usher, M.J.
Your time has expired.
Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.
I wanna tell you the truth.
Here it is.
I'm Spider-Man.
Weird, huh?
Now you know why I can't be with you.
If my enemies found out about you...
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.
I wish I could tell you how I feel about you.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...my wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon.
But first, before we start...
...has anybody lost a large roll of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?
Because we found the rubber band.
It's a terrible joke.
But thank you for coming.
Today...
...you will witness the birth of a new fusion-based energy source.
Safe, renewable energy and cheap electricity for everyone.
And now let me introduce my assistants.
These four actuators were developed and programmed...
...for the sole purpose of creating successful fusion.
They are impervious to heat and magnetism.
These smart arms are controlled by my brain through a neural link.
Nanowires feed directly into my cerebellum...
...allowing me to use these arms to control fusion reaction...
...in an environment no human hand could enter.
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence in the arms...
...is as advanced as you suggest...
...couldn't that make you vulnerable to them?
How right you are.
Which is why I developed this inhibitor chip...
...to protect my higher brain function.
It means I maintain control of these arms, instead of them controlling me.
And now on to the main event.
Give me the blue light, Rosie.
Precious tritium is the fuel that makes this project go.
There's only 25 pounds of it on the whole planet.
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.
Ladies and gentlemen...
...fasten your seat belts.
Doctor, we have a successful fusion reaction.
This is a breakthrough beyond your father's dreams.
Thank you.
We're producing a thousand-megawatt surplus.
The power of the sun...
...in the palm of my hand.
Keep calm! It's only a spike!
It'll soon stabilize!
Ladies and gentlemen, please clear the room.
We have a containment breach!
Otto, please get back!
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!
It will stabilize! It's under control!
I'm in charge here!
It's my money! I'm in con...
This doesn't change anything.
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.
No!
Rosie!
Watch it.
That was too close.
If he had more than a drop of tritium, he could have destroyed the city.
I'm ruined.
I have nothing left, except Spider-Man.
He saved your life, sir.
He humiliated me by touching me.
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.
What was he doing here anyway?
Molten metal penetrated the spinal cavity...
...and fused the vertebrae at multiple points...
...including the lamina and the roof of the spinal column.
We won't know the extent of the damage until we get in there.
I suggest we cut off these mechanical arms, slice up the harness...
...and, if need be, consider a laminectomy...
...with posterior spinal fusion from C 7-T1 to T12.
We're ready, doctor.
Anybody here take shop class?
No! No! No!
Help me! Help me!
No!
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.
Crazy scientist turns himself into some kind of a monster.
Four mechanical arms welded right onto his body.
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up with eight limbs. What are the odds?
Hoffman!
What are we gonna call this guy?
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."
- I like it.
- Of course you do.
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?
Get out.
Chief, I found Parker.
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.
Mad scientist goes berserk, we don't have pictures!
I heard Spider-Man was there.
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.
Chief, the planetarium party.
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.
What do you know about high society?
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.
My society photographer got hit in the head by a polo ball. You're all I got.
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.
Could you pay me in advance?
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.
My Rosie's dead.
My dream is dead.
And these...
...monstrous things should be at the bottom of the river...
...along with me.
Something...
...in my head.
Something talking.
The inhibitor chip!
Gone.
Rebuild.
No.
Peter was right.
I miscalculated.
I couldn't have miscalculated.
It was working, wasn't it?
Yes.
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.
Make it bigger and stronger than ever.
But we need money.
Steal it?
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.
That's right.
The real crime would be not to finish what we started.
We'll do it here.
The power of the sun in the palm of my hand.
Nothing will stand in our way.
Nothing!
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.
My uncle Ben's life insurance.
Yes, but I'm afraid...
...it's just not sufficient to refinance your home.
Oh, but I'm giving piano lessons again.
You are?
We appreciate that you've just opened up...
...a new supersaver account with us today.
But the fact is...
...you do not have the assets to justify this loan. I'm sorry.
Well...
At least we get the toaster.
Actually, that's only with a deposit of 300 or more.
Oh, yes, I see.
Okay.
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.
Peter?
Don't leave me.
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.
Hold it!
Put your arms up! All of them!
Here's your change!
Oh, no. Come on!
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.
Not anymore.
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.
Wait a second.
- Hand her over.
- Of course.
Easy, now.
Butterfingers.
Look out!
Help me!
- Help me!
- I'm coming!
Hang on!
Help!
Thank you.
Aunt May.
You've stuck your webs in my business for the last time.
Now you'll have this woman's death on your conscience.
Come on.
Shame on you.
There you go.
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.
We sure showed him.
What do you mean, "we"?
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.
Penny! Over here!
Leave it.
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.
Why? It's a party.
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost a bundle on some crackpot...
...who you thought was gonna take you with him to fame and fortune?
Not to mention your friend the bug.
Not tonight, Harry.
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.
Parker!
Parker!
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.
Think I'm paying you to sip champagne?
Get a shot of my wife with the minister.
Beautiful tie.
Get a shot of us with the DA.
Beautiful dress.
Here, get a shot of the mayor and his girlfriend.
Wife.
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
The committee for the Science Library of New York...
...is pleased to present our guest of honor.
He's the first man to play football on the moon.
The handsome, the heroic, the delicious...
...Captain John Jameson.
Hi.
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.
But there was a disturbance.
I don't know you.
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.
I've been reading poetry lately.
Whatever that means.
Day by day he gazed upon her
Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day...
Don't start.
Can I get you a drink?
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.
John.
By the way, John has seen my show five times.
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.
Even my father.
He came backstage to borrow cash.
But my best friend, who cares so much about me...
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.
After all these years...
...he's nothing to me but an empty seat.
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.
I find him with my father's body, and you defend him.
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.
Don't act like you're my friend.
You stole M.J. From me.
You stole my father's love.
Then you let him die because you didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?
Huh? Isn't that right?
Huh, brother?
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.
What a surprise.
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!
Oh, no. No!
Why is this happening to me?
You told him yes? Just that fast?
It felt right.
Well, you might congratulate me.
Congratulations.
Good luck in the world.
John loves me.
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.
No man will ever want you."
So, what, you're gonna spend the rest of your life...
...trying to prove something to your father?
Do you really love this guy?
- Very much.
- "Very much"?
That just doesn't fly.
I mean, if you really love the guy, then the answer is:
"Do I love him? I adore him.
He's my comfortable afghan.
He's all I can think about.
Everything he is, everything he says, everything he does...
...to me, for me, with me, is sweet kisses.
He makes up for all the grief and pain I've ever had...
...and in the dark of the night, he is there."
That's the answer I need.
Not just "I love him very much."
You read too many love stories.
What about that perfect kiss you said you had once?
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.
That's all he is.
But what's wrong with believing in love stories?
You seem very okay to me.
My diagnosis?
It's up here.
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?
There is one dream where...
...in my dream...
...l'm Spider-Man.
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.
So you're Spider-Man.
In my dream.
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.
So it's somebody else's dream.
- What's your major? Theater Arts?
- Science.
Connors?
He flunking you?
He says he might.
There you go.
What about this friend?
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.
Gotta make you mad not to know who you are. Your soul disappears.
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.
I've been there. Who was I?
Identity. Big one.
Me, I go to my shrink.
What does he tell you?
She tells me I need some strong focus on what I want.
And I have to find out who won't let me have it, why...
...and then I have to tackle that guy, let him hear me...
And one more thing. I have to make sure I'm right about what I want.
Listen...
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.
That's why you keep falling.
You always have a choice, Peter.
I have a choice.
All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...
... make me sad.
Can't you understand?
I'm in love with Mary Jane.
You know I understand.
But I thought you'd learned the meaning of responsibility.
Oh, you don't know how it feels.
Peter, all the times we've talked of honesty...
...fairness, justice...
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...
...to take those dreams out into the world.
I can't live your dreams anymore.
I want a life of my own.
You've been given a gift, Peter.
With great power comes great responsibility.
Take my hand, son.
No, Uncle Ben.
I'm just Peter Parker.
I'm Spider-Man...
...no more.
No more.
No more.
- You punk!
- Sorry.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hurry up!
And when the borderline is tau equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?
Someone, please?
.23 electron volts.
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.
If you are not, then you have certainly been deceiving us all...
...in a very inexcusable manner.
I hope you have not been leading a double life...
...pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time.
That would be hypocrisy.
Of course, I have been rather reckless.
"I am glad."
"I am glad."
"I am glad."
Are you glad to hear it?
I am glad...
...to hear it.
In fact, now you mention the subject...
...I have been very bad in my own small way.
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.
You could've told me you were coming.
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."
You look different.
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants, did my homework.
I do my homework now.
You wanna get some chow mein?
Peter...
...l'm getting married.
I always imagined you getting married on a hilltop.
And who's the groom?
You hadn't decided yet.
You think just because you saw my play...
...you can talk me out of getting married?
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.
You're too late.
Will you think about it?
Think about what?
Picking up where we left off.
Where was that?
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.
I don't think it's that simple.
Of course you don't, because you complicate things.
You don't understand.
I'm not an empty seat anymore.
I'm different.
Punch me, I bleed.
I have to go.
I'm getting married in a church.
You are different.
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding, not go into bankruptcy.
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?
Get some cheese and crackers, some of those little cocktail weenies.
I got a garbage man here says he's got something you might want to see.
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in there, you're the third guy this week.
Where the hell did you get that?
In the garbage.
In the garbage?
He must've given up.
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.
All right, 100. Give this man his money and throw in a bar of soap.
Your wife is still on that line.
Flowers? How much?
You spend any more on this thing, you can pick the daisies off my grave.
Get plastic.
Gotta go, big story.
Spider-Man
Spider-Man
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?
Come on, man. Get the money.
Come on, come on.
Help!
Come on!
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.
He was a peaceful man.
And it was all my doing.
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.
Oh, I know I shouldn't.
It's just that you wanted to take the subway...
...and he wanted to drive you.
If only I had stopped him.
We'd all three of us be having tea together.
I'm responsible.
For what?
For what happened to Uncle Ben.
But you were at the library.
You were doing your homework.
He drove me to the library, but I never went in.
What do you mean?
I went someplace else.
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...
...to buy a car, because I wanted...
...to impress Mary Jane.
It happened so fast.
I won the money, and the guy wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.
The thief...
...was running towards me.
I could've stopped him, but I wanted...
...revenge.
I let him go.
I let him get away.
He wanted a car.
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.
Uncle Ben said no...
...and then he shot him.
Uncle Ben was killed that night...
...for being the only one who did the right thing.
And I...
I held his hand...
...when he died.
I've tried to tell you so many times.
Just one more little chore.
Where are you?
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.
Your father only obsessed over his work.
Good night, Bernard.
Hello, Harry.
Otto. What do you want?
That precious tritium.
But I need more of it this time.
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!
Hey! Hey!
Stop! Stop! All right!
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.
On second thought, bring him to me alive.
How do I find him?
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?
He takes pictures of Spider-Man for the Bugle.
Make him tell you where he is.
Have it ready.
Don't hurt Peter!
Somebody, help!
Fire!
Alisa, the Chens can't find their daughter. Have you seen her?
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?
We think there's a kid stuck on the second floor.
Hey, where you going?!
I'm coming!
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Come on. Come on.
Mama.
You got some guts, kid.
Some poor soul got trapped on the fourth floor. Never made it out.
Oh, man.
All right, Billy, let's knock it down and roll them up. Get on out of here.
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this equipment, let's go! Let's move it!
Am I not supposed to have what I want?
What I need?
What am I supposed to do?
I shouldn't have without...
...knocking.
Come in.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Would you like a piece of chocolate cake?
Okay.
And a glass of milk?
That would be nice.
Okay.
Thank you.
You got a message.
It's your aunt.
Thanks.
What's going on?
Oh, they gave me another few weeks, but I decided the hell with it.
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm quite able to take care of things myself.
And Henry Jackson across the street is giving me a hand...
...and I'm giving him $5.
That's Henry Jackson?
Yes. It's funny what happens in two years.
Nine years old, has great ambitions.
Listen, about my last visit...
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.
It's water over the dam or under the bridge or wherever you like it.
But you made a brave move in telling me the truth.
And I'm proud of you.
And I thank you, and I...
I love you, Peter.
So very, very much.
Hey. Where are all my comic books?
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.
You're getting tall.
Henry, why don't you put those cookbooks in with the mixer.
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?
I used to.
Where is he?
Henry and I agree. We don't see his picture in the paper anymore.
He...
...quit.
- Why?
Wanted to try other things.
He'll be back, right?
I don't know.
You'll never guess who he wants to be.
Spider-Man.
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.
Too few characters out there, flying around like that...
...saving old girls like me.
And Lord knows, kids like Henry need a hero.
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...
...setting examples for all of us.
Everybody loves a hero.
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.
And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours...
...just to get a glimpse of the one...
...who taught them to hold on a second longer.
I believe there's a hero in all of us...
...that keeps us honest...
...gives us strength...
...makes us noble...
...and finally allows us to die with pride.
Even though sometimes we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing we want the most.
Even our dreams.
Spider-Man did that for Henry...
...and he wonders where he's gone.
He needs him.
Do you think you could lift that desk and put it into the garage for me?
But don't strain yourself.
Okay.
Strong focus on what I want.
I'm back!
I'm back!
My back.
My back.
Honey, you sure you don't want to invite your friend, the photographer?
Peter Parker?
Positive.
Thought he was your pal.
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.
He's just a great big jerk.
The world's full of great big jerks.
You're adorable.
It's just the uniform.
Lean your head back for me.
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.
Just put my head back?
Okay.
Wow.
I'm back on the moon.
You up there with me?
- Hiya.
- Surprised?
Very.
Thanks for coming.
Everything okay?
You might say so.
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.
You know how our minds play tricks on us.
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.
Some part of me heard what you had to say after the show that night...
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.
I was afraid to trust you.
But I've been thinking about it...
Listen, there's more for me to say.
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?
I'm saying...
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...
...but I can't.
My mind was playing tricks too.
Do you love me, or not?
I...
...don't.
You don't.
Kiss me.
Kiss you?
I need to know something.
Just one kiss.
What's happening?
Peter Parker...
...and the girlfriend.
What do you want?
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.
Tell him to meet me at the Westside Tower at 3:00.
I don't know where he is.
Find him.
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.
If you lay one finger on her...
You'll do what?
Still no word on the whereabouts of your son's fiancée.
Sorry, Jonah.
It's all my fault.
I drove Spider-Man away.
He was the only one who could've stopped Octavius.
Yes.
Spider-Man was a hero.
I just couldn't see it.
He was a...
A thief! A criminal!
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!
I want that wall-crawling arachnid prosecuted!
I want him strung up by his web!
I want Spider-Man!
Where is she?
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.
What the hell?
You have a train to catch.
Help!
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!
Tell everyone to hang on!
Brace yourselves!
Any more bright ideas?
I got a few, yeah!
Whoa, watch out!
We're slowing down.
Nice and easy, we'll go down.
Slower. Gently.
Is he alive?
He's...
...just a kid.
No older than my son.
It's all right.
We found something.
We won't tell nobody.
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.
He's mine!
You want to get to him, you got to go through me.
And me.
Me too.
Very well.
Where do you want him?
And the tritium?
Yes.
If only I could cause you the pain that you've caused me.
First we'll see who's behind the mask.
I can look into your eyes as you die.
Pete.
No.
It can't be.
Harry.
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.
Tritium?
He's making the machine again.
When that happens, she'll die, along with half of New York.
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...
...you killed my father.
There are bigger things happening here than me and you.
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.
Hey!
Hey!
I'm talking to you!
You got what you needed for your little science project, now let me go.
I can't let you go, you'd bring the police.
Not that anybody could stop me now that Spider-Man's dead.
He's not dead.
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.
Surprise.
As soon as you get free...
I should have known Osborn wouldn't have the spine to finish you!
Shut it down, Ock. You're going to hurt a lot more people this time.
Well, that's a risk we're willing to take.
Well, I'm not.
Hang on, Mary Jane!
Run!
Let's see you scurry out of this.
Now what?
Dr. Octavius.
We have to shut it down.
Please tell me how.
Peter Parker?
"Brilliant but lazy."
Look at what's happening.
We must destroy it.
I can't destroy it.
I won't.
You once spoke to me about intelligence.
That it was a gift to be used for the good of mankind.
A privilege.
These things have turned you into something you're not.
Don't listen to them.
It was my dream.
Sometimes, to do what's right, we have to be steady...
...and give up the thing we want the most.
Even our dreams.
You're right.
He's right.
Listen.
Listen to me now.
Listen to me now.
Now, tell me how to stop it.
It can't be stopped.
It's self-sustaining now.
- Think!
- Unless...
The river.
Drown it.
I'll do it.
No!
Hi.
Hi.
This is really heavy.
M.J.
In case we die...
You do love me.
I do.
Even though you said you didn't.
I will not die a monster.
I think I always knew...
...all this time...
...who you really were.
Then you know why we can't be together.
Spider-Man will always have enemies.
I can't let you take that risk.
I will...
...always be Spider-Man.
You and I can never be.
Mary Jane!
Hello?
Who's that?
Son.
I'm here.
Dad?
- I thought you were...
- No.
I'm alive in you, Harry.
Now it's your turn.
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.
Now make him pay.
But Pete's my best friend.
And I'm your father.
You're weak.
You were always weak. You'll always be weak until you take control.
Now you know the truth about Peter.
Be strong, Harry.
Avenge me.
- Avenge me!
- No!
Call Deborah.
The caterer?
Tell her not to open the caviar.
Had to do what I had to do.
Mary Jane.
Peter.
I can't survive without you.
You shouldn't be here.
I know you think we can't be together.
But can't you respect me enough to let me make my own decision?
I know there'll be risks.
But I want to face them with you.
It's wrong that we should only be half-alive...
...half of ourselves.
I love you.
So here I am, standing in your doorway.
I've always been standing in your doorway.
Isn't it about time somebody saved your life?
Well, say something.
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.
Go get them, tiger.

Good luck, Chihiro
Hope we meet again
Chihiro? Chihiro!
We're almost there.
This really is the middle of nowhere.
I'll have to shop in the next town.
We'll just have to make do.
Look, there's the elementary school.
That's your new school, Chihiro.
Why, it looks very nice.
I liked my old school.
Mom, my flowers got bent.
No wonder, the way you squeeze them.
A little water and they'll perk right up.
My first bouquet, and it's farewell flowers.
What about the rose you got for your birthday?
One rose? One rose isn't a bouquet.
You dropped the card.
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.
SPIRITED AWAY
Wait a minute. Did I take a wrong turn?
I don't get it.
That must be it up there.
The blue one on the end.
That's it.
I guess I turned off too soon.
Maybe if we go straight?
Oh, please. That's how we always get lost.
Let's just see what's up here.
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.
Dad, are you sure?
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.
Sit down, Chihiro.
What are you doing? Slow down!
There's a tunnel.
What's this building?
It looks like a gate.
Honey, I think we should go back.
Chihiro!
Honestly...
Look at this, it's just plaster.
This thing's pretty new.
The air's blowing in.
What is it?
Let's see what's on the other side.
It's creepy, Dad. Can't we go back?
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.
The movers will be there soon.
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.
I know, but...
No! I won't go.
Dad, let's go.
Come on, it'll be fun.
I'm staying here!
Chihiro, you wait in the car.
Mom...
Wait up!
Watch your step.
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.
Let's find out. It must be close.
Houses, way out here?
I knew it.
It's an abandoned theme park.
They built lots of them back in the nineties.
But they went bust when the economy tanked.
This must be one of them.
Wait, where are we going?
Let's go back, Dad.
Please!
Mom, that building's moaning.
It's just the wind.
What a lovely spot. We should've brought the sandwiches.
This would've been a river.
Do you smell something?
- Something smells good.
- You're right.
Maybe they're open for business after all.
Hurry up, Chihiro.
Wait for me!
This way.
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.
There's nobody here.
Over there.
Come on!
Come take a look.
This is amazing.
Hello, is anybody here?
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.
You got customers!
Don't worry. We'll pay when they show up.
You're right. Let's see now...
What kind of bird is this?
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.
I don't want any.
Can't we go? They'll be mad at us.
Don't worry, your father's here.
I've got credit cards and cash.
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.
- Mustard.
- Thanks.
Mom! Dad!
What a weird building.
A train!
You can't be here. Go now!
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!
They're lighting the lamps. Come on!
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!
What's his problem?
Dad?
Dad, let's go home.
Let's go, Dad!
Dad!
Mom!
Mommy!
Water!
No...
It's just a dream.
Wake up, wake up. Wake up!
Please wake up.
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.
Go away, disappear.
Disappear.
I'm fading away!
This has to be a dream.
Don't be afraid. I'm a friend.
No, no, no!
Open your mouth. Eat this.
Unless you eat something from this world, you'll disappear.
No!
Don't worry. You won't turn into a pig.
Chew it and swallow.
Good, now you'll be fine.
See for yourself.
I can touch you.
Of course. Now come.
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?
You can't see them now, but you will.
Quiet!
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.
I can't stand up. What should I do?
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.
In the name of the wind and water within, unbind her.
Stand up!
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.
I'm scared.
Be calm.
Welcome, your presence honors us.
Greetings, welcome.
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.
Welcome back. We've been waiting for you.
Just a little further.
Master Haku!
Where have you...
A human?
Run!
Master Haku, Master Haku!
I smell something.
A human intruder!
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.
No, Chihiro, you did very well.
Now listen. I'll tell you what to do.
If you stay here, they'll find you.
I'll distract them while you get away.
No, don't go! Stay with me, please.
You have no choice, if you want to survive here... and save your parents, too.
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.
Listen carefully.
After I'm gone, go through the back gate.
Take the stairs all the way down.
You'll find the boiler room where... they stoke the fires.
Look for Kamaji.
Kamaji?
Ask him for work.
If he refuses, keep asking.
If you don't work, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.
Yubaba?
She's the sorceress who rules our world.
She'll try to trick you into leaving... but keep asking for work.
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.
Master Haku, Master Haku!
I have to go.
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?
You told me long ago.
My name is Haku.
Here I am!
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.
I know, I've been searching too.
Um...
Excuse me.
Um...
Are you Kamaji?
Haku sent me. Please let me work here.
What, all at once?
Get to work, you little runts!
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers that heat the baths.
Step on it, boys!
Please let me work here.
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.
I'll never run out of help.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Wait a second.
Out of the way.
Wait, what do I do with this?
Do I leave it here?
Finish what you start.
Get to work, runts! Wanna turn back into soot?
And you, better watch it. You can't just take someone's work.
If they don't work, their spell will be broken.
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.
You sootballs got a problem?
Get to work!
Chow time!
What, you guys at it again?
Give it a rest. Where's your bowl?
I keep telling you to leave it out.
Food's here. Break time!
The human! You're gonna catch it.
They're having a fit about it upstairs.
She's my granddaughter.
Your granddaughter!
She says she wants work, but I don't need any help.
Could you take her to Yubaba for me?
This girl can handle herself.
Not a chance. Yubaba would kill me.
Not even for this? Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.
If you want work, you have to sign a contract with Yubaba.
Might as well try your luck.
Fine! You there, follow me.
What about "Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?
Yes, ma'am.
What a klutz. Move it!
Yes, ma'am.
Leave the shoes. And the socks!
Yes'm.
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.
Thank you very much.
Good luck.
Yubaba lives on the top floor in the back.
Move it, will you?
You'll lose your nose.
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.
We're here.
Welcome, sir!
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.
Here we are.
Your room is on the right.
- Lin?
- Yes, sir!
Something smells.
It's human. You reek of human.
Is that so?
I smell it, I do. Smells mighty tasty, too.
You're hiding something.
Tell me the truth.
Maybe it's this.
Roasted newt? Give it here!
Not a chance. The girls asked me to get it.
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.
Pull the lever to go up, sir.
Can't you even knock?
What a plain little girl.
Now, come.
I said, come!
Ow...
What a racket. Could you be quiet?
Please...
Let me work here.
Stop your babbling.
Why do I need a weakling like you?
Besides, this is no place for humans.
Millions of spirits come here... to purge themselves of toil and care.
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.
Gobbling our guests' food like a couple of pigs.
Just deserts, I'd say.
And as for you, you'll never see your world again either.
You'd make a lovely piglet.
Or perhaps a lump of coal?
Trembling, aren't you?
Still, I'm impressed you made it this far.
Someone must've helped you.
I must thank your friend.
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.
Please let me work here!
Not that again!
I want to work here!
Shut your mouth!
Why on earth should I hire you?
Anyone can see you're a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.
What job would I possibly have for someone like you?
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.
Or maybe I'll give you the nastiest job I've got... and work you night and day... until you breathe your very last breath!
Now, now. What's wrong, my dear?
I'm coming. That's a good baby.
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.
I want to work here!
Keep your voice down.
I'll be right there, just be patient.
That's a good baby. There, there.
Please give me a job!
All right, just pipe down.
There, there, good baby.
That's your contract.
Sign on the bottom line.
I'll put you to work.
But one peep out of you about anything... and I'll turn you into a piglet.
Should I sign here?
Where else? Quit dilly-dallying.
Unbelievable.
What a ridiculous oath I took.
I'm bound to give work to whoever asks.
- Finished?
- Yes.
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.
Quite a fancy name.
From now on, your name is Sen.
Understand? Sen.
Answer me, Sen!
I understand.
Yes ma'am?
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.
What is your name?
Chi... I mean, Sen.
Then follow me, Sen.
Haku, I...
No idle chatter.
Call me Master Haku.
I'm afraid even Yubaba can't give an order like that.
Humans aren't allowed here.
She signed the contract.
- What!
- I'll work hard.
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.
She won't stink after three days of our food.
If she doesn't measure up, do with her as you will.
Now go back to work. Where's Lin?
What, you're dumping her on me?
You wanted an assistant.
That's right! Lin's just perfect.
Go, Sen.
Yes sir.
What a pain. You're gonna pay for this.
Off you go.
Come on.
You pulled it off!
You're so thick, I was worried.
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.
What's wrong?
My legs are shaking.
This is where we live.
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.
Your apron. Keep it clean.
Trousers.
You're so puny.
Too big.
Lin, are there...
What?
Are there two Hakus here?
Two of that one? I sure hope not.
Still too big.
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.
Now where was that...
All right, here we go.
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.
What's all the noise, Lin?
New girl. Says she feels faint.
Meet me at the bridge. I'll take you to your mother and father.
My shoes are gone.
Thank you.
Follow me.
Dad, Mom, it's me!
It's Sen.
Mom! Dad!
Are they sick? Are they hurt?
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.
They don't remember they were ever human.
Listen to me! I promise
I'll save you.
Don't get too fat or they'll eat you.
Hide these.
I thought they were gone.
For when you go home.
This was a farewell card.
Chihiro?
Chihiro... That's my name!
Yubaba controls us by stealing our names.
You're Sen here. Keep your real name a secret.
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.
Without your real name, you'll never find your way home.
I no longer remember mine.
Your real name?
But it's strange, I remember yours.
Better eat, you must be hungry.
I don't want to.
I put a spell on them to give you back your strength.
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.
You know the way back.
Thanks Haku. I promise to work hard.
Where were you? I was worried.
Sorry.
Out of the way.
Come on, give it some elbow grease.
Starting today, you two are on the big tub.
What? That's Frog work!
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.
Aren't you getting wet?
Sen, come on!
Coming!
I'll leave this open.
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.
Just look at this. Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.
The big tub is reserved for our filthiest guests.
It's caked with sludge.
Lin! Sen! First customers are coming.
All right already!
Man, this is pure harassment.
Go get a tag from the foreman.
A tag?
For an herbal bath.
Right.
Lin, what's a foreman?
Something's coming. I wonder... ls some good-for-nothing using the rain to sneak in?
Absolutely not, it's too valuable to waste.
Good morning!
Feeling refreshed?
For Kasuga.
One deluxe sulfur bath.
No point standing there.
Back to work.
Scrub it with your hands.
Good morning!
Your bare hands.
But she said it has to be an herbal bath.
You just don't get it.
Mugwort, right?
Relax and enjoy.
Foreman. Yes ma'am!
Thank you!
But that's not...
Hey you, wait!
What's the trouble?
Oh, nothing at all.
We have an intruder.
A human?
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.
Wow, you got a really good one.
This goes straight to Kamaji.
Water should be right up.
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.
You're really are a klutz.
Look at that color.
This one has dried worm salts.
With water this murky, who's gonna see the sludge?
Yank it again when it's full. It'll stop.
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.
Okay.
Ouch!
Um... The bath's not ready yet.
So many...
They're for me?
But I don't need them.
No, you gave me one already.
Madam!
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.
It's headed straight for the bridge!
Please turn back.
Please go! The baths are closed for the night.
Please withdraw, please!
Stinky!
That's odd. Stink
Spirits feel different.
Well, now that it's here, better go greet it!
All we can do is get rid of it fast.
Everyone, please return to your rooms!
Please hurry. Terribly sorry!
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.
Yes sir!
Pay attention, this is your debut.
Show the customer to the big tub.
Remember, one peep out of you and you're coal.
- Got it?
- It has arrived.
No, that's not polite!
Welgum to our bazz.
Oh... Money...!
Hurry Sen, take it!
Yez ma'am.
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!
Diz way...
Sen!
Horrible!
Breakfast!
Open the windows, all of 'em!
What? Just a minute.
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.
What will she do?
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls with her dirty hands!
Did you give Sen new tags?
Never, what a waste!
All that precious herbal essence!
Sen! Sen, where are you?
- Lin!
- Are yo u okay?
I asked Kamaji to help us out.
He's sending his best herbal essence.
Thanks. There's a thorn or something stuck in him.
A thorn?
I can't pull it out.
A thorn? Hmm...
Get everyone downstairs!
Hurry!
Sen and Lin!
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.
Use this rope.
Yes ma'am!
Tie it good and tight!
Hurry up! Girls, lend a hand!
It's tied!
Everyone ready? All together now!
Heave!
And heave!
Heave!
Heave!
A bicycle?
I knew it. Now, heave!
Heave!
Sen, are you all right?
Well done.
Gold! It's gold!
Hands off! That's company property.
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.
Open the main gates! He's leaving!
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.
That was the guardian of a great river.
Everyone, learn from Sen!
Sake on the house tonight.
Now hand over all that gold you picked up.
Want some? I swiped them.
Thanks.
What a day.
Haku missed the whole thing.
Not Haku again!
Sometimes he just disappears.
They say Yubaba makes him do bad stuff.
Really?
Lights out, Lin.
Okay.
There's a town. And the water's like an ocean.
What did you expect after all that rain?
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.
What's wrong?
Gold!
Who are you? You're no customer.
You're not allowed in there.
Hey, it's gold! For me?
You can make gold?
Gimme!
Who's down here?
It's way past lights out.
Hey boss, I'm hungry.
Starved, in fact.
That voice...
There, I'll pay you now.
I'm a customer. I want a bath.
Wake everyone up!
Mom and Dad, the river guardian gave me this medicine.
If you take it, you'll be people again.
Dad, Mom, where are you?
Daddy!
What an awful dream.
Lin?
Where is everybody?
Wow, it really did turn into an ocean!
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.
Kamaji lit the fires already.
Did I sleep that long?
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?
Serve everything you've got, even leftovers!
Sen!
Lin?
I was just coming to wake you up, look!
Gold! He gave me real gold.
We've got a real high roller.
Please, sir, try this!
Throw us some gold!
I'm starving, bring it all!
Who's this guest?
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.
I'm going to see Kamaji.
I wouldn't go there now.
He's angry because they woke him up.
Lin, let's go back for more.
What if I can't recognize my parents?
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.
That's the dragon I saw.
It's coming this way.
Those aren't birds!
Haku, don't give up. Over here!
Haku!
It's just paper.
Haku? It is you, isn't it?
Are you hurt? Those paper birds are gone.
You're safe now.
He's going to Yubaba.
What should I do? He'll die!
Now the richest man in the whole wide world... has come to grace us with his presence.
Greetings!
Now let us appeal to his generosity.
Please, sir! Over here.
I hope I get some.
They say gold springs from his palms.
Toss some this way, sir!
What are you doing?
Going upstairs.
No you don't. What's this?
Blood!
Out of the way, we have a guest.
Thank you for your help.
Get out of the way!
I don't need it.
I'm busy, please excuse me.
Quiet! Quiet down.
Back, get back!
Please excuse her manners.
The girl is new and a human.
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.
Why, I would never...
He ate them!
Yubaba!
We're in a fine mess now.
He's a No Face.
That's right, a No Face!
Your greed attracted quite a guest.
Don't do anything stupid until I get down there.
Just look at this carpet.
Get Haku out of here.
He's useless to me now.
Bo, sleeping outside your crib again?
Oh I'm sorry, you were sleeping like such a good baby.
Baba still has work to do.
Go back to sleep now, that's a good baby.
Ouch, let me go!
Oh, thanks for helping me.
But I'm in a hurry, please let me go.
You came to make me sick.
The outside has bad germs.
I'm a human. Maybe you never saw one before.
You'll get sick out there.
Stay here and play with me.
Are you sick?
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.
Staying inside will make you sick!
You see, someone I really care about is badly hurt.
I've got to go right now.
Please let me go.
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.
I'll break your little arm.
You're hurting me!
Please, I'll come play with you later.
No, I wanna play now!
Blood! See? It's blood!
Haku!
Go away!
It's you, isn't it?
Hang on!
Be quiet!
Haku!
Go away!
No!
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.
Please be a good boy and wait.
If you don't play with me I'll cry...
Please, wait!
What a racket. Simmer down.
You're a little butterball, aren't you?
I am a bit transparent here.
Baba...
Oh dear, can't you even tell me from your own mother?
There, that gives you a little more freedom.
Let's see now. What shall we turn you into?
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...
I'll do the same to you.
Who are you?
Yubaba's older twin sister.
Thanks to you I've had a nice tour of the place.
Now hand over the dragon.
What are you going to do?
He needs help.
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.
He stole a valuable seal from my house.
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid... and eager to learn my sister's magical ways.
This boy will do anything that greedy woman wants.
Now step aside.
It's too late for him anyway.
The thing he stole had a protection spell.
Now the thief will die.
No, don't!
What are you up to now?
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.
Oh dear, that was careless...
Haku, no!
Haku!
What is this?
Hold on there!
Haku!
Does it hurt?
This is serious.
Haku, don't give up.
What can we do? He'll die!
Something inside him is eating him up.
Inside him?
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.
Eat it, maybe it will help.
Haku, open your mouth.
Please Haku, eat it.
See, it's safe.
Is it some kind of medicine?
Open your mouth. You can do it.
That's it.
Swallow it.
He spit something out. That's it!
The seal!
It's getting away.
There! Over there!
Sen, we have to purge the spell.
Begone!
Haku took this from
Yubaba's sister.
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.
Precious loot, I'd say.
I knew it was Haku.
Kamaji, it's Haku!
Haku!
Haku, Haku!
Kamaji, he's not breathing.
He is, but he's still very ill from the spell.
That should calm him some.
Haku turned up one day, just like you.
He said he wanted to learn magic.
I tried to warn him.
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice is dangerous business.
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying... that he'd lost his home.
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.
He got paler and paler as time went by... and got a sharp gleam in his eye.
Kamaji, I'm going to give this back to Zeniba.
Give it back, apologize, and ask her to help Haku.
Tell me how to get there.
To Zeniba's house?
That's one scary sorceress.
Please.
Haku helped me. Now
I want to help him.
Well, getting there is one thing.
Getting back's the problem.
Wait a minute.
Let's see now, they're here somewhere...
Everyone, I need my shoes and clothes.
Sen! I've been hunting for you everywhere!
Lin...
Haku? What happened here?
Who are those guys?
My new friends.
Right?
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.
That big tipper turned out to be a No Face.
Yubaba says you let him in.
She might be right.
What, are you serious?
I thought he was a customer.
He's already swallowed three of our people!
Found them. Here they are, Sen.
We're busy, gramps.
You can use these.
Train tickets? Where'd you get those?
Leftovers from 40 years ago.
You get off at the sixth stop, called Swamp Bottom.
Swamp Bottom?
That's right, the sixth stop.
Six.
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train... but these days it's one way only.
Still want to go?
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.
What about Yubaba?
I'll talk to her now.
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.
What's going on here?
Don't you understand? It's love.
It just keeps getting bigger!
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.
Thank goodness, Sen!
Yubaba can't control him.
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.
Where's Sen? I want Sen!
Now hurry!
Yubaba, it's Sen.
Where were you?
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!
Win him over and take all his gold.
What's this filthy rat?
Don't you recognize him?
Of course not. How disgusting.
Now in you go.
Have a nice time.
Will she be all right?
Want to take her place?
Try this, it's yummy.
Want some gold? I've decided it's just for you.
Come over here.
What do you want? You can tell me.
Where did you come from?
There's someplace I have to go right away.
You should go home.
You can't give me what I want.
Where's your home? You must have a mom and dad.
No... No...
I'm lonely... So lonely...
Are you lost?
Sen... I want Sen.
Take the gold.
Would you eat me?
Take it.
Take it!
Before you eat me, eat this first.
I was saving it for my parents, but you can have it.
Sen!
You little wench!
What did you feed me?
Watch out!
Not in my house!
I'm over here!
Here!
You'll pay for this!
Sen, down here!
Over here!
We don't need him.
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.
But where do we take him?
I don't know.
Don't know?
Great, now he's following us.
- From here you walk.
- Okay.
You'll find the station.
Thanks.
Be sure to come back!
I will.
Sen! I said you were a klutz.
I take it back!
No Face, hurt her and you'll get it from me!
There it is.
The train's coming, let's hurry.
To Swamp Bottom, please.
You want to come too?
One more, please.
Sit down.
Behave yourself, okay?
Kamaji.
Oh, Haku. You're awake.
Kamaji, where's Sen?
What happened? Please tell me.
Don't you remember anything?
Just fragments.
Chihiro kept calling my name in the darkness.
I followed her voice and woke up here.
Chihiro? So her name is Chihiro.
Wonderful...
It's the power of love.
This gold will hardly cover the damage.
That fool, Sen! She just cost me a fortune.
But we were saved, thanks to her.
Silence!
She started the whole thing.
Now she's run away.
Abandoned her own parents!
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.
No, wait.
Master Haku!
What, you're still alive?
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.
You've gotten pretty fresh.
Since when do you talk that way?
Bo?
Bo!
Pebbles!
Bo!
Where are you, Bo?
Please come out.
Bo!
Bo?
Why, you little...
Out with it!
Where did you hide my Bo?
He's with Zeniba.
Zeniba?
Now I understand. That evil witch.
She thinks she's beaten me.
So, what's your plan?
I'll bring him back.
But you must send Sen and her parents back to their world.
And what about you?
Maybe I'll send them back and then tear you to pieces.
I think this is right.
Come on.
You can ride on my shoulder.
Come in.
Thank you.
Well, hurry up then.
Come on.
So you all made it.
- I...
- Have a seat.
I'll make some tea.
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.
Do you know what this is?
No, but I know it's very precious.
I'm here to apologize for him. He's sorry.
You held this and nothing happened to you?
What?
Wait, the protection spell is gone.
I'm sorry. There was this strange bug.
I squashed it.
Squashed it!
My sister snuck that bug into the dragon... so she could control him.
And you squashed it!
Now then, sit down.
You must be No Face. You sit, too.
Please turn them back into themselves.
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.
They can change back any time.
Yubaba and I are two halves of a whole, but we don't get along.
You know what bad taste she has.
Sorceress twins are just a recipe for trouble.
I'd like to help you dear, but there's nothing I can do.
It's one of our rules here.
You'll have to save your parents and your dragon boyfriend... all by yourself.
But can't you even give me a hint?
I feel like Haku and I met a long time ago.
In that case it's easy.
Everything that happens stays inside you... even if you can't remember it.
It's already late. Why don't you stay the night?
You boys give me a hand.
Come on, keep at it.
See? You have a talent for this.
You're a big help.
It's not the same when you use magic.
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.
Haku could die while
I'm sitting here.
And they might eat my mom and dad!
Wait just a little longer.
There we are.
Use it to tie back your hair.
It's pretty.
It'll protect you. I made it from the thread we spun.
Thank you.
What good timing. We've got another guest, let him in.
Sure.
Haku!
Haku...
I'm so glad to see you.
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?
Thank goodness.
Good timing, I'd say.
Zeniba, Haku's alive.
Haku, I no longer blame you for what you did.
But be sure to protect this girl.
Okay boys, time you went home.
Come see me again soon.
You stay with me and be my helper.
Zeniba!
Thank you, I'm going now.
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll manage just fine.
My real name is Chihiro.
Chihiro? What a nice name.
Take good care of it.
I will!
Now off you go.
Thank you, Zeniba. Goodbye!
Haku, listen.
I don't remember this, but my mom told me about it.
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.
But I just remembered.
The river was called... it was called the Kohaku River.
Your real name is Kohaku.
Chihiro, thank you!
My name is Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.
What a name! Sounds like a guardian spirit.
I remember how you fell into me as a child.
You were chasing your shoe.
Yes, and you carried me to shallow water.
I'm so happy...
They're back!
You brought Bo back with you?
Baba!
Bo! You're not hurt? What a terrible time you had.
Bo, when did you learn to stand on your own?
Yubaba, remember your promise.
Send Chihiro and her parents back to their world.
Sorry, but it's not that simple.
This world has rules, you know.
Silence!
Just do it, Baba. Don't be so mean.
Baby had such a good time.
But I'm just following the rule.
Otherwise I can't break the spell.
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.
But...
Granny!
Granny?
I'll do as you ask.
Haku told me about the rule.
Well, you've got guts.
I brought your contract. Follow me.
This won't take a minute, Bo.
Don't worry.
See if you can pick out your parents for me.
You get one guess.
Pick them out and you all go free.
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.
Not here? Is that your answer?
Yes.
You're right!
Attagirl! Good for you.
Thank you everyone.
All right! You win, just get out of here.
Thanks for everything.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
See you soon.
- Haku!
- Let's go.
Where's Mom and Dad?
They went on ahead.
The water's gone.
I can't go any further.
Go back the way you came.
But don't look back until you're out of the tunnel.
But what about you?
I'll tell Yubaba I'm quitting my apprenticeship.
I'm fine now. I have my name back.
Now I can go home too.
Will we meet again somewhere?
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?
Promise.
Now go, and don't look back.
Chihiro!
Where have you been? Hurry up.
Mom! Dad!
Don't go running off like that.
Let's go.
Mom, are you really okay?
Hurry, the moving van will be there.
Hurry up, Chihiro.
Watch your step.
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.
The end of the tunnel.
Hey!
What is it?
Will you look at that.
It's all dusty inside, too.
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...
I told you not to stop here.
That's it, you're fine.
We're off, Chihiro.
Chihiro! Hurry up!

The End
No, man, I'm just saying'-- I'm sayin' if-- if you own the beach property, right...
- Mm-hmm?
- Do you own, like, the sand and the water?
Nobody owns the water.
God owns-- It's God's water.
What if someone walks onto your beach, right?
Let's say if you do own it.
No, man, you don't own the beach.
- What you own is sand on the beach, man.
- Here. Here, man.
What if there's a naked girl on the beach?
That girl's not yours.
You don't own the girl.
What if she breaks her foot on your property?
She could sue me.
Sue me! Sue me!

Windows down! Windows down!
Windows down! Put the windows down!
All right, we're cool.
We're cool.
God, did you see that?
It must have been, like, a double homicide or something fuckin' cool.
- We was freakin' out for nothing.
- Man, I almost had a heart attack.
Mike, you didn't eat both those bags, did you?
Come and get it.
You must have eaten, like, a hundred bucks worth of pot...
- and, like, 30 bucks worth of shrooms, man.
- Who's the man?
So, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need
130 buck, you know... whenever you get a chance.

Is that the same car, man?

Yeah, it is.

Almost made it.

- Yes, sir.
- Now, did you say, "Yes, sir"?
- I think he said, "Yeah, sure."

- Well, I said, "Yeah, sure"... but what- literally, what
I said was, "Yeah, sure, sir."
- So you are okay then?
- Yes, sir.
- You smell somethin', Rabbit?
- Fear.
Now hand over that registration.
Yes, sir.
My mother's gonna kill me.
Holy shit. This is- This is- This is-
Don't look. Don't look.

Am I fucked up or is this fucked up, man?
This shit is fuckin' crazy.

Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God!

Mother of God.
Whoo!
Radio, we're in high-speed pursuit of a white Miata headin' southbound on Route 294.
Unit 91, come in, 91
Unit 91, come in, 91.
What are you doing out there, 91?
Quit counting your pubes.
We got a hell-raiser in a white Miata.
Ninety-one, are you there?
Ninety-one?
Ninety-one, are you there?
Hey, good-lookin'.
You catch any speeders today?
- Whoo!
- What the fuck!
Let's go, 91.
Rabbit, get that gun out!
Aw, Mac, you fucker!
Greetings.
- You guys are too slow.
- You killed my dummy.
Mac, now I'm gonna pay you. But I shouldn't,
'Cause I knew it was you the whole time.
Thorny, don't lie in front of the rookie.
It sets a bad example.
- Foster, where are your shoes?
- What, are you the shoe police now?
I am, and you owe me
20 laps around the bar. Let's go.
- Your black magic only works on the rookie.
- That's brown magic.
- Pay up.
- When do I get to do that?
You'll get your chance,
Rook. Shots?
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of booze.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
- I'm impressed.
Jesus!
Sorry, boys, you're on duty.
- On your tab, Officer Womack?
- Rookie, pay the lady.
- Pay her.
- Unit 23. Come in, 23.
Unit 23. Come in, 23.
Do you need me out there?
Do you need my assistance?
- Shut up, Farva.
- I can be there--
Listen, we got the Miata.
We're okay.
What about those expert you picked up?
Do you need my assistance?
The snozberries taste like snozberries.
- Oh, shit!
- He killed the cops!
- Get out of the car, man!
- This is a cop car!
- Hello.
- You boys like Mexico?
Yeeeee-hoooooo!
One, two, three, do it!
Oh, go, girlfriend
I'm your mother.
Come on, Thorny. You're losing to the rookie.
It's embarrassing.
Come on, Rabbit.
You can do it.
Oh, Rabbit, he's killing you.
I got Thorny in front by a lot.
What's the matter, your mama didn't teach you how to chug?
Come on, Thorn
Come on, Thorn.
- Ohh!
- Goddamn it.
I am all that is man.
- Every time.
- Finish it up.
See, there you have it.
You're doing it all wrong.
Open your throat, relax the jaw.
Don't forget to cup the ball
You're never gonna win... with those thin little bird lips you got there.
This guy's got these big old powerful lips.
Am I correct, Thorn?
So much of my authority is derived from the power right here.
Hey, guys.
Wow.
- Uh, do you have any more syrup?
- Sorry, Urs.
Why couldn't they chug ketchup?
It's a good thing you didn't order hash browns.
I mean, if they had been chugging the ketchup.
You get the score of that
Red Sox game last night?
- I turned it off just after--
- Ah, waiter. There you are.
I will have the enchilada platter with two tacos and no guacamole.
- Smy?
- Yeah, Chief, I'll take a chinchilla.
I don't get it. Tacos?
They think I'm Mexican.
You're not Mexican?
Another highway cop?
What, are you guys multiplying?
Yeah, if they can figure which hole to stick it in.
Ah, what the fuck?
- Hey, I saw that!
- Sit down, Rando.
That's it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
All right, all right!
- Cut it out, you turkeys!
- He fuckin' started it!
I'm sorry, Bruce. These boys get that syrup in them... they get a little antsy in their pantsy.
You just can't keep them under control.
You should keep these dogs on a leash, John.
Let's go.
♪ A-number one top gun cadets ♪
♪ In the name of justice
John Q. Public can trust us ♪
♪ Hail to thee dear old Paroon ♪♪
- Hail to thee!
- Hail to thee!
- Hail to thee!
- Hey, all right!
Hey, what's up, bone diddlies?
Did I miss the song?
Sing it again, rookie bitch.
Farva.
- Forgot the coffee.
- My bad, Cap.
All right, all right.
Let's get started.
I got the latest shit list, gentlemen.
It's down to Flagstone
Deer Lick and us.
And if we keep up these low numbers, you can bet your sweet butts... we're gonna get the big, ugly ax.
- Who'll bust heads on the highway?
- The goddamn local cops!
And you better believe that Grady and his goons... have got a copy of this list, so we need to step it up.
Who wants cream?
Nobody? Okay, no cream.
Foster, how many tickets did you issue last week?
Uh, I don't have my figures here in front of me.
Three.
- I can't make 'em speed.
- Try hidin'.
And grow a goddamn moustache, why don't ya?
I haven't shaved in two weeks.
- I'm growin' mine.
- Oh, you're growin' yours, are ya?
I'll tell you when it's time to grow a moustache.
Coffee's served!
Oh, no! That's Rabbit's.
That's Rabbit's.
- I get it. It's Rabbit's.
- Oh, look, a bar of soap.
Oh, shit!
I got you good, you fucker!
- Awesome prank, Farva.
- Better than the crap you pull, Mac.
- Look, fellas...
- Bite it, Rook. Make him look like a dick.
Every Thursday night I walk into the Lodge to play Hearts... and they always have my
Old-Fashioned just waiting there.
- I like that.
- Bite it. Bite--
Oh, hell!
Give me the goddamn soap!
We got 50 miles of highway.
That stretch of highway is ours.
I'll be damned if I'll let Grady and those buttheads get their hands on it!
Thorny, you're the ranking officer here.
Let's do your jobs and keep this place open, huh? Let's do it. Farva!
Your suspension continues.
Hit the radio.
Oh, yes.
Oh. Oh, local smokeys on our turf.
All right, hit it.
See, that's what O'Hagan was talking about.
Hi. You guys forget what color your car is?
- Bye-bye.
- Later, dude.
All right, how about "Cat Game"?
- Cat Game? What's, uh, what's the record?
- Thorny did six...
- but I think you can do ten.
- Ten?
Starting right meow?
- Uh, sorry about that.
- All right, meow... hand over your license and registration.
- Your registration? Hurry up meow.
- Oh.
Sorry.
There somethin' funny here, boy?
No, no, no.
Well, then, why you laughing,
Mr. Larry Johnson?
- All right meow, where were we?
- Are you saying "meow"?
Am I saying "meow"?
- I-I-I thought--
- Don't think, boy.
Meow, do you know how fast you were going?
Meow, what is so damn funny?
I could have sworn you said "meow."
Do I look like a cat to you, boy?
Am I jumping around all nimbly-bimbly from tree to tree?
- No. No.
- Am I drinkin' milk from a saucer?
- No.
- Do you see me eatin' mice?
Now you stop laughin' right meow.
Yes, sir.
Meow, I'm gonna have to give you a ticket on this one.
- But--
- No "buts" meow. That's the law.
It's not so funny meow, is it?
Meow!
Ooo-wee-ooh!
Thanks for washing my car, Rook.
- You know what this is?
- A chamois cloth?
Ha! Luck guess.
I just lost a buck... to myself.
- Think that's funny, do you?
- Yeah, I do.
Also heard something funny about how you got suspended.
Something about a school bus full of kids?
Oh, you heard that, did ya? Let me tell you another funny story, New Jack.
Back in '74... the great Charlie Rich was named Country Musician of the Year.
Then in '75, he had to hand the award off to the new one.
And you know who that was?
Mr. "Sunshine on My Goddamn Shoulders,"
John Denver.
- Really?
- Yeah. Can you believe it?
- Wow!
- Replaced by John Fuckin' Denver.
- Amazing.
- Yeah.
Well, I'll be damaged if Mr. Rich didn't pull out his cigarette lighter... and light that award on fire in front of everyone.
Do you get it?
So you're saying you'll set my Country Music Award on fire?
I'm saying when my suspension's up, you better watch your ass.
Or you’ll light my ass on fire?
- You wanna go? You wanna take one?
- Make your first move.
Hey! I hate to break up the honk convention, but we got a 10-92.
- You wanna take this one, Rod?
- Hell, yeah!
I bet you do-- Ohh!
Nice wax-job, Rook.
- Thank you, sir.
- You--
What the hell is this?
We got local pigs runnin' around?
How'd the locals beat us here?
We're, like, ten miles out.
- Look at this chump.
- Oh, Mr. Tough Guy here.
Take a walk, bud take a walk.
Holy shit!
It's a cool Winnebago.
My Uncle Denny used to have one just like this.
Rabbit, put your game face on.
You got it, boss.
- Hey, what the fuck?
- Oh-oh!
Oh, yes.
- Oh, man! What happened here?
- Take a walk, sonny.
This investigation is already under control.
Well, now it is.
- Hey!
- Don't touch the crime scene, rodent!
Rabbit. Hey, look at that.
Johnny Chimpo.
- Quit slappin' me.
- Would you stop touching my rookie, Grady?
Hey, I'll touch you.
This is the Spurbury Police.
Put your hands up and come outta there!
Get the fuck out of here!
- Glamor pet. No dice Get your tape.
- Okay. Let's cruise.
- Sounds like y'all have a hog problem.
- Oh, watch it, Mac.
Mac, I'm serious.
Be careful, Mac. He's angry.
- He's angry? Well, hello.
- Hey, mark it off.
- Smy, you mark it off.
- Back it up, Grady. I'm serious.
What's the point? Didn't you guys get shut down already?
Oh, yeah, that's next week.
Your bust. You know there's a dead chick in there?
Move it, Ramashit!
- Take it up with O'Hagan!
- Fight, fight, fight!
- Ow! My arm!
- Mac!
Get off of me!
Get off!
I'll give you the fat guy for Foster and, uh... how about that stupid guy for Rabbit?
Well, you're gonna have to be more specific.
They're both kinda fat and stupid.
Get these damn handcuffs off now, Ramathorn!
- Cut him loose.
- Go ahead, Smy.
You want to tell me what bug crawled up your big ass, Grady?
Yeah, I will tell you.
This is our crime scene.
We are takin' it.
- It's highway. It's our jurisdiction.
- No. No.
This highway is closed.
This is our jurisdiction.
Aw, fuck it.
You deal with the hog.
Hey, Chief.
What in hell's gotten into you guys?
I told you to be good.
I told you this was a bad time.
But you go ahead and get into a battle royale with the locals at a crime scene.
- But they started that fight.
- Of course they started the fight!
Now they've taken a jurisdictional grievance against us.
They want us to blow i
I mean, a murder on the highway... and you give them the investigation.
Christ! We look like a bunch of pussies.
All right, come on out, Rabbit.
I guess I just go take a shower then, huh?
Ow!
Strike three!
You're out of there!
All right, good cut, Ritchie.
Good cut. Come on.
Next batter! Batter up!
Next batter! Let's go.
But, Thorn, if they do shut you down... maybe you could
Stick around here?
I don't know, get a different job?
You can always come work in my shop.
Yeah, retired cop goes to work for his hippie girlfriend... in her head shop.
Too sitcom.
Okay. You better pay attention, Coach. Our son's up.
All right, Arlo.
Watch the ball. Get a hit.
You got it.
- Let's do it.
- All right, Arlo.
Whoa!
- Hey, you gotta keep on your toes.
- Do somethin' about that, ref.
Sorry-ass local cops.
You think you have a nice relationship with someone... based on professional courtesy and mutual boredom.
The next thing you know, they're trying to take you out.
What? What?
I don't wanna get transferred.
Have to go be a rookie again with a bunch of random dudes.
Don't worry about it.
If it happens, we'll, uh, we'll all just stay here, open up a roller disco.
Throw him the heat.
Bring it on.
Uh, anybody want a corn dog?
See if they got any chocolate bananas. Foster?
Ohh!
Hey, Charlie's Angel.
Hey, congratulations. You're the one millionth person to say that to me.
- Oh. What do I win?
- Ooh. Um...
Ahh. There you go.
Hope I don't get brain freeze.
I'm not sure you've got the required equipment.
So, listen, I, um, had a really good time at that Winnebago fight.
Maybe, uh, I don't know, we could do it again sometime.
All right, all right.
Fair is fair.
You can slug me back if you want to.
- Really? Okay.
- Yeah.
Hold my snow cone.
- Okay.
- Heads up!
Hey, what happened over there?
What? Wh- Why?
How about a little pep, hmm?
From those guys over there.
Assholes.
You want to move that, buddy. Now!
So, about my field time.
Yeah, yeah. I've been thinkin' a lot about that.
I think I might be able to talk to Grady for you.
- Pink stick, eat it or lose it.
- Hey, shut your pie hole, buddy.
I mean, because I'm ready to go out on patrol.
I'm goin' nuts being on the radio all the time.
I'd like to get some field work.
Yeah? Why don't you take your radio and go stand in a field.
Move that gigantic cotton candy!
Goddamn it! How's the view from sugar heaven, bitch?
Hi. I'm looking for Chief Grady.
I have some files for him.
Grady's not here.
I'll take the file.
It's kind of important.
How about Officer Rando?
Nope.
What do you need?
I'm the only one here?
There are no male officers around?
Just give me the file.
What's this?
So you originally from Vermont or, uh, or what?
You know, you've got a lot of courage walkin' into the lion's den.
- Oh, I got brass buns.
- Mm. You should join the band.
What are your cells, eight by eight?
Ours are nine by nine.
No big deal.
Listen, you seem like a really nice guy, but I just don't date cops.
I'm not much of a cop, really.
More like a civilian trapped in a cop's body.
Oh. Well, I hear you can get an operation for that.
But then,
I guess you'd miss out... on all those wack things you highway guys do.
Yeah, those stories about us are mostly lies, really.
Except for the one about how we pulled over AC/DC's bus... and then they flew us down to Jamaica to party with them; that one's true.
But, yeah, other than that it's pretty boring out there.
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't know.
All right, it's probably time for you to get out of here.
- I don't want to get fired too.
- Oh, I'm not getting fired.
I'm gettin' shut down.
That's a big difference.
- In our cells, the door is over here.
- Right.
A couple of hyenas.
Well, you know, they are speeding.
- Come in, Radio.
- Don't call me Radio, Unit 91.
Then don't call me Unit 91, Radio.
- Are you done?
- Yeah, okay, Radio.
We got a suspicious vehicle.
White Caprice, Vermont plates.
Tijuana-Gringo-Oner-Fiver-Zero.
- Roger. Checking.
- Thank you, Radio.
Unit 91, that license plate belongs to a local Spurbury police vehicle.
It does? Oh, my God!
- Very funny, 91.
- Thank you, Radio.
Whoa! Looks like that truck's planning on skipping the weigh-in.
Yeah, well, you don't weigh in, you don't wrestle.
Whoa! What's this jack-off doin' trying to pull him over?
There's no fuckin' way that is happenin'.
- What the hell's he doin'?
- I got somethin'.
Yeah. That's right, doofu.
Move it along.
You, uh, wanna do "Repeat"?
Do you wanna do "Repeat"?
No. I've been thinking a lot about what the Captain said.
I'd like to play it straight this time, okay?
Okay.
- For O'Hagan.
- For O'Hagan.
Good morning.
Would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
- Sure. I was just--
- Good morning.
Would you mind stepping down from there with your license and registration?
- Yeah. No problem.
- Excuse me one second. No.
Excuse me one second.
No.
Did, uh, I do something wrong, officers... because I know
I wasn't speeding.
- Why didn't you weigh in?
- Yeah, why didn't you weigh in?
Did I miss that weigh station?
They got me runnin' so many miles...
I Just must have dazed out and well--
I'll pull into the next one and get weighed, okay?
What are you pulling back there?
Well, uh, mostly just soap, I think.
Why don't we take a look?
Listen, Officers, I'm on a really tight schedule. I really need to--
Let's go, Mr. Galikanokus.
Well, you heard him.
Let's go, Mr...
Mr. Galonukum.
Hop on up.
Okay-silly-dilly-dokey-o.
I'm an idiot.
Yeah, that's true.
Sorry about the light there.
I have a flashlight in the cab.
- Hey! Mr. Galikanokus!
- Whoa!
Mr. Galikanokus!
- We should have seen that comin'.
- We should have seen that comin'.
- It is time to stop now, Mac.
- It is... time to stop now, Mac?
And that was the second time I got crapped.
- Awesome.
- Afternoon.
- Hey.
- Hey.
It stinks like sex in here.
What happened?
We got a little distracted by somebody doin' the "Repeater."
- Huh. That'll happen.
- That will happen.
Well, you did it this time.
Fishin' your car out of
Lake Leblanc right now.
Oh, man.
Nah, we just parked it across the street.
All right, listen. Next time this kind of thing happens...
I want you to stop, take a deep breath... and pull your heads out of each other's asses, would ya?
Language.
It's easy for you to say.
He's got a tiny little head.
Yeah. What's this guy movin'?
Soap, I think.
Reefer.
Whoo-hoo!
That's one stinky pyramid.
We should've built a stinky igloo and climb in.
That's a lot of pot.
Thinkin' back to your tour days with the Dead, Rabbit?
- Better lock this shit up, huh, buddy?
- What are you talkin' about?
Enhance.
Enhance. Enhance.
Just print the damn thing!
All right, what do we know about this Galikanokus guy?
It's a fake name, fake license.
- Bunty Soap?
- Fake soap company.
- What, plastic fake? Decorative fake? What?
- No, like they don't exist.
So, we got 150 kilos of marijuana and no arrests. We got nothin'.
I got a theory, Cap.
These, uh, bales of pot, they have that red Johnny Chimpo sticker on them.
And that dead woman in the Winnebago had the same logo tattooed on her back.
See, a lot of drug dealers use stickers to mark their products. Like a brand name.
See! Where'd you learn that,
Cheech? Drug school?
Shut up, Farva.
Did that bag you pulled off those college kids have that sticker?
Um...
I don't believe it did.
- Was there any marijuana on that Winnebago?
- Nope.
A monkey tattoo.
Sounds kinda flimsy.
What's the significance of this John Chimpo fella?
Uh, well, you know those really cheap Japanese Cartoons?
No? This is basically a cheaper Afghani knockoff.
It's this monkey that basically travels around the world... uh, doing nasty things.
His butler tries to keep him in line, but, uh-- No.
It's really funny, Cap.
It's Afghanistanimation.
The monkey has a butler?
Great.
- Is that what they do in Arabia, Thorny?
- How the hell should I know?
All right. Somebody get me a VTR copy of this thing.
I'll talk to Grady, see if he'll let us take a look at the Winnebago.
All right. You ready for the photo shoot?
Okay, fellas, let's take it.
- Pull down your pants.
- Shut up, Farva, you idiot. Come on, do it.
- John. I'm not interrupting, am I?
- Mayor Timber!
- No. Come in, come in.
- Good work, gentlemen, all the way around.
- Could I get in on that?
- Sure. Why not?
- Excuse me. Good work. Good work, Officer.
- Hey.
You're gonna have a hard time shutting us down now, right, Mr. Mayor?
We got a murder one day, a drug bust the next.
I'm thinkin' we need as much police as we can get.
- That'd be a good slogan, wouldn't it?
- Mm-hmm.
Tell that to the budget committee.
I Just got off the phone with Governor Jessman... and she's gonna be swinging through here on her way to Burlington.
Give me a gun, huh, to hold for the pictures.
- Rabbit, run. Gun.
- And, John... as far as this brawling with the local police is concerned--
It won't happen again, Bill.
I'm onto it.
Good.
'Cause when the governor shows up,
I'm gonna throw her a little party.
We're gonna let her know just how this community feels about its law enforcement.
Spread it on!
Come on, Dad!
Faster! Faster!
- So what's the deal with you and Bobbi?
- Come on, Dad!
You guys are goin' out, but you, um, sleep with other people?
Well, I mean, yeah.
Not really. Kind of.
It's sort of a long story, all right?
Well- Hey, Arlo, does Mom ever have any friends over?
- Any older boys?
- Can't we turn the siren on?
In a minute, all right?
Are you listening?
Does she have anyone over that maybe you call uncle?
Like Uncle Fred?
Uncle Fred?
Who's Uncle Fred?
He's this crazy bird on TV.
- He's crazy. He flies around like a pigeon.
- Oh, right.
Uncle Freddy, he's great.
He's a crazy bird.
Okay.
We got one.
You wanna take this one, kid?
- What about you?
- I gotta stay with little "A."
- You're okay, right?
- Sure.
- Go on. Make mama proud.
- All right.
Yeah, Farva, I got a Porsche, brown, Washington plates--
- Eight-Donna-Peanut-Eunuch.
- Roger. Checking.
Kill it.
Can I please see your license and registra--
I'm sorry, Office for the speeding violation.
I am so used to driving on the Autobahn.
Uh-- what?
...Sean Cassidy.
Yummy, yummy.
Nicht?
- Do you know why I pulled you over?
- We were driving way too fast.
- Ja.
- Ja.
Officer, this is a major problem... because I cannot afford another ticket with mein Porsche.
Is there maybe something I can do for you, hmm? Or maybe my wife...
Could do for you to avoid this dilemma?
Is there maybe something you would like me to do to you?
Or maybe something you would like to do to me? Hmm?
Uh, 'cause you were doing 90 in a 65.
Perhaps some spanking or cuffing is in order.
Could you hold on a minute?
Just a minute. I'll be right back.
- Twenty-three, that Porsche is hot.
- Are you sure?
Rabbit?
- Please, Thorn, not now. No.
- He can join too, if you like?
- Get over here.
- Tickle, tickle.
- Ja.
- Hold on a second.Just one second, huh?
- What?
- Farva said that car is stolen.
What? Stolen?
- Shit!
- Is there a problem, officers?
Hold on! Come on, Thorn,
I need this.
Look, kid, any other day, I'd step in here and show you how to swing.
But the car's stolen.
Goddamn it!
You got to get over there and you got to cuff her.
Do it! You're a highway patrolman.
Cut it out! Do it.
Now turn that off and step out of the car, sir.
- This is no problem, hmm?
- Put your hands on the car and spread 'em.
- Ah, now some fun for both of us.
- Get back in the car!
Rabbit, get over there and cuff her.
Up against the car.
Ma'am, I hate to do this to you, but would you--
Would you please put your hands behind your back?
Now things are getting kinky.
Arlo!
- I love your--
- I'm on the radio. Come in, Farva.
Arlo! Rabbit! Let's go!
Climb up on Uncle Rabbit's lap, Arlo, okay?
I don't think that's such a good idea, Thorn.
Uh, right.
Okay, why don't you Just sit in the middle, buddy?
Ursula, what the fuck?
There's no T.P. in the bathroom.
- What about the piece stuck to your shoe?
- What about that piece?
Shit!
You know, you might get ahead around here if you made the extra effort.
- Do you want me to wipe your ass?
- That's not what I--
Well, around my house, my wife knows to refill the T.P.
I'm not your wife, Smy.
No. And if you were,
I'd take you down a peg or two.
Ooh.
Hi, douche bag.
You know, if you were my wife..
I'd massage your feet every night until you fell asleep.
Nice try.
He strangles her and puts her face in pig food?
What an asshole.
Got any I.D. on the corpse?
Yeah. "Jane Doe."
Do you know her?
Oh, we're working on it.
It's called routine police work.
Apparently, she had a cartoon monkey tattooed on her back.
John Chimpo, I'm told.
And those cannabis bags in our truck... those stickers had the same monkey logo.
So we think there might be some kind of connection.
Are you suggesting that a cartoon monkey is bringing drugs into our town?
- Look, I know we don't like each other.
- I like you.
Come on! I'm looking for a little cooperation here.
John Chimpo.
Hanson, could you round up, uh, Johnny Chimpo... and, uh, Jerry Giraffe and Arty the Alligator... and bring them in for a lineup.
- Thanks, sweetie.
- Sounds like they're having fun.
That's what happens when you start hanging out with a state trooper.
We show you the funny.
Well, where were we?
Uh, you were laying your best rap on me and I was resisting.
But you were starting to think about it.
- I told you. I don't touch highway hog.
- Baby, I'm Sizzle Lean.
I scratched your back, Bruce.
I scratched it good and hard.
Now, either you scratch my back or you’re gonna get my size ten boot up your ass!
Desperation is a stink cologne, John.
Let's see. You are an expendable line item on a state spending bill.
You have a station full of crappy cops.
I am about this far away from having a bigger budget.
And now, you come in here talking about... monkey tattoos on some drunk lady's tit like it's a goddamn drug conspiracy.
Keep your bags packed, John.
Let us handle the real police work, huh?
Uh, John, when you do get shut down you come back, talk to me.
I can always use a good meter maid.
Let it roll.
Come and get me, Mac.
- See you later, sucker!
- Ohh! Ohh! Fuck!
Can't catch the Rabbit.
- Damn it!
- Out of the car! Out of the car, scumbag!
Well, hello, Shirley.
Come on, Farva, man. Same team. Same team.
What's Thorny going to say, Rook?
Honestly, Bobbi
I think it's gonna happen.
We don't want to leave
We really like this town.
I'll probably just get sent down to Brattleboro. It's a nice town.
I don't think it's a healthy time for him to move.
He's got a lot of real good friends here.
Who? That creepy kid with the lisp?
Hey. Stop jumping on the bed.
Look, I don't want to go without you.
- Then you should stay here.
- But I can't if they transfer me.
Hey, stop jumping on the bed.
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
Hey, honey, it's almost
Mitternacht, huh?
Uhh. We really should be getting back to the jail.
You don't want us turning into pumpkins.
Thorn, can't they just stay a little longer?
All right.
Who wants a mustache ride?
- I want one. I want one!
- I do! I do! I do!
Spurbury Police.
Oh, thank the Lord.
Thank the Lord. It's terrible.
Oh, there's a disgusting pervert flashing people.
Ma'am, I need you to calm down.
I can't calm down!
You calm down! Oh, my God!
- Ma'am, tell me your location.
- He's right in front of the building... on 323, uh, Karuna Street.
- That's this address, ma'am.
- Oh, well, then, maybe you can see him.
He's right in front of the building.
Go look. I'll hold.
Whoo-aaah!
Did you see him?
Oh, he's disgusting.
He certainly is, ma'am.
Oh, I think he's going to the window again.
Whoo-ooo-ooo!
Oh, the humanity!
He's so bulgy. He's like a moose.
Oh, no!
I think he's going back again.
Freeze, motherfucker!
Oh, God! Please don't shoot me.
I-I'm naked.
Drop your coat and grab your toes.
What?
I'm gonna show you where the wild goose goes.
Oh, this isn't happening.
I-I-I'm a police officer. Ursula, help!
Baby, I'm gonna butter your bread.
You don't have these at your station?
I don't suppose you got a pair of fresh underwear I could borrow?
I'm not sure you could fit into my panties.
You know, you can't tell anybody about this.
I already told my mom about you.
Ohh! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Shit!
- Baby, you rocked me.
Wow! What is this?
Rabbit, you're off the road! Shut up, Farva!
It's a good move, Cap.
Rabbit, you're on radio.
Farva, you're ridin' with Thorny.
- Wait a minute--
- What do you want me to do about it?
My hands are tied!
It's all over the police band!
Rabbit, you couldn't have picked a worst time!
I got a Q-17 request form today.
We have to inventory our equipment.
Which means our balls are this close to the band saw.
What are you sellin', Mac, hot dogs?
- There's a new billboard.
- Casino le Fantastique?
Let me guess.
You just humped the mayor's wife and burnt down City Hall.
I'll do you one better, Captain.
So I'm walkin' down by the local police station, minding my own business.
But there's something funny in the air.
I feel like I just gotta get into that Winnebago.
So after I jimmy the door, I do a quick recon.
Bullshit.
I can see there's something not right about that bed.
- So I busted it in.
- Bullshit.
And just sittin' there were ten huge duffel bags of these mothers.
Let me get this straight. You went into the impound, scaled the fence... broke into the Winnebago and smashed the bed, all on a hunch?
I'll believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet.
What? Do you think
I just grew this weed?
How could you know to look underneath the bed?
It must have been my sixth-- or even my seventh sense.
You know, Rabbit, a good cop doesn't really know why he does anything.
Disregard that, Rabbit.
And you didn't even think to call in your partner?
So these local mothers have got a hundred keys of chiba and don't know it?
Not a clue.
It's totally hidden.
And Grady's walkin' around like he's hot soup.
All right, we got a chance here.
But we got to beat these guys to the punch.
Mac, you and Foster check out the truck stops... and find out what you can about Galikanokus and Bunty Soap.
I'll talk to Grady and play a little hardball.
Thorny, I'm takin' a hard line.
You got to promise me no more bullshit.
Cap, you know I'm cool, but I can take no responsibility for these white devils.
Well, you're gonna have to.
Now, Rodney, we're under a lot of pressure here.
Remember what we talked about.
If anything happens... count to ten, take some deep breaths.
Ten deep breaths.
I got it, Cap.
Foster, you're on duty.
Trust me, skipper, we'll make you proud.
You are awesome.
You are incredible.
You are a fantastic cop.
Keep goin'.
Uh, and then somebody said,
I think it was O'Hagan, said, um...
- "Foster, you deserve a promotion."
- Hmm. I think you get a star.
Mm. Foster? Wait.
I don't know if this is gonna work.
- This steering wheel is jabbing my ass.
- Oh, right.
Ow! Okay.
In New York City, a guy could pay ten bucks to watch two cops have sex in a cage.
Yeah?
Oh.
- Foster?
- Yeah?
In our cruisers, somebody has to let you out of the back seat.
Oh, fuck it!
Do we look like the two dumbest guys in the world to you?
Is that why you choose to treat us with such disrespect?
Look, all I'm sayin', man, is switch partners. It'll be fun.
- I don't think so.
- Come on, mix it up a bit.
Mm, no fuckin' way.
Come on, Mac, you know you’re always sayin' how funny Foster smells.
Oh, look out for Thorny, master of psychology.
Do I really smell?
All right, assholes, quit talkin' about me.
Lock and load, Ramathorn.
Let's kick some tail.
We weren't talkin' about you, you big idiot.
Bullshit.
- Truck stop, huh?
- We gotta do it.
But the captain didn't say anything about going undercover.
Do you think they're gonna tell us anything if they know we're cops?
Get a job, man! Look, you're fuckin' super cop.
You should know this.
- I am super.
- Plus, we can't take our car... until they replace the door you, for no reason whatsoever, ... removed last night.
I told you it was those kids with the wrenches.
Ah, yes, those ballsy little punks who took your car door off... while you were sittin' in the damn thing.
I told you I was in a very deep sleep.
Yeah. You wanna tell that to O'Hagan?
Maybe we can borrow his car today.
Do you even know how to drive this thing?
Shit! This rig sucks!
Aha!
Uh, who knew it was a stick?
How about we, uh, pop a couple of Viagra... and issue tickets with raging, mega-huge boners?
Only you, Farva, can make a dark man blush.
- And, no, we're not doin' it.
- Ah, hell.
Hey, I came up with a great name for our car.
Oh, yeah?
Get this.
You're Arcot Ramathorn-- Ram-- and I'm Rod Farva- Rod; car Ramrod.
Car Ramrod. You get it?
Yeah, I got it.
- Rabbit, I got a Plymouth Voyager...
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Say "Car Ramrod."
- Vermont plates- Hold on.
Vermont plates- Alpha...
God-Mustard-One-Niner-Decade-China.
Check it.
Roger, 23.
You didn't say it.
I wrote it on the paper.
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, yeah.
Come on, Ramathorn, what game are we playin'?
- What? No games.
- Don't bullshit me.
Let's play one of those games I keep hearin' about. You know, Mac and Foster... did that thing, you know, with the "who can say pussy the most."
You know, actually, Mac bet Foster he couldn't say "meow" ten times.
To the driver.
I realize that doesn't sound funny as I described--
Who can say "meow" the most?
You guys are real crazy.
Hey, look out for these guys!
Hell, I can say "meow."
I can say "moo."
For 20 bucks, I'll call the guy a chicken-fucker.
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.
Easy, Rod. Easy, Rod.
License and registration... chicken-fucker! Brawwk!
- Bruce? John O'Hagan.
- John!
I'm glad you called. Listen. I have
Bobby the Baboon in lockup... and he says that for twenty bananas he'll provide evidence...
Johnny Chimpo is the pimp in charge of the Cartoon Network whorehouse.
Look, I'm done dickin' around.
We got new evidence on your murder.
Who? Galikanokus?
You know where he is?
No, we don't know where he is, but--
Then I don't see how you can possibly help us, then.
Okay. This is my last offer.
Either you let us in on this investigation... or I'm gonna embarrass you personally.
Oh, how embarrassed?
Like, naked in a dream embarrassed?
No, no.
Embarrassed like back in '77, when you got caught fuckin' your cousin embarrassed.
She's not my cousin.
Welcome to Dimpus.
Can I take your order?
Give me a, uh, double bacon cheeseburger.
Double bacon cheeseburger.
It's for a cop.
- Roger.
- What the hell's that all about?
He gonna spit in it now?
No, I was just tellin' him that so he makes it good.
Don't spit in that cop's burger.
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Roger. Hold the spit.
Give me a, uh, pie.
Apple.
Do you want me to hold the spit?
Just kidding,
Officer... Farva.
So, do you want to "Dimpisize" your meal for a quarter more?
Want me to "punchisize" your face for free?
Some male figure? I'm his dad.
And stop with the whole transfer thing.
Oh, Christ.
You know what? I gotta go.
Let's talk about this later, okay?
Okay. bye.
Now don't give me any lip.
It’s just a quarter, and look how much more you get.
- I said no!
- It’s just 25 cents.
- Hey, listen, guy. He doesn't want it.
- I can handle this, Ramathorn.
- I don't want it!
- Right. Uh, beverage?
Gimme a, uh, liter of cola.
- A what?
- A liter of cola!
"Leederacola."
Do we make leederacola?
Will you just order a large, Farva?
I don't want a large Farva.
I want a goddamn liter of cola!
- I don't know what that is!
- Liter is French... for "give me some fuckin' cola before I break both fuckin' lips."
All right, all right.
Relax!
- That look like spit to you?
- Yeah.
Ah, fuck it.
Mm. I feel like a real cop again.
Well, I wouldn't get used to it,
'Cause you know it's not gonna last.
- Bullshit. I'm not goin' anywhere.
- All right, buddy.
We're about to get shut down anyway.
Oh, yeah?
That's a lot of"Dimp."
- What do you do if you get transferred?
- I don't know.
Bobbi doesn't want to leave, and...
I don't want to leave her and Arlo, so--
Yeah, I don't know what the hell I'm gonna do.
Who gives a shit? I'm about to win ten million bucks anyway, right?
Are ya? What are you going to do with that ten million bucks?
And you can't say,
"Buy the Cleveland Cavaliers."
- I'd buy a ten-million-dollar car.
- Ah, good investment.
- But I'd pull you over.
- Bullshit. You could never catch me.
Oh, I could never catch you?
If you did, I'd activate my Car's wings, and fly away.
I got a good feelin' about this.
Damn it, you burger punk!
You son of a bitch!
Aah!
Yeah, Burger Boy!
All right, all right, all right.
Cut it out, you guys.
Knock it off.
Clear out of here.
All of you.
I was hittin' his ass so hard with that hose.
I'm sorry about the delousing, Rod.
Standard procedure.
- It's powdered sugar.
- The lice hate the sugar.
- Listen, Rod--
- It's delicious.
Uh, good. Good.
Say, Rod, what are your plans after the shutdown?
We're not gettin' shut down,
Grady. We're drug busters.
Maybe they're drug busters, but you're dispatch.
- Nuh-uh. I'm back on the road, now.
- Until this little incident.
Listen, Rod...
This whole murder thing, we've been tryin' real hard to break it open... but O'Hagan just will not cooperate with the evidence.
Now I've spoken to the governor myself.
She is gonna shut your station down, son.
It's gonna happen.
Now, I'm gonna have a bigger budget then, and I could really use... a good local officer like yourself.
- Could I go now?
- You could have your own car.
Work on exciting cases. Hey, we could even chase drug dealers together.
Now, the thing is, Rod...
I really need to know about your side of the investigation.
O'Hagan's making all kinds of threats, and-
Can we make a deal?
I'm all highway.
Let him loose.
Sorry about that, bro.
Hey, Charlie's Angel.
- What's up?
- Guys.
Hey.
Well, we got about, uh, twenty desk lamps.
- Farva went schizoid.
- That's good.
- How did the undercover thing go?
- Well, not so good.
- Turns out, this guy can't drive a semi.
- Yeah.
You guys watch that Johnny Chimpo thing?
- Funny, but nothin' there.
- Mm. Maybe you missed something.
Mm, trust me, bro.
There's nothing there.
Maybe we should take another look.
That's it, you're off the road. Never again.
Sir, no.
- It was not my fault.
- Neither was the goddamn school bus.
You know, there was a time we'd take a guy like you out back and beat you.
- Now you got your goddamn unions.
- I'm not a pro-union guy.
- And you're banned from Dimpus Burger.
- Damn it!
Get some rubber gloves. From now on you're my cleaning lady.
Beat it!
Well, the butler is basically saying to Johannes Chimpo...
"Don't let the Great Satan tempt you with the Western culture.
You must remain true to the Taliban warlord."
Cool beans.
So, um, Galikanokus is not the butler?
Well, possibly. But this is, uh, quite brilliant, really.
And so, Captain, you think there might be some connection with the smugglers?
Rabbit, get this meatball out of here.
You got it, Captain
Come on, meatball.
We should probably do that.
Back in the cage with your beautiful wife, huh?
What did you find out at the weigh station?
My cruiser weighs 16,000 kg.
I just got off the phone with Tom McCardle from the budget committee.
- This thing with Farva screwed our pooch.
- What?
They can't lump us in with that fuckin' Martian.
- We're all in the same boat.
- But our shenanigans are cheek and fun.
Yeah. His shenanigans are cruel and tragic.
Which makes them not shenanigans at all, really.
Evil shenanigans.
I swear to God I'll pistol-whip the next guy that says, "shenanigans."
Hey, Farva!
What's the name of that restaurant you like with all the goofy shit on the walls...
- and the mozzarella sticks?
- You mean shenanigans?
- No! Oh!
- You're talking about shenanigans, right?
Put those away!
Hey, Rabbit.
Yeah, I know. "You got beautiful, big brown lips."
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Have your fun, boys.
Have your fun.
'Cause I'm gonna start looking for a new job.
Hey! Urs! Ha!
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.
The mayor came down today.
Ah, biker! I'm an idiot.
Boy, you guys just keep shooting yourselves in the foot.
- Heard you got to see Farva naked.
- Yeah, it was hard to miss.
So, Grady thinks he's got you guys by the balls.
Yeah. How do you feel about long-distance relationships?
Think I'm getting sent to Deer Lick.
Well, I've been thinking about this.
I think
I might have an idea.
The governor comes to town on
Saturday for that big thing, right?
She's gonna make a big speech about drugs and law enforcement...
- and all of that because of your bust.
- She's gonna shut us down.
No! Not if you give her more.
Get the reefer out of the Winnebago and give it to her during the party.
Make a big show of it.
With all that media there, she would love us for it.
- No way she'll shut you down.
- That reefer's locked in the Winnebago... which is locked in your impound, which is guarded by assholes.
All right.
Here's what I'll need.
Five ski masks, a case of smoke bombs-- the good ones--
- and banana peels, lots of banana--
- Foster?
- How about if I just help you get in?
- You would do that for me?
Yeah. What the hell.
We'll work together.
Like Cagney and Lacey.
Yeah. Well, Cagney and Lacey were women.
- But--
- I could be Lacey.
Mac-o!
- So that's it, huh?
- C.C.S. Rockman Bulletproofing is the tops!
Same guys who make our flak-jackets.
Now, Rabbit, a good cop does what... before using his equipment in the field?
- Uh, they test it?
- They test it. Exactly.
How are you shootin' today, Thorn?
- Dead on all morning.
- How about that little fella?
Oh, that little guy? I wouldn't worry about that little guy.
Good enough for me.
You're my man, now.
I don't get it. How are we going to get into the local impound?
There are gonna be cops there.
Wa-hoo!
Most of the local cops will probably already be at the banquet.
They'll leave, like, one or two of the dumbest guys at the station.
- How are you feelin' there, Mac?
- Good enough to fuck your mother!
So, what we have to do is distract whoever they leave there.
Hey, Mac! You still have that Halloween costume?
Oh, hell, yeah.
You don't throw out--
Wa-hoo-hoo!
Damn, that's good!
So, if we can get ten minutes, you and I can get into the impound... get the reefer, and get it to the governor before she leaves?
- Nice and easy.
- I like it.
- You're up.
- Me?
- Now, don't get puke on it.
- Does it hurt?
You're gonna feel a little pinch.
Lookin' good, Rabbit!
Now don't move!
- Hang on, buddy.
- Hey, Cap!
- Hey, Captain.
- Bulletproof cup, huh?
I invented this gag, Rabbit.
- Only in my day, the rookie got naked.
- Who, whoa, whoa!
And we also used blanks.
You're a sick motherfucker, Mac.
Thanks, Chief.
All right, Thorny.
Why'd you call me up here?
Good to know you’re still battin' for us with the budget committee Mayor.
Well, I don't want to mince words, John, but it doesn't look too good.
Maybe not to the untrained eye.
But if I was a bettin' man, I'd put money on us changin' the governor's mind tonight.
Well, you might want to strap on your ass-kissing boots and start right now.
- I think she's your only hope.
- Hello.
What is this thing again?
Humane society?
- Uh, it's a drug bust.
- Cocaine?
- Hello.
- Uh, marijuana.
Then why are we here?
Oh, I think we're pretty well covered, Mr. Mayor.
I think she's got a lot of decisions to make.
- I don't envy her.
- Oh, I do.
I'll be luck to have a figure like that when I'm her age.
Yeah. That's a good one.
We're sending someone down, don't worry. Okay.
Thanks You bet.
- No, no, no, no. We'll bring the guns.
- We're on it. We're on it.
We got it. All right, that's like twenty calls.
I'll tell you what. I'll go down there and check it out.
- What about me?
- Burton, somebody's got to stay here.
All right, fuck it.
Shit!
Maybe this is the key.
I mean, no offense, bro, but...
When did you become a cop?
None taken, Ramathorn.
None taken.
- Really. How'd you know the key was there?
- A gentleman never asks.
A lady never tells.
Wonder how Rabbit's doin'?
Oh, yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!
- What does that look like to you?
Is the bear--
- Is the guy--
- Oh, yeah. Yeah!
Seems more of a game warden thing to me.
- Well, it's illegal, Burton. I know that!
- Whoo! Oh!
Oh, shit. Look who's here.
I thought you said he wasn't gonna make it.
I tried.
- Glad to see you, Rodney.
- Hey, how are you doin', Rowdy?
How you think I'm doin'? Open bar, ain't it?
Mm-hmm.
- Thought you said Bowl-a-rama.
- Yeah, I tried to call you, but, um--
Yeah, right!
- Give me six schlitzes.
- No schlitz.
- Whatever's free.
- Take it easy, Rod.
Open bar, dude!
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Hello down there.
Are you okay?
Excuse me.
- Bear- Bear-fucker!
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Do you need assistance?
- Oh! Oh! Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Let's do this.
Hey, hey, whoa! Whoa!
Mayor Timber, yeah. So I just wanted to let you know... that the governor's gonna have to leave early.
For an emergency fund-raiser.
So--
Aw, she's gonna speak in about five minutes.
And then we're gonna have to zip on out of here.
- Well, thanks for the heads-up.
- I'll go check on those guys.
Mac-Attack! Wanna go punch for punch?
Good one!
I did not specify.
Never shit a shitter.
Lady in blue, comin' through.
Ramathorn.
What? I don't know.
Two minutes?
♪ Yeah, yeah ♪
♪ Well, I got a ticket to ride this rocket ♪
♪ whoo, sixteen ounces in my back pocket ♪
♪ Well, come on, baby, won't you take a little taste ♪
♪ 'Cause we're about to get on into outer space ♪

You weren't kiddin'.
That's a lot of hooch!
♪ whoo-hoo
Yeah, hoo-hoo ♪
Holy shit.
What's Grady doin' up there?
...and of course, your own local police chief, Bruce Grady... has made yet another astonishing breakthrough.. in our state's War on Drugs.
That's fine police work.
Thank you very much.
The real credit... goes to my skilled officers, who uncovered the marijuana in that Winnebago.
And, uh, we have identified the dead woman from that Winnebago... as a drug "queenpin" from Louisville, Kentucky- Lucy Garfield.
Or, as we like to call her down at the station,
"The Louisville Smuggler."
There will be no more running of marijuana.. through Spurbury on my watch.
You can count on that.
Farva's number one!
Farva's number one!
Hey! You showed Grady our secret stash?
That was our stash!
- I did not show Grady the stash!
- Those bags of grass...
- represented a-a bond of trust between us.
- Foster--
Foster, I had no idea--
Did you pick me because you could manipulate me?
No! How could you even say that?
- Because you crapped on my heart!
- I what on your heart?
What are you gettin' out of this?
Is Grady puttin' you on the road?
No, a-are you--
You're screwing him too.
- Asshole.
- Aah!
Ursula-
- Oh, Mac.
- What the fuck?
Fuckin' traitor!
Hey, Mac! Did it work?
Did it work?
Was there ever a moment when you suspected her?
- No, why would I?
- Exactly.
Why use your head when you can be getting some cop-on-cop fucky-sucky?
Well, did you tell her anything?
Two cops sleeping together. What the hell do you think they talked about?
I don't know. Doin' it?
Positions and stuff?
Oh, shut up.
You guys don't even know her.
Get it through your head, fish dick. She was in on it.
Fuck you, Mac!
All right, all right. Fighting's not gonna change anything.
Foster, she played you good. It's called the honey pot. You should have known better.
Well, I guess they were gonna shut us down anyway.
But you two are friends, you know?
You shouldn't let this come between you.
Come on now.
Shake hands.
- Sorry.
- You should be.
- Hey!
- Sorry. - Sorry.
- Good, now. Who wants a shot?
- I do.
- I'll have one.
- I said, who wants a shot?
I do!
Do you have any openings in Sherburne, Cap?
- Not for you guys.
- Oh, come on.
- We're like the sons you never had.
- If you were my son, Mac...
I would have smothered you by now.
Smothered me in gravy, you big, dirty man.
- You put in for a transfer yet?
- Ugh!
I applied for a guard job.
At the post office.
- Oh, man.
- You'll finally get to shoot someone.
- To the death of fun.
- Here's to you guys.
What's up, dirty dogs?
Guess that's it for the old locker.
She stinks like ass, but I'll sure miss her.
I guess you can say that about all my girls.
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck to you too.
- What are you?
- I'm a cop. What are you?
- A local cop?
- Grady had an opening. Big deal.
Why are you wearing that uniform in my station?
Look who's talkin', Denim Dan!
You look like the president, chairman and C.E.O. of Levi Strauss.
Where'd you get the Canadian tuxedo?
You ratted us out to Grady.
I'm not even gonna dignify myself with a response to that.
Hey, I got no hard feelings.
Nothin' a few beers can't fix, right?
Hey, how about one on me, Ramrod?
Excuse me.
Uh, excuse me, guys.
Yeah. I'll be right back.
What the fuck?
We should have taken him out the back and shot him.
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- I gotta call Ursula.
Fellas, we got to get him back.
He's gotta pay for this.
Nobody wears that uniform in my station.
- Farva's goin' down!
- Yes! Right!
- Grady's goin' down!
- Yeah!
- All of these fuckers are goin' down!
- Yeah!
What?
Welcome to Dimpus Burger.
May I take your order?
Hello in there.
This is Officer Rod Farva.
- Give me a liter of cola!
- Uh, sorry, Officer Farva, I can't--
You want me to come in there, boy?
I'll come in there!
- Hello?
- Chase him! Chase him!
Let's pull someone over.
Whoo!
License and registration.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
We are the Spurbury police!
Whoo! Hoo!
Who-ho-ho-ho!
Whoo!
I'm cool. I'm cool.
Grady! Get your ass out here!
- Grady!
- I don't want to sound like a wienie...
- but I think I should call Ursula.
- No way!
- You sound like a fuckin' wienie.
- Gimme the radio.
Grady? Bruce?
Fuck it, all right.
Gimme the goddamn radio.
- He's not home!
- Hey, Chief-o!
This is Officer Rod Farva.
Come in, Ursula.
- What're you doin'?
- Ursula! I love you, Ursula.
- Come in, Ursula!
- Who is this? Hello?
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, she's there?
Ursula! Oh, I'm sorry.
Sir, this is a police channel.
Please get off of it.
- I'm tryin' to apologize here.
- Sir, this is not a civilian channel.
If you’d like to have a conversation with someone, please go to Channel Five.
All right, Thorny.
Pop it over to Channel Five.
Look what I found!
A two-by-four!
- You go, girl!
- Foster!
- Help me out here, Rabbit.
- Foster, is that you?
- I need someone sober.
- You got it, Cap.
- And, hit!
- My ass in your face, Thorny.
So-So, hey, what's goin' on?
Don't use that boyfriend voice with me.
What are you doing?
Don't use that boyfriend voice with me, Foster!
- Hit!
- Yea!
Now, did you know that Farva was the one who told Grady about our plans?
- Yeah. I know. He's working for us now.
- So, I'm sorry.
- I don't know. Can I come see you?
- I love you.
- Listen, Foster--
- Ursula! I'm naked!
Listen, Foster? You want to get these guys back?
- Yeah!
- I know a way we can get 'em really good.
Yeah, let's get 'em good!
Did you hear that, guys?
Yes, sir.
Okay, I get off work at 10:30.
Meet me at Route 9 and Okeechobee Rod, and don't be late.
- She said, "Okeechobee."
- She's okey-dokey.
She's late.
So, Foster...
- is this your usual meeting spot?
- No.
- Fuckin' shit!
- That was Galikanokus!
Let's get him!
Outta the car!
Goddamn it!
Same shit, different day, huh, Rabbit?
Everybody outta the car!
I said now!
You're all under arrest for stealing a Spurbury police vehicle.
No, Farva, you are under arrest for being a total and complete fuckhead!
Y-You don't want to do this, Rod
We gotta go catch that truck.
Using what?
Super citizen power?
Galikanokus is on that truck!
I'll believe that when me shit turns purple...
- and smells like rainbow sherbet.
- Does it sound like that when I say it?
Farva! You are not stopping me from getting my job back!
Get him, Mac!
- I got a job now.
- You're a local cop.
- You're goddamn right I am!
- You ratted us out!
No, Thorny.
I barely had a job before.
Farva, get the coffee.
Farva, hit the radio.
Farva, clean the cells!
I'm a cop, goddamn it!
I got my own car, now.
I get to bust criminals!
It's what I gotta do!
- You screwed us over.
- No, Thorny.
Okay. Okay, I did!
I did, I did.
- I'm sorry, Rodney.
- Come on, Rod.
- Oh, Thorny!
- No, no, no. Please. Come on.
Listen, listen. This is your big chance.
When we go up there, and we're wrong, no big deal.
But if we’re right, you can be a hero.
Come on. Team Ramrod!
Will you look at that?
- We got 'em, Cap.
- We got 'em, we got 'em!
- Oh.
- Fuckin' Galikanokus!
There's Canadian markings on that plane.
Okay, Foster. You and Rabbit come around in a classic pincer move.
- Mac, I need you to take--
- No, no, no, Thorny. Me and you!
We outflank 'em, and we do, like, a submarine move.
- Team Ramrod?
- Shut up, Farva.
- Farva, you're leaning--
- Wait a minute!
Oh! The locals!
I hate those fuckin' guys!
Goddamn it, you dipshits! If I had my car,
I'd have been in on this bust!
Shh! Rodney! Rodney, get your ass back here!
Here we go again--
What the fuck?
- Oh, did you see that? He kissed that guy!
- Shh!
Holy shit!
God! We should have known.
Sok wait. The local cops are selling
Afghani grass to the Canadians?
Assholes!
- No, Rabbit, it's comin' in from Canada
Canadian grass. Ah!
- Assholes.
- No!
The local mothers are running protection for 'em.
Oh, I guess I'm the asshole.
I'm sorry we didn't wait for you, but--
Listen to me, Foster.
I need to tell you something.
- What, are you guys drunk?
- No!
- Your local buddies are runnin' grass!
- Listen, I know.
I know what they're doing. I've known for awhile.
You know this?
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Are you in on it?
No! They keep me on dispatch. I didn't know what to do when I found out about it.
- I was afraid I'd lose my job.
- Oh.
You should have just told us.
We would have arrested them.
- Yeah, we used to be cops, remember? Shh!
- I remember--
No offense, but the less you guys knew, the less you could screw up.
Oh.
I was trying to stop it without getting brought down.
Th-- That's why I helped you find the reefer, that's why I helped you guys steal the Winnebago... and that's why
I brought you... here tonight.
You didn't do this because you like Foster? Shh!
No, I mean--
I do like Foster, but I--
But you used him.
Yeah, I guess so.
But I really like him now.
Ah!
- This is so good--
- This is kind of awkward.
I hate to break up the "like-fest," but it's prime time for crime-time!
But wait! Hey, hey, hey!
Are you guys kidding? Look at yourselves.
You saw what they did to
Galikanokus's girlfriend.
And you guys are drunk, and unarmed.
Oh, hey, I am sober as a bird.
I am drunk.
- What do you got?
- No guns. They got flares.
And some string.
Oh, Farva, you sad, lonely man.
Ugh.
Oh, wait. He's got your name written on it.
- Oh!
- Ooh.
Chief! Chief Grady! I secured the perimeter, sir.
Farva!
Sorry I missed the call.
Looks like we got 'em. Rock 'n' roll!
What the hell are you doin' here, Farva?
Put that pistol down!
- Qu'est-ce-que c'est ca?
- English!
- Chief!
- Put a bullet in him, Grady.
What the fuck is this?
- Grady?
- Shit, what the fuck is this?
Shoot it!
- That's my car.
- Grady!
- That's my girl!
- Grady!
Smy, Burton, check that out.
- What are ya, drunk?
- Drunk enough to kick your ass.
Let's see what you've got, O'Hagan.

Here we go.
"Dear John..."
"Congratulations are due to you..."
"and your men for your brave, impressive..."
"but most of all unorthodox tactics..."
"in thwarting the drug-smuggling ring..."
"and extreme police corruption."
- Ooh. She loves us.
- All right.
"I cannot stress enough how proud we at the statehouse are of you."
"The great State of Vermont could use more officers like your men."
"As you requested, we have reevaluated the financial situation..."
"regarding your unit."
And we're gonna buy you a tank.
"Due to our tight fiscal situation..."
"we regret to inform you that we are still..."
"going to have to close your station."
"Good luck in Sherburne, John."
"And give your men my best."
"Sincerely..."
Governor Fuckhead.
I did not see that coming.
I told you to bring the handcart.
- Sorry.
- Tilt it.
Oh, goddamn, I remember these things being lighter!
I think I'm gonna drop a nut!
- Shit.
- Hope they like foam.
It's not so bad. Good exercise.
- Cool uniforms.
- Yeah. All the beer you can drink.
I'm into that!
Beer!
- Oh, God.
- You order the keg of St. Anky?
Uh, yeah!
But aren't you guys the Highway Patrol?
Yeah, but our station got shut down, so--
Oh, no shit, man!
Yeah, shit.
This your keg?
Oh, my-my Dad ordered it.
But he's asleep right now.
Keg's here!
Oh, St. Anky!
- Oh, God. No!
- No, no, no!
Hey, man. Hey, bro.
It's cool, man. They got fired!
No shit?
No shit, man!
- All right, all right. Where's the keg go?
- Put it in the rec room, man.
Make room, make room.
What took you guys so long to get here?
What'd you do?
Brew it yourself?
- You're cool, man.
- I am cool.
Check this out. Um, why don't you guys put that, um... over there?
- Move it, move it, move it.
- We want a drink! Come on.
Tap this thing!
Actually, you know what?
I think it's better...
Feng Shui if it’s, uh over there.
Definitely. Definitely better over there.
Oh, wait, wait. Guys Guys.
You know what?
Man, it's probably better for the flow... if you put it back over here.
And don't forget to tap that keg, guys.
Okay, okay. Somebody's gonna need to sign for this... and I need to see some I.D.
Look, you know what?
I don't have any I.D.
But, uh, Abraham Lincoln here, he says that I'm 21 ... and he never told a lie.
Yeah, actually it was George Washington that never told a lie.
You guys drive a hard bargain, but--
Actually, you know what?
Why don't you guys split it?
That was good, man.
- Are you ready for the fun part?
- Oh, yeah.
'Cause here comes the fun part: Spurbury Police!
You're all under arrest!
- Come on back, now.
- Oh, yeah.
All this for a noise complaint?
I love acid--
Cops.
What the crap?
How come nobody called me?
- We're in trouble, aren't we?
- Oh, yeah. You're in big trouble.
And if you really want to choke somebody, you gotta hit the Adam's apple.

 onschuldigen in the eyes god have disappeared.
 we must fear, but not for disappeared people.
 they have trusted god and by Jesus to the sky have been brought.
in Thessalonicenzen stand that the lord with a gil comes to the ground. it is the voice of the archangel, on which the deads will arise. those who live then still will be incorporated by god in the sky...

Wait nou.
Buck, where you go naartoe? - I cannot remain now real.
I must to V.N.to warn Chaim.
Williams, how you want that to do if you do not know truth? say the bible: Trust god, differently are deceived you. you are here not occasional and that weet you.

Finely that you are there. ladies and lords, my excuses for the delay. You will nevertheless sit.
Chaim, seat oneself.
Mr.. Williams, come sit you at our?  
Mr.. Carpathia, no press would be at this meeting.

Mr.. Williams journalistic state of service shows... that he is only interested in truth. and those interest our all.

Nicolae, where it has you? This we have never agreed. in the court of oaths, were there the snake which seduced Eva. that led to the fact that people were repudiated from the paradise. those snakes stand since then between the our and paradise. where this goes for, Carpathia? - This goes for your tweeën. you are snakes that entity and prosperity for you yourselves uses. that is ridiculous, Nicolae.
- Do not lie against me.
I was manipulate this way null and void and this way easily. who is now the marionette, Jonathan?  Look s where I am and where you are.

This becomes entirely painless.
I am no monster.
- Nicolae, alsjeblieft.
I was scared this way then Mr.. Stonagal the weapon of the keeper took away... and then his friends Mr.. Cothren shot. then he afterwards the weapon on itself aimed, everyone had been bewildered. but Jonathan were teased debt feeling and fear. then he heard that Williams would unmask m., was he in order Council. he knew that his boze plans from would come and that his life work... where he had done this way his best on, totals would be destroyed.
I would have wanted do weet that you this for Dirk and Alan. but pers-liaison with blood to his hands are possible I do not have.
I have large plans with your. your tales concerning Stonagal and Cothren transmit GNN at this moment. the complete world finds me quite now.
Everyone will follow me blindly.

I must ervandoor. course but with me.
Nicolae Carpathia showed much courage by making plan this boze confessed. nevertheless give the head of V.N. not for his own security. he promises continue with his peace plans and disarmament. this way lack now we leaderships, are Carpathia the hope for the radelozen. the bible forecasts end up. if the antichrist comes to the power then are this still but the beginning. then become the coming seven years most terrible from the history. our only hopes are meet and god to trust
I do not know also all answers, but is provisional enough the belief.
RUSSIAN ARK
I open my eyes and I see nothing.
I only remember there was some accident.
Everyone ran for safety as best they could.
I just can't remember what happened to me.
How strange. Where am I?
Marie, I must tell you something.
Judging by the clothes, this must be the 1800s.
Where are they rushing to?
What if we are denied entry?
I've never been so frightened!
Don't forget, the girl in white is mine.
Where are you all going?
It's cold! Close the doors!
Quickly!
Move ahead!
I went looking for the right way to go.
Those officers don't know the way.
Can it be that I'm invisible?
Or have I simply gone unnoticed?
Can it be? Has all this been staged for me?
Am I expected to play a role?
What kind of play is this?
Let's hope it's not a tragedy.
What does it all mean?
-Where should we go?
-Maybe here?
No, it's there.
That man in black.... He wanders about, too.
He nods to me but goes away.
Pardon me for speaking before we've been properly introduced.
What city is this?
What city? Well, everyone speaks Russian.
I so hoped this was Chambord during the Directoire period.
-What language are we speaking?
-Russian.
Russian?
How strange! I never knew Russian before.
What are they doing in there?
Shall we enter?
-Where? There?
-Yes, something is going on.
No, I have to find out what on earth I am doing here.
These wanderings about, this knowing Russian....
I want to leave.
Your curiosity is not amusing.
Could all this be theatre?
Farewell!
Our paths must part.
Farewell.
You have answered all my questions.
-Farewell then.
-Where does this door lead to?
What a pity.
We will never meet again.
He was obviously a foreigner.
Why would he be so rude otherwise?
It's best...
not to get involved in this.
Let's not disturb them.
In any case, it's much too late.
Sir, sir! I'm here.
My Russian cicerone! Do you know the way?
-Yes, let's go together.
-This is your country.
Yes, but not my century.
How did I come to be here?
I think I saw Peter the Great.
I hear delight in your voice.
Was it interesting?
Yes, very interesting.
Really.
In Asia, tyrants are adored.
The more terrible the tyrant, the more his memory is cherished.
Alexander the Great, Timur... and your Peter the Great.
You're wrong about Peter.
He taught Russians to enjoy themselves.
A spiral staircase.
Where has everyone disappeared to?
I see. But why?
What's so interesting up there?
You'll see...
Peter ordered his son's execution.
The same man who taught the people to enjoy life. How funny!
I thought you knew where we were going.
He built a European city over a swamp.
He introduced order of the most primitive kind.
-Where are they going?
-But the city is still European!
To a party. But why the back staircase?
They were taught to have fun.
So they go to parties.
And the officer and the lady?
-At the party.
-Where are they?
They've gone to the underworld.
Down, down, down!
And they are no more.
Be careful. The stairs are steep and dark.
Thank you. I can see.
Do you see where we are?
No, I don't know yet.
Sir, be careful!
Don't betray our presence.
No need to remind me.
Do not forget I brought you here.
Please don't get involved in anything.
And you, do not get too close to the actors.
Bend towards me. You are beautiful.
-Do you remember?
-Yes.
Good.
-Why are you pushing me?
-Don't scratch me!
-Why is she pushing me?
-You are pushing, too.
What an impressive orchestra!
They must be Europeans!
No, they're Russian musicians.
No, Europeans!
Italians!
They're Russians, for God's sake!
So?
I say it's good.
Very good!
I need to piss!
I can't hold it in anymore!
No, no, don't, don't....
Ah! Yes, yes.
Sir, sir!
Don't yell!
-Where are you?
-Here. It's only Catherine the Great.
Follow me!
I love the 18th century.
A time of genius and manners.
I would have to agree with you.
-Never contradict me.
-Very well.
Where's the Empress? Gone!
Russia is like a theatre. A theatre.
Careful!
I think I know where we are.
How pretentious they are!
Don't lag behind, sir.
I'm not. I think we're speaking too loudly.
No matter. They're completely deaf.
I'm careful. I won't touch anyone.
Theatre.... What actors!
And those costumes!
Thank you, sirs. Thank you.
They can't see me.
This seems like the Vatican.
Is that where we are?
Those reliefs are painted, are they not?
What naturalism!
Weren't those decorations inspired by Raphael's sketches?
Raphael, yes.
Better than the Vatican.
This is Saint Petersburg.
So they're copies?
Your authorities don't trust your own artists.
Russians are so talented at copying!
Why?
Because you don't have ideas of your own.
Your authorities don't want you to have them.
In fact, they are as lazy as all the rest of you.
Lazy!
There was a painting gallery here.
-On the upper floor.
-With 1 1 1 Italian paintings.
-But not the best masters.
-Not the best.
The tsars were mainly Russophiles.
But sometimes even they dreamed of Italy.
Wasn't the Hermitage created to satisfy those dreams?
-Raphael isn't for you.
-Not for us.
-For Italy.
-Italy.
-It's warm there!
-Warm.
What beauty!
The small Italian gallery....
Who are these people?
Of which milieu are they?
Do you see that vase?
Yes! Empire style is everywhere.
-And those Voronikhine lamps.
-Lamps....
Empire, Empire, Empire!
I have no enthusiasm for it.
That style is too silly.
Don't forget it was born under Bonaparte.
Then it became fashionable here... to the point of becoming the national style... to the detriment of its originality.
We battled Napoleon, not the Empire style.
Who are they? Who are these people?
Petersburgers, of when the city was no longer a capital.
It's better that way.
A capital city should be... an ancient city like Moscow. Not a Chimera.
-Who are these people?
-Should I introduce you?
-Only if it's not impolite.
-No, they are friends.
Oleg Konstantinovich, medical professor.
Lev Mikhailovich, actor.
Shouldn't they rise?
My European friend, he is visiting Russia.
-My pleasure.
-He's European.
Medicine is a fine profession.
I haven't spoken for years.
Aside from my new accomplice.
Such a long time.... What is that odour?
Odour?
A curious odour.
Have you been in Saint Petersburg long?
Yes, for one hour.
-And you came straight here?
-I had my reasons.
You must love art!
Are you interested in beauty or just its representation?
No, Marquis. We're here to rest.
"Marquis"?
How do you rest?
Today, we've come together.
It smells of formaldehyde.
Formaldehyde.
Marquis, I'll show you a splendid painting.
These men are emitting a very strange odour.
Marquis, look at
The Birth of John the Baptist.
The Marquis smells of formaldehyde.
Is he alive?
No, it's you.
I know this painting.
I saw it on my last visit here.
It comes from Paris, from the Crozat collection.
Catherine II acquired it in 1 772.
One of the earliest pieces of the Hermitage collection.
Such information is for specialists.
For us, detail is more interesting.
Look closely here.
A chicken and a cat are in the foreground.
They are symbolic figures.
The chicken represents greed, avarice... the cat, cynicism and cruelty.
Cynicism and cruelty.... The cat....
They are both calmed by the birth of John.
How interesting.
Why is he dressed like that?
Cleopatra, for example....
What do you know of her?
Massimo Stanzione....
Cleopatra is on the same wall...
as The Circumcision of Christ by the pious Lodovico Cardi.
-What bothers you?
-Bothers me?
Right next to Saint Cecilia?
Can you imagine!
By Carlo Dolci!
And next to Eastern Still Life!
-Why does that bother you?
-Don't argue, Oleg.
As a Catholic, that shocks me.
What do you think of Wagner?
Who is Wagner?
Oleg, he doesn't know Wagner!
Wagner is that child who behaved badly... with my best friend, Meyerbeer.
I have never listened to Wagner.
-Broaden your horizons!
-That doctor is so insistent!
-But I'm not sick!
-We wish you much success.
Sir, why are they badly dressed?
My friends, how could I think...
that you would get along so badly?
I'll tell you one day.
I'm in a strange situation.
Why quarrel with everyone?
If you do, we will never discover why we are here.
Such clothing kills a man's creative essence!
Why do you find it necessary to embrace European culture?
For what reason?
Why borrow also Europe's mistakes?
My God! What is all this?
Mother!
Canova!
What an elevated approach to art!
What feel for the material!
How wonderful!
He is a true heir to the masters of antiquity!
Canova almost married my mother.
Was your mother a sculptress?
Yes. In Rome.
In Rome? Your mother, a sculptress....
In this Canova collection, there are even sculptures...
that Tsar Alexander bought from the wife....
Of Napoleon?
Yes.
It was 1815, I was at the Congress of Vienna.
What were you doing there?
-I was a diplomat.
-A diplomat?
This collection was the object of a harsh dispute.
Look where we are now!
Is this a dream?
Maybe, maybe.
I don't know about you, but I'm wide awake!
It's amazing how well I speak Russian!
Yes, quite well.
Who was that small man?
Wasn't that Pushkin?
-Good day.
-Good day.
Is that your great poet? Your beloved one?
I read him in French. Nothing special.
Sir.
My God, how touchy you are!
Pardon me!
I'm sorry if I've offended your nationalist sympathy.
What is that, nationalist sympathy?
What's that there?
-Please....
-Who is that?
Please don't rush.
All alone, without an escort?
It would be wiser not to talk to that lady.
Don't bother her.
Let's move along.
Excuse me, madam, have you lost your guide?
Thank you for your concern.
I know everything here.
Of course. Do you work here?
Not at all. I'm here to admire the works of the old masters.
Would you accompany me into the next salon?
To see the Flemish masters?
With pleasure. Your slender fingers see all.
-1 40 paces, straight ahead.
-1 40, is that so?
How many are left?
Watch your step.
-One cannot be so intrusive, I told you.
-It's not the right time for this.
It's all your fault.
-You are compromising me!
-Oh, don't.
How dare you! Quiet!
-We're here.
-Yes.
Can we go closer to that painting?
Would you like me to tell you about it?
The Virgin with Partridges by van Dyck.
Catherine II acquired it.
Tell me about this painting.
Please, tell me.
See the calm and serenity around the Madonna and Joseph.
-Joseph, yes.
-God protects them.
There is no doubt about his unseen presence.
The apple tree represents life.
Sunflowers stand for piety.
On the upper right, partridges symbolise frivolity.
-They're flying away.
-Partridges....
Angels dance and play.
So many other symbols that we can only guess about.
Sir, leave her. She's an angel.
Why have you gone quiet?
The partridges, the children, the Madonna....
Thank you, madam. Thank you.
I highly value your opinion on the works of van Dyck.
You'll definitely be interested in another painting.
Be very careful!
A Rubens.
Sir, do not disturb me!
The Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee.
The Pharisee....
I don't see it.
Where is it?
Thirty-six, thirty-five....
No, that painting isn't here.
Not part of the Tsar's collection.
Yes, it's here.
That particular Rubens is not here!
Yes, it was from Lord Walpole's collection...
like The Virgin with Partridges.
But that Rubens isn't on exhibit.
But it's here.
-Where are you?
-What a wonderful scent!
The scent of oils....
Sir, let's leave here now.
No, let's stay a while.
What wonderful paintings!
What are those men counting?
You were right. I found it.
Let's take a closer look.
There it is.
We're almost there.
Face the painting directly.
There it is.
Yes, there it is.
-Something to say about Rubens?
-Van Dyck.
Rubens considered van Dyck to be his best pupil.
You know, there was a time when all these paintings... were placed much higher and much closer to one another.
The Tsar himself supervised how they were hung. Did you know this?
-Who are you?
-I'm a sailor.
-Insignias.
-Yes, the Navy.
The Tsar visited his collection every morning.
He personally saved all this... during the fire.
-Which fire?
-In 18....
So you are asking me?
Enough, let's go.
It's time for me to go.
May I accompany you?
What a pity.
I must ask you to leave.
The museum is closing.
Please see yourself to the exit.
Quiet. Close the door.
The museum is closing.
-How was my scene?
-I wasn't impressed.
I was joking.
Joking....
-Do you hear music?
-I hear something.
Russian music makes me break out in hives.
That has nothing to do with the music.
Why do you look at me like that?
-Rags.... A dog....
-Rags.... A dog....
-Eternal people....
-Eternal people....
Live and go on living.
-You'll outlive them all.
-Eternal people....
What are you doing? Eavesdropping?
Are you interested in painting?
What nice little hands!
Stay away from me!
Amen. Amen.
-Beautiful, isn't it?
-Absolutely.
-Are you Catholic?
-No, I'm not Catholic.
Why do you ask?
It seemed to me that you were deep in thought... while admiring the images of the founders of our church.
I don't know. I wasn't thinking about that.
You were not....
Do you know that those are the apostles Peter and Paul?
Yes, that's what I heard.
That's what you heard. And so?
I looked at them because I like them.
You like them....
-One day, all men...
-All men....
-...will become like them.
-Really?
How can you know what will become of people...
if you don't know the Scriptures?
Why aren't you saying anything?
Look at their hands.
The hands are beautiful. And so?
How can you know what will become of people...
if you don't know the Scriptures?
For you, they're just two dusty old men.
-Just flesh.
-They're covered with dust... from their long road to appear in this painting.
-What happened?
-They are good and wise.
How can you know their character... if you have not read the Gospels?
How can you know all that?
Sir, why are you frightening him?
He was already afraid.
He's not afraid.
These people are never afraid.
Leave him alone.
Better to appreciate the scent of the paintings.
-It smells good.
-Very good.
You need not fear.
So strange to hear those words.
Now I understand. We're in the gallery.
Yes...
I understand.
We're in the Tsar's gallery... near the portrait of a medieval fanatic.
Where have we wandered to?
That music was good, after all.
Who was the composer?
-Glinka.
-Who is he? A German?
A Russian.
No, he's German.
All composers are German.
All composers are German?
EI Greco.
Very nice.
Looks like a Rembrandt.
EI Greco.... Dust from the roads.
What dust from the roads?
Nice, very nice.
-Something you don't like?
-Not at all.
-It's nice, very nice.
-Nice....
More flesh.... Very nice.
These are nice paintings.
Nice paintings....
They're getting better and better.
There's an angel.
Pardon me for addressing you without an introduction.
To whom was that directed?
Do tell.
-I'm speaking to the painting.
-You are speaking to the painting?
How interesting!
-I must speak my mind.
-Speak your mind?
And so you talk to the painting.
Would you like to try?
Must I try? Very well.
-Like that.
-Like this?
Now, like this.
Now a turn.
Sometimes I prefer speaking to myself.
This painting and I... we have a secret.
Really?
-Yes.
-Now it's over.
That's all, gentlemen. Good-bye!
Where are you going, madam?
She's offended. She has left.
Hi!
Good-bye!
Farewell, gentleman!
How charming!
She's offended. But so charming!
Where has she gone?
Marble... a white stone... very white.
Rather cold, isn't it?
When you first came here, it must have been disastrous.
That was just after the fire.
I have been here before, but it's as if I have not.
What luxury!
What is that?
It's under the Convention that everything was devastated.
You don't know
20th-century Russian history.
Our Convention lasted 80 years.
A real revolution.... Very sad.
What kind of system is there now?
A republic?
I don't know.
I have never believed that a republic was suitable... for a country as large as Russia.
You Europeans are democrats who mourn the monarchy.
-You are French, is that it?
-Who are you?
Excuse us, we're lost.
-Please be on your way.
-Let us live! Let us live!
-Remaining here is forbidden!
-Help us, please.
Who forbids it? What is forbidden?
What language! Everything is forbidden!
It's better not to argue.
We're going, we're going.
I know where we can hide.
I suddenly feel afraid.
I don't like military uniforms.
-Not that door, sir!
-But I like it.
-Such a beautiful door!
-No, not that one!
Why is it so cold?
I told you not to enter.
What cold! Frames.... But where are....
Where are the canvases?
Let's go back, I beg you.
-Who's there?
-It's me.
-Why have you come here?
-I don't know. I simply entered.
-Come closer.
-I'm coming.
Maybe you need help, kind sir.
Who is the "kind sir"?
Me.... You....
Not here, not there.
There is no one.
Only coffins and corpses. Come and see.
-I'm coming.
-That's my coffin.
-Your coffin?
-Yes, I made it myself.
Why that strange tone, kind sir?
Why coffins in the Hermitage?
"Kind sir"!
-It's my coffin.
-Yes, it is yours.
-He looks well-fed!
-But where are the corpses?
Why do you ask "where"?
Don't step on the corpses.
He looks well-fed!
You stepped on the corpses!
-What happened?
-The war.
Which war? Against whom?
-Against Germany.
-What is Germany?
The unified state of the Germans.
In the 20th century,
Russia was at war with Germany.
The Germans surrounded the city.
But the city did not surrender.
More than 1 million dead.
-More than 1 million?
-Yes.
That's a high price to pay. Very high.
Saint Petersburg and the Hermitage paid dearly.
In Russia, it is said that freedom knows no price.
A very high price.
But maybe not.
But it has already been paid.
I was wrong, by the way... when I criticised your tsars... for all this beauty and opulence.
Even if they all were... tyrants.
Quieter, please.
But it is beautiful, isn't it?
What do you see? Who is it?
Maybe Catherine II, but I'm not certain.
Nothing could be less certain.
That's enough! Lisa, take away the children.
Don't go too near to her.
If it is Catherine, she has a sixth sense....
Like this.
Lower, lower!
That will be all.
The candles, the candles.
It's stuffy in here.
-There.
-No, I won't let you.
That's it.
But it's cold outside.
That's it.
Sir!
Where are you?
I hear your footsteps. Where are you?
Mortals must not chase royalty.
You won't catch up anyway.
I hear your footsteps.
I hear them.
Sir, what are you doing? It's cold!
-Come this way.
-Yes, it's cold.
-She disappeared.
-I know.
-She disappeared again.
-Move aside.
-Do you know where to go?
-Help us. Come.
Let us through. We are allowed.
Where is the door? Where is it?
Greetings!
Don't be shy. Come. We will not stay long.
Thank you very much.
A new hairstyle is necessary.
What beautiful hair you have! Those curls!
Tea! Would you like tea?
I don't either, but they insist.
Where is the tea?
We're in a hurry. Where is it?
-I know I'm beautiful.
-Too beautiful.
What do you want me to say?
-Come on!
-I have nothing to say!
What is that?
-Did you write this book?
-Not me. He did.
Neither he nor I. But he will dedicate it.
Follow me.
Sir, what are you looking at?
Shall we continue?
What do I see? Nothing for the moment.
Some people are obviously waiting for something.
Let's proceed with caution.
These madmen could eat you.
They liked your hair.
Of course, good writers always have beautiful hair.
-Be more careful and quiet now.
-I'm following you.
-Close the door quickly.
-It's done.
When I was last received here at the Winter Palace... it was being renovated after the terrible fire.
-The parquet doesn't creak.
-It doesn't creak....
-The ambassador of Persia!
-Excuse us for being late.
Sir, let's go.
The ambassador of His Highness the Shah...
Prince Khozrev-Mirza... the son of the future Shah, with his entourage.
-Do you know what is happening?
-Not yet.
We are witnesses.
Nicholas I received an apology from the Persian emissaries... regarding the murder of Russian diplomats.
Griboedov was one, I think.
How interesting.
Are you able to see?
What uniforms!
Luxury, empire...
power....
Look over there. Higher.
Can you see?
Yes, I see now!
One must not trust this world. You are right.
Beware, court officials are cunning.
Some of them are mediums.
They could sense your presence.
Thank you for your advice.
We Gemini are curious by nature.
I'll move ahead.
Maybe I'll meet old acquaintances.
Good luck. I'll find you later.
Mighty Sovereign Emperor!
The peaceful nature of Persia and the sacred union that exists... among His Majesty and the Shah were both upset by evil.
Under its power, a frenzied Tehran crowd... committed unheard-of acts of evil.
The resulting victim was the Russian mission.
The honest heart of Fetkh-Ali-Shah... was horrified by the idea that a handful of wrongdoers... might destroy our peace and union.
His Majesty the Shah has sent me, his grandson... to request that you, Sovereign... erase from memory this event.
Let the world know that, despite this terrible event... two wise monarchs, with their infinite wisdom... speak openly and vanquish all suspicion.
With the greatest joy, I stand before you...
Your Imperial Majesty.
I carry out my grandfather's will... that we strengthen peace... between our two peoples.
His Imperial Majesty... commands me to assure Your Excellence... of his pleasure at hearing your explanation... as well as the righteous plea... of your sovereign.
I've been observing you. Who let you enter?
-You have no business here.
-That's correct.
Then you must leave at once.
Off you go, sir! Away!
-I had no intention of staying.
-Away!
This ceremony will continue for a few more hours still.
As a former diplomat, I'm aware of that.
A terrible boredom will set in. Terrible!
Leave me alone!
-And what is that?
-What did you say?
I adore luxury and regal splendour.
Stasov wasn't a bad architect.
He loved discipline, but left space for breathing.
We cannot stay here.
The ceremony will finish.
Then they will all come in.
My God!
Sevres porcelain, my weakness!
-Beautiful.
-Yes, yes!
-Inimitable!
-Beautiful.
This is the cameo service?
Yes, it is.
Not so close, please.
What gold!
Sir, it's awkward setting the table with you here.
You can admire it later when you are seated.
Please do go away.
What pure tones!
The blue and gold are enchanting.
And the wine-sediment colour!
AIways such marvellous cooks here in the Winter Palace.
Do you recall the taste of food?
No, I have forgotten.
You've forgotten....
Visit the other salons while waiting for the dinner bell.
-That blue!
-Please, sir.
There's dancing. Come on.
Let's leave here.
-We're being chased away.
-Chased away....
It's so dark here.
Heavens!
I see you have never seen a tsar... nor grand princes in all their magnificence.
-Monarchy is not eternal.
-As if I didn't know....
Don't I have the right to dream a little?
We are free, you and I. Dream away.
There's someone here. Do you hear voices?
Sir, don't you hear them?
No, I don't hear anything.
Look, someone is moving there.
Where?
Mr. Orbeli, I don't understand.
What has upset you so?
You and my father know:
No insect can harm this throne.
-It's made of silver and treated oak.
-It's not the throne.
I'm very worried.
See that velour from Lyons.
It's completely worn out.
-We'll restore it. Be patient.
-You don't have the time.
You're right, Boris.
We don't have time either.
You won't ever see him again.
Speak!
He's your son.
What difficulty are they having?
They seem uncomfortable with each other.
What do you expect?
You descend from the heavens... and no longer know how to behave.
Your son is Hermitage director.
Like you and I before him.
The wars ahead.... Terrible wars.
But we managed to preserve all this through the catastrophes.
I can't hear anymore.
And you?
Yes, I hear. But not very clearly.
What are they saying?
The elder Piotrovsky is asking...
whether the director's telephone is still under surveillance.
His son tells him, "Forget that."
"I would prefer telling you about the Hermitage cats."
"They are still here...."
There are so many people that I wasn't able to help.
Ten years have passed.
You know what I'm referring to.
But everyone speaks well of you.
Your books are still in print.
Those of Mr. Orbeli, too.
That's particularly admirable.
The dead weep with joy when their books are reprinted.
Especially 37 years later, Mikhail.
Is something still troubling you?
Is it the authorities?
They want acorns from oak trees.
They are not interested in knowing how to nurture the tree of culture.
But it will be their doom if the tree falls.
Then there will be nothing left.
Can't they understand that?
Mr. Orbeli, what awaits us?
-I'm coming!
-Speak!
-Listen, Mikhail....
-Let him go.
You're completely alone.
They won't tell him anything.
I know, ask me!
I am asking you....
Everyone can see the future... but no one remembers the past.
Look how handsome they are!
Such fine young men!
Beautiful uniforms, even if I don't like the military.
You didn't answer my question.
Nothing, you know nothing.
Sir! Wait!
He doesn't hear me.
I must apologise.
They said other things.
I could hardly hear them.
I made it all up, about Orbeli....
About Piotrovsky, too.
-Only God can judge you.
-I made it all up.
We are free, you and I. You said it yourself!
Please, don't run.
Run! I can't keep up with you.
Little birds.
Children!
Anastasia, where are you going?
They are... so light!
You're always watching me.
I have a bad feeling.
Don't be alarmed.
Pray. And I shall pray for you.
Did you hear that?
-Did you hear shots?
-Calm down. God is with you.
I think someone is following us.
Calm down, Alexandra.
If only Alexis could run....
Doctors are good for nothing.
There is no hope.
It's my fault.
Children!
Children, behave yourselves!
Sorry, excuse us.
Come here, Anastasia. Where were you?
I looked for you all morning.
We were playing.
Let's go.
Where is Alexis?
-Thank you, I can manage.
-Of course.
-Are you in pain?
-I'm fine, Mother.
Move your chair forward.
You are late for tea.
Forgive me.
What do you think? Shall we forgive her?
Anastasia won't do it again.
It looks like it's not your fault.
Good-bye.
Fly away, my little angels!
And here's their cage.
They're all here, of course.
There haven't been so many guests for a long time.
Good evening.
Look at that strange fellow.
But...
where has my European gone?
Where is he?
There he is!
He doesn't see me.
I should go up to him.
Otherwise he will be offended.
Sir! He can't hear me.
But I'll see him later.
Wouldn't it be nice to jump about like that?
You know...
Aristarkh Konstantinovich is being sent to Africa.
What a tiger! He could eat anyone!
Your mother has trained the servants well.
Don't be shy! You are doing very well.
The most important for the mazurka is....
You are doing great.
Thank you.
Saint Petersburg has the best balls in Europe.
Everyone is so easygoing.
Like one big family.
There must be over 3,000 people.
Maybe less.
I've forgotten everything!
I dance so poorly! I've forgotten everything!
But it's all coming back to me!
Good, very good!
Bravo! More! More!
Where were you? I lost you.
I'm here.
I lost you.
Lost....
I'm sad.
Let's go.
To where?
Where? Forward.
Forward....
What will we find over there?
Over there? I don't know.
I'm staying.
Farewell, Europe.
It's over.
You might say I grew up here.
But I'm not quite myself.
It's as if I were in someone else's house.
Listen up! Look here!
Poor man, your lady has gone away!
-Flown away like a bird!
-Gone....
In a flash!
Shall we dine together?
I'll wait downstairs. Bring up the coach.
Have our coats brought up.
And don't lose them!
When we return to Kursk, we must organise a ball.
Just before Lent, for example.
I think we should invite your nephew as well as Varenka. Let him see.
Nathalie!
It feels like we're floating.
It seems all this is but a dream.
But you have found her!
Nothing has happened!
Custine!
Let me pass!
Sir, sir....
It's a pity you're not here with me.
You would understand everything.
Look.
The sea is all around.
We are destined to sail forever.
To live forever.
- Ally, can we get a recap?
- You remember the Kowolskis.
They've owned this shop for 30 years, and they are attempting to set a record... by making Buffalo's largest cookie, and you have to wear this.
- A hair net?
- Health department.
- You're kidding me.
- If you're working around the cookie...
 you have to have it on.
It's the law.
I just did the hair.
The hair is perfect.
All right. Give it to me.
God, why do you hate me?
We're rolling.
And speed.
For three decades, the
Kowolski family bakery... has been a mainstay in downtown Buffalo... known for their sinfully sweet, cream-filled Polski pierogis... and the occasional sugar-induced coma that follows.
But today, in honor of their 30th anniversary, they've invited us to ride along as they go for the record... on Buffalo's biggest cookie.
Vol. Vol?
You need a tissue or something?
Can we get Vol a tissue or a spoon?
It's a good thing we're wearing these today,
'cause I wouldn't want any stray hairs... to fall into the booger.
- Are we gonna do this again?
- No. We can cut to B-roll.
Moving on!
So tell me, Mama.
Why make Buffalo's biggest cookie?
Well... man from health department say he find rat pellet in our pastry but I say "No. Is big chocolate sprinkle." But he shut store down.
So we clean up, make big cookie... for to bring customers back.
Well, I admire your candor.
Let's try that again, shall we?
So tell me, Mama. Why make
Buffalo's biggest cookie?
So the children of the neighborhood will be happy?
That's right. It must be wonderful seeing the smiles on their little faces.
I work in back. I see no smiles.
The previous Buffalo record was eight feet, seven inches, baked by Gladys Pelsnick.
If this cookie beats Gladys's, it will prove once and for all... that the Kowolskis have much more free time.
And the cookie is...
10 feet, four inches.
We have a new record!
Cue the cheesy inspirational music!
But what are we really looking at here?
Is it just a big cookie, or does this cookie represent the pride of Buffalo, its dedicated and hardworking citizens the key ingredient... with a few nuts thrown in... and, finally, the love of our families, which provides the warm, chewy center, making our beloved Buffalo the sweetest place to live.
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.
I'm Bruce Nolan, Eyewitness News.
And cut it.
So, what do you think?
- I think it's really good.
- It sucks.
It's a story about a cookie.
The Pillsbury Doughboy will be riveted.
Honey, it was funny. It made me laugh.
There's nothing wrong with makin' people laugh.
I'll never be an anchorman, not with this.
The job's right there, but I can't reach it, because every time they make me do this kinda stuff,
I have to act like a total goof in order to make it work.
I have no credibility. Not good. Not good.
- Ok, you know what? Now you're just sounding silly.
- You know what? Forget it.
It's not important, right? It's not important.
- Let's watch it one more time.
- Oh, no.
- Just once more. Please?
- No.
No. Bruce, you promised that you would help me with this photo album.
Now, you get your goofy butt over here.
Okay.
Okay. Okay. Now, you just go through this stack, and you pick your favorites.
Oh, come on. This is fun.
Right? Isn't this fun?
This is nice.
Evan's gonna get that anchor job.
I just know it.
- Oh, Bruce!
- He's the favorite.
All right. You know what? Just forget it. Let's just forget it.
This is just our life. We can always just have some kid do it for us.
Whoa! Hold the phone! I like this one.
Our weekend at the lake.
How did you get that? That's supposed to be in our private stash.
- You look perky, hon. It must've been cold.
- All right. Just give it to me.
I think I'll put this on my computer and use it as wallpaper.
- Okay. Give it to me. Come on!
- Hey, hey. No, no, no.
All right. Fine. Do with it what you will. I don't care.
- I will do with it what I will.
- Jesus.
You know, I might even send this in to Playboy.
- I hear their layouts can be quite tasteful.
- Give that to me right now!
Sweetie? Time to get up.
Uh-uh.
Good dream. No. Uh-uh. No.
Well, the Buffalo Sabres lost again last night...
at the hands of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
- It was a shootout on the ice for our hometown...
- Of course they did. They're my team.
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.
You know, I think there might be something to this cookie line.
All the greatest anchors have had their own signature sign-off.
Like Wal-ter Cron-kite.
And that's the way it was.
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.
And that's the way, uh-huh, uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Oh, no. Grace, the dog!
I'm in the shower!
No, Sam! Bad dog!
Inside, bad. Outside, good.
Inside, bad. Outside, good.
Oh, you're done now.
Great.
B-E-A-utiful.
Come on. Let's go back inside and have a shit.
- What is the deal-io?
- We are having a blood drive.
Creepy. Needles. Yuck.
Well, they need my blood.
I have a very rare blood type.
- I'm A.B.-Positive.
- Really?
I'm I.B.-Positive.
I be positive they ain't touchin' me with no needle. It's just so...
- Helpful and lifesaving?
- No. It's your blood. It's blood.
Blood's supposed to stay inside the body. That's where it's meant to be.
Besides, they stockpile this stuff in a warehouse somewhere.
It's all frozen on ice, and they tell everybody there's a shortage.
That's just not true.
Where did you hear that?
From a very reliable friend of a friend of a girl... whose sister's going out with someone very high up in the government.
But for your own protection,
I cannot discuss it at this time.
- Now, get out before they see us together.
- Oh, no.
Oh. Here. Hold on a second.
You need these more than I do.
- What is these?
- Prayer beads.
The kids made 'em for me.
They will keep you safe.
I hope they're powerful. I'm gonna need a friggin' miracle to get to work on time.
This isn't happening. Not now.
Not during sweeps week.
Not during sweeps week!
Oh, God.
Yeah. Yeah. Meeting's started without me.
This is my luck. This is my luck!
Shit.
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!
Jesus.
 Get out of there!
"Are you blind?"
 No, but I'm late.
Is your child in dire jeopardy?
- Find out tonight after the game.
- Okay. Promos are approved.
Uh, Jack, shouldn't we be focusing on Pete's retirement?
- I mean, this is his last week.
- Yeah, Jack. Any word on the open anchor position?
Evan, when I know something, you'll know something.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was...
Did you guys already play the spots? It's a nice story, Bruce, but we're gonna go with Evan's piece... sex scandal in the mayor's office... for sweeps.
Oh, yeah. Sweeps.
And that's the way the cookie crumbles.
I'm just messing with you, Bruce.
See, you just gotta remember that the newsroom... is like a big cookie.
- Do you like jazz, Evan?
- Yeah.
Let me play something for ya.
- I can hold that note all day, buddy.
- Knock it off, guys.
Bruce, we're gonna keep your story in reserve. Now, can we get back to the board... so we'll have something to put on the air today?
Great choice, Jack. This is the Cadillac of bolognas.
- Okay. Thanks.
- Jack, can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah. Sure, Bruce. What do you need?
- Sweeps.
Jack! Hear me out here.
I'm startin' to get desperate, man. I'm pushin' 40, and what have I got to show for it?
I've hit some kind of a ceiling here. There's an anti-Bruce barrier I can't get past.
And Evan is lovin' it, by the way.
Lovin' it. He gets the stories. He gets on sweeps. Maybe I should be more like Evan.
You don't wanna be like
Evan. Evan's an asshole.
- I can be an asshole.
- No, Bruce. You can't.
- You gonna pick that up?
- Yeah. I'm sorry. It's...
I'm losin' it. It's just this whole anchor thing opening up has got me nuts.
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Susan.
 Hi, Jack.
Look, Bruce. You're a good reporter. You make people laugh.
All right. I'll tell you what. Today is the
156th anniversary of the Maid of the Mist.
- I want you at Niagara Falls in an hour.
- Maid of the Mist?
- That's always live.
- Mm-hmm.
- But Evan always does live feeds.
- Now you and Evan get the live feeds.
- I'm going live? During sweeps?
- But watch your step, Bruce.
- I've seen your outtakes.
- Jack, you will not regret this.
And I won't forget you when
I go national. Uh, can you...
Thanks, pal.
Can I have your wish now?
I'm gonna put it in the wish jar. Thank you.
- Okay. Put your wish in there.
- Me too.
Put your wish in there.
Look at that. Looks like a big wish.
Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Martin, don't... don't eat that. Don't eat that.
Don't put that in your mouth.
That's paste, honey. Ooh.
- That must've tasted awful.
- Mommy!
Oh, Zoe-Baboey! Did you have a good time with Aunt Crazy today?
Mm-hmm. Yeah? See how nice this is? Baby on the hip?
Oh, it's amazing. You've become
Mom. The transformation is complete.
I'll get it.
- Small Wonders Day Care.
- Grace?
No. It's Debbie, the sister whose life you're not wasting.
- Oh, all right. Okay, okay, okay.
- Bye, Debbie!
Oops. Hi. Hi. Sorry.
Debbie forgot to take her meds today. Where are ya?
Oh, a little place called the winner's circle. I'm at the falls doing a live report.
- Live? That's great!
- Yeah! It's happening, hon. I got sweeps, and I'm live.
You know what that means? They're seein' if I can think on my feet, you know, like I might have to do in a live news anchor situation.
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah. It's what we've always talked about, Grace.
- Jack practically came out and told me.
- Practically?
Well, he didn't spell it out, but legally, he can't.
But this is exactly what happened to Susan
Ortega just before they bumped her up to the desk.
It's good. It's good.
It's good.
Okay. Well, honey, I just don't... I don't want you to get too ahead of yourself.
Bruce? Oh, I gotta go.
They're callin' me in.
Oh. Okay, honey. Good luck. I love you.
Love, love, love, love, love.
Let's do it.
- They want you close to the falls.
- Really?
- I'm gonna get soaked.
- That's the point. They want you to put this on.
Part of the condition of us getting the exclusive.
You know what? Nothin' can bother me today. Nothin'.
Okay. Now, remember. It's their
156th-year anniversary.
- 149 capacity.
- Right.
- They cater to tourists, honeymooners...
- And people who are insanely thirsty.
- I get it.
- Okay.
And you are gonna be interviewing Irene Dansfield.
Irene! Pleasure to meet you. Truly.
- You look beautiful.
- Irene's mother rode on the maiden voyage.
- Wow. Rub that in my face, why don't ya?
- Ninety seconds!
Ninety seconds? Holy hell. Uh, yeah. Okay. Ninety seconds? Whoo.
Because of the fast response, the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without incident.
- Susan?
- Bruce Nolan is standing by at Niagara Falls, but before we go live to Bruce, we have an announcement to make.
As everyone knows, after 33 years, our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.
Pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill,
But the show must go on, and we could think of no one better... than our very own...
Evan Baxter.
Ohh... Oh, boy.
- Congratulations, Evan.
- Thanks, Susan. I'm thrilled and honored.
And as you said, no one can replace the great Pete Fineman, but I will do my best.
I have to say, I am so proud to be a part of our local community of Buffalo, and I think, in a lot of ways, a great city is like a great recipe, really.
You take hardworking citizens, add some caregivers, maybe a few nuts,
All sprinkled with the love and support of our good families.
Ultimately, that makes one sweet place to live.
- That was amazing.
- I meant it.
- I wish I'd written something.
- And now let's go live... to that wacky Bruce Nolan out at Niagara Falls.
Hey! Wacky Bruce!
Bruce? Talk, Bruce. Hello?
Talk, honey. Talk.
- What's going on?
- We got a Walt Disney.
- He's frozen solid.
- We may not have audio. Check the feed
- We may be having a bit of technical difficulty.
- Feed's good, Jack.
Move. Come on. Come on. Come on. Talk, Bruce, damn it!
All right. Get ready to pull the plug.
Oh Come on, baby. Say something.
Say something.
Bruce, talk.
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, thank you, God.
Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of the Mist in fabulous Niagara Falls, New York.
First off, let me just add another congratulations to Evan Backstabber...
Pardon me. Bastard.
Baxter, rather.
It is good to see what someone with real talent can do... when great opportunities are given to them instead of me.
Anyway, I'm here with
Katharine Hepburn's mom.
Tell me. Why did you throw the blue Heart of the Ocean jewel over the railing of the Titanic?
Did you feel bad at all letting Leo DiCaprio drown while you were safe, floating on the big door?
Could you have taken turns, or were you just too afraid to freeze your big, fat ass off?
I guess that's how life is, isn't it?
Some people are drenched, freezing to death on a stupid boat... with a stupid hat, while others are in a comfy news studio, suckin' up all the glory.
Oh, well. No big deal.
Oh, look. It's the owner of the Maid of the Mist.
Let's have a talk with him, shall we?
- Come on in here, Bill.
- That's all right.
No, no, no, no. No, no.
Come on. Let's have a talk.
Come on. What are you doing?
Bill, you've been running the Maid of the Mist for 23 years, now tell me.
- Why do you think I didn't get the anchor job?
- Hey, man. I don't want any problems.
Is it my hair, Bill?
Are my teeth not white enough?
Or like the great falls, is the bedrock of my life... eroding beneath me?
Eroding! Eroding! Eroding!
Cut the feed. Go to black.
- Go to black.
- I'm on it.
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness
News. Back to you, fuckers!
Oh, my God.
That is perfect. That is the motivation that I needed!
Right there! Thank you.
Thank you, W.K.B.W!
Wimpy Kitty Baby Whiners!
That's what that stands for!
I'll see you on Channel 5, where they do the real news.
Do I look blind to you? Do I look blind to you?
- Hey.
- Let's go, man. Come on. Let's go.
What are you doing over there?
Come on. Leave the poor guy alone.
You okay, man?
Yeah, you better keep walkin'.
What? What'd you say, ese?
Run, man! Run! Oh, God!
Okay, okay, okay! I didn't mean it! I was just kiddin'!
Hey, you forgot your things.
Say somethin' to that. Say somethin'.
B-E-A... utiful.
That's what I get...
That's what I get for trying to help someone.
Oh, don't look at me, Walter.
Oh, no!
Well, that's my payment, I guess.
That... That is my reward.
Just? Just get a clue!
- Oh thank God you're all right.
- God, yeah. Let's thank God, shall we?
For his blessings are raining down upon me.
- Wait! That's not rain!
- Bruce, please don't do that, honey.
You know that everything happens for a reason.
That I don't need. That is a cliche. That is not helpful to me.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
I have no bird. I have no bush.
God has taken my bird and my bush.
Oh, I see. So God is picking on you, is that what you're saying?
No. He's ignoring me completely.
He's far too busy giving Evan everything he wants.
Oh, that's great, Sam, but you missed your target. I'm over here!
Don't get mad at the dog.
It's not the dog's fault.
No. It's God's fault. I gave him the wrong coordinates.
All right. You know what? Enough. All right? Will you stop being such a martyr?
I am not being a martyr. I'm a victim.
God is a mean kid sitting on an anthill with a magnifying glass, and I'm the ant.
He could fix my life in five minutes if he wanted to, but he'd rather burn off my feelers and watch me squirm!
Sweetheart, I know you're mad. It's completely understandable.
What Evan did is slimy and wrong, but this day could've been so much worse.
- I'm just glad you're okay.
- Okay? News flash! I'm not okay.
I'm not okay with a mediocre job! I'm not okay with a mediocre apartment.
I'm not okay with a mediocre life!
So is that what you think that we have? A mediocre life?
- Don't make this about you.
- About me? How could I make this about me?
It's about you! It's always about you!
Perfect. Perfect.
I'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt, please!
Okay, God. You want me to talk to you?
Then talk back. Tell me what's going on.
What should I do? Give me a signal.
Oh, I need your guidance,
Lord. Please send me a sign.
Ah, what's this joker doin' now?
Okay. All right. I'll try it your way.
All right. Lord, I need a miracle.
I'm desperate. I need your help, Lord.
Please reach into my life. Hey!
What the he... I got ya!
Fine! The gloves are off, pal!
Come on! Let me see a little wrath.
Smite me, Oh mighty smiter!
You're the one who should be fired!
The only one around here not doing his job is you!
Answer me!
Sorry. Don't know ya.
Wouldn't call you if I did.
Ohh.
Oh, God. Ohh.
Hello 555 0123.
Oh, no!
Sam, this has gotta stop.
All right. Now, get it straight here.
That's the house. This is the bathroom. House. Bathroom.
Bathroom. House. House.
Bathroom. Bathroom. House.
What's the point?
Denied that promotion at work?
Is life unfair?
Is there someone less talented than you reaping all the benefits?
Is your name Bruce? Then do we have the job for you.
We're located at 77256 23rd Street.
So come on down, or we'll just keep beeping you.
"Omni Presents"
Oh, yeah. The glass is half full.
Oh, geez!
Come on! Look! What is that?
What is that?
Ah, geez! Thank you. Thank you again.
What the...
You're looking for Room 7.
Yeah. I figured.
You want me to even those up for you?
How do I get to Room 7?
That'll be on the seventh floor.
Stairs are right over there.
- I'd rather take the elevator.
- Out of order.
I love the stairs though.
They were my second choice.
Do you mind giving me a hand with this floor?
What? That's good.
Are you serious? Oh, uh, I'm kind of busy.
- Um, rain check.
- I'll hold you to it.
I'm free on the seventh at 7:00.
Seventh at 7:00 it is.
This looks promising.
Hello?
Another "hugantic,"
"ginormic" waste of my life.
Hello?
- Yo! I'm lookin' for whoever runs this joint.
- Be right with ya.
I'm trying to fix a light.
Tell me if it's working.
Yeah. Seems to be.
- Kind of bright, though.
- Yeah. It is for most people.
Spend their lives in the dark trying to hide from me.
Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?
Yeah, but I'll get around to it.
- You install the Clapper?
- No, but catchy jingle, isn't it?
"Clap on, clap off"
"Clap on, clap off the Clapper"
Just can't get it out of my head.
Well, good luck with that. I'm gonna go now.
Okay. But the boss'll be right out.
You must be Bruce.
I've been expecting you.
This is hilarious. So you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor?
Must be a killer Christmas party.
Don't get drunk, though.
One of you might need a ride home.
You always were funny,
Bruce, just like your father.
He didn't mind rolling up his sleeves, either, son.
People underestimate the benefit of good old manual labor.
There's freedom in it. Some of the happiest people in the world... go home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day.
All right. What is this?
How do you know my father, and how did you get my pager number?
Oh, I know quite a lot about you, Bruce...
Just about everything there is to know.
Everything you've ever said or done or thought about doing...
Right there in that file cabinet.
Wow. A whole drawer just for me.
- Yeah.
- Mind if I take a look?
- It's your life.
- This oughta be good.
Now, this last entry was a little disturbing.
"The gloves are off, God."
"God has taken my bird and my bush."
"God is a mean kid with a magnifying glass."
"Smite me, Oh mighty smiter!"
Now, I'm not much for blaspheming, but that last one made me laugh.
Are you spying on me?
Who are you?
I'm the one.
- Huh?
- Creator of the Heavens and the Earth...
Alpha and Omega.
Oh, I see where this is going.
Bruce, I'm God.
Bingo! Yahtzee! Is that your final answer?
Our survey says, "God!"
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing!
Well, it was nice to meet you, God.
Thank you for the Grand Canyon, and good luck with the Apocalypse.
Oh, and by the way, you suck!
You know what would've been a little more impressive, though?
If you hadn't used the cheesy file cabinet illusion.
Anybody with a brain stem can tell that that drawer... is being fed through the wall from the other side.
All you have to do is find the crease, right around here.
There is a seam here... or a hollow spot.
Where? Through the drywall and concrete?
Okay. That is a good one.
That is a good one.
- Okay. How many fingers am I holding up?
- Now, Bruce.
- Thou shalt not tempt the Lord...
- Hey, if you can't do it, man, that's cool.
Three. Two. Four. Nine. Six.
Eight. One.
Okay. How many now?
- Seven.
- Aha!
You've been doing a lot of complaining about me, Bruce.
- And quite frankly, I'm tired of it.
- Wait. Don't come near me, seriously.
When I'm backed into a corner,
I'm like a wild animal.
- I don't wanna hurt you, but I will, out of instinct.
- You haven't won a fight... since grade five, and that was against a girl.
Yeah, but she was huge.
She had been held back.
And the sun was in your eyes. Oh, there you go.
Anyway, I brought you here to offer you a job.
- Job? What job?
- My job.
You think you can do it better, so here's your chance.
When you leave this building, you will be endowed with all my powers.
Sure, whatever you say, pal.
Okay. That did not happen, and no one needs to hear about it.
I'm deleting the program.
No. No. I'm having a breakdown, that's what it is.
Normal, everyday psychotic episode caused by a tumor or brain lesion.
Come on. Start!
That was lucky.
Come on, man. Calm down. You did not meet God; you do not have his powers.
If that was God, then
I'm Clint Eastwood.
Holy hell!
Be careful what you wish for, punk.
No. Uh-uh! No. No.
I am a reasonable, sane human being with a. 44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the wo...
I'm not Clint Eastwood. I'm Bruce Nolan.
Bruce Nolan. I'm Bruce No-lan!
Oh, it's not real. It's not real.
- Coffee?
- Yeah. Uh, coffee. Yeah.
- We have a special on soup today.
- No. That's fine. No, thank you.
It's tomato. I made it myself.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Excuse me. I need a sp...
It's okay. I found one.
Here's your soup.
Oh, soup. Right. Uh, yeah. Right.
Having fun?
Thy... Thou...
Come. Take a closer walk with me.
- Let me explain the rules.
- Rules?
Yeah. You left in such a rush,
I didn't get a chance to explain.
Two extra fingers freaked me out a little bit.
I just figured I'd get your attention.
I did the same thing to Gandhi; he didn't eat for three weeks.
Anyway, here's the deal.
You have all my powers.
Use them any way you choose.
There are only two rules. You can't tell anybody you're God.
Believe me, you don't want that kind of attention.
And you can't mess with free will.
Uh-huh. Can I ask why?
Yes, you can! That's the beauty of it!
- This is amazing.
- Speaking of amazing... Excuse me.
Oh.
Holy sh... cow.
Since you're through with these, I think I'll keep 'em.
Might come in handy someday.
See you around, kid.
- Where you going?
- I'm taking a vacation.
God doesn't take vacations, does he? Do... ye?
Did you ever hear of the Dark
Ages? Besides, I'm covered.
You can clear everything up in five minutes if you want to, right?
Ciao.
"I've got the power"
Boom!
And he saw that it was good.
Whoa.
B-E-A-utiful.
- Hey. Check it out. Check it out.
- Hey. Check it out.
Oh, look. It's the hero.
What's up, homie?
Yo, brethren, what up with thee?
Blessings on your alley.
Looking for another can of whoop-ass?
- You didn't get enough, Mr. Hero?
- He wants some more.
Surely I say unto you dudes,
I do not wish to fight.
So as soon as you apologize and make a full reckoning of your transgressions,
I shall absolve you and continue along the path of righteousness.
What are you talkin' about, man?
Straight up. You talk kind of funny, you know what I mean?
I don't know if you've lost it all up in here or what, but check this out, homie.
You want me and the homies to apologize, right?
I'll tell you what. We'll apologize the day a monkey comes out of my butt.
Then you get your "sorry."
How about that?
What a coincidence, because that's today.
Hey, did that monkey just come out your crack, man?
This is some voodoo shit, man.
Vámonos! Let's go!
Are you guys leavin'?
Hey, don't forget your parting gifts!
Hey, little anal-dwelling butt monkey.
Time for you to go home, little buddy.
I am Bruce Almighty!
My will be done!
"What if God was one of us"
"Just a slob like one of us"
"Just a stranger on a bus"
"Tryin'to make his way"
"Home"
- Oh my God.
- You can call me Bruce.
What happened to you? You seem so... happy.
- Why shouldn't I be... on a night like this?
- Wow.
- Those are amazing. What are these?
- They're a new breed.
Cross-pollination between tulips and daisies.
I call them tu-daisies.
Okay.
Honey, these flowers are really beautiful, but last night...
Last night, I was only human.
Barry, help me out here.
Honey. Hi. Wow.
- I've never seen the moon that big!
- Yeah.
We really shouldn't waste it.
- Bedroom?
- Five minutes.
Let there be light.
I'll be out in a minute.
Don't rush yourself.
Sometimes anticipation can heighten the pleas-ure.
Oh, God! Oh!
It's a funny thing about pleasure.
It can be quite... pleasurable!
Oh, my God!
- Pleasurable.
- Oh, God!
Oh, good God!
Pleasurable. Pleasurable.
In international news, Japanese relief workers are staging a desperate effort... to rescue hundreds of people stranded by a freak tidal wave that hit Kitamoto City.
Scientists say the tsunami may have been caused by what they're describing... as unusual lunar activity.
More on this as it develops.
Please bless my mommy, my daddy and especially my little sister.
Please help me, Lord.
Please get me through this one.
All I'm asking is would you help me?
Thank you for everything else in my life. Amen.
Sam!
Good boy.
Ah... Forget something?
Hmm.
Good boy. There are girls in the house, huh?
- Morning.
- Good morning!
- I made you grilled cheese.
- Ooh, my favey!
- Honey, last night was just...
- Heavenly? I know. I know.
I mean, I woke up this morning, and
I felt like my boobs were bigger.
Ohh. I mean, do they look bigger to you?
Uh, what? Your, um, hmm? No. Uh...
- Bigger?
- Oh, come on! Look at them!
Please. They are definitely bigger.
I mean, look. They feel huge to me.
Well, listen, I, uh, have to go, but this has been the breast bek... breast...
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?
To get my job back.
"Yeah, yeah"
"I am great.
Yeah, yeah"
"I am..." Good grief.
Is that what I'm drivin'?
Whoa. Nice car, man.
Yeah. It gets me from "A" to "B."
Oh, darn. All this horsepower and no room to gallop.
Heigh-ho, Silver, away!
I certainly wouldn't want to be a fugitive on the run with Hank,
Buffalo's number-one police dog on the job.
This is Phil Sidleman reporting from the Police Canine Training Center,
Channel 5 News.
And cut it.
Hey, hey, hey!
Look what the cat coughed up!
Channel 7, right? You're the guy that went crazy?
I had a bad moment.
- What are you doing here?
- Just looking for a story.
There's no story here.
This pond is all fished out.
- Standard stuff anyway.
- I don't know.
- My instinct tells me there's something more.
- Yeah? Well, go with that.
It served you well in the past, right?
Hey! Hank found something!
Hey, we got a body!
Over here!
Get the camera! Now!
- It's locked, and the keys are inside!
- I guess every dog has his day.
Hey, kid. You wanna make 10 bucks?
You know how to use one of these things?
Duh.
Seems to be in tune. Let's do this.
The body of Jimmy Hoffa was uncovered in a field today outside of a canine training center in Buffalo, New York.
- Bruce Nolan was the first on the scene.
- Thank you, Jane.
As you can see behind us, the body is being carefully exhumed... and will be transported to a medical facility, where D.N.A. Testing can confirm the identity.
That, however, merely a formality at this point, as in a bizarre twist, the body was found buried with a birth certificate... and complete set of dental records.
I'd call that a red-letter day for any K-9 unit, but was that enough for old Hank here?
No, sirree. Moments later, he busted a local news camera crew...
With 220 pounds of marijuana.
I never saw it before, I swear!
I'm Bruce Nolan, and that's the way the cookie crumbles.
Yeah! Did you like that?
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
- Hi, Bruce.
- Oh, hi, Susan.
Good work. I'm impressed.
- Jack, did you need me for something?
- Bruce! Bruce!
- Just the man I wanna see.
- Hey.
- Hoffa? What are the odds of that?
- What are the odds of that?
- Bruce, why don't you sit down?
- Okay.
I'm gonna be straight with you. We want you back, Bruce.
But I want you to understand it was not my decision to let you go.
- When the big guy gives the order, you know...
- No harm, no foul, Jack.
I needed some time to reassess my goals and get in touch with my true self.
- You did that in a day?
- Imagine what I could do with seven.
Look, Bruce. It is not in my power to give you anchor.
Now, as far as field reporting goes, if you're looking for a bump...
Jack, let's just cut the crap and get down to brass tacks here.
I'm kidding with you, and you...
I had you going, Jackie. Don't even worry about it, my old friend.
You just give me a camera,
Jack; I'll give you the news.
My secret is that I let the jalapeños marinate... in a spicy sauce for at least 24 hours before I stir it into the chili.
Then I let it all come to a simmer b... Oh!
Hold that thought, Hazel! It seems as if an asteroid or some kind of meteorite... has just hit ground right outside the Mark Twain Chili Cook-Off.
This should certainly spice things up a bit.
- His stories are all over town.
- From unearthing Jimmy Hoffa...
To a meteor crashing to earth...
Bruce Nolan is rapidly becoming known as...
And that's the way the cookie crumbles!
- Was this Bruce's idea?
- Uh-huh.
He said he wanted me to have a day of beauty and luxurious serenity.
I gotta tell you. He is really impressing me lately.
You know where he's taking me to dinner tonight?
Hmm. Where?
- The Blue Palm?
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my gosh. I just got chills.
- I know.
And he told me to prepare for the most memorable night of our entire lives.
Oh, my gosh. Grace, he's gonna propose.
Oh, stop it. No. Really?
Yeah. Really. Come on. You do the math.
He sends you all day to a beauty spa.
He's taking you to the most romantic restaurant in town, where you had your first date.
You know, I never thought I'd say this, but Bruce is right. This is your big night.
- Relax and enjoy it.
- Oh, God.
Ow. Wow.
Welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00 with Susan Ortega,
Evan Baxter, Fred Donohue... sports, Dallas Coleman... weather.
And now, Buffalo's number-one news team.
Good evening, and welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00. I'm Susan Ortega.
And I'm Evan Baxter, and here's what's making news.
A potential scandal with the
Buffalo P.D. surfaced today... when the mayor...
- I'm sorry. I'm seem to have something stuck in my...
- Somebody get him some water, please.
Looks like my new co-anchor may need a glass of water.
Oh. There we go.
Sorry about that.
In other news, the prime minister of Sweden visited Washington today, and my tiny little nipples went to France.
What did he just say?
Check the prompter.
The prompter's fine.
Evan, read the copy, please.
The copy's good. Just read it.
The White House reception committee greeted the prime rib roast minister, and I do the cha-cha like a sissy girl.
I "lika" do the cha-cha.
I'm sorry. We seem to be having some technical difficulties.
In other news...
My apologies.
- May I?
- Certainly.
It's perfect. She'll love it.
You know, uh...
I was gonna, uh... I was gonna wait until after the meal, but i think it's gonna burst out of me like an alien if I don't do it now.
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Okay.
This is it, isn't it?
I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready for this.
I mean, I'm ready for this.
I just don't know if I would...
I didn't think I would have... I'm sorry. Go on.
I didn't know this was so important to you.
Me neither. Me neither.
Oh.
- Grace.
- Yes?
- Grace.
- Yes?
I got anchor.
Yes.
Apparently, it wasn't working out with Evan, so he's gonna finish out the week, and I go live on Monday.
- That's great, honey. That's great.
- I know. I know.
Wow.
So that's what this is all about?
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.
Grace, we got anchor. Jack's throwing me a party Friday night... at the Vanderbilt estate to celebrate.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Now I lay me down to sleep.
Oh, I feel so stupid. I feel stupid.
Wow, it is kinda loud in here, isn't it?
- No, it's not loud.
- Geez, keep it down to a dull roar?
- What are you...
- Thank you.
Is that supposed to be funny?
'Cause that is not funny.
What are you saying?
What is wrong with you?
Stop yelling!
Uh, would you excuse me?
I think I'll take a little trip to the, um...
The wine is going right through me.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
- Keep going, Tony! You're great!
- Oh, God.
What is going on here? Oh, what is this?
Give me a break!
Really something, isn't it?
Is this heaven?
No, this is Mount Everest.
You should flip on the Discovery
Channel from time to time.
But I guess you can't now, being dead and all.
I'm dead?
Nah, I'm just messin' with ya.
That's not funny, man.
That is not funny!
Okay.
And what about the voices in my head?
- Is that part of the hilarity?
- No, those are prayers.
And you keep ignoring them, they're gonna build up on you like that.
But it's just noise.
I can't understand them.
Well, you're not listening, son.
Let's see.
You've had my powers for a little over a week now.
How many people have you helped?
I took care of a few things. I righted a few wrongs in my own life first, okay?
I was gonna help the others.
I think I could help the world.
- The world?
- Mm-hmm.
That wasn't the world.
That was just Buffalo between
57th Street and Commonwealth.
Oh.
I didn't want to start you off with more than you could handle.
Well, you took the job, Bruce, so I suggest you get to it.
Prayers, prayers. Okay, prayers. Oh!
This creepy whisper thing has to end.
Organization and management is what I need.
I need a system.
Something concrete.
Concentrate!
Files.
Let all prayers be organized into files.
Well, that takes care of the voices.
Not exactly a space saver though.
Grace might notice.
I know. Prayer Post-Its!
Okay, I need something with a lock, security, combination, a password.
A password.
You've got prayers.
Welcome to the revelation superhighway.
We bless. No mess. Downloading now.
It's good. It's good.
This is gonna take a while.
1,527,503 prayer requests?
I'd better manifest some coffee.
Hola! Juan Valdez.
- Buenos días.
- Buenos días.
- Disfrute de un buen café!
- Gracias, senor.
Adios.
Adios!
Ah! Now, that's fresh mountain-grown coffee from the hills of Colombia.
It's good.
It's good!
Okay, I had to have made some kind of a dent by now.
Oh, come on!
What a bunch of whiners. This is gonna suck up my whole life.
You know what?
Yes, to all!
Yeah, there ya go.
Now everybody's happy.
I'll drink to that. My tech stocks tripled in five days.
You know something, Joe?
- You seem taller.
- I am.
My daughter pitched a no-hitter.
I lost 47 pounds on the Krispy Kreme diet.
Hey, there he is, the man of the hour!
Bless you. Bless all of you.
Be fruitful and do long division or something.
Hey, try that. It's an excellent year.
Hey, Bruce. Who do you like in the game tonight?
I like the Sabres.
Coach prays a lot.
Hey, this is Bruce, Grace and Sam.
Leave a message.
Grace, are you there?
Hello. It's me.
Hello? Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
Come on, Grace. Come to the party.
I'll call you later, okay?
Come on, Sam.
Help me out here.
Oh, Sam, don't! Come on!
- Come on. Tell me.
- If I told you, it might not come true.
What is it you want,
Mary? What do you want?
You... You want the moon?
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.
Hey, that's a pretty good idea.
- I'll give you the moon, Mary.
- I'll take it.
Then what?
Well, then you could swallow it, and it'll all dissolve, see?
The moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes...
And the ends of your hair.
Hey, this is Bruce, Grace and Sam...
Hi, Bruce.
What are you doing in here all alone?
Oh, I was just gonna...
Oh, uh, I mean...
I was gonna, uh, give Grace a call.
Yeah, I didn't see her in there.
So, how are you and Grace doing?
Well, actually, we had a-a bit of a fight.
Kind of... I'm not sure if she's...
- You're on fire, Bruce.
- Hmm?
Some women can't handle the fire.
Some can.
That's interesting, 'cause, you know, I never thought... we would ever talk.
Grace!
Aah!
You might wanna stop touching me.
Now is not a good time.
Grace!
Grace! Grace, come here!
Grace, this is so weird.
I was just calling you.
Oh, yeah. What? And you thought, like, Susan's mouth was the phone?
I... She kissed me. I didn't...
I'm the "kissee" Grace...
Oh, please. Yeah, you were putting up a really big fight.
I tried to fight her off. I tried to stop her, but she's really strong.
Okay, I screwed up.
Can I make it up to you?
Yeah! Why don't you, uh, get me a boat, Bruce.
- What?
- Yeah, a big boat.
And then maybe two big bags of cash. Then... Then I'll be happy.
Lots of money and lots of stuff.
Other people want idiotic crap like getting married... or having babies with the man that they've loved for five years.
But not me, Bruce.
Just gimme the boat.
No wonder you stayed single!
- Oh! Grace, don't do this!
- I'm not doing this.
I'm undoing it.
I'll be at Debbie's.
You take care of Sam until
I can make arrangements.
You can't leave me.
I'm the Alpha, lady!
I'm the Omega, baby!
Okay, fine. I don't need you.
What's the matter, Bruce?
She can't handle a little competition?
The game's been called on account of rain.
An unusually high number of lottery winners...
has New York officials concerned.
So far, 1,100 winning tickets have been turned in,
all strangely from the Buffalo area.
More on this story as it develops.
Enjoying your party?
Nothing like spending quality time with great friends, huh?
Grace left me.
Yeah, I know.
She'll take me back.
She'll take me back, right?
Would you take you back?
How do you make somebody love you without affecting free will?
Welcome to my world, son.
You come up with an answer to that one, you let me know.
Rise and shine, Buffalo.
It's 70 and sunny, and the perfect day to forgive Bruce.
Bye.
- Have fun, you got it.
Hi.
- Can I get a small coffee to go?
- Sure, hon. Just a sec.
K-Tel Records brings you the 100 greatest love songs of all time.
You'll hear such classics as "All You Need Is Bruce."
"If You Can't Be With The One
You Love, Then Love Bruce."
"Do That To Bruce One More Time."
And who can forget that classic,
"Bruce So Horny, He Love You Long Time."
Order today and we'll throw in at no extra charge...
the video Sweatin' To Bruce.
Just dial 1-900-4 GIV HIM.
That's 1-900-4 GIV HIM. Do it now.
Oh, no, no, no. Honey, no, no. Oh, gosh, please don't put that in your mouth.
You don't eat that. Oh, that's not food.
Go to the bathroom, please. Wash out your mouth.
Wash off your hands.
God, I swear that kid is gonna poop an ornament.
One more time, you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.
All right. That's it! That's it!
Hi.
I surrender! I surrender! I surrender.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm, uh, doing my first anchor tonight.
Oh, wow! That's great!
- So how have you been doing?
- Good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Good.
Just, um... Debbie won the lottery.
Oh, yeah? You're kidding.
But I guess so did 400,000 other people, so she only won, like, $17.
I miss you.
Okay.
I took the first step.
Jumped out on the ledge.
- Feeling pretty vulnerable too.
- I don't know what you want me to say.
- Just say you love me and you want me back.
- No, Bruce.
Come on. What about all the signs?
How did you know about that?
Did you talk to Debbie?
Look, would it help if I just said that I was a complete ass?
- Hey, you said "ass."
- Yeah, but it's okay if I'm talking about a donkey.
- I didn't say "hole." If I said "ass"...
- Wait! Wait!
Okay, you know what, honey?
Let's go. Let's go inside.
All right, kids. Everybody inside. Time to go inside.
Grace, please... none of this seems right without you.
Yeah, I gotta go.
Wait!
Uh...
How do you feel now?
Have you completely lost your mind?
- What? Are you drunk?
- Yeah, I'm drunk. Drunk with power.
Love me. Love me.
Love me. Love me!
I did.
Yeah, I know... free will.
More power outages reported today...
caused by last week's meteorite strike.
Officials are desperately trying to repair several transformers...
damaged by the ensuing electrical surge.
The scene nearly turned violent when hundreds of disgruntled Buffalo residents...
protested last week's lottery results.
And doomsayers are pointing to last week's strange celestial events...
as signs that prophesy is now being fulfilled...
and the world as we know it may be coming to an end.
The world's gone mad.
- Bruce, 30 seconds to air.
- Okay. Okay.
There you are. It's your big debut. How are you feeling?
You know what? Fine. Never better.
Show must go on, right?
The Sabres just won the Stanley Cup.
- You're kidding me!
Was that tonight?
That's great, isn't it?
- It's getting pretty crazy out there.
- Uh-huh.
- We're gonna kick live to Fred at the stadium, okay?
- Five seconds to the open.
- This is it. You ready?
- Born that way.
Welcome to Eyewitness
News at 6:00, with Susan Ortega,
Bruce Nolan, Fred Donohue... sports... Dallas Coleman... weather.
And now, Buffalo's number-one news team.
- I'm Susan Ortega.
- I'm Bruce Nolan.
And here's what's making news.
- What happened? What the hell happened?
- We lost power.
- Transformer's down again.
- Oh, geez.
Ever since that damn meteorite hit.
It's okay. We're back up.
We apologize for the interruption.
And now back to the news. Bruce.
- Thank you, Susan.
- I'm sorry. We're going live to H.S.B.C. Arena, where the Buffalo Sabres have won the Stanley Cup.
- Great.
- Fred?
We're about to uncork some champagne because... the Sabres have won their first championship in 22 years!
What in the blue blazes...
We'll be back with the Sabres' Stanley
Cup victory in just a hot second.
In other news... Bloody hell!
- For the love of God, what is it now?
- The whole booth is down.
No, it's not!
In other news, fighting erupted in... the Gaza Strip today, as
Israelis and Palestinians...
- Bruce.
- What?!
We've got a situation here.
- They're rioting right outside the station.
- You're kidding.
The whole town is going crazy.
Come on, Bruce. Say something.
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this just in.
Possibly... the biggest breaking news story this town has ever seen.
And I gotta go.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Susan, it's all yours.
Repent! The end is near! Repent!
Come back with my bubble gum machine!
Come back here!
The lottery sucks!
I only won 17 bucks!
Channel 7 fries!
Oh! Oh, no!
God?
Are you here?
Hello? I need your help.
Clap on. Clap on.
Clap on! Clap on! Clap on!
Figures!
Well, hello there, Bruce Almighty.
Not as easy as it looks, is it, son?
- This God business.
- They're all out of control.
It's mayhem. I don't know what to do.
Well, you're right on time... 7:00.
The seventh at 7:00.
All righty then.
- There we are.
- It's good. It's good!
It's a wonderful thing.
No matter how filthy something gets, you can always clean it right up.
There were so many, I just gave them all what they wanted.
Yeah, but since when... does anyone have a clue about what they want?
So what do I do?
Parting your soup is not a miracle, Bruce.
It's a magic trick.
A single mom who's working two jobs... and still finds time to take her kid to soccer practice, that's a miracle.
A teenager who says 'no' to drugs and 'yes' to an education, that's a miracle.
People want me to do everything for them.
But what they don't realize is... They have the power.
You wanna see a miracle, son?
Be the miracle.
Wait. Are you leaving?
Yeah. I see that you can handle things now.
But what if I need you.
What if I have questions?
That's your problem, Bruce.
That's everybody's problem.
You keep looking up.
Order has been restored in Buffalo...
after this evening's downtown riot.
State officials have suspended all lottery sales...
pending further investigation.
No injuries were reported in the melee. However, there were dozens...
Okay.
Well, thanks a million.
- Oh, not a problem.
- God bless.
Bruce giveth... and Bruce taketh away.
If you don't like it, megabyte me.
- Evan.
- Bruce.
I suppose you're here to gloat about the anchor position.
Go ahead. Take your best shot.
Well actually, I, uh...
I just came to tell you that I've been a royal prick.
The anchor position is yours.
I turned down the job.
Oh, and I never really congratulated you in the first place.
Congratulations.
Thanks, Bruce.
In the financial world, things are settling back to normal...
in what analysts are calling a fluke market fluctuation.
- You made the right move, Jack.
- So what about you?
Are you ready to go back out there?
And do the cutesy stuff?
The lighter side of the news?
Lower and debase myself for the amusement of total strangers?
Yeah, I could do that.
Sounds like fun.
Good.
Okay, Sammy, let's do it right, like all the other dogs.
I don't wanna make you feel bad, but they're laughing at you, pal.
They're laughing at you.
Ok, come on. Concentrate. There you go.
Come on. Pump it out if you have to.
What am I gonna do with you?
I know this seems kinda crazy, but desperate times... calls for desperate measures.
Yeah. Ok.
Ok, Sammy. Do your thing.
That's it. That's it. Good boy!
Training my dog.
Yes, we did it! We did it!
Bow-wow-wow Yippee-yo, yippee-yay
We're doin'it doggy style
I'll alert Penthouse Forum.
Hi, Deb. How are ya?
How's Grace?
I really didn't come to chat, okay,
Bruce? I came for Grace's stuff.
You need, uh...
No, it's okay. I've got it.
I don't, uh... I don't know if she...
I don't know if she wants that or not.
This is full. You did all this?
You know what I do every night before I go to bed? I tuck my kids in, maybe have a scoop of ice cream and watch Conan.
You know what Grace does?
She prays.
Most of the time for you.
Find Grace Connelly.
The woman does pray a lot.
Find Grace, then Bruce.
"Dear God, please help Bruce find himself,
"find contentment, find you."
"Dear God, please help Bruce.
He seems to be struggling."
"Dear God, give Bruce strength."
"Dear God, bless Bruce."
"Bruce. Bruce. Bruce."
It's her.
Sammy, it's her. She's logging on. She's praying right now.
Grace.
Please, God.
Please.
I still love him.
But I don't wanna love him anymore.
I don't wanna hurt anymore. Please.
Help me forget.
Please help me let him go.
Please help me let him go.
You win!
I'm done!
Please, I don't wanna do this anymore.
I don't wanna be God.
I want you to decide what's right for me.
I surrender to your will!
Am I...
You can't kneel down in the middle of a highway and live to talk about it, son.
But why?
Why now?
Bruce... you have the divine spark.
You have the gift for bringing joy and laughter to the world.
I know. I created you.
- Quit braggin'.
- See. That's...
That's what I'm talking about.
That's the spark.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to pray, son.
Go ahead. Use them.
Uhm...
Lord, feed the hungry.
And bring peace to... all of mankind.
- How's that?
- Great.
If you wanna be Miss America.
Now, come on.
What do you really care about?
Grace.
Grace. You want her back?
No.
I want her to be happy.
No matter what that means.
I want her to find someone... who will treat her... with all the love... she deserved from me.
I want her to meet someone... who will see her always... as I do now... through your eyes.
Now, that's a prayer.
Yeah?
Yeah.
- It's good.
- It's good.
It's good!
I'm gonna get right on it.
- Clear!
- Whoa!
- That didn't feel very good.
- Clear!
Got a rhythm.
- All right. I got a pulse.
- All right. Let's set him up.
Yeah. Get the backboard and brace.
Bruce? Bruce?
Welcome back.
You're lucky to be alive, son.
Someone up there must like you.
I hear all that stuff winds up in a warehouse somewhere.
Grace.
Hi, baby.
Oh. Oh, my God, look at you.
- I was such an idiot.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I don't know what I would have done.
Oh, God.
I swear I wanted to be mad at you forever.
Now you're just showing off.
This is Bruce Nolan here at Buffalo's
First-Annual "Be the Miracle" Blood Drive.
It's a B-E-A-utiful day, so come on down here.
Because the life you save could be mine.
- Ha, ha.
- Let's go over here, where the Kowolskis have baked a very special cookie just for this occasion.
Sure, it's a little creepy and a shameless plug, but we love 'em.
Thank you, Mama.
Vol, finger... nose.
I, myself, will have given blood twice this week.
For those of you who haven't heard,
I'd like to introduce you to the future Mrs. Exclusive... Grace Connelly.
There she is.
Look at her!
Isn't she beautiful?
She just gave blood, and she still has enough left to fill up her face.
Yes, behind every great man, there's a woman rolling her eyes, folks.
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness News, with all the folks down here at the blood drive, reminding you to...
Be the miracle!
You heard 'em.
Okay, cut it. Thank you, Bruce.
Thanks, Ally.
Hey.
- How was that?
- That was great.
That was really great. Now, you still have to go over there.
- The nurse is waiting.
- Oh, do I have to?
Oh, it's not gonna hurt. In fact, I think you'll find it quite pleasurable.
Ooh, baby.
Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sigh?
"Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie"
- Oompah.
- Loompah.
Doompah.
Oh, geez.
I'm sorry.
I'm a very rare blood type. I'm A.B.-Positive.
Hmm. Sounds delicious.
Yeah, well, there, you know, there are storehouses all over the world.
You know, all over the... with... with tons of stuff on ice.
- And it's... Sorry.
- You're like this.
Sorry. Go on. Okay.
Positive. I.B.-Positive.
Okay, sorry.
- I have a "rarey"...
- Oh!
She has a "rarey." Okay.
Well, they need my blood.
I have a very rare blood type.
- I'm A.B.-Negative.
- I'm I.B.-Positive.
- Am I A.B.-Negative or am I...
- I don't know what you are anymore.
I'm gonna need a frickin' miracle to get to work on time.
Shit.
Shit!
That won't work.
Other stories in the n-n-n-n-n-n...
The prime minister of Sweden visited Washington today.
And in other...
In other...
In other news...
I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness No...
Eyewitness Nose.
Okay, and clear.
Be the miracle.
That's right.
- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!
I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.
Go back to the Shadow.
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
You shall not pass!
No! No!
Gandalf!
Fly, you fools.
No!
Gandalf!
Gandalf!
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
Nothing.
Just a dream.
Can you see the bottom?
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
Mr. Frodo!
I think I've found the bottom.
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what.
It's not natural. None of it.
- What's in this?
- Nothing.
Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or something.
Roast chicken?!
You never know.
Sam. My dear Sam.
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.
It is special.
It's a little bit of home.
We can't leave this here for someone to follow us down.
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.
Real Elvish rope.
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.
Won't come free in a hurry.
Real Elvish rope.
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth we don't want to see any closer.
And it's the one place we're trying to get to.
It's just where we can't get.
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen, Sam...
...but they did.
Mr. Frodo?
It's the Ring, isn't it?
It's getting heavier.
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.
Oh, yes. Lovely.
Lembas bread. And look!
More lembas bread.
I don't usually hold with foreign food...
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.
Nothing ever dampens your spirits, does it, Sam?
Those rain clouds might.
This looks strangely familiar.
It's because we've been here before.
We're going in circles.
What is that horrid stink?
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.
I can smell it.
We're not alone.
The thieves. The thieves.
The filthy little thieves.
Where is it?
Where is it?
They stole it from us.
My precious.
Curse them, we hates them!
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!
This is Sting.
You've seen it before...
...haven't you, Gollum?
Release him or I'll cut your throat.
It burns!
It burns us!
It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it.
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's going to hear this racket.
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!
That would kill us! Kill us!
It's no more than you deserve!
Maybe he does deserve to die.
But now that I see him, I do pity him.
We be nice to them if they be nice to us.
Take it off us.
We swears to do what you wants.
We swears.
There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
We swears...
...to serve the master of the precious.
We will swear on...
...on the precious.
Gollum. Gollum.
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.
Yes...
...on the precious.
On the precious.
I don't believe you!
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!
He's trying to trick us.
If we let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep.
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.
You've been there before?
Yes.
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
But we swore to serve the master of the precious.
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits.
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
Hey! Come back now! Come back!
There! What did I tell you?
He's run off, the old villain.
So much for his promises.
This way, Hobbits.
Follow me!
Merry!
Merry!
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.
Saruman will have his prize.
We will deliver them.
Merry!
Merry? Wake up.
My friend is sick.
He needs water. Please!
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!
Stop it!
Can't take his draught!
- Leave him alone!
- Why?
You want some?
Then keep your mouth shut.
Merry.
Hello, Pip.
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.
- It was just an act.
- An act?
See? I fooled you too.
Don't worry about me, Pippin.
What is it? What do you smell?
Man-flesh.
They've picked up our trail.
Aragorn.
Let's move!
Their pace has quickened.
They must have caught our scent.
Hurry!
Come on, Gimli!
Three days and nights pursuit.
No food. No rest.
And no sign of our quarry, but what bare rock can tell.
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
They may yet be alive.
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.
Very dangerous over short distances.
Rohan.
Home of the Horse-lords.
There's something strange at work here.
Some evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?
The Uruks turn northeast.
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.
Saruman.
The world is changing.
Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard...
...and Mordor?
To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman...
...and the union of the two towers?
Together, my Lord Sauron...
...we shall rule this Middle-earth.
The Old World will burn in the fires of industry.
The forests will fall.
A new order will rise.
We will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear...
...and the iron fists of the Orc.
I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
But, my lord, there are too many!
They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep.
- Burn it.
- Yes.
We will fight for you.
Swear it.
We will die for Saruman.
The Horse-Men took your lands.
They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks.
Murderers!
Take back the lands they stole from you.
Burn every village!
We have only to remove those who oppose us.
It will begin in Rohan.
Too long have these peasants stood against you.
But no more.
Éothain! Éothain!
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him.
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm.
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.
Freda, I will find you there.
Quickly!
Go, child.
Rohan, my lord...
...is ready to fall.
Théodred.
Find the king's son!
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.
My Lord Éomer, over here!
He's alive.
Théodred.
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
He was ambushed by Orcs.
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.
That is a lie.
Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
Grima.
Grima.
Grima.
Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.
Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent...
...your warmongering.
Warmongering?
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?
What was the promised price, Grima?
When all the Men are dead, you will take your share of the treasure?
Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.
Too much.
You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan...
...and all its domains under pain of death.
You have no authority here.
Your orders mean nothing.
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
He signed it this morning.
Keep breathing. That's the key.
Breathe.
They've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
We're not going no further...
...until we've had a breather.
Get a fire going!
Merry!
Merry!
I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire, Pippin.
What's making that noise?
It's the trees.
What?
You remember the Old Forest, on the borders of Buckland?
Folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall...
...and come alive.
Alive?
Trees that could whisper...
...talk to each other...
...even move.
I'm starving.
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days.
Yeah!
Why can't we have some meat?!
What about them?
They're fresh.
They are not for eating.
What about their legs?
They don't need those.
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.
Alive?
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.
The master wants it for the war.
They think we have the Ring.
As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
Just a mouthful...
...a bit of the flank.
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Pippin.
Let's go.
Go on.
Call for help.
Squeal.
No one's going to save you now.
Pippin!
A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
Riders of Rohan...
...what news from the Mark?
What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?
Speak quickly!
Give me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine.
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...
...if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
You would die before your stroke fell.
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.
We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
Not even his own kin.
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king...
...and claimed lordship over these lands.
My company are those loyal to Rohan.
And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning.
He walks here and there, they say...
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.
And everywhere, his spies slip past our nets.
We are no spies.
We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They have taken two of our friends captive.
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.
We left none alive.
We piled the carcasses and burned them.
Dead?
I am sorry.
Hasufel! Arod!
May these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
Look for your friends.
But do not trust to hope.
It has forsaken these lands.
We ride north!
It's one of their wee belts.
We failed them.
A Hobbit lay here.
And the other.
They crawled.
Their hands were bound.
Their bonds were cut.
They ran over here.
They were followed.
The belt!
Run!
Tracks lead away from the battle...
...into Fangorn Forest.
Fangorn?
What madness drove them in there?
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
I'm going to rip out your filthy little innards!
Come here!
Trees. Climb a tree.
He's gone.
Merry!
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!
Run, Merry!
Little Orcs.
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.
Tree?
I am no tree!
I am an Ent.
A tree-herder.
A shepherd of the forest.
Don't talk to it, Merry.
Don't encourage it!
Treebeard, some call me.
And whose side are you on?
Side?
I am on nobody's side...
...because nobody's on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!
Hobbits?
Never heard of a Hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
They come with fire.
They come with axes.
Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning!
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!
Halflings!
Shire-folk!
Maybe you are...
...and maybe you aren't.
The White Wizard will know.
The White Wizard?
Saruman.
See? See?
We've led you out.
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!
Very lucky we find you.
Nice Hobbit.
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.
A swamp, yes, yes.
Come, master. We will take you on safe paths through the mist.
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.
I found it. I did.
The way through the marshes.
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.
They go around for miles and miles.
Come quickly.
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
I hate this place. It's too quiet.
There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
No, no birdses to eat.
No crunchable birdses.
We are famished! Yes!
Famished we are, precious!
Here.
What does it eats?
Is it tasty?
It tries to chokes us!
We can't eats Hobbit food!
We must starve!
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!
Oh, cruel Hobbit.
It does not care if we be hungry.
Does not care if we should die.
Not like master.
Master cares.
Master knows.
Yes.
Precious.
Once it takes hold of us...
...it never lets go.
Don't touch me!
There are dead things!
Dead faces in the water.
All dead. All rotten.
Elves and Men and Orcses.
A great battle long ago.
Dead Marshes.
Yes. Yes, that is their name.
This way.
Don't follow the lights.
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones...
...and light little candles of their own.
Frodo!
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!
Are you all right?
So bright.
So beautiful.
Our precious.
What did you say?
Master should be resting.
Master needs to keep up his strength.
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.
Gollum. Gollum.
Gandalf told me you were one of the river-folk.
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home
He said your life was a sad story.
They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead
You were not so very different from a Hobbit once.
Were you?
Sméagol.
What did you call me?
That was your name once, wasn't it?
A long time ago.
My name.
My name.
Sméagol.
Black Riders!
Hide! Hide!
Come on, Frodo. Come on!
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?
No, you cannot kill them. No.
Wraiths!
Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it.
They are calling for the precious.
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.
I'm here.
Hurry, Hobbits.
The Black Gate is very close.
Orc blood.
These are strange tracks.
The air is so close in here.
This forest is old.
Very old.
Full of memory...
...and anger.
The trees are speaking to each other.
Gimli!
Lower your ax.
They have feelings, my friend.
The Elves began it.
Waking up the trees, teaching them to speak.
Talking trees.
What do trees have to talk about?
Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
Something's out there.
What do you see?
The White Wizard approaches.
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.
We must be quick.
You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
Where are they?
They passed this way the day before yesterday.
They met someone they did not expect.
Does that comfort you?
Who are you?
Show yourself!
It cannot be.
Forgive me.
I mistook you for Saruman.
I am Saruman.
Or rather, Saruman as he should have been.
You fell.
Through fire...
...and water.
From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak...
...I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth.
U ntil at last I threw down my enemy...
...and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
Darkness took me...
...and I strayed out of thought and time.
Stars wheeled overhead...
...and every day was as long as a life age of the Earth.
But it was not the end.
I felt life in me again.
I've been sent back...
...until my task is done.
Gandalf.
Gandalf?
Yes.
That was what they used to call me.
Gandalf the Grey.
That was my name.
Gandalf.
I am Gandalf the White.
And I come back to you now...
...at the turn of the tide.
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?
That is no short distance!
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
Then we have run all this way for nothing?
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...
...in this horrid, dark, dank, tree-infested...?
I mean, charming...
...quite charming forest.
It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.
A great power has been sleeping here for many long years.
The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones...
...that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
I n one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
You still speak in riddles.
A thing is about to happen that has not happened since the Elder Days.
The Ents are going to wake up...
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!
Oh, that's good.
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.
I n fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
That is one of the Mearas...
...unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
Shadowfax.
He is the lord of all horses...
...and has been my friend through many dangers.
O rowan mine
I saw you shine
U pon a summer's day
U pon your head
How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
Such a beautiful verse.
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.
You might call it far, perhaps.
My home lies deep in the forest...
...near the roots of the mountain.
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.
And safe is where I'll keep you.
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.
It's one of my own compositions.
Right.
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
Sleep, little Shirelings.
Heed no nightly noise.
Sleep till morning light.
I have business in the forest.
There are many to call.
Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.
The withering of all woods is drawing near.
The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.
Sauron will suffer no rival.
From the summit of Barad-dûr, his Eye watches ceaselessly.
But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him.
The rumor has reached him.
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.
He fears what you may become.
And so he'll strike hard and fast at the world of Men.
He will use his puppet, Saruman, to destroy Rohan.
War is coming.
Rohan must defend itself, and therein lies our first challenge...
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king's mind is enslaved, it's an old device of Saruman's.
His hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning...
...we have one advantage.
The Ring remains hidden.
And that we should seek to destroy it...
...has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor...
...in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom.
We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed...
...and the secrecy of his quest.
Do not regret your decision to leave him.
Frodo must finish this task alone.
He's not alone.
Sam went with him.
Did he?
Did he, indeed? Good.
Yes, very good.
The Black Gate of Mordor.
Oh, save us.
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now.
Master says to show him the way into Mordor.
So good Sméagol does, master says so.
I did.
That's it, then.
We can't get past that.
Look!
The gate.
It's opening!
I can see a way down.
Sam, no!
Master!
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
- Now!
- No!
No! No, master!
They catch you! They catch you!
Don't take it to him.
He wants the precious.
Always he is looking for it.
And the precious is wanting to go back to him.
But we mustn't let him have it.
No! There's another way.
More secret. A dark way.
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.
He's up to something.
Are you saying there's another way into Mordor?
Yes. There's a path...
...and some stairs.
And then...
...a tunnel.
He's led us this far, Sam.
Mr. Frodo, no.
He's been true to his word.
No.
Lead the way, Sméagol.
Good Sméagol always helps.
Hello?
Treebeard?
Where has he gone?
I had the loveliest dream last night.
There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed.
And we smoked all of it.
And then...
...you were sick.
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
Did you hear that?
There it is again.
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.
You just said something... Treeish.
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.
You're taller.
- Who?
- You!
- Than what?
- Than me!
I've always been taller than you.
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.
Please, Merry.
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".
Three-foot-eight.
You did something.
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!
Merry!
No, Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!
Give me it back. Merry!
What's happening?!
It's got my leg!
Merry!
Help!
Away with you.
You should not be waking.
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.
Go to sleep.
Away with you.
Come, the forest is waking up.
It isn't safe.
The trees have grown wild and dangerous.
Anger festers in their hearts.
Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate.
They will harm you if they can.
There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long?
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.
There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- How did they die?
- Die? No.
We lost them.
And now we cannot find them.
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
Can't say that I have.
You, Pip?
What do they look like?
I don't remember now.
Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...
...whose mind is overthrown.
Saruman 's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
My lord, your son...
...he is dead.
My lord?
Uncle?
Will you not go to him?
Will you do nothing?
Be careful what you say.
Do not look for welcome here.
Oh, he must have died sometime in the night.
What a tragedy for the king...
...to lose his only son and heir.
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.
Especially now that your brother has deserted you.
Leave me alone, snake!
Oh, but you are alone.
Who knows what you've spoken to the darkness...
...in the bitter watches of the night...
...when all your life seems to shrink.
The walls of your bower closing in about you.
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.
So fair.
So cold.
Like a morning of pale spring...
...still clinging to winter's chill.
Your words are poison.
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
I cannot allow you before Théoden King so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.
By order of Grima Wormtongue.
Your staff.
You would not part an old man from his walking stick.
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He's a herald of woe.
The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late...
...Théoden King.
He's not welcome.
Why should I welcome you...
...Gandalf Stormcrow?
A just question, my liege.
Late is the hour...
...in which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Láthspell I name him.
Ill news is an ill guest.
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.
I have not passed through fire and death...
...to bandy crooked words with a witless worm.
His staff.
I told you to take the wizard's staff.
Théoden...
...son of Thengel...
...too long have you sat in the Shadows.
I would stay still if I were you.
Hearken to me!
I release you...
...from the spell.
You have no power here...
...Gandalf the Grey.
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
Wait.
If I go, Théoden dies.
You did not kill me...
...you will not kill him.
Rohan is mine.
Be gone.
I know your face.
Éowyn.
Éowyn.
Gandalf?
Breathe the free air again, my friend.
Dark have been my dreams of late.
Your fingers would remember their old strength better...
...if they grasped your sword.
I've only...
...ever served you, my lord.
Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
Send me not from your sight.
No, my lord! No, my lord.
Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
Get out of my way!
Hail, Théoden King!
Where is Théodred?
Where is my son?
Simbelmynë.
Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas that these evil days should be mine.
The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live...
...to see the last days of my house.
Théodred's death was not of your making.
No parent should have to bury their child.
He was strong in life.
His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
They had no warning.
They were unarmed.
Now the Wild Men are moving through the Westfold, burning as they go.
Rick, cot and tree.
Where is Mama?
This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.
All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on.
Draw him away from your women and children.
You must fight.
You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak.
Éomer is loyal to you.
His men will return and fight for their king.
They will be 300 leagues from here by now.
Éomer cannot help us.
I know what it is you want of me...
...but I will not bring further death to my people.
I will not risk open war.
Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not.
When last I looked...
...Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
Then what is the king's decision?
By order of the king...
...the city must empty.
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.
Helm's Deep.
They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight.
Who will defend them if not their king?
He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people.
Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.
He thinks he's leading them to safety.
What they will get is a massacre.
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for him.
I fear for the survival of Rohan.
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you.
The defenses have to hold.
They will hold.
The Grey Pilgrim.
That's what they used to call me.
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked this earth, and now I have no time.
With luck, my search will not be in vain.
Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day.
At dawn, look to the east.
Go.
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.
His name is Brego.
He was my cousin's horse.
Brego.
Your name is kingly.
I have heard of the magic of Elves...
...but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North.
You speak as one of their own.
I was raised in Rivendell...
...for a time.
Turn this fellow free.
He's seen enough of war.
Gandalf the White.
Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
There were three who followed the wizard.
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
You stink of horse.
The Man...
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.
His cloth was poor.
And yet he bore a strange ring.
Two serpents with emerald eyes.
One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
The Ring of Barahir.
So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he has found Isildur's heir.
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.
The line was broken years ago.
It matters not.
The world of Men shall fall.
It will begin at Edoras.
I am ready, Gamling.
Bring my horse.
This is not a defeat.
We will return.
We will return.
You have some skill with a blade.
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords can still die upon them.
I fear neither death nor pain.
What do you fear, my lady?
A cage.
To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them.
And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
You're a daughter of kings...
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.
I do not think that would be your fate.
Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
It's vulnerable. He knows this.
He will expect an attack on the city.
They will flee to Helm's Deep...
...the great fortress of Rohan.
It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains.
They will be slow.
They will have women and children with them.
Send out your Warg-riders.
Hey, stinker, don't go getting too far ahead.
- Why do you do that?
- What?
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.
Because.
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.
There's naught left in him but lies and deceit.
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
You have no idea what it did to him...
...what it's still doing to him.
I want to help him, Sam.
Why?
Because I have to believe he can come back.
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.
What do you know about it?
Nothing!
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I said that.
I do.
It's the Ring.
You can't take your eyes off it.
I've seen you.
You're not eating. You barely sleep.
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.
Mine! My own!
Can't you hear yourself?
Don't you know who you sound like?
We wants it.
We needs it.
Must have the precious.
They stole it from us.
Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked. Tricksy. False.
No. Not master.
Yes, precious. False.
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
Master's my friend.
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.
Not listening. I'm not listening.
You're a liar and a thief.
No.
Murderer.
Go away.
Go away?
I hate you.
I hate you.
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.
I saved us.
It was me. We survived because of me.
Not anymore.
What did you say?
Master looks after us now.
We don't need you.
What?
Leave now...
...and never come back.
No.
Leave now and never come back.
Leave now and never come back!
We told him to go away.
And away he goes, precious.
Gone! Gone! Gone!
Sméagol is free!
Look.
Look. See what Sméagol finds?
They are young.
They are tender. They are nice.
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!
You'll make him sick, you will...
...behaving like that.
There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
What's it doing?
Stupid, fat Hobbit.
It ruins it.
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.
What we need is a few good taters.
What's taters, precious?
What's taters? Eh?
Po-ta-toes.
Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew.
Lovely, big, golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
Even you couldn't say no to that.
Oh, yes, we could.
Spoil a nice fish.
Give it to us raw...
...and wriggling.
You keep nasty chips.
You're hopeless.
Mr. Frodo?
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.
Servants of Sauron.
They are called to Mordor.
The Dark One is gathering all armies to him.
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.
The last war that will cover all the world in Shadow.
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
It's an oliphaunt.
No one at home will believe this.
Sméagol?
We've lingered here too long.
Come on, Sam.
Wait! We're innocent travelers!
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.
Those that claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.
The enemy?
His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem.
You wonder what his name is...
...where he came from.
And if he was really evil at heart.
What lies or threats led him on this long march from home.
If he would not rather have stayed there...
...in peace.
War will make corpses of us all.
Bind their hands.
{2094}{2167}Horror and devastation lay in their wake.
{2197}{2256}The source of their terrifying power...
{2259}{2339}lay within a chamber on planet Uroboris.
{2367}{2492}The waters it contained|held the promise of everlasting life.
{2537}{2623}The chamber could only be opened|with a single key...
{2625}{2680}which, if ever found...
{2692}{2818}would guide its bearer back|to the fountainhead of immortality.
{2860}{2971}However, the key would drive|all who touched it insane.
{3013}{3123}When the Arakacians were finally defeated,|the chamber was locked...
{3126}{3227}and the key, cast out deep into space.
{3246}{3306}It has never been found...
{3324}{3376}until now.
{5539}{5596}Give it up, why don't ya!
{5641}{5698}Damn! Not again!
{5786}{5855}I can't wait to get|those new matter munchers.
{5870}{5940}I've had just about enough|of these cheap heads.
{6294}{6366}Tyler, major find here!
{6373}{6400}What is it?
{6496}{6531}I don't know.
{6925}{6995}Careful, it could be a Class 4 biohazard.
{7013}{7056}What is that thing?
{7119}{7153}What's it doing?
{7703}{7756}It's weird.
{8090}{8123}What's going on?
{8150}{8179}Are you okay?
{8218}{8275}Should I call for a containment crew?
{8405}{8432}No, please!
{9158}{9227}The guardian has revealed himself!|The key has been found!
{9270}{9368}Odin, tell us. Is the day|of the great darkness at hand?
{9374}{9501}Yes. It is written in the Old Books.|The coming back time has begun.
{9573}{9622}Evil will descend upon us!
{9629}{9686}We must prepare to defend the chamber!
{10202}{10241}Sanders, sector 3!
{10249}{10250}We're still waiting|for their preliminary core samples.
{10250}{10318}We're still waiting|for their preliminary core samples.
{10320}{10381}What? How long|have they been down there?
{10386}{10457}Over 12 hours. They must be going nuts.
{10510}{10611}Weird. System checks out,|but no response. Deadsville.
{10619}{10700}Send someone down there.|I want to know what's going on.
{10718}{10776}I need a big ship to get somewhere.
{10780}{10830}What the hell do you think you're doing?
{10832}{10872}Security. To the bridge!
{11105}{11148}Any other stupid questions?
{11238}{11334}You, fat boy. Name and duties.
{11351}{11426}- Lambert, sir. Navigation's Officer.|- Drive.
{11480}{11513}Germain St. Germain.
{11515}{11590}When I want your name, shit brain,|I'll ask for it.
{11595}{11634}Take over engineering.
{11642}{11713}Plot a course for BR-549, sector 7.
{11734}{11797}And somebody better|get rid of this garbage.
{11911}{11940}By the way...
{11970}{12035}you have 20 seconds|to get us out of here.
{17720}{17745}Hi.
{17747}{17789}What are you still doing here?
{17791}{17852}I know. I'm going to be late for school.
{17858}{17887}Where's Dad?
{17890}{17964}He's at the council meeting.|I thought you were supposed to go.
{18361}{18425}Do you believe|any of that immortality crap?
{18444}{18501}Think about it. A stupid key?
{18524}{18572}Call him a liar, and see what happens.
{18574}{18636}Listen, this guy's getting weirder|by the day.
{18638}{18708}Imagine in 10 years? Hell, 100.
{18742}{18777}You've got a point.
{18781}{18875}I am getting sick of it.|Going all over the bloody place.
{18888}{18941}Looking for a stupid compound!
{19019}{19091}- What have you got?|- A FAKK 2 planet, sir.
{19114}{19181}Death to all carbon based life forms.
{19219}{19298}Federation Assigned Kitogenic Killzone|to the second level.
{19300}{19359}Which means it's a dead planet.
{19369}{19400}Scan it anyway.
{19457}{19493}I don't get it.
{19511}{19551}There's life out there.
{19553}{19626}The FAKK 2 must have been|from an old registry.
{19632}{19716}I want a bio-scan for compound H2O-471.
{19910}{19973}There are small traces in their systems.
{20010}{20067}Yeah. Immortality all over the place.
{20090}{20115}You!
{20128}{20186}Just remember you're not immortal yet!
{20222}{20266}What's this place called?
{20342}{20370}Eden, sir.
{20439}{20479}Welcome to paradise.
{20654}{20737}And our irrigation program|is already showing promise.
{20750}{20837}Agro-production is up five percent|in the last six months.
{20845}{20904}Phase two of our expansion project...
{20906}{21011}the development of the Noma Valley,|will begin in three weeks as scheduled.
{21023}{21111}Things look good, ladies and gentlemen.|Our future is bright.
{21475}{21588}- Help Kerrie. I'll get our air defences up!|- Be careful! I'll see you up there!
{21679}{21717}Quickly. This way!
{22562}{22589}Kerrie!
{25735}{25761}Julie.
{25800}{25827}Father!
{26844}{26919}Looks like the boys|got a little trigger-happy.
{26936}{27016}When making an omelette,|one breaks a few eggs.
{27219}{27269}Here, let me help you.
{27338}{27387}They attacked.
{27405}{27494}- You okay?|- We never had a chance.
{27521}{27609}Hey, look at this! A live one!
{27635}{27667}Leave her alone!
{27836}{27907}Get off of me! Let me go!
{28085}{28146}Feisty and sexy.
{28149}{28213}Careful boys, this one's a keeper.
{28258}{28304}- Pack 'em up!|- Yes, sir!
{28315}{28375}Splitsville, boys! We're moving out!
{28630}{28661}Wait for me!
{28673}{28738}Lover-boy, you're on your own.
{28746}{28806}You can't just leave me here like this!
{28834}{28876}Wait a minute, man...
{29018}{29091}Like the sign says, a dead planet.
{29838}{29906}This won't hurt. It's just a DNA test.
{29909}{29977}The good stuff comes later.
{30043}{30087}Start with the others, Doc.
{30093}{30188}- This one's special.|- But of course.
{30242}{30293}What I need is in your system.
{30305}{30347}Not enough to make you immortal...
{30349}{30474}but it probably keeps your people|beautiful and healthy. Especially you.
{30492}{30538}I'll save you for last.
{30543}{30619}And if you're lucky, my dear,|and play your cards right...
{30621}{30697}we'll spend a lot of quality time together.
{30903}{30981}Perfect. I knew|you wouldn't disappoint me.
{31055}{31085}Clean her up!
{31096}{31156}And I don't have to remind your kind...
{31174}{31209}she's mine.
{33793}{33836}I should have been a cook!
{33866}{33914}Try this for an appetiser!
{33916}{33998}- I didn't do anything! I swear!|- You're one of them!
{34000}{34082}No! I mean, I was, but I ran away!|I didn't kill anybody!
{34084}{34116}Who did this?
{34118}{34180}He took over our ship|and forced us to come here!
{34182}{34231}- Who?|- His name's Tyler!
{34233}{34263}Why did he attack?
{34265}{34332}He's nuts!|He thinks he's going to live forever!
{34335}{34431}Where did he go? You've got one second.
{34446}{34470}One....
{34504}{34550}Wait! I'll take you to him!
{34553}{34606}- Where?|- Do we have a deal?
{34674}{34786}- How long to fix this Spacehawk?|- Two hours, max! I'm almost there.
{34855}{34944}You dropped your wrench.|Aren't you going to pick it up?
{34967}{34991}Yeah.
{35115}{35152}What did I do?
{35576}{35616}I am a genius.
{35676}{35735}Doc, this had better work.
{35997}{36048}I like the hint of lemon.
{36075}{36108}I'm so glad.
{36159}{36187}Yes!
{36422}{36457}So, where are we going?
{36502}{36563}He said he needed to get to a jump port.
{36568}{36635}Computer, set co-ordinates|for the closest spaceport...
{36637}{36694}that can handle a class C vessel.
{36703}{36802}Searching. Confirmed.|Neo Calcutta. Course set.
{36809}{36859}ETA 93.7 hours.
{37218}{37255}So, what's your name?
{37293}{37369}Don't talk, don't touch,|don't even breathe...
{37372}{37463}or I kill you. Got it?|- I got it.
{38783}{38839}Request incoming docking co-ordinates.

{39744}{39804}Confirmed. Cleared for docking.
{40679}{40725}You like this place?
{40736}{40783}Looks like a lot of your type.
{40823}{40911}After four days stuck in a Spacehawk,|getting the cold shoulder...
{40913}{40985}it's not so bad.|We could have a lot of fun here.
{40989}{41040}What are you, socially deprived?
{41042}{41131}I'm not socially deprived.|Well, maybe a little.
{41163}{41271}'´Sit down! What are you looking at?|You snore!
{41284}{41346}'´Get outta my face! Shut the fuck up!'´
{41376}{41439}This is heaven compared|to where I come from.
{41458}{41491}Shut the fuck up.
{41668}{41786}Are you sure this guy Tyler is looking|for a jump port? And to where?
{41905}{41977}We're talking high-grade,|silicone-rubber flesh here.
{41979}{42093}And a PVC skeleton with plastic ball|and socket joints for optimum movement.
{42105}{42185}You can customise her|with a choice of seven synthetic hair dyes.
{42187}{42287}And optional entry ports|with four speeds of suction!
{42323}{42359}Loveable, isn't she?
{42397}{42433}Check this out.
{42435}{42529}She's loaded with the latest micro-sensor|orgasmatronic technology...
{42534}{42585}and an expandable vocabulary...
{42587}{42669}of over 200 dirty words.
{42671}{42747}Test results indicate|she's better than the real thing.
{42758}{42828}Go on, Venus.|Show the gentleman what you got.
{42910}{42977}Please select your sexual preference.
{42981}{43070}Vaginal. Anal. Oral. Other.

{43150}{43214}I don't know, 2,000....
{43219}{43306}Unless, of course,|you'd prefer the Fellation Blowfish.
{43326}{43439}Sick, twisted, low-life, scum sucking pig!
{43447}{43504}At least I'll have someone to talk to.
{43534}{43556}What?
{43562}{43625}That's him. The tall one.
{43683}{43759}- Let's go.|- I'll wait here.
{43768}{43849}But he'll see me.|You don't know what he's like.
{43865}{43894}Chicken shit.
{45153}{45193}God, this is fun!
{45717}{45757}Nobody touches these...
{45817}{45843}but me!
{45882}{45908}Bar towel!
{46293}{46368}Hello? Captain Tyler,|Metal Mammoth Mining.
{46372}{46416}We need some drinks!
{46529}{46605}We should make it fast.|We don't want to miss the jump.
{46623}{46654}Screw the jump!
{46665}{46718}I've got all the time in the world!
{46720}{46786}Besides, something just came up.
{46853}{46916}You just found the man of your dreams.
{48512}{48599}When you kill someone, darling,|make sure he's dead.
{48620}{48649}What the hell?
{49856}{49903}Looks like happy hour is over.
{49924}{50012}- Who's gonna pay for all of this?|- This ought to take care of it.
{50015}{50067}Here. Keep the change.
{50081}{50131}What? Holy shit!
{50144}{50169}Grenades!
{50647}{50673}Julie?
{50791}{50828}Are you all right?
{50903}{50986}He died! And then he was alive again!
{50999}{51031}Now you know.
{51062}{51122}I don't know dick! How does he do it?
{51124}{51171}He's got this weird potion!
{51173}{51236}And a key leading him|to the Chamber of lmmortality.
{51238}{51291}Why didn't you tell me that before?
{51294}{51370}'´Sit down. Get outta my face!|Shut the fuck up!'´
{51449}{51542}So if I take away his potion,|he'll stay dead, right?
{51544}{51616}If you can get close enough.
{51688}{51727}That's him, isn't it?
{51731}{51778}Son of a bitch, he's getting away!
{51796}{51868}What more could the universe want|in a tyrant?
{51889}{51957}Perfect body, perfect mind.
{51993}{52067}- Irresistible charm.|- Perfect psycho!
{52093}{52172}Psycho? Time to come out and play.
{52174}{52217}Don't even think about it!
{52307}{52385}The hyperspace jump.|There's always something.
{52420}{52481}I'll make it up to you later, sweetheart.
{52514}{52577}Let me out of here, you bastard!
{52981}{53063}Cortez to Jump Control.|Set lock-in for Uroboris.
{53067}{53142}No pre-set lock-in. Set co-ordinates.
{53152}{53240}Quadrant 9, sector 4013,|in the Terackian system.
{53250}{53293}Scanning location.
{53313}{53379}Warning. No returnjump port.
{53390}{53436}Please confirm lock-in.
{53451}{53481}Confirmed.
{53504}{53556}It'll take us forever to get back!
{53573}{53632}That won't be a problem,|once we get there.
{53716}{53777}We'll never make it!|This thing's a death trap!
{53811}{53896}- It's gotten us this far.|- This far is nowhere.
{53901}{53957}Spacehawk in hyperspace equals death!
{53961}{53996}Stow the bag.
{54582}{54670}- Are you nuts?|- I'm not going to lose him now.
{55356}{55428}You can't just piggyback their jump!
{55597}{55685}A tractor beam! Are you insane?|We're going to rip to...
{56294}{56364}- What the hell is that?|- We've got company.
{56373}{56440}Excuse me, '´company'´?|What do you mean '´company'´?
{56445}{56522}See that blip? It's like|somebody hitched onto our jump.
{56524}{56631}That could change our trajectory.|I want them dead! Now! Take 'em down!
{56638}{56713}But I've never heard of anyone|firing on a ship in hyperspace.
{56715}{56784}Do you have a better idea? Do it! Now!
{56789}{56828}Man, that's suicide.
{57080}{57161}- We lost them all. They're toast.|- Send the bomber.
{57197}{57271}One more word, and I'll send you.
{57466}{57547}We're hit! I knew it!
{57557}{57601}This is all your fault!
{57752}{57790}Do something!
{58119}{58160}The tunnel's breaking up!
{58172}{58225}We're not going to make it!
{58485}{58529}Yes! Do it!
{59288}{59348}I sense the key is here.
{59390}{59492}For the moment, it is best|if Zeek and I assess the threat alone.
{61608}{61640}My ampoules.
{61804}{61867}I'm afraid it's down to you.
{61889}{61941}No. Please.
{62139}{62181}Lambert, damage report.
{62237}{62278}I want a damage report!
{62552}{62591}Don't worry, I'm fine.
{62604}{62656}Yeah? Like I give a shit!
{62668}{62741}What's the status|on the double D-40s and munitions?
{62755}{62791}We found a wheel.
{62795}{62823}Personnel?
{62864}{62920}Seventy-eight percent dead or missing.
{62922}{62953}Life-scan?
{63008}{63104}There's a town, looks like|it's about 10 or 12 miles north of here.
{63119}{63150}Flight status?
{63165}{63207}You've got to be kidding.
{63211}{63273}Gather the weapons,|what's left of my men...
{63275}{63330}shoot the injured. We're moving on.
{64035}{64088}Was it good for you?
{64169}{64215}I'll start you off like this.
{64217}{64320}The next step, in three or four days,|depending on your production...
{64323}{64384}will be the body tank.
{64439}{64469}You're sick!
{64495}{64550}I'm a sick genius.
{65836}{65874}I can't breathe.
{65896}{65941}Get off my face!
{66017}{66049}What are you?
{66051}{66109}I'm Zeek, what are you?
{66210}{66249}You're so soft.
{66269}{66319}I'm harder than you think, stone man.
{66321}{66414}Please, you must not touch|my master Odin's property.
{66418}{66490}He's left me with the responsibility|to guard it.
{66500}{66597}Relax, your thing is safe with me.|Where is your master?
{66600}{66631}I am Odin.
{66640}{66747}Please excuse my little friend,|he takes his duties very seriously.
{66750}{66827}- What are you called?|- FAKK Julie.
{66870}{66964}Julie, soft. Very soft.
{66983}{67036}You're not from our world, are you?
{67043}{67098}Hardly. What is this place?
{67110}{67207}Uroboris. Some call it home.|Others call it hell.
{67216}{67275}My master says you come from the sky.
{67278}{67343}Do you have it? Do you have the key?
{67355}{67405}I don't know anything about a key.
{67407}{67473}I crashed here trying to kill a madman,|who won't die.
{67475}{67519}I did see two fireballs.
{67534}{67623}The other was headed in the direction|of a city called Shantaar.
{67646}{67713}It's not far from here. We'll take you there.
{67740}{67794}So please, come with us.
{67818}{67883}Tell me more about this madman.
{67908}{68000}Bastard named Tyler,|killed everyone I ever cared about.
{68005}{68120}Our legends say that|whoever carries the key, becomes insane.
{68145}{68190}That's him all right.
{68235}{68300}I'm sorry. I sense your sadness.
{68313}{68377}It's hard to be the last of your people.
{70009}{70079}Not much of an army. But it's a start.
{70099}{70190}Look. The ugliest one seems|to be sitting in my chair.
{70828}{70865}Hey, you, ugly!
{70901}{70975}Your mother is a Hectarian|whore's handbag!
{71818}{71903}Molten lava? We have to cross this?
{71910}{71989}Yes, Shantaar lies on the other side.
{72031}{72117}- I hate this place.|- How are we going to cross?
{72183}{72306}I am Chartog, guardian of the Red River.
{72314}{72356}I know the way across...
{72383}{72431}and I will tell you.
{72469}{72512}You just have to...
{72547}{72586}kiss me.
{72600}{72627}No way.
{72655}{72722}What's the matter, my precious?
{72758}{72836}Don't you find me attractive?
{72885}{72948}If this is what it takes to kill Tyler....
{72985}{73072}That's a good girl. Help your friends.
{73085}{73142}It will be over soon.
{73162}{73223}Who will I have to kiss to get back?
{73490}{73528}What are you doing?
{73557}{73596}We're waiting for you.
{73635}{73710}Son of a bitch! Kiss this!
{73819}{73881}Your people have strange customs.
{73936}{73975}Tell me about it.
{74574}{74662}Mortality sucks, immortality sucks.
{74675}{74716}Everything sucks.
{74789}{74816}Oh, shit.
{74877}{74922}This really sucks.
{75767}{75813}Is he the one you search for?
{75850}{75876}Oh, yeah.
{76061}{76107}Yeah! Come on, Tyler!
{76476}{76543}I'm your new leader! Me!
{76723}{76768}Now we're up the creek.
{77058}{77104}When you kill someone...
{77167}{77210}make sure they're dead!
{77394}{77423}Yo, baby.
{77704}{77819}I am Tyler! Your new lord!
{78118}{78197}Blind adulation makes me so horny.
{78226}{78259}Bring me a wench!
{78448}{78525}Master, he's the one with the key, isn't he?
{78572}{78642}He's far too powerful for us|to deal with alone.
{78644}{78678}Leave that to me.
{78683}{78795}Julie, you are too impulsive.|Please, think about this.
{78802}{78863}- Think about what?|- The key.
{78889}{78968}- You don't understand.|- You worry about the key.
{78977}{79016}Tyler's mine.
{79092}{79179}She is letting her thirst|for revenge rule her mind.
{79891}{79950}A little retro, but hey....
{80200}{80241}Where'd they find you?
{80273}{80386}I hear you're very special.|I've come a long way to meet you.
{80489}{80605}- You're not a robot, are you?|- Why don't you find out for yourself?
{80626}{80694}I could say I've died|and gone to heaven, but...
{80715}{80757}that wouldn't be true.
{80766}{80857}Which part, the dying or the heaven?
{80932}{80955}You.
{81080}{81158}I know I'm irresistible,|but what do you want?
{81166}{81208}I want you...
{81231}{81279}and what you have.
{81284}{81352}There's a price to pay for immortality...
{81356}{81424}and the universe is going|to pick up the tab.
{81455}{81490}How original.
{81505}{81559}Every king must have a queen.
{81597}{81632}Do you want me?
{81656}{81697}Take a wild guess.
{81815}{81843}Forever?
{81866}{81894}Shut up.
{82162}{82198}Not this time!
{82257}{82283}Bitch!
{82289}{82335}Time to die!
{82474}{82497}Die!
{82641}{82677}What are you doing?
{82707}{82801}- Stop!|- I can't! The master told me!
{82877}{82912}You stupid rock!
{83167}{83241}What does it take to get laid around here?
{83258}{83350}I had him! Ten more seconds,|and he was dead!
{83366}{83414}We thought you were in trouble.
{83424}{83492}Julie, it's too late.
{83507}{83567}It's not just about you and Tyler.
{83588}{83680}What Tyler seeks lies within the walls|of the Holylands.
{83705}{83806}He will come and we will all be judged.
{83845}{83912}What do you mean you can't find them?
{83932}{84038}How do you lose a 6-foot bitch|with a talking rock?
{84087}{84123}How do you do that?
{84126}{84210}- We looked everywhere.|- You idiots!
{84218}{84245}Gather the troops!
{84286}{84324}This is it?
{84362}{84459}I sure could use a drink|and a little social give and take.
{84520}{84565}There goes that idea.
{84961}{85065}Can we stop for a moment?|I'm not as young as I once was.
{85077}{85125}I'll see what lies beyond.
{85224}{85268}Eden was beautiful.
{85283}{85329}Then he destroyed it.
{85338}{85396}Master, come see!
{86012}{86081}It's time for the next phase.
{86156}{86179}Please.
{86188}{86262}In five minutes, you will lose all senses.
{86339}{86410}It will seem like a very peaceful dying.
{86426}{86492}What? We have company.
{87691}{87724}Do you like this?
{87948}{87994}You shouldn't have done that.
{88397}{88466}Now I'm really upset!
{88560}{88656}I am worried, Master.|The soft one has been inside too long.
{88706}{88767}Here, kitty.
{88799}{88847}I know where you are.
{88849}{88913}I can smell you.
{89076}{89104}Help me!
{89230}{89312}- Kerrie, what about the others?|- They're all dead.
{89361}{89391}Hang on to me.
{89528}{89554}It's okay.
{89599}{89628}Nearly there.
{89766}{89794}Hurry, run!
{90407}{90453}Isn't that where we crashed?
{90511}{90544}My ampoules!
{90798}{90862}I've had it up to here with that bitch!
{90874}{90995}When I find her, I'll make her immortal|so I can screw her and kill her...
{90999}{91093}every hour of every day for all eternity!
{91101}{91155}We march on the Holyland now!
{91349}{91417}Where the key goes, horror follows.
{91419}{91482}All in the sacred name of immortality.
{91511}{91537}Why us?
{91541}{91620}Do your ancient books|not teach you about the Arakacians?
{91623}{91664}We have no ancient books.
{91672}{91738}They were destroyed|so our people could live in peace...
{91740}{91793}without the memory of past evil.
{91822}{91914}To forget history is|to allow evil to rise again, Julie.
{91927}{91983}More sinister and ruthless than ever.
{91986}{92066}- Is Tyler an Arakacian?|- He is not.
{92072}{92174}Many centuries ago, the Arakacians|discovered an ancient tear...
{92179}{92263}in the fabric of the universe|from which flowed a liquid...
{92265}{92318}capable of bestowing immortality.
{92332}{92434}They enslaved my ancestors|and forced them to build a chamber...
{92437}{92524}in the Holylands to contain|this unnatural power.
{92548}{92628}And so it was that the Arakacians|ruled in infamy until...
{92630}{92751}my people were able to lock the chamber|and cast the key deep into space.
{92771}{92876}Without their life-giving waters,|the Arakacians became mortal...
{92895}{92958}and we were finally able to defeat them.
{92976}{93022}But now Tyler has the key.
{93025}{93107}Yes. The key which holds|the promise of immortality...
{93110}{93190}but also renders its bearer insane.
{93197}{93238}Such is the curse.
{93265}{93338}The promise of immortality?|He's already invincible.
{93340}{93392}No. He is not.
{93425}{93501}The key is guiding him|to the everlasting waters...
{93504}{93548}but he has yet to reach them.
{93550}{93601}Why did he have to destroy Eden?
{93606}{93678}The Arakacians also occupied your colony...
{93687}{93778}and stored some of the liquid there|as they ravaged the universe.
{93793}{93847}Over time it seeped into the earth.
{93851}{93930}Your people absorbed traces of it|into their systems.
{93937}{93997}Which Tyler distilled from their bodies!
{94032}{94088}Not enough to render him immortal...
{94090}{94160}but now he has the strength|to reach the chamber.
{94162}{94249}A whole people destroyed|because of the lust for power of one man.
{94260}{94356}It has happened before, Julie.|It will happen again.
{94385}{94417}Not with Tyler.
{95737}{95789}Welcome back, Master Odin!
{96153}{96240}- Odin, the key? ls it here?|- I'm afraid so.
{96256}{96299}As we speak, the carrier...
{96301}{96392}and the vile scum of Shantaar|descend upon our city.
{96414}{96516}We have done all we can to prepare.|We will fight to the death.
{99069}{99108}You know each other?
{99113}{99164}He tried to save me at the school.
{99177}{99210}It was nothing.
{99244}{99285}And where did you meet?
{99301}{99330}We're sisters.
{99361}{99389}Sisters!
{99419}{99488}The elders have been killed!|There's a traitor among us!
{99490}{99522}Warn the others!
{99583}{99611}There it is.
{99641}{99730}The Chamber of lmmortality,|that holds the everlasting waters.
{100686}{100716}The last one.
{101389}{101450}Everybody fight! Come on!
{102731}{102768}This is going to suck!
{104471}{104500}You fool!
{104514}{104565}That was my last one!
{105873}{105942}- Thank you, soft one.|- Anytime.
{106384}{106413}Hey, asshole!
{106452}{106478}You again!
{107855}{107894}Did you miss me?
{108273}{108331}You always hurt the ones you love.
{108340}{108371}Like this?
{108620}{108713}Hold that pose. I'll be right back.
{109364}{109451}It's mine. It's all mine!
{109934}{110029}Bring it on, bitch!|You're really starting to piss me off!
{110038}{110116}You are not worthy of the Holy Waters!
{110156}{110183}Not today.
{110802}{110869}Remember this on your way to hell!
{110942}{110974}FAKK 2!
{111021}{111114}The insanity has to end now.
{111255}{111305}We must destroy the key.
{111350}{111385}Perhaps not!
{111508}{111532}Why?
{111560}{111674}Because I am Arakacian!
{111680}{111761}My charade fooled|the insufferable Holylanders!
{111766}{111813}And even that little stone idiot!
{111815}{111889}What makes you think|a pathetic mortal could stop me?
{112735}{112774}You fools!
{113366}{113423}I must fulfil my destiny.
{113961}{114034}- You must!|- Zeek, I command you!
{114272}{114360}Good-bye, soft one. I'll never forget you.
{115194}{115220}It's over.
{115367}{115438}- Let me help you.|- Oh, no. He survived.
{115462}{115491}Are you okay?
{115507}{115570}What does it look like, you dickhead?
{115783}{115869}Eternity is a long time to spend alone.
{115886}{115930}What are you talking about?
{115966}{116031}Does this mean|we're all going to be immortal?
{116055}{116100}'Cause if that's true, you know....
{116102}{116168}Listen, I'm going to be around|for a long time.
{116185}{116219}Who took the key?
{116231}{116276}Does this mean we're friends now?
{116278}{116348}'Cause I've been putting up|with a lot of your crap, so...
{116364}{116448}l think it's payback time.|Come on, you know you love me.
{116919}{117026}And so the key to the chamber|of immortality...
{117028}{117149}was once again cast out|into the silent gulfs of space...
{117189}{117314}with a new stone protector|to guard it against evil.
Moorgate Passage.
Moorgate Passage.
I see it over there!
Bleeding rat-wags!
What's gotten into them?
What in God's name is that?
Halt!
Halt!
- Blimey!
- Stop!
- Come on!
- Halt!
In the name of the law!
- Halt!
- How the hell do we stop this thing?
I said, halt!
Here.
Careful, mates. Careful.
There's men inside!
Please.
Bring the scientist with us.
Kill any who resist.
Do we have him?
Draper at your service, sir.
The world, Herr Draper.
I want the world.
Really?
That's so frightening.
Don't wander off.
Where's Quatermain?
That gentleman at the back.
Do I have the pleasure of addressing
Allan Quatermain?
Yes, you do, sir. Indeed you do.
You're not what I expected.
I presume you're another traveler...
...got it in your head to sample the Dark Continent.
And while you're at it, hunt down old Allan Quatermain...
...and have him tell his adventures.
- Well...
- You just fill a seat, sir.
You can fill my glass.
Bruce, double.
I'll regale you with how I found King
Solomon's Mines, or I could relate my...
It is not your past that interests me.
My name is Sanderson Reed.
I am a representative of Her Majesty's British government.
The empire needs you.
But the question is...
...do I need the empire?
Perhaps I should toddle off.
Should I, Allan?
Yes, of course, Nigel, you toddle off.
Toddling.
Nigel is useful for keeping the story seekers at bay.
I'm Quatermain.
The empire is in peril.
You're probably too young to know, but the empire is always in some peril.
We need you to lead a team of unique men like yourself...
...to combat this threat.
Regale me.
There is great unrest, countries set at each other's throats, baying for blood.
The trouble of which I speak could set a match to the whole thing. War.
- With whom, exactly?
- Everyone.
A world war.
- That notion makes you sweat?
- Heavens, man, doesn't it you?
This is Africa, dear boy.
Sweating is what we do.
Where is your sense of patriotism?
God save the queen.
- God save the queen. God bless her.
- God save the queen.
That's about as patriotic as it gets around here.
But you're Allan Quatermain.
Stories of your exploits have thrilled
English boys for decades.
That I know, and Nigel has done a grand job reminding me.
But with each past exploit...
...l've lost friends.
White men and black...
...and much more.
And I am not the man I once was.
The gentleman over there.
- We're in for the long haul.
- Exactly.
- Mr. Quatermain?
- Why, yes indeed, sir.
Wrong Quatermain.
That's him.
Get down!
- They're indestructible.
- No, just armor-plated.
Automatic rifles? Who in God's name has automatic rifles?
That's unsporting. Probably Belgium.
Allan!
Wicked waste.
Look out!
Good old Britannia.
Wasn't there another one of these buggers?
Mr. Quatermain!
Bruce, Matilda.
Our friend might have some information.
But he's so far away.
Yes, I thought he was.
God, I hate getting old.
- Did you mean to just wound him?
- Obviously.
Stop him! I need information!
Bloody poison.
You may have no love for the empire, but I know you love Africa.
A war in Europe will spread to its colonies.
It appears the war has arrived.
Very well, Reed...
...l'm in.
Excellent.
Pack for an English summer.
You made good time getting here.
Not as good as Phileas Fogg,
Around the World in 80 Days.
Where are we going, Australia?
And here we are, sir.
I don't like theatrics.
After Africa's veldts, London's weather isn't helping your mood, I see.
Identify yourself.
I'm known by many names,
Mr. Quatermain.
My underlings call me sir.
My superiors call me M.
M?
Just M.
I must say, the delight is mine, meeting so notable a recruit...
...to this newest generation of the
League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.
League of what?
There have been times when a danger upon the world...
...required the services of singular individuals.
How very curious.
This museum is full of the curious.
Allan Quatermain, Captain Nemo.
I know of Mr. Quatermain.
And I know of you, captain.
Rumor has it that you're a pirate.
I'd prefer a less provocative title.
- I'm sure you would.
- Gentlemen, please.
Nations are striking at nations.
Every attack marked by the use of highly advanced weaponry.
These attacks are all the work of one man...
...who calls himself the Fantom.
- Very operatic. What's in it for him?
Profit.
Those machines are his creations, the work of scientists he holds imprisoned.
His attacks have nations clamoring for the weapons that assail them.
- Then it's a race for arms.
- And millions will perish.
There's one last chance to avert war.
The leaders of Europe are to meet secretly in venice.
And you believe that this Fantom will attack that conference?
If he can find it.
We need a team to stop him in venice.
This team consists of six members.
- You'll have four days.
- Four days to get to venice?
- It's impossible.
- Let me worry about that.
Well now, extraordinary gentlemen indeed.
One of them is late.
- Harker, the chemist.
- Oh, chemist, eh?
Do we get to blow something up then?
My eyesight must be worse than I thought.
No, your eyesight's fine.
No games, M.
Some time ago, a talented, albeit misguided, man of science...
...discovered the means to become invisible.
- Yes, I recall the tale, but didn't he die?
- Well, he did, but his process didn't.
You see, I stole it, and here I stand for all to see.
- Is this some parlor game?
- Believe it.
Easy now, Allan.
I'm feeling a bit of a draft in my nether regions.
And I must say, it's quite refreshing.
Allow me to introduce myself.
Rodney Skinner, gentleman thief.
Now, I thought invisibility would be a boon to my work.
Well, you can imagine, it was my undoing.
Once you're invisible, it's bloody hard to turn back.
We finally caught him.
And they'll provide an antidote.
Well, that's if I'm a good boy.
And are you a good boy?
I guess you'll find out, won't you?
Am I late?
A woman's prerogative, Mrs. Harker.
Please tell me this is Harker's wife with a sick note.
Sick would be a mild understatement.
My husband's been dead for years.
Gentlemen, Mrs. Wilhelmina Harker.
Mina's prior acquaintance with a reluctant League member...
...may prove useful.
- I'm waiting to be impressed.
The fate of the world is at stake.
There are two more members to recruit.
- The clock hands turn, gentlemen.
- Kicking us out already?
A moment ago, it was sherry and giggles.
- What in God's name is that?
- I call it an automobile.
Yeah, but what is it?
The future, gentlemen.
The future.
- This is my first mate.
- Call me Ishmael. Please.
So how did M get you?
None of your business.
You're a little testy, Mr. Q.
Mrs. Harker, I doubt if you measure danger the way I do.
And I imagine you with quite the library,
Mr. Quatermain.
All those books you must have read merely by looking at their covers.
I've had women along on past exploits and found them to be, at best...
...a distraction.
- Do I distract you?
My dear girl, I've buried two wives and many lovers...
...and I'm in no mood for more of either.
- You can send them my way...
- Skinner, shut up.
- Shall I wait, captain?
- No, bring my lady to me.
This is a charming spot.
Does Jack the Ripper live here?
- Good evening.
- Mr. Dorian Gray?
- I am indeed.
- We came by way of M.
M for mystery.
Well, I've told him and I'm telling you,
I'm not interested.
Dorian.
Mina?
Charming d¨¦cor.
You're missing a picture, Mr. Gray.
And you don't miss a thing, do you?
Oh, sometimes.
Scotch, anyone?
Please, help yourself.
Don't let it ruin your makeup.
I'm impressed, Mr. Gray. You take
Skinner's uniqueness in your stride.
Yes, well, I've seen too much in my life to shock easily.
Although, I must say
I was surprised to see you again.
Well, our last parting was such sweet sorrow.
So you're nothing more than an enticement.
Nevertheless, your presence intrigues me.
They say you're indestructible,
Quatermain.
Well, a witch doctor did bless me once.
I had saved his village.
He said Africa would never allow me to die.
But you're not in Africa now.
No.
I confess a curiosity as to what the files say about Mr. Gray.
We, all of us, have traits useful in this endeavor.
A hunter, scientist, even Skinner has stealth.
- Cheers.
- What have you?
I have experience.
Gray and I have met before, many years ago at Eton College.
A lecture, no doubt.
You, the nation's hero,
Dorian, the eager listening boy.
Quite the reverse.
It was Gray visiting Eton...
...and I was the boy.
What is it?
- Gray?
- They are not mine.
They're mine.
First meetings usually warrant introductions.
Of course. I am the Fantom.
You are the League of so-called
Extraordinary Gentlemen.
Introductions made.
Oh, and I'm scarred, Mr. Quatermain, not blind.
Drop the gun.
Your mission is to stop me.
That, of course, I cannot permit.
So I give to you all a special one-time invitation.
Join me.
You think we'll help start a war that will consume the planet?
While you profit from your arms race?
I cannot deny that fortunes are made in war.
Imagine the riches a world war will yield.
- He's not wrong.
- Speak for yourself.
Draw your pistol!
I walk a different path.
Run, James!
Hang on.
Night-night.
Dorian!
What are you?
I'm complicated.
Damn.
I thought I was special.
You're invulnerable to harm.
I don't like to boast.
What happened to Mina?
Oh, she's probably hip-deep in some sort of trouble.
Don't be such an alarmist, Mr. Q.
And my hips are none of your business.
Shoot!
Go on!
I guessed as much, that they would do anything to protect you.
See, now that's your biggest mistake.
Thinking that I need them to protect me.
Extraordinary.
Boy, they told me European women had funny ways.
You missed a spot.
Excuse me.
And you are?
Special Agent Sawyer of the American Secret Service.
Then America is aware of the situation?
If war starts in Europe, how long will it take until it crosses the Atlantic?
I followed you. I knocked out a straggler, and I took his place.
Very noble. But this is a private party, and you're not invited.
Actually, Dorian has declined...
...so we are one shy of a full deck.
On the contrary, the battle was just the spur I needed.
That and the thrill of a friendship renewed.
So you're not needed.
- Winchester.
- That's right.
- It's modified, American style.
- American-style shooting too.
Well, whatever it takes.
You like it, I brought two.
You're in.
- So, what's the next port of call?
- Paris.
Just one last member to recruit.
Capture is more the word, and it will be quite a hunt.
You make him sound like some kind of animal.
Oh, speaking thus, Mrs. Harker, your conduct a moment ago?
Indeed. We are all aquiver with curiosity.
Well...
My husband was Jonathan Harker.
With a professor named van Helsing, we fought a dangerous evil.
It had a name, Dracula.
He was Transylvanian.
European?
One of those radicals the newspapers love to report on?
I don't know, Mr. Skinner.
Is the vampiric sucking of people's blood radical behavior?
Our transportation is forthcoming.
A boat?
It travels on water, if that's what you mean.
And beneath it.
Behold Nautilus, the Sword of the Ocean.
Next stop, Paris.
I don't see what we need a big monkey for.
Well, this big monkey has terrorized the Rue Morgue for months.
Imagine the mayhem he'll give the enemy.
- You missed!
- I'm not trying to hit him.
Turn left, Mr. Hyde.
Make him turn left, boy.
If you can't do it with one bullet, don't do it at all.
- He's doubled back.
- Precisely. Come on.
Look out!
That was naughty.
- Thanks.
- Eyes open, boy.
I can't protect you all the time.
He's afraid.
I can't smell anything.
Perfect.
Welcome aboard, Mr. Hyde.
"This hunt's too dangerous for a woman, even one such as you. Leave it to me."
Good God.
Hello, Dorian.
The great white hunter's bagged his prize.
Or the prize bagged him.
Stay back, if you value your life.
- You scratched me.
- Better me than him.
Well, this is nice.
Mr. Hyde.
You've done terrible things in England.
So terrible that you fled the country.
Now, I'm ashamed to say that
Her Majesty's government...
...is willing to offer you amnesty...
...in return for your services.
Do you want to go home?
Home?
"Home's where the heart is," that's what they say.
And I have been missing London so.
Its sorrow is as sweet to me as a rare wine.
I am yours.
Don't be afraid.
- Who says I'm afraid?
- You do!
You stink of fear!
Quite the parlor trick.
You wait till you see my next one.
Dr. Jekyll...
...at your service.
So...
...the League is set.
So is the date for the conference.
- We have three days.
- Three days?
Can this canoe do that?
You underestimate the Nautilus, sir.
You underestimate her greatly.
She's out of your league.
Mina?
Don't flatter yourself, Dorian.
Fortune rewards the bold.
If you require help during the voyage,
Mrs. Harker, just let me know.
I'm curious how you think you'll assist me, Agent Sawyer.
Heavy lifting.
Light banter.
- I'm a useful kind of guy.
- You're sweet.
And you're young.
Neither are traits that I hold in high regard.
The solar panels are fully charged.
We'll be diving in a moment.
Mr. Quatermain.
Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Skinner.
- Captain.
- Nemo.
The plans the Fantom stole from the Bank of England. These are copies.
Da vinci's blueprints of venice.
Its foundations...
...and waterways.
So he'll attack the conference by sea.
Easy, Allan, easy.
Skinner! I want you dressed at all times!
Or it's my boot up your ass!
Dinner is served, Mr. Quatermain.
I can offer you a jacket, if you require.
Oh, thank you, no.
But thank you for your contributions so far.
I may have been overly rude earlier...
...when I called you a pirate.
And I may have been overly charitable when I said I wasn't.
But I try to live in the now...
...where the ghosts of old wrongs do not abide. What of you?
I don't believe in ghosts, although I've seen my share.
Your past haunts you.
Vanity, pride...
...mistakes that cost me someone dear.
So now you throw yourself in harm's way?
Old tigers, sensing the end, they're at their most fierce.
And they go down fighting.
They're not how I left them, captain.
That's all I'm saying.
Powder?
You think sabotage?
We ain't that far off course.
Did you want something?
No, I was just wondering why you signed up for all this.
Nemo told me you hate the British Empire.
They called, and I answered.
Yeah, well that ain't all of it, though, is it?
Sorry I asked.
A few years ago...
...the British approached me with a mission for queen and country.
That sounds like the morning ride to work for you.
I signed on without hesitation.
I even took my son along.
I led and my son followed.
He died in my arms.
After that, I washed my hands of England and the empire and...
...the legend of
Allan-bloody-Quatermain.
Now...
...would you like to learn how to shoot?
- I can already.
- I saw, it was very American.
Fire enough bullets and hope to hit the target.
Sawyer, I'm talking about pipping the ace...
...at 900 yards.
Try.
Easy, easy.
- Aim.
- That's easy.
Allow for wind, target movement.
- Yeah, that's easy too.
- This is the part that's not.
You have to feel the shot.
Take your time with it.
You have all the time you need.
All the time in the world.
Take your...
Too soon.
But that was bloody close.
And at 500 yards too.
Again.
Did you teach your son to shoot like this?
Quatermain?
That's Kali.
Goddess of death.
Nemo worships death, can we trust him?
He's not the one I'm worried about.
Mina.
I'm identifying a powder that Nemo found.
Magnesium phosphorus.
Photographers use it to create a flash.
A camera, perhaps?
It appears that someone wishes to capture this vessel's secrets.
I was surprised you ultimately joined the League.
I mean to undo the flaws in my character.
I want to face my demons.
And what do you know of demons?
Do you recall a space on the wall of my home?
A picture was missing.
Although the picture is my portrait...
...I doubt you'd recognize the face upon it.
Every year that passes, my portrait ages...
...instead of me.
When did you last see it?
I dare not look upon it myself...
...or the magic of the painting would be undone.
Nightcap?
I'm not much of a drinker.
Just a small one then.
How clumsy of me.
We don't want blood everywhere.
- Do we?
- No.
Not blood.
Yes, Henry. Look, but don't touch.
That's your way.
Just shut up.
- I won't be tricked again.
- Tricked?
You've known what I was about each time you drank the formula.
Liar! I'm a good man, a good man!
Well, who's lying now?
You want it!
Even more than you want her.
You can't shut me out forever!
- Drink the elixir!
- No!
- She barely even looks at you!
- Be quiet!
She looked at me!
Contain your evil, doctor!
I'll not have the brute free upon my ship.
Must I take drastic steps?
- I am in control.
- I very much doubt it.
Your talk is all well and good, sir, but your own past is far from laudable.
Let me out.
If I didn't know better,
I'd swear I already had.
One of the vials is missing.
Oh, God.
So it's clear. With da vinci's blueprints and enough explosives...
...he could set a bomb that would blow venice's foundations to rubble.
- He's gonna sink the whole city.
- Yes, and spark off his world war.
I'm afraid that's not the sum of our problems.
Skinner, he's taken a vial of my formula.
- Are you sure?
- Who else?
You've seen the way the sneaky blackguard operates.
It's the carnival.
My God, we must locate that bomb.
We can go no further, captain.
All ahead, stop.
Deploy the divers beneath the city.
- The explosives must be found.
- Aye, aye, sir.
The city is vast. It could be anywhere.
- What about Skinner?
- I'd be alert for his treachery.
Bloody carnival.
God, I feared the worst.
It's all right. We still have...
- The buildings are falling like dominoes!
- We're too late!
There must be more than one bomb.
Nemo!
The bombs are at the city's center.
We must take out one key building.
- Get ahead and destroy the next building!
- Interrupt the chain!
With a beacon at the coordinates, I could launch a rocket and take out the domino.
That's ridiculous!
We'd never get there in time.
- No room for error, but it could work.
- What are you talking about?
I'm an immortal, sir, not a gazelle.
How can we outrun this?
Care for a spin?
Come on, Jekyll, get in!
- I'll need coordinates.
- Can you track this?
- Of course.
- Then this is the target.
- Launch when you see the flare.
- Right.
- Jekyll, come on, we'll need Hyde.
- No!
Hyde will never use me again.
Then what good are you?
Straight ahead, then turn left.
No, no, take a right after the canal ports.
We must turn left to get ahead of the...
Snipers!
Damn Skinner, he must have told them we were coming.
Dorian!
- Can't get a clear shot!
- Then take the wheel!
Sawyer!
Sit down, you buffoon. I don't know how to drive this bloody thing!
Get down!
Got it!
Save your bullets. These men are mine!
Did you see that?
- Did you see what she just did?
- Keep your eyes on the road!
It's a gauntlet!
The vampire lady has us covered!
The collapse has reached the carnival.
Time's running out.
Tune the tracer to the car's frequency.
- The rocket must be ready to launch.
- Aye, aye, captain.
Come on, Sawyer, come on!
- Captain, we must pull out!
- No, we stay and do our job!
Remember the flare. I'm off!
- What?
- Don't forget, you're the target.
- We'll be smashed apart!
- Nemo says we stay, we stay.
He's overtaken the collapse!
Be ready to launch!
Launch!
Bravo, boy.
He's done it.
Venice still stands.
You've failed.
You see yourself as the brave
John Bull.
But you're weak.
You run from the memory of your son's death.
You should have trained him a little better.
You may as well have put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger yourself.
Oh, yes, I know all about you.
I know all about your spy.
Do you?
Mr. Gray? What happened?
Misadventure. Have the others returned?
You're the first, hopefully not the last.
That bastard, Skinner.
A lot to answer for.
Skinner? No.
Me.
You?
You don't know the half of it.
The Fantom is M.
And the hunt is still on.
- What are you talking about?
- The Fantom is M...
...the man who recruited us.
- Let me see that.
- But how?
- We'll get our answers.
- Where are the others?
- Dorian's missing in action.
And Mr. Skinner must have fled when he realized we knew.
And Sawyer?
He'll live to fight another day.
Don't worry, I've had my fill of throats for this evening.
Captain!
It was Gray...
...not Skinner.
Gray has tricked us all.
What is it?
The sound of treachery!
What is that thing?
My exploration pod.
- We could track it.
- I intend to catch it!
That is us.
That is the Nautiloid.
We will be upon them soon.
You okay?
Just a little shaken.
Nemo?
It's nothing of mine.
Captain, the noise came from this.
A recording disk?
Ready, professor?
Recording.
Gentlemen, if you're hearing this...
...then every step leading up to it has gone as planned.
And I have been true to the goals set to me.
Yes, it's me, Dorian.
As you know by now,
I'm no loyal son of the Empire.
My loyalty to Mr. M comes in no small part from his possession...
...of something I hold very dear to my heart...
...something I would do anything to regain.
- Are you all right?
- My ears hurt. It's nothing.
Everything so far has been misdirection.
Sanderson Reed, the assassins in Kenya...
...your recruitment and mission, the secret conference, a myth.
Even the League itself. There is no League. There never was.
It was a ruse to get me closer to my goals.
He likes the sound of his own voice.
You see, I want you, each of you, even tired old Ouatermain.
He'll capture Hyde where all others have failed.
The question is why.
Why all this mask and mystery?
Because in the war to come, I intend to wield the greatest weapon of all:
The power of the League itself.
Turn it off, Henry.
Please, turn it off.
To that end, I set my wolf among you sheep...
Growl.
...who'll gain your trust, quietly lead you astray.
And all the while, I'll collect you, the parts of you I need.
Nemo's science.
Magnesium phosphorus.
Skinner's skin sample.
You scratched me.
Jekyll's potion.
And Mina's blood.
He's stolen us, and we let him.
If you fail to save venice, then I get my war.
And if you succeed...
...well, it's a small price to pay for Gray to go about his task.
War will come, sooner or later...
...as inevitable as summer into autumn.
Now, some of you, perhaps Ouatermain if he isn't dead...
...will pause to ask why I'm letting you know all this.
What fool reveals his stratagem before the game is over?
It is over, for you...
...because my voice isn't the only sound being made.
While I've rambled on, a secondary layer of inaudible sound...
...higher than humans can hear, audible to dogs and lower animals...
...has been heard by crystal sensors dotted about your vessel.
Sensors attached to bombs.
"Bomb" voyage.
Out of the way!
We have to surface!
We're taking in water!
Controls are not responding!
Primary engine room almost full!
Aft bulkhead open. Pump valves jammed!
- Seal it off!
- There are men in there!
For the greater good, we must seal it!
We can do it, Henry.
What are you talking about?
You know we can do it, together!
Seal it! Seal it up!
Wait!
Don't close it!
- What are you doing?
- It's our last chance.
But I'm ordered to close it!
Then close it.
Seal it up.
Bravo, Edward. Bravo!
Let's not make a saint out of a sinner.
Next time, he may not be so helpful.
Can we still follow Gray?
Well, we were the faster, but now we're the tortoise to his hare.
- So we're done?
- No, we're alive.
If M has any ideas to the contrary, that gives us an edge.
We're getting a signal.
Morse code.
- What's it say?
- "Hello, my freaky darlings."
Skinner?
"Hiding onboard little fish with Gray and M.
On way to base, east by northeast.
Follow my lead."
Good work...
...all of you.
Captain?
All ahead, full!
If Skinner's headings are correct...
...we will pass through the treacherous Straits of Tartary...
...and enter the Amur River, which empties out...
...into the frozen lakes of Mongolia, virtually inaccessible to outsiders.
Peasant settlements.
They're all deserted.
Why deserted?
Fear, no doubt.
M's summer retreat.
This is where Skinner signaled he'd meet us.
So we wait.
Skinner?
- We heard a noise.
- It was nothing.
Just an old tiger sensing his end.
Perhaps this was not his time to die after all.
- I've been waiting all week to do that.
- Get a grip, man.
Well, I thought I just did.
Mina.
- Report!
- Well, hello to you too.
And need I remind you,
I am naked in the snow.
I can't feel any of my extremities, and I mean any of them.
With all the suspicion on the ship...
...I knew you wouldn't believe
I wasn't the spy.
I thought it was best to disappear.
So, what are we dealing with?
The fortress is vast.
Furnaces produce iron for making
M's weapons of destruction.
They're pieced together on the factory floor by a private army of ruthless men...
...who share his vision.
But the worst was to come.
In the dry dock, M's best minds pervert Nemo's dream.
- The Nautilus?
- Nautili. There's eight, for now.
- What about the kidnapped scientists?
- M holds their families hostage.
The men work, or the women and children die.
- Monstrous!
- That isn't the half of it.
The scientists are forced to work night and day to make new versions of us.
Invisible spies, an army of Hydes, vampiric assassins.
M leaves for Europe today with a sample of the chemicals...
...to sell to the most eager nation.
- I'll not let my evil infect the world.
- Do you think any of us feel differently?
Chimney pipes laced to buildings...
...and bombs in the furnaces would make quite a bang.
But someone needs to blow that place to hell, and I am least likely to be seen.
Skinner, I didn't know that you were such a bare-faced liar.
All that time pretending that you weren't a hero?
Shut up, or I'll come to my senses.
And besides, any more like me, and I'll lose the franchise.
No, this cannot be a hunt to the death, more's the pity.
We must take M alive if his secrets are to be uncovered.
Not Gray.
He's lived long enough.
- Oh, I'll handle him.
- No.
Nemo, you and Hyde will free the prisoners.
Sawyer and I will deal with M.
Then the game is on.
Do you mind?
Night-night.
Your painting's in your room.
In return for the League, that was our deal, and I'm glad to see you honor it.
So, what now?
London. I've had my fill of violence.
Now I'm in the mood for vice.
You could stay, share my dream.
I've lived long enough to see the future become history, professor.
Empires crumble.
There are no exceptions.
You think you're better than me.
You forget, I've seen your painting.
Skinner said turn right at the column.
Oh, great. Which one?
This way.
You lead, and I'll follow.
The scientists.
They're for Nemo.
Prepare the armaments for shipment.
Prepare the armaments for shipment.
They're moving out.
Let's hope Skinner's up to the task.
You, help him out!
Release them!
Quietly!
Get them back to the ship.
Intruders! Intruders!
Intruders!
James, here's your box of tricks!
The brute's potion, the vampire's blood...
...the Indian's science and mounted samples of invisible skin.
They'll be all the rage in Europe.
The Nautiloid is fueled and ready.
- We have trouble.
- Trouble? I call it sport.
Intruders! Indians! I think it's
Captain Nemo and his men!
The prisoners are escaping!
How many times do I have to kill these cretins?
- Make this the last.
- Damn them.
Nemo, get the scientists!
Is that all you've got?
Do not move, M.
Or would you prefer
Professor James Moriarty?
James Moriarty, the so-called Napoleon of crime?
That man died at Reichenbach Falls.
He died, and I was reborn.
Watch out!
Eyes open, boy.
Can't protect you all of the time.
Hello, lover.
Mina.
You're alive.
It's possible I can't die.
The same could be said of you.
Let's put it to the test.
- Minx.
- Do you realize what you've done?
What you've let out of me?
A woman's wrath. Oh, I'm petrified!
We'll be at this all day.
The bedroom, Mina, does it give you memories or ideas?
Ideas.
If that had been permanent,
I'd have been very upset.
Your painting.
I hoped I'd get to nail you one more time.
I didn't think it'd be literally.
Skinner?
It's okay. It's Skinner.
What the hell are you doing here?
What makes you think I'm Skinner?
Sawyer!
Run for it!
Keep moving!
Go over! Go, quickly!
Come on! You want more?
No!
Not the whole thing.
You are so lovely.
Thank you.
You broke my heart once.
This time you missed.
You spoke once of wanting to meet your demon.
Here he is.
Skinner?
That's the last time I play with matches.
End of the line, Moriarty.
To the death, but you'll need Hyde to make it mine.
He'll be making his own fun.
Nemo!
Here!
Nemo!
Nemo, run!
What is that thing?
It's me on a bad day.
He's too strong. We're trapped.
No, he's burning through the formula at an accelerated rate.
He'll soon change back.
Nemo!
I hope I've got your fire when I'm your age.
You will not live beyond today.
That I promise you.
Hyde. Come on.
My formula's done.
Watch out!
Think you'll come in here and wreck this? I'll rebuild it.
There'll be others like me,
Quatermain.
You can't kill the future.
Do you ever get tired of being wrong?
The League, me, Skinner.
Wrong.
Wrong about your little
American friend as well.
Do you really think he's ready for action?
I think you've trained him about as well as you trained your son.
Get him.
- It's too far.
- Take your time.
You're ready.
Take your time.
I got him.
May this new century be yours, son...
...as the old one was mine.
You remember he swore Africa wouldn't let him die?
I wish the old boy had been right.
What's next?
I have long hidden away from the world.
Now I wish to see it anew as the century turns.
You're all welcome to join me.
We've all been hiding in one form or another.
The Nautilus awaits.
So who's coming?
So long, old chap.
Goodbye, Allan.
Goodbye.
Thanks.

[man's voice] Once upon a time in a kingdom far, far away, the king and queen were blessed with a beautiful baby girl.
And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night.
Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming.
[horse whinnies]
It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep.
[crows caw]
For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land.
And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse.
He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her... [gasps]
What?
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!
[sighs relier] Oh, thank heavens.
Where is she?
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?
[ Counting Crows: Accidentally In Love]
So she said what's the problem, baby?
What's the problem?
I don't know
Well, maybe I'm in love
Think about it every time I think 'bout it
Can't stop thinking 'bout it
How much longer will it take to cure this?
Just to cure it,
'cause I can't ignore it
If it's love, love
Makes me wanna turn around and face me
But I don't know nothing
'bout love
Oh, come on, come on
- [screams]
-  Turn a little faster
Come on, come on
The world will follow after
Come on, come on
Everybody's after love
So I said
I'm a snowball running
Running down into this spring that's coming all this love
Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight
Shimmering love
Well, baby, I surrender
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well, I didn't mean to do it
But there's no escaping your love
These lines of lightning mean we're never alone
Never alone, no, no
Come on, come on
Jump a little higher
Come on, come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on, come on
We were once upon a time in love
Hyah!
We're accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally
I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
Accidentally in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
It's so good to be home!
- [distant singing]
- [giggling]
Just you and me and...
[Donkey sings]
- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes!
Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine.
[chuckles]
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek.
How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed?
Donkey, what are you doing here?
Taking care of your love nest for you.
Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants?
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.
You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona.
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...
Look at the time.
I guess you'd better be going.
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon?
Oh, yeah, that.
I don't know.
She's been all moody and stuff lately.
I thought I'd move in with you.
You know we're always happy to see you, Donkey.
But Fiona and I are married now.
We need a little time, you know, to be together.
Just with each other.
Alone.
Say no more.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you.
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?
You're bothering me.
Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess...
Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so...
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue or something.
He'll be fine.
Now, where were we?
[giggles] Oh.
I think I remember.
- Donkey!
- [Fiona yelps]
I know, I know! Alone!
I'm going! I'm going.
What do you want me to tell these other guys?
[fanfare]
[theme to Hawaii Five-O]
Enough, Reggie.
[clears throat] "Dearest Princess Fiona.
"You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away
"for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage
"at which time the King
"will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your..." uh... "Prince Charming.
"Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away.
"aka Mom and Dad."
Mom and Dad?
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?
- We're not going.
- [both] What?
I mean, don't you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this?
[chuckles] Well, they might be a bit surprised.
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.
Yeah, right.
Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome at the country club.
Stop it.
They're not like that.
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band?
Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance.
To do what?
Sharpen their pitchforks?
No! They just want to give you their blessing.
Oh, great.
Now I need their blessing?
If you want to be a part of this family, yes!
Who says I want to be part of this family?
You did!
When you married me!
Well, there's some fine print for you!
[exasperated sigh]
So that's it. You won't come?
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going! And that's final!
Come on!
We don't want to hit traffic!
[Gingy] Don't worry!
We'll take care of everything.
[all cheer]
- Hey, wait for me. Oof!
- [glass breaks]
[sighs]
[ Chic: Le Freak]
Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!
Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!
Ride 'em up! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide!
Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks!
Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!
Rawhide!
Yee-haw!
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] No.
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Fiona] Not yet.
- [Donkey] OK, are we there yet?
- [Fiona] No.
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] No!
- [Donkey] Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] Yes.
- Really?
- No!
- Are we there yet?
- [Fiona] No!
- Are we there yet?
- [Shrek] We are not!
- Are we there yet?
- [Shrek & Fiona] No!
- Are we there yet?
- [Shrek mimics]
- That's not funny. That's really immature.
- [Shrek mimics]
- This is why nobody likes ogres.
- [Shrek mimics]
- Your loss!
- [Shrek mimics]
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!
This is taking forever, Shrek.
There's no in-flight movie or nothing!
The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey.
That's where we're going.
Far, far...
[softly] away!
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.
Well, find a way to entertain yourself.
[sighs]
[deep sigh]
[clicks tongue]
[popping]
- [popping]
- [exasperated sigh]
For five minutes...
Could you not be yourself...
[shouts] ...for five minutes!
- [popping]
- [shrieks]
Are we there yet?
- [chuckles] Yes!
- Oh, finally!
[fanfare]
[Lipps, Inc: Funkytown]
Wow!
It's going to be champagne wishes and caviar dreams from now on.
Hey, good-looking!
We'll be back to pick you up later!
Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me
We are definitely not in the swamp anymore.
[whistle] Halt!
Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it
Hey, everyone, look.
Talk about, talk about movin'...
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.
[Donkey] Swimming pools!
Movie stars!
[cheering]
[applause]
[fanfare]
Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband.
Well, this is it.
- This is it.
- This is it.
This is it.
[fanfare]
[fanfare and cheering stop]
[gasps]
[tweeting]
[baby wails]
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.
[chuckles] So... you still think this was a good idea?
Of course! Look.
Mom and Dad look happy to see us.
- [softly] Who on earth are they?
- [softly] I think that's our little girl.
That's not little!
That's a really big problem.
Wasn't she supposed to kiss
Prince Charming and break the spell?
Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they do look...
[softly] Happy now?
We came. We saw them.
Now let's go before they light the torches.
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.
That was for my own...
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home.
Harold, we have to be...
Quick! While they're not looking we can make a run for it.
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...
A disaster! There is no way...
- You can do this.
- I really...
- Really...
- don't... want... to... be...
Here!
Mom... Dad...
I'd like you to meet my husband...
Shrek.
Well, um...
It's easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from.
[chuckles nervously]
[gulps]
[belches]
- Excuse me.
- [Shrek & Fiona laugh]
Better out than in,
I always say, eh, Fiona?
[both giggle]
[Shrek] That's good.
I guess not.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.
- I had the hardest time finding this place.
- No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!
No, Dad! It's all right.
It's all right. He's with us.
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: the noble steed.
Waiter!
How 'bout a bowl for the steed?
Oh, boy.
[slurps]
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?
Oh, sorry!
Great soup, Mrs Q.
Mmm!
No, no. Darling.
[chuckles nervously] Oh!
So, Fiona, tell us about where you live.
Well...
Shrek owns his own land.
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!
It's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and...
[laughing] What?
I know you ain't talking about the swamp.
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.
I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children.
- [splutters]
- [chokes]
It's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it?
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, OK?
- For his type, yes.
- My type?
I got to go to the bathroom.
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.
Bon appetit!
Oh, Mexican food!
My favorite.
Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in.
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.
I suppose any grandchildren
I could expect from you would be...
Ogres, yes!
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!
That is, assuming you don't eat your own young!
Dad!
No, we usually prefer the ones who've been locked away in a tower!
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.
Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle.
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!
It's so nice to have the family together for dinner.
- Harold!
- Shrek!
- Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Mom!
- Harold...
Donkey!
[glissando]
Your fallen tears have called to me
So, here comes my sweet remedy
I know what every princess needs
For her to live life happily...
[both gasp]
Oh, my dear.
Oh, look at you.
You're all grown up.
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!
I'm your fairy godmother.
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.
Now, don't worry.
I'm here to make it all better.
With just a...
Wave of my magic wand
Your troubles will soon be gone
With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash
A high-priced dress made by mice no less
Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress
Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse
Confide in your very own furniture friends
We'll help you set a new fashion trend
-  I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great
-  The kind of girl a prince would date!
They'll write your name on the bathroom wall...
"For a happy ever after, give Fiona a call!"
A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle
Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away
And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!'
Nip and tuck, here and there to land that prince with the perfect hair
Lipstick liners, shadows blush
To get that prince with the sexy tush
Lucky day, hunk buffet
You and your prince take a roll in the hay
You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune
Don't be drab, you'll be fab
Your prince will have rock-hard abs
Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!
Nip and tuck, here and there
To land that prince with the perfect hair
Stop!
[chuckles] Look...
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother, but I really don't need all this.
[gasps and mutterings of disapproval]
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.
- [knocking]
- [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona?
[dog barks]
Oh! You got a puppy?
All I got in my room was shampoo.
Oh, uh...
Fairy Godmother, furniture...
[giggles]
I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek.
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?
Shrek is the one who rescued me.
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!
She's just trying to help.
Good! She can help us pack.
Get your coat, dear. We're leaving.
- What?
- I don't want to leave.
When did you decide this?
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.
But remember, dear.
If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away.
Thanks, but we've got all the happiness we need.
Happy, happy, happy...
[laughs] So I see.
Let's go, Kyle.
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?
I told you coming here was a bad idea.
You could've at least tried to get along with my father.
I don't think I was going to get
Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it.
Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted?
Sure. Do you want me to pack for you?
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!
Here's a news flash for you!
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!
- [yelps]
- [roars]
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"
[mimics Shrek roaring]
[sniffling]
I knew this would happen.
[Lillian] You should.
You started it.
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.
I think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally.
This is Fiona's choice.
But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her.
I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing?
Fiona does.
And she'll never forgive you if you don't.
I don't want to lose our daughter again, Harold.
Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable.
Don't you remember when we were young?
We used to walk down by the lily pond and...
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.
It's not the same!
I don't think you realize that our daughter has married a monster!
Oh, stop being such a drama king.
Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong!
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!
I'd like to know how it could get any worse!
- Hello, Harold.
- [gasps]
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!
Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit!
[chuckles]
I'll just stretch it out here for a while.
You better get in.
We need to talk.
Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed.
[yawns] Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy.
So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What?
Oh, hello.
Ha-ha-ha!
So, what's new?
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.
When did you get back?
Oh, about five minutes ago, actually.
After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert...
I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower...
Mommy can handle this.
He endures blistering winds and scorching desert!
He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower...
And what does he find?
Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married.
It wasn't my fault.
He didn't get there in time.
Stop the car!
[crash]
Harold.
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.
[gasps] Where are we?
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?
My diet is ruined!
I hope you're happy. Er... okay.
Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings...
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.
Your order, Fairy Godmother.
This comes with the Medieval Meal.
There you are, dear.
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don't want me to go back on my part.
[sighs deeply] Indeed not.
So, Fiona and Charming will be together.
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.
Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom.
What am I supposed to do about it?
Use your imagination.
[whooshing]
[whinnies]
Oh...
Come on in, Your Majesty.
[piano plays, people talk]
I like my town
With a little drop of poison
Nobody knows...
[barman belches]
[clears throat] Excuse me.
Do I know you?
No, you must be mistaking me for someone else.
Uh... excuse me.
I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister.
Ah! There you are. Right.
You see, I need to have someone taken care of.
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.
Um... He's an ogre.
[crowd gasp]
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.
There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed.
Where could I find him?
[knock on door]
Hello?
Who dares enter my room?
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem?
You are told correct.
But for this, I charge a great deal of money.
Would... this be enough?
You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty.
Just tell me where
I can find this ogre.
[Eels: I Need Some Sleep]
[snoring]
[chimes]
Everyone says
I'm getting down too low
Everyone says you've just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
I need some sleep
Time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep
And the wheels keep spinning round
Everyone says you've just gotta let it go
Everyone says you've just gotta let it go
Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude.
[plays tune]
Dear Diary...
Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go.
He never lets me out after sunset.
Dad says I'm going away for a while.
Must be like some finishing school.
Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
Mrs. Fiona Charming.
[echoing] Mrs. Fiona Charming.
[knock on door]
Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book.
I was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier.
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.
Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over...
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.
Dad. We both acted like ogres.
Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other.
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt.
A little father-son time?
I know it would mean the world to Fiona.
[sighs]
Shall we say,
7:30 by the old oak?
[birds twitter]
[Shrek] Face it, Donkey!
We're lost.
We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly.
"Head to the darkest part of the woods..."
"Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches."
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!
You were the one who said not to stop for directions.
Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and I end up lost in the woods with you!
Don't get huffy!
I'm only trying to help.
I know! I know.
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.
I just really need to make things work with this guy.
Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy.
[purring]
[purring]
Well, well, well, Donkey.
I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring?
What? I ain't purring.
Sure. What's next? A hug?
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr.
What do you think I am, some kind of a...
Ha-ha!
Fear me, if you dare!
[hisses]
Look! A little cat.
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.
Come here, little kitty, kitty.
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.
- [screaming]
- Whoa!
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!
Oh, God. Oh...
No!
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!
Shrek! Hold still!
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.
Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from...
Puss... in Boots!
I'll kill that cat!
Ah-ha-ha!
[coughs]
[wheezes]
[retches]
[coughs]
- [chuckles] Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!
What should we do with him?
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.
Oh, no! Por favor!
Please!
I implore you!
It was nothing personal, Señor.
I was doing it only for my family.
My mother, she is sick.
And my father lives off the garbage!
The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Fiona's father paid you to do this?
The rich King? Sí.
[screams]
Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing.
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you.
Gee, thanks.
Maybe Fiona would've been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming.
That's what the King said.
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me.
Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her.
Well, it's not like
I wouldn't change if I could.
I just... I just wish
I could make her happy.
Hold the phone...
"Happiness."
"A tear drop away."
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you!
Aw, man, where do I begin?
First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans.
Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me.
Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going "Piñata!!"
What is a piñata, anyway?
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!
Don't go projecting on me.
I know you're feeling bad, but you got to...
Aaaahhh!
You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of...
What? Is it on? Is it on?
[clears throat]
This is Fairy Godmother.
I'm either away from my desk or with a client.
But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment.
Have a "happy ever after. "
Oh...
Are you up for a little quest, Donkey?
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure!
Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo!
We're on the move!
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.
On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine.
The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken.
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots.
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?
[purrs]
Ahh!
Listen. He's purring!
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!
Lighten up? I should lighten up?
Look who's telling who to lighten up!
[giggles] Shrek!
[barks]
[barks]
Shrek?
They're both festive, aren't they?
What do you think, Harold?
Um... Yes, yes.
Fine. Fine.
[sighs]
Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball.
Honestly, Lillian,
I don't think it matters.
How do we know there will even be a ball?
Mom. Dad.
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.
Mom, have you seen Shrek?
I haven't.
You should ask your father.
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...
Mmm! Exquisite.
What do you call this dish?
That would be the dog's breakfast,
Your Majesty.
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.
I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in.
You know, after your little spat last night.
Oh. You heard that, huh?
The whole kingdom heard you.
I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute.
Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon.
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.
Shrek loves me for who I am.
I would think you'd be happy for me.
Darling, I'm just thinking about what's best for you.
Maybe you should do the same.
[both whisper]
No, really?
[both laugh]
[Shrek] Shh...
Oh...
[hooter blasts]
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.
That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage.
She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom.
Then why don't we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell!
[Puss in Boots shrieks with laughter]
[Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh.
Hi. I'm here to see the...
The Fairy Godmother.
I'm sorry. She is not in.
Jerome!
Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now!
[sighs]
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.
Look, she's not seeing any clients today, OK?
That's OK, buddy.
We're from the union.
The union?
We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign.
Oh! Oh, right.
Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed?
Uh... a little.
We don't even have dental.
They don't even have dental.
Okay, we'll just have a look around.
Oh. By the way.
I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here.
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.
[voices and grinding machines]
[explosion]
A drop of desire.
[giggles] Naughty!
A pinch of passion.
[laughs]
And just a hint of... lust!
[laughs]
- [Shrek] Excuse me.
- [gasps]
Sorry to barge in like this...
What in Grimm's name are you doing here?
Well, it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy.
Oh-ho-ho!
And there's some question as to why that is?
Well, let's explore that, shall we?
Ah. P, P, P...
Princess. Cinderella.
Here we are.
"Lived happily ever after." Oh...
[laughs] No ogres!
Let's see. Snow White.
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.
The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman...
No, no, no, no, no!
You see, ogres don't live happily ever after.
All right, look, lady!
Don't you point... those dirty green sausages at me!
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.
Oh! Sorry.
Ah... that's okay.
We were just leaving.
Very sorry to have wasted your time,
Miss Godmother.
Just... go.
Come on, guys.
[whistles tune]
TGIF, eh, buddy?
Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac?
Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face!
Man, that stinks!
You don't exactly smell like a basket of roses.
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!
Already our minds are becoming one.
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.
Shrek, this is a bad idea.
Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch.
Puss, do you think you could get to those on top?
No problema, boss.
In one of my nine lives,
I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Shrek, are you off your nut?
Donkey, keep watch.
Keep watch?
Yeah, I'll keep watch.
I'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside.
I'll laugh, too.
I'll be giggling to myself.
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems.
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try "handsome."
Sorry. No handsome.
Hey! How about "Happily Ever After"?
Well, what does it do?
It says "Beauty Divine."
In some cultures, donkeys are revered as the wisest of creatures.
Especially us talking ones.
[gasps] Donkey!
That'll have to do.
We've got company.
Can we get on with this?
Hurry!
Nice catch, Donkey!
Finally! A good use for your mouth.
[ Pete Yorn: Ever Fallen In Love]
Come on!
You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel like dirt and I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you and that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love
In love with someone, ever fallen in love
In love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone, ever fallen in love
In love with someone, ever fallen in love
With someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with
Fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone you shouldn't have fallen in love with
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!
And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate!
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.
Whoa, what happened here?
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom? l shall rend his head from his shoulders!
I will smite him where he stands!
He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me!
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.
We'll just have to come up with something smarter.
Pardon. Um...
Everything is accounted for,
Fairy Godmother, except for one potion.
What?
Oh...
I do believe we can make this work to our advantage.
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength.
"For you and your true love.
"If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine.
"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine."
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.
Hey, man, this don't feel right.
My donkey senses are tingling all over.
Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here.
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?
[sneezes]
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapor Rub over your chest, think again!
Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip.
It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you.
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.
If there'll be any animal testing,
I'll do it.
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.
How do you feel?
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?
You still look like an ass to me.
Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys.
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!
But I love Fiona more.
Shrek, no! Wait!
[gurgling]
[farts]
Got to be... I think you grabbed the "Farty Ever After" potion.
Maybe it's a dud.
Or maybe Fiona and l were never meant to be.
Or maybe Fiona and l were never meant to be.
[thunder rumbles]
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die. I don't want to die!
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!
I'm melting!
It's just the rain, Donkey.
[chuckles] Oh.
Don't worry. Things seem bad because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you.
[hisses]
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...
The sun'll come out...
Tomorrow
[yawns]
Bet your bottom...
Bet my bottom?
I'm coming, Elizabeth!
Donkey?
Are you all right?
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?
[groans]
[Puss in Boots shrieks]
There you are!
We missed you at dinner.
What is it, darling?
Dad...
I've been thinking about what you said.
And I'm going to set things right.
Ah! Excellent!
That's my girl.
It was a mistake to bring Shrek here.
I'm going to go out and find him.
And then we'll go back to the swamp where we belong.
[Lillian] Fiona, please!
Let's not be rash, darling.
You can't go anywhere right now.
[rain patters]
[Both] Fiona!
Look, I told you he was here.
Look at him! Quiet. Look at him.
[Shrek groans]
Good morning, sleepyhead.
[Shrek shouts]
[All] Good morning!
We love your kitty!
- [Shrek] Oh... My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.
Thanks.
Uhh!
Aahh!
Oh...
A cute button nose?
Thick, wavy locks?
Taut, round buttocks?
I'm... I'm...
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.
I'm Jill. What's your name?
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.
Get in line.
Get in line.
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!
I can whinny.
[whinnies]
I can count.
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."
Pah!
"Warning: Side effects may include burning, itching, oozing, weeping.
"Not intended for heart patients or those with... nervous disorders."
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place! Yeah!
What?
Señor? "To make the effects of this potion permanent,
"the drinker must obtain his true love's kiss by midnight."
Midnight?
Why is it always midnight?
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.
I'll be true... enough.
Look, ladies, I already have a true love.
[all] Oh...
And take it from me, Boss.
You are going to have one satisfied Princess.
And let's face it.
You are a lot easier on the eyes.
Inside you're the same old mean, salty...
- Easy.
- ...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been.
And you're still the same annoying donkey.
- Yeah.
- [sighs]
Well...
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.
First things first.
- We need to get you out of those clothes.
- [all gasp]
- Ready?
- Ready!
- [Donkey screams]
- Driver, stop!
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!
I'm blind! Tell the truth.
Will I ever play the violin again?
You poor creature!
Is there anything
I can do for you?
Well, I guess there is one thing.
Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers.
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.
[both laugh]
Father?
Is everything all right, Father?
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.
Unless, of course,
I can't find you or if I forget.

- [Puss in Boots, in angry Spanish]

Oh, yeah
Turn and face the strange

Don't wanna be a richer one
Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange

Just gonna have to be a different man
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Halt!
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.
Still don't know what
I was looking for
And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets
Every time I thought
I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
- [screams]
-  Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
- Shrek?
-  Ch-Ch-Changes
Don't wanna be a richer one
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
Fiona?
Hello, handsome.
Shrek!
- Princess!
- Donkey?
Wow! That potion worked on you, too?
What potion?
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...
Now, we're sexy!
Shrek?
[purrs]
For you, baby... I could be.
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?
He went inside looking for you.
Shrek?
Fiona! Fiona!
You want to dance, pretty boy?
Are you going so soon?
Don't you want to see your wife?
Fiona?
Shrek?
Aye, Fiona. It is me.
What happened to your voice?
The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona.
But not the way I feel about you.
Fiona?
- Charming?
- Do you think so?
[laughs] Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve.
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.
I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think?
[Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona!
Fiona!
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!
Oh, shoot! I don't think they can hear us, pigeon.
[sighs deeply]
Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough?
I just wanted her to be happy.
And now she can be.
Oh, sweetheart.
She's finally found the prince of her dreams.
But look at me.
Look what I've done for her.
It's time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek.
She's a princess, and you're an ogre.
That's something no amount of potion will ever change.
But...
I love her.
If you really love her... you'll let her go.
[Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]
[Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good]
Shrek?
Señor.
What's going on?
Where are you going?
You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold?
People just ain't no good
I think that's well understood
There you go, boys.
Just leave the bottle, Doris.
Hey. Why the long face?
It was all just a stupid mistake.
I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place.
I hate Mondays.
I can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you.
What choice do I have?
She loves that pretty boy,
Prince Charming.
Come on. Is he really that good-looking?
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!
He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels.
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know... shockingly, this isn't making me feel any better.
Look, guys.
It's for the best.
Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of.
Everybody wins.
Except for you.
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.
Aye.
And that's why
I have to let her go.
Excuse me, is she here?
She's, uh... in the back.
Oh, hello again.
Fairy Godmother. Charming.
You'd better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold.
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming.
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.
I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?
No, no, it's nobody's fault.
Perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay?
- [both] What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!
I beg to differ.
I do it all the time!
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming.
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?
I can't. I won't do it.
Oh, yes, you will.
If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after.
And I can take it away just as easily.
Is that what you want? Is it?
- No.
- Good boy.
Now, we have to go.
I need to do Charming's hair before the ball.
He's hopeless.
He's all high in the front.
He can never get to the back.
You need someone to do the back.
Oh. Thank you, Mother.
[Donkey] Mother?
Um... Mary! A talking horse!
The ogre!
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!
(Announcer) The abs are fab and it's gluteus to the maximus here at tonight's Far, Far Away
Royal Ball blowout!
The coaches are lined up as the cream of the crop pours out of them like Miss Muffet's curds and whey.
Everyone who's anyone has turned out to honor Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
And, oh my, the outfits look gorgeous!
Look! Hansel and Gretel!
What the heck are the crumbs for?
And right behind them,
Tom Thumb and Thumbelina!
- Oh, aren't they adorable!
- [screaming]
[woman] Here comes Sleeping Beauty!
Tired old thing.
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?
Oh. It's the one, it's the only...
It's the Fairy Godmother!
Hello, Far, Far Away!
Can I get a whoop whoop?
May all your endings be happy and...
Well, you know the rest!
We'll be right back with the Royal
Far, Far Away Ball after these messages.
I hate these ball shows.
They bore me to tears.
Flip over to Wheel Of Torture!
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona.
Whizzes on you guys.
Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing!
No, to your left. Your left!
- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!
We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup.
It's time to teach these madcap mammals their "devil may mare" attitudes just won't fly.
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!
I have to talk to Princess Fiona!
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!
Did someone let the cat out of the bag?
You capitalist pig dogs!
[shrieks]
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.
Find Princess Fiona!
I'm a donkey!
Tell her Shrek...
I'm her husband, Shrek!
Quick! Rewind it!
I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!
[knock on door]
Darling?
Ah. I thought I might find you here.
How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball?
I'm not going.
The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage.
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.
I mean, look at him.
Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love.
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.
Change?
He's completely lost his mind!
Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance?
You might find you like this new Shrek.
But it's the old one
I fell in love with, Dad.
I'd give anything to have him back.
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.
Otherwise I'm up all night.
Thanks.
I got to get out of here!
I got to get out of here!
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!
What about my Miranda rights?
You're supposed to say
I have the right to remain silent.
Nobody said I have the right to remain silent!
You have the right to remain silent.
What you lack is the capacity.
I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad.
Shrek? Donkey?
Too late.
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!
Oh...
[ Theme from Mission Impossible]
Fire in ze hole!
[explosion, rumbling]
Look out below!
Quick! Tell a lie!
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!
Say something crazy like
"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!"
I am wearing ladies' underwear.
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!
It looks like you most certainly am are!
- I am not!
- What kind?
- It's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!
- Are not.
- Are too!
- Are not!
- Are too!
Here we go. Hang tight.
[Donkey] Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!
Ow!
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!
Pardon me, would you mind letting me go?
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!
We've got to stop that kiss!
I thought you was going to let her go.
I was, but I can't let them do this to Fiona.
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.
The castle's guarded.
There's a moat and everything!
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick.
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?
Well, sure!
He's down on Drury Lane. Why?
Because we're gonna need flour.
Lots and lots of flour.
Gingy!
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!
[evil chuckle]
[Gingy] It's alive!
[rattling]
[gasping]
[whinnies] Run, run, run, as fast you can!
[screaming]
Go, baby, go!
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!
[Shrek] No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!
[all shout]
[Donkey] Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!
That's right! Follow the pretty pony!
Pretty pony wants to play at the castle!
[Mongo] Pretty pony.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek.
[applause, cheering]
Shrek, what are you doing?
I'm just playing the part, Fiona.
Is that glitter on your lips?
Mm. Cherry flavored.
Want to taste?
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...
[piano plays]
C Minor, put it in C Minor.
Ladies and gentlemen.
[applause, cheering]
I'd like to dedicate this song to...
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.
Fiona, my Princess.
Will you honor me with a dance?
Where have all the good men gone
And where are all the gods?
[all chant] Dance!
Where's the streetwise Hercules
To fight the rising odds?
Since when do you dance?
Fiona, my dearest, if there's one thing I know, it's that love is full of surprises.
Late at night I toss and I turn
And I dream of what I need
Hit it!
I need a hero
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!
Man the catapults!
Aim! Fire!
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!
[groaning]
Not the gumdrop button!
[enraged howling]
Incoming!
Ha-ha! All right!
Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy
Go, Mongo! Go!
Man the cauldrons!
After you, Mongo.
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!
Shrek!
More heat, less foam!
Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above
Out where the lightning
Splits the sea
I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me
Heave! Ho!
[Gingy, slow-motion] No...!
[Mongo groans]
[whistles] Come on!
[cheering]
Look out!
- Be good.
- [weeping bitterly]
[sobbing] He needs me!
Let me go!
Donkey!
Puss!
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!
Today, I repay my debt.
[all] Aww...
[growling] On guard!
He's gotta be strong
And he's gotta be fast
And he's gotta be fresh
From the fight
- I need a hero
- Stop!
[Donkey whinnies]
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?
You couldn't just go back to your swamp and leave well enough alone.
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!
Pinocchio! Get the wand!
I see London! I see France!
Whah!
I'm a real boy!
Ah! Ah! Aaahhh!
Catch!
Donkey!
Oh!
I'm a real boy. Aah!
Oh!
- Ha!
- Ah.
That's mine!
Pray for mercy, from Puss...
And Donkey!
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!
No!
- Hi-ya!
- [crowd gasp]
- Fiona.
- Shrek.
Harold! You were supposed to give her the potion!
Well, I guess I gave her the wrong tea.
- [Charming] Mommy!
- Mommy?
[growls] I told you.
Ogres don't live happily ever after.
[screams]
Woo!
Ha!
[breathes deeply]
[gasping] Oh, Dad!
[sobbing]
- Is he...?
- Yup.
[croaking]
He croaked.
Harold?
Dad?
I'd hoped you'd never see me like this.
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!
No, no, he's right.
I'm sorry.
To both of you.
I only wanted what was best for Fiona.
But I can see now... she already has it.
Shrek, Fiona...
Will you accept an old frog's apologies... and my blessing?
Harold?
I'm sorry, Lillian.
I just wish I could be the man you deserve.
You're more that man today than you ever were... warts and all.
[ribbits]
[clock chimes]
[clock chimes]
Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion!
Midnight!
Fiona. Is this what you want?
To be this way forever?
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this.
You'd do that?
- For me?
- Yes.
I want what any princess wants.
To live happily ever after... with the ogre I married.
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!
You cannot make me cry!
[sobbing]
[clock chimes]
Whoa!
No. No, no.
Aaah! Ow.
Oh, no.
[sighs]
[laughs] Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.
[giggles] Now, where were we?
Oh. I remember.
[giggling]
[applause]
Hey! Isn't we supposed to be having a fiesta?
Uno, dos, quatro, hit it!
[Eddie Murphy/Antonio Banderas:
Livin' La Vida Loca]
[  Eddie Murphy/Antonio Banderas:
Livin' La Vida Loca ]
Puss and Donkey, y'all...
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
- Sing it, Puss!
-  I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
Here we go!
She's into new sensations
New kicks in the candlelight
She's got a new addiction
For every day and night
She'll make you take your clothes off
And go dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
But she'll take away your pain
Like a bullet to your brain
Upside inside out
Living la vida loca
Hey gorgeous!
Living la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
-  Living la vida loca
- [Donkey] She livin' it loca!
Living la vida loca
- [Donkey] Say it one more time now!
-  Living the vida loca
[Puss in Boots jamming]
[Puss in Boots]
Hey, Donkey, that's Spanish!
She'll push and pull you down
Living la vida loca
She will wear you out
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Living the vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
Living la vida loca
All by myself
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself anymore...
Amigo, we are off to the Kit-Kat Club.
Come on, join us.
Thanks, compadre.
I'm... I'm not in the mood.
We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!
[shrieking]
Hey, baby!
Hey, that's my girl!
Yeah! All right!
Baby, where you been?
- [cries]
- I'm sorry, too.
I should've stayed.
But Shrek had this thing he had to do.
What? Say it one more time.
What you talking about?
Are you serious?
- [cooing]
- [gasping]
- Papa!
- [screaming]
- [cooing, squealing]
- [chuckling]
Look at our little mutant babies!
[Donkey] I got to get a job.
[Donkey] I got to get a job.

<SYNC Start=106055><P>Immortality seems like a good idea...
<SYNC Start=108683><P><br>
<SYNC Start=109125><P>...until you realize<br>you're going to spend it alone.
<SYNC Start=112993><P><br>
<SYNC Start=113196><P>So I slept, hoping the sounds<br>of the passing eras would fade out...
<SYNC Start=117724><P><br>
<SYNC Start=117967><P>...and a sort of death might happen.
<SYNC Start=120162><P><br>
<SYNC Start=120370><P>But as I lay there, the world didn't<br>sound like the place I had left...

<SYNC Start=475591><P>I may be wrong, but what<br>I remember about vampires is...
<SYNC Start=479254><P><br>
<SYNC Start=479428><P>...you generally keep<br>your identity secret.
<SYNC Start=482522><P><br>
<SYNC Start=482732><P>Yes. But why hide it<br>in this day and age?
<SYNC Start=486224><P><br>
<SYNC Start=486402><P>I've hidden in the shadows<br>for centuries.
<SYNC Start=489064><P><br>
<SYNC Start=489272><P>It's time to share myself<br>with the world.
<SYNC Start=492002><P><br>
<SYNC Start=492575><P>Could you prove it? You know, give us<br>a demonstration of your powers.
<SYNC Start=497410><P><br>
<SYNC Start=497613><P>If you like, I can give you a private<br>demonstration in your hotel tonight.
<SYNC Start=502880><P><br>
<SYNC Start=506956><P>Your first and only concert's<br>in Death Valley, just days away.
<SYNC Start=511290><P><br>
<SYNC Start=511494><P>-Why just the one?<br>-I don't like repeating myself.
<SYNC Start=514952><P><br>
<SYNC Start=515164><P>There are rumors about<br>the hidden meaning in your lyrics...
<SYNC Start=520033><P><br>
<SYNC Start=520203><P>...that you're giving away<br>vampire secrets. Is that true?
<SYNC Start=523934><P><br>
<SYNC Start=524140><P>Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few<br>old friends. Daring them to come out.
<SYNC Start=529578><P><br>
<SYNC Start=529779><P>Won't these vampires be pissed off<br>that you're giving away secrets?
<SYNC Start=534216><P><br>
<SYNC Start=534850><P>I imagine they are, yes.
<SYNC Start=538217><P><br>
<SYNC Start=538421><P>Do you have anything to say<br>to the other vampires?
<SYNC Start=542016><P><br>
<SYNC Start=542225><P>As a matter of fact, I do.
<SYNC Start=545285><P><br>
<SYNC Start=546862><P>Come out, come out, wherever you are.
<SYNC Start=551629><P><br>
<SYNC Start=553402><P>See you all in Death Valley.
<SYNC Start=557031><P><br>
<SYNC Start=579161><P>I heard Lestat keeps all these girls<br>in his cellar. And it's nice.
<SYNC Start=583894><P><br>
<SYNC Start=584100><P>They give you food<br>and cable and weed.
<SYNC Start=586762><P><br>
<SYNC Start=586969><P>Oh, please.
<SYNC Start=588459><P><br>
<SYNC Start=588671><P>But you have to let him suck you<br>on your neck whenever he wants.
<SYNC Start=593472><P><br>
<SYNC Start=593676><P>-Doesn't sound too bad.<br>-Done worse.
<SYNC Start=596839><P><br>
<SYNC Start=597046><P>-I'll say.<br>-This way, girls.
<SYNC Start=598946><P><br>
<SYNC Start=612495><P>So this is Lestat's house?
<SYNC Start=615123><P><br>
<SYNC Start=615331><P>It is this week. We move around a lot.
<SYNC Start=618664><P><br>
<SYNC Start=618868><P>Why is that?
<SYNC Start=620358><P><br>
<SYNC Start=621070><P>What can I say? The guy is just....
<SYNC Start=624301><P><br>
<SYNC Start=625908><P>-Boss. I didn't see you there.<br>-No. You wouldn't, would you?
<SYNC Start=631403><P><br>
<SYNC Start=634984><P>These are the girls<br>that you asked for.
<SYNC Start=638420><P><br>
<SYNC Start=639121><P>Yes.
<SYNC Start=640679><P><br>
<SYNC Start=656372><P>Do you want me to take<br>the girls home later?
<SYNC Start=659535><P><br>
<SYNC Start=659742><P>No, thank you, Roger.
<SYNC Start=661903><P><br>
<SYNC Start=662111><P>I'll make sure they're taken care of.
<SYNC Start=664773><P><br>
<SYNC Start=667550><P>You want some?
<SYNC Start=669575><P><br>
<SYNC Start=670586><P>Want me?
<SYNC Start=672577><P><br>
<SYNC Start=673589><P>You hungry?
<SYNC Start=675318><P><br>
<SYNC Start=679562><P>You hungry for something else?
<SYNC Start=683089><P><br>
<SYNC Start=687269><P>Come on.
<SYNC Start=688998><P><br>
<SYNC Start=689505><P>-Don't you want to have some fun?<br>-Don't do that.
<SYNC Start=692963><P><br>
<SYNC Start=693309><P>Are you ticklish?
<SYNC Start=695675><P><br>
<SYNC Start=695878><P>I'm very ticklish.
<SYNC Start=698540><P><br>
<SYNC Start=764613><P>Come out, come out...
<SYNC Start=766774><P><br>
<SYNC Start=766982><P>...whoever you are.
<SYNC Start=769416><P><br>
<SYNC Start=777593><P>Jesse.
<SYNC Start=779356><P><br>
<SYNC Start=781197><P>Jesse.
<SYNC Start=784360><P><br>
<SYNC Start=784567><P>A voice...
<SYNC Start=786125><P><br>
<SYNC Start=787036><P>...calling to me...
<SYNC Start=789197><P><br>
<SYNC Start=789405><P>...in my dreams.
<SYNC Start=791498><P><br>
<SYNC Start=791707><P>The same dream I've had<br>since I was 6.
<SYNC Start=795370><P><br>
<SYNC Start=795778><P>I have a family of my own.
<SYNC Start=798645><P><br>
<SYNC Start=798948><P>Not a strange dream, really.
<SYNC Start=801610><P><br>
<SYNC Start=801817><P>One every orphan has.
<SYNC Start=804547><P><br>
<SYNC Start=832314><P>I'm sorry, but you must go.
<SYNC Start=834179><P><br>
<SYNC Start=834383><P>Why can't I stay with you?<br>Please, Aunt Maharet.
<SYNC Start=838183><P><br>
<SYNC Start=838387><P>I don't want you to go. But you must.
<SYNC Start=841845><P><br>
<SYNC Start=842291><P>Aunt, you're bleeding.
<SYNC Start=845124><P><br>
<SYNC Start=851834><P>You must be with your own.
<SYNC Start=853859><P><br>
<SYNC Start=854069><P>-I knew things were not normal.<br>-This isn't the life I wanted for you.
<SYNC Start=858733><P><br>
<SYNC Start=858941><P>I only knew I was part of them,<br>and being cast out....
<SYNC Start=863037><P><br>
<SYNC Start=863245><P>Was I bad?
<SYNC Start=864542><P><br>
<SYNC Start=864747><P>Had I done something wrong?
<SYNC Start=866840><P><br>
<SYNC Start=867049><P>I'll always be watching over you.
<SYNC Start=869540><P><br>
<SYNC Start=869752><P>I want to stay with you forever.
<SYNC Start=872220><P><br>
<SYNC Start=872421><P>You can't.
<SYNC Start=874946><P><br>
<SYNC Start=910726><P>I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News.
<SYNC Start=912921><P><br>
<SYNC Start=913128><P>Vampire turned rocker Lestat<br>has returned with a new CD, Forsaken.
<SYNC Start=918065><P><br>
<SYNC Start=918267><P>Although from New Orleans...
<SYNC Start=920258><P><br>
<SYNC Start=920469><P>...he claims to be an 18th-century<br>French nobleman...
<SYNC Start=924064><P><br>
<SYNC Start=924239><P>...who has been asleep<br>for over 100 years.
<SYNC Start=926935><P><br>
<SYNC Start=927142><P>Here's a look at the new video<br>from the debut album, "Redeemer. "
<SYNC Start=932910><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1001617><P>Like everyone, I assumed<br>Lestat was a joke.
<SYNC Start=1004415><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1004620><P>A rock star with a gimmick. Then one<br>of his lyrics caught my attention.
<SYNC Start=1009751><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1010092><P>"Take a walk down the aisle<br>at the end of the mile.
<SYNC Start=1013323><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1013495><P>Give your life to my charms<br>in the Admiral's Arms."
<SYNC Start=1016828><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1017032><P>That rang a bell.
<SYNC Start=1018556><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1018767><P>I tracked down old leases in London.
<SYNC Start=1021395><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1021603><P>It turns out in the late 1 600s<br>there was a pub in Mile End...
<SYNC Start=1025767><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1025941><P>...called the Admiral's Arms.
<SYNC Start=1027841><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1028043><P>It had a reputation for dealing<br>with black magic...
<SYNC Start=1031240><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1031447><P>...and reports of people vanishing.
<SYNC Start=1034007><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1034216><P>Here's where you could find<br>the Admiral's Arms in old London.
<SYNC Start=1039552><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1039755><P>That part of London<br>is mostly warehouses...
<SYNC Start=1042747><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1042958><P>...meat-packing plants and<br>a private club in the same location.
<SYNC Start=1047088><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1048397><P>I think that it's a vampire coven.
<SYNC Start=1051833><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1052034><P>And Lestat is leading us to it.
<SYNC Start=1054832><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1056905><P>-Who took this picture?<br>-I did.
<SYNC Start=1059999><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1060209><P>You're still an apprentice.<br>You don't do field work.
<SYNC Start=1063940><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1064146><P>The Talamasca has a code.
<SYNC Start=1065773><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1065981><P>I know. "Observe the dark realm,<br>but be not of it."
<SYNC Start=1069610><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1069818><P>Well, it's held good for 1 2 centuries.
<SYNC Start=1072753><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1072955><P>We record and observe,<br>but never interfere.
<SYNC Start=1076891><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1077092><P>I had to see it for myself.
<SYNC Start=1079185><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1082097><P>Is David aware of this?
<SYNC Start=1084292><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1084833><P>Jesse?
<SYNC Start=1085857><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1088437><P>Hello, David.
<SYNC Start=1089426><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1090205><P>-I was explaining--<br>-Why don't you see me in my office?
<SYNC Start=1093936><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1097179><P>This is a real coven.<br>In the middle of London.
<SYNC Start=1100342><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1100549><P>All the more reason<br>to have told me first.
<SYNC Start=1103882><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1105554><P>Listen, Jesse...
<SYNC Start=1107181><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1110659><P>...we know about Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1113219><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1113695><P>What he's doing is unprecedented.
<SYNC Start=1116425><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1117466><P>So why is he doing it?
<SYNC Start=1119058><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1119268><P>Aren't you curious?<br>Don't you think we should find out?
<SYNC Start=1122863><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1124306><P>Let me show you something.
<SYNC Start=1126433><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1129545><P>What do you see?
<SYNC Start=1131445><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1134149><P>Mid-1 500s. Florence.
<SYNC Start=1136811><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1137920><P>This one?
<SYNC Start=1139478><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1143292><P>-This man is in both.<br>-Yes.
<SYNC Start=1146352><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1148697><P>All the different paint samples...
<SYNC Start=1151063><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1151733><P>...all authentic.
<SYNC Start=1153633><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1153836><P>Each painted at the time<br>of their particular style.
<SYNC Start=1157465><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1164079><P>His name is Marius.
<SYNC Start=1166240><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1167115><P>I've been tracing him for years.
<SYNC Start=1169948><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1170419><P>My little obsession.
<SYNC Start=1172512><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1172721><P>The closest we've come<br>to the original vampire.
<SYNC Start=1175849><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1176124><P>Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.
<SYNC Start=1179787><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1183131><P>So he's older than Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1185656><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1185868><P>He made Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1188029><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1188737><P>How do you know that?
<SYNC Start=1190102><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1190305><P>Because I have Lestat's journal.
<SYNC Start=1193172><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1196578><P>I want to see it.
<SYNC Start=1198045><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1200382><P>Promise me you'll never<br>go back to that place.
<SYNC Start=1203442><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1234783><P>It was the winter of 1788.
<SYNC Start=1238241><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1238453><P>And I was brought to a Mediterranean<br>island by the man who made me.
<SYNC Start=1243413><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1244726><P>If a man is what you'd call him.
<SYNC Start=1248457><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1297980><P>Lestat, welcome.
<SYNC Start=1300346><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1302451><P>Who are you?
<SYNC Start=1303884><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1304086><P>Do I know you?
<SYNC Start=1306020><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1308557><P>I am unknowable by nature,<br>but you may call me Marius.
<SYNC Start=1312459><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1312661><P>I'm the lord of a great manor.<br>They'll send an army to look for me.
<SYNC Start=1317462><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1317666><P>I doubt they'll find you,<br>Lord de Lioncourt.
<SYNC Start=1320692><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1320902><P>You're a long way from home.
<SYNC Start=1322893><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1352134><P>You're weak...
<SYNC Start=1353761><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1354269><P>...near passing.
<SYNC Start=1355736><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1357539><P>I can barely hear your heartbeat.
<SYNC Start=1360167><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1361276><P>The future hastens.<br>An age beyond my antique reason.
<SYNC Start=1366578><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1366782><P>You will help me understand<br>these times.
<SYNC Start=1369751><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1370152><P>That's why I chose you.
<SYNC Start=1372245><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1372621><P>Chose me for what?
<SYNC Start=1374145><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1384066><P>Drink...
<SYNC Start=1385465><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1386001><P>...and live.
<SYNC Start=1387593><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1388570><P>You've been brave enough<br>for one night, my son.
<SYNC Start=1391801><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1394543><P>Drink...
<SYNC Start=1396704><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1398213><P>...and learn.
<SYNC Start=1400204><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1402584><P>Good, is it not?
<SYNC Start=1405178><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1408990><P>No more. No more, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=1411515><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1412994><P>No more!
<SYNC Start=1414859><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1449197><P>Don't be afraid.
<SYNC Start=1451597><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1451867><P>It's only your body that dies.
<SYNC Start=1454893><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1469384><P>More.
<SYNC Start=1471716><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1474055><P>I impressed my maker<br>with my thirst for things.
<SYNC Start=1477616><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1477826><P>He set out to educate me<br>in the unknown.
<SYNC Start=1480454><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1480629><P>Taught me all about the world,<br>its hidden history...
<SYNC Start=1485259><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1485467><P>...and about myself.
<SYNC Start=1487867><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1493341><P>That's enough, my son.
<SYNC Start=1495673><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1498547><P>When you feed, hold back<br>from the moment of death.
<SYNC Start=1501812><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1502017><P>Never take the last drop, or it will<br>draw you in and you will die.
<SYNC Start=1506579><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1512027><P>Appreciate your prey.
<SYNC Start=1514325><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1519467><P>Their blood that we take into us<br>carries with it life...
<SYNC Start=1523767><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1523972><P>...their life, their knowledge,<br>their complexity.
<SYNC Start=1528636><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1531680><P>My senses run amuck,<br>like a newborn child.
<SYNC Start=1535241><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1536084><P>And as for my new powers, I was beside<br>myself with the pleasure of it all.
<SYNC Start=1541488><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1543992><P>We've stayed long enough.
<SYNC Start=1545653><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1545860><P>But we've spoken to no one.
<SYNC Start=1547657><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1548230><P>A vampire's life<br>is a life of discretion.
<SYNC Start=1550994><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1551199><P>Discretion?
<SYNC Start=1552791><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1553468><P>Why must we hide, Marius?
<SYNC Start=1555436><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1555637><P>We are the powerful,<br>we are the immortal.
<SYNC Start=1558970><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1559174><P>We should walk fearless<br>in the open, no?
<SYNC Start=1562666><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1573388><P>That cannot be.
<SYNC Start=1575652><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1576658><P>We're vulnerable during the day.
<SYNC Start=1579354><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1579561><P>Mortals must never know about us,<br>for the sake of all our kind.
<SYNC Start=1583691><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1584199><P>So I could never know her?
<SYNC Start=1586360><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1586568><P>Not unless you wanted to kill her.
<SYNC Start=1588900><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1596211><P>So I can never be known?
<SYNC Start=1598042><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1600715><P>You must be dead to the world.
<SYNC Start=1603513><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1604719><P>Come on, time to leave.
<SYNC Start=1607085><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1668083><P>Sophia, run! Run!
<SYNC Start=1670347><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1670685><P>Go! Go--
<SYNC Start=1673051><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1673888><P>Lestat...
<SYNC Start=1675150><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1675357><P>...stop her!
<SYNC Start=1677655><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1678426><P>You must!
<SYNC Start=1679484><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1717098><P>We must remain in the shadows.
<SYNC Start=1721000><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1722437><P>You still have a few<br>lingering mortal emotions.
<SYNC Start=1725998><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1727108><P>They'll serve you no good, my friend.
<SYNC Start=1730441><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1743024><P>Forgive me.
<SYNC Start=1744958><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1752000><P>The faces of my victims haunted me,<br>reminding me of my fate.
<SYNC Start=1758064><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1758273><P>For nights and days I played...
<SYNC Start=1760639><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1760842><P>...furious that I would never partake<br>of the simplejoys of the world.
<SYNC Start=1766576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1766781><P>I was meant for more than this.
<SYNC Start=1768976><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1808590><P>Marius?
<SYNC Start=1810490><P><br>
<SYNC Start=1891906><P>Would you like me to play for you?
<SYNC Start=1894534><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2042557><P>What have you done, Lestat?
<SYNC Start=2045151><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2054469><P>-More!<br>-I don't think so, my little lord.
<SYNC Start=2058166><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2058406><P>-Let me go.<br>-No.
<SYNC Start=2060431><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2060641><P>You've had the purest blood,<br>seen the oldest things.
<SYNC Start=2064099><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2064312><P>-Far too much for one as young as you.<br>-Her blood is like liquid fire.
<SYNC Start=2069773><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2069984><P>Who is she?
<SYNC Start=2071383><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2076824><P>She's your mother.
<SYNC Start=2078951><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2079160><P>She's my mother.
<SYNC Start=2081219><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2081429><P>Akasha, the queen of all<br>who are damned.
<SYNC Start=2085593><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2086234><P>And he's her king.
<SYNC Start=2088168><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2088669><P>Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this<br>earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.
<SYNC Start=2093868><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2094041><P>They drank until Enkil<br>lost his will to drink.
<SYNC Start=2098034><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2098212><P>Without her mate beside her, she also<br>lost hers. They became living statues.
<SYNC Start=2103172><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2103351><P>She respects nothing except the taste<br>of blood, human and immortal alike.
<SYNC Start=2108983><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2109357><P>No. Release me!
<SYNC Start=2110881><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2116964><P>She made you quite powerful.
<SYNC Start=2119364><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2119534><P>You'll not stop me!
<SYNC Start=2121764><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2123037><P>Can I hear her blood in your voice?
<SYNC Start=2125904><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2126707><P>In all the years of my care,<br>not once have they moved.
<SYNC Start=2130234><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2130444><P>Until tonight. And she chose me.
<SYNC Start=2134141><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2135049><P>I chose you.
<SYNC Start=2136676><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2140721><P>Where are you going?! Marius!
<SYNC Start=2144054><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2201482><P>Many times since, I have called<br>to Marius. But there was no answer.
<SYNC Start=2207819><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2208356><P>Just the endless procession<br>of days, months...
<SYNC Start=2212850><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2213027><P>...years.
<SYNC Start=2214551><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2215730><P>My teacher left me<br>to my darkest lesson.
<SYNC Start=2219393><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2219567><P>That in the end, we are alone.
<SYNC Start=2221728><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2222637><P>And there is nothing but the cold,<br>dark wasteland of eternity.
<SYNC Start=2228598><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2253501><P>David thought thejournal<br>would satisfy my curiosity.
<SYNC Start=2256959><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2257638><P>But it only made me want<br>to know more.
<SYNC Start=2260835><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2261008><P>I had to go back<br>to the Admiral's Arms.
<SYNC Start=2263704><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2263878><P>I had no choice.
<SYNC Start=2266312><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2302817><P>This is a fantastic place. I love it.
<SYNC Start=2305809><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2306487><P>You sure I can't get you a drink?
<SYNC Start=2309251><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2310224><P>Soon.
<SYNC Start=2311521><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2374188><P>Hi.
<SYNC Start=2375746><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2376624><P>-Hi.<br>-Come here often?
<SYNC Start=2378023><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2378459><P>All the time.
<SYNC Start=2380222><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2384065><P>I don't see any marks.
<SYNC Start=2386932><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2387101><P>You haven't seen the rest of my body.
<SYNC Start=2389626><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2390638><P>Is that an invitation?
<SYNC Start=2393266><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2393441><P>Sorry, I'm taken.
<SYNC Start=2395534><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2395743><P>And...
<SYNC Start=2397540><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2398245><P>...where is your host?
<SYNC Start=2400304><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2400714><P>He's here somewhere.
<SYNC Start=2402079><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2405786><P>This host, what's his name?
<SYNC Start=2409381><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2413427><P>Marius.
<SYNC Start=2414724><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2415629><P>Sorry, don't know the guy.
<SYNC Start=2418359><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2418532><P>-Of course not. He's an ancient.<br>-There aren't any ancients left.
<SYNC Start=2422969><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2423137><P>They all turned to dust.
<SYNC Start=2425799><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2426140><P>So unless you've got him in a bottle<br>somewhere....
<SYNC Start=2429371><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2429543><P>You're brave to joke.<br>I wish you could meet him.
<SYNC Start=2432637><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2432813><P>-And why is that?<br>-Because you might learn something.
<SYNC Start=2436408><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2439887><P>Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=2441878><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2456270><P>Going somewhere?
<SYNC Start=2457965><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2459874><P>Now this will only hurt a little bit.
<SYNC Start=2462843><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2463244><P>In fact, you might even enjoy it.
<SYNC Start=2467078><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2467281><P>Don't do this.
<SYNC Start=2468305><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2488936><P>Boo.
<SYNC Start=2490426><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2505986><P>That was quite a performance.
<SYNC Start=2509353><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2509990><P>You should be more careful.
<SYNC Start=2512754><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2513894><P>-Thanks.<br>-For what?
<SYNC Start=2517193><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2517531><P>You saved me.
<SYNC Start=2519362><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2520034><P>How presumptuous.
<SYNC Start=2522025><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2522937><P>So you know Marius?
<SYNC Start=2526464><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2528742><P>I know a lot of things.
<SYNC Start=2530403><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2530611><P>Not how to stay alive, apparently.
<SYNC Start=2533273><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2533614><P>I guess we have that in common.
<SYNC Start=2535775><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2536317><P>Although I'm a little ahead<br>of the race here.
<SYNC Start=2539252><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2539453><P>Well, I can fix that.
<SYNC Start=2541978><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2542623><P>Your song "Redeemer" is about<br>the girl with the violin. Isn't it?
<SYNC Start=2546957><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2548662><P>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2549822><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2550064><P>Is it?
<SYNC Start=2551463><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2554435><P>What else do you think you know?
<SYNC Start=2556699><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2557805><P>I....
<SYNC Start=2559067><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2559273><P>You're shaking.
<SYNC Start=2561741><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2561942><P>Cold.
<SYNC Start=2563341><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2564345><P>Still cold?
<SYNC Start=2565903><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2567481><P>Go on. Tell me more about me.
<SYNC Start=2571417><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2571652><P>You want....
<SYNC Start=2573279><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2573487><P>What do I want?
<SYNC Start=2575421><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2576824><P>-You yearn.<br>-What do I yearn?
<SYNC Start=2580260><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2583631><P>For what do I yearn?
<SYNC Start=2586395><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2586567><P>To walk with the living.
<SYNC Start=2588694><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2590304><P>Out of the cold,<br>dark wasteland of eternity.
<SYNC Start=2594764><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2598279><P>Well...
<SYNC Start=2599337><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2601782><P>...that makes you<br>a very clever librarian.
<SYNC Start=2605115><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2605286><P>Talamasca.
<SYNC Start=2607846><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2608022><P>I knew I left that journal somewhere.
<SYNC Start=2611514><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2614361><P>-Was it a good read?<br>-It touched me.
<SYNC Start=2618229><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2618832><P>Did it, now?
<SYNC Start=2620493><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2621935><P>Don't worry, Jesse.
<SYNC Start=2623800><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2624238><P>Your kind never satisfies my thirst.
<SYNC Start=2626832><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2629843><P>Lestat, I know something<br>that's not in your journal.
<SYNC Start=2633210><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2635783><P>What?
<SYNC Start=2636772><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2637318><P>You still have the violin, don't you?
<SYNC Start=2639752><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2640421><P>No, I understand.
<SYNC Start=2642480><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2643424><P>After all, it's only human.
<SYNC Start=2645187><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2701882><P>Clever librarian.
<SYNC Start=2703873><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2714094><P>David, listen, I'm going<br>to Los Angeles for the concert.
<SYNC Start=2717962><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2718665><P>I met him, David. I talked to Lestat.
<SYNC Start=2721725><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2722002><P>What? Jesse?
<SYNC Start=2724197><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2724405><P>Listen to me very carefully now.
<SYNC Start=2727966><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2729610><P>You are no longer seeing<br>things clearly.
<SYNC Start=2732579><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2732746><P>Lestat told the world that vampires<br>live among us. They're mad.
<SYNC Start=2736512><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2736683><P>They'll be at the concert to kill him.<br>You've become obsessed with it.
<SYNC Start=2741245><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2741422><P>-I'm worried about you.<br>-Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.
<SYNC Start=2746155><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2746360><P>I'll check in and....
<SYNC Start=2748260><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2749329><P>I'm sorry. I have to go.
<SYNC Start=2750956><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2751165><P>No, Jesse--
<SYNC Start=2752757><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2769583><P>The city of Lost Angels already<br>fed on the blood of youth.
<SYNC Start=2773576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2773754><P>My presence here barely<br>stirred a ripple.
<SYNC Start=2777019><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2777191><P>We had three days till the concert.
<SYNC Start=2779591><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2779793><P>I could feel something was coming.
<SYNC Start=2782318><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2782496><P>Ijust couldn't figure out what.
<SYNC Start=2785659><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2818499><P>Marius.
<SYNC Start=2820023><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2832079><P>Lestat.
<SYNC Start=2833842><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2835215><P>It is good to see you, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=2837683><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2838986><P>And you.
<SYNC Start=2840351><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2840587><P>Still wearing the old fashions, I see.
<SYNC Start=2844216><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2846026><P>Old habits die hard.
<SYNC Start=2848187><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2848395><P>How did you manage to slip<br>through the '50s in red velvet?
<SYNC Start=2853526><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2854234><P>I slept.
<SYNC Start=2855701><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2857070><P>Don't think you missed much.
<SYNC Start=2859334><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2860541><P>-Elvis.<br>-Elvis, yes.
<SYNC Start=2864238><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2866446><P>You're bigger than he is now.
<SYNC Start=2868471><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2868882><P>So....
<SYNC Start=2869906><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2870784><P>After all this time...
<SYNC Start=2872911><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2873453><P>...what's the occasion?
<SYNC Start=2875387><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2875556><P>You've just become very hard to avoid<br>these days, at least in conversation.
<SYNC Start=2881085><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2882095><P>-What are you trying to prove, Lestat?<br>-Oh, please.
<SYNC Start=2885622><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2885799><P>It's a little too late to come over<br>all paternal now, Marius.
<SYNC Start=2890031><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2890237><P>Two hundred years<br>and not a word from you.
<SYNC Start=2894003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2895242><P>You almost cost me everything.
<SYNC Start=2898336><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2901281><P>Now you've done it again.
<SYNC Start=2902908><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2903517><P>This isn't the time to settle<br>old scores.
<SYNC Start=2907078><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2908722><P>Vampires don't settle old scores.
<SYNC Start=2911782><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2913894><P>We harbor them.
<SYNC Start=2916328><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2920634><P>How did you find me?
<SYNC Start=2922397><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2922970><P>I made you.
<SYNC Start=2924335><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2924671><P>I've always known where you are.
<SYNC Start=2927003><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2927808><P>Besides...
<SYNC Start=2929275><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2929610><P>...l just had to look for the most<br>gauche house on the block.
<SYNC Start=2933876><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2935549><P>Come. Let me show you what it means<br>to live in the light.
<SYNC Start=2939417><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2949319><P>Impressive.
<SYNC Start=2950616><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2950787><P>Reminds me of old mad druids<br>running around chanting in the forest.
<SYNC Start=2955190><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2955392><P>A return to the primitive.
<SYNC Start=2957485><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2958128><P>Out there, my fans...
<SYNC Start=2960153><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2961464><P>...they worship me.
<SYNC Start=2963022><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2963466><P>Millions of arms reach out to embrace,<br>beg me to come into their lives.
<SYNC Start=2968563><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2968738><P>It's what you always wanted.
<SYNC Start=2970763><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2970974><P>With all my black little heart.
<SYNC Start=2973636><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2974978><P>Did you think of anyone but yourself?
<SYNC Start=2978311><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2978715><P>I only have myself.<br>You taught me that.
<SYNC Start=2981980><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2982719><P>It may be time to get ready<br>for some company.
<SYNC Start=2986120><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2986289><P>-What's that supposed to mean?<br>-Your music's woken an old friend.
<SYNC Start=2991921><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2993930><P>Can't you hear it?
<SYNC Start=2995557><P><br>
<SYNC Start=2996065><P>Or is the applause all you<br>can hear now?
<SYNC Start=2999626><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3018755><P>Akasha.
<SYNC Start=3020086><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3020890><P>Arisen.
<SYNC Start=3022482><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3023193><P>She has taken the king's blood.
<SYNC Start=3025957><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3026229><P>Absorbed his power.
<SYNC Start=3028129><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3028765><P>Good. Let her come.
<SYNC Start=3031859><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3032202><P>Cancel the concert.
<SYNC Start=3034329><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3034637><P>Never.
<SYNC Start=3035968><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3036573><P>You're no match for her, Lestat.<br>You're not a god.
<SYNC Start=3040532><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3041211><P>We were once mortals too.
<SYNC Start=3044009><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3045048><P>It is our heritage we protect.
<SYNC Start=3047881><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3048051><P>Such reverence for mortals.
<SYNC Start=3050849><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3051054><P>Then you should have left me as one.
<SYNC Start=3053989><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3114717><P>Scent is fading.<br>He was here too long ago.
<SYNC Start=3120053><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3120256><P>You like him, do you?
<SYNC Start=3121985><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3123126><P>He reminds me of someone.
<SYNC Start=3125151><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3125361><P>All he's going to remind you of soon<br>is a pile of bones.
<SYNC Start=3130025><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3130300><P>We're going to dismember him.<br>Bleed him dry.
<SYNC Start=3133428><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3133603><P>Really?
<SYNC Start=3134797><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3136039><P>Is that what you're going to do?
<SYNC Start=3139475><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3317820><P>Old gods on new streets.
<SYNC Start=3321278><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3321791><P>Not only had the concert sold out<br>among the living...
<SYNC Start=3325283><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3325461><P>...it seemed all the undead<br>were coming too.
<SYNC Start=3328589><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3328798><P>There would be angry vampires<br>out there...
<SYNC Start=3331699><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3331868><P>...frightened of the light I was<br>directing on all our kind.
<SYNC Start=3336032><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3336239><P>Do you have anything to say<br>to the other vampires?
<SYNC Start=3339800><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3340009><P>Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
<SYNC Start=3343843><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3344747><P>Come out, come out, wherever you are.
<SYNC Start=3348183><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3348918><P>They wanted me dead.
<SYNC Start=3351011><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3351220><P>Let them try.
<SYNC Start=3352881><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3353256><P>Bring it on.
<SYNC Start=3354723><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3355124><P>Better dead than alone.
<SYNC Start=3357922><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3373609><P>Hey, honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?
<SYNC Start=3376134><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3376312><P>-Going to the show?<br>-No.
<SYNC Start=3378143><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3378314><P>-Come on, I got them for $200.<br>-$200?! I don't think so.
<SYNC Start=3382080><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3382251><P>-What if I say 1 50?<br>-1 50? You're gonna cut me a deal?
<SYNC Start=3388156><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3388357><P>So, listen, just two girls, okay?<br>So how old are you again?
<SYNC Start=3392555><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3395531><P>-Check it out. Champagne?<br>-Yeah.
<SYNC Start=3398796><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3415985><P>Oh, my God, I can't believe<br>it's really you! I'm your biggest fan.
<SYNC Start=3421082><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3423125><P>Boo.
<SYNC Start=3424524><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3425494><P>Boo back.
<SYNC Start=3426791><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3427697><P>Lestat, I came all the way<br>from Tarzana.
<SYNC Start=3430325><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3430499><P>Really?
<SYNC Start=3431625><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3432635><P>-And you?<br>-London.
<SYNC Start=3434227><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3435504><P>A London Goth. I see.
<SYNC Start=3438098><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3439208><P>It's funny, I would have pegged you<br>for a Talamascan.
<SYNC Start=3443907><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3444847><P>Maybe in another life.
<SYNC Start=3446781><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3446949><P>I'm an Episcopalian.
<SYNC Start=3448576><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3449051><P>And I'm a frigging Buddhist.<br>Lestat....
<SYNC Start=3452578><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3452755><P>Roger, would you take our little<br>Episcopalian back to church?
<SYNC Start=3457089><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3457260><P>Just the one tonight? Sure.
<SYNC Start=3459820><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3460029><P>-Sweetheart, come on.<br>-What?
<SYNC Start=3463294><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3463966><P>-Come on.<br>-What?!
<SYNC Start=3465593><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3465768><P>-It's a good thing.<br>-Can I still go backstage?
<SYNC Start=3468965><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3470706><P>Why are you following me?
<SYNC Start=3473266><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3473542><P>What do you want?
<SYNC Start=3474941><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3488424><P>So you come all this way<br>just to return this to me?
<SYNC Start=3492758><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3492962><P>Out of the goodness of your heart?
<SYNC Start=3495931><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3498601><P>I want you to show me what it's like.
<SYNC Start=3501263><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3501671><P>What what is like, exactly?
<SYNC Start=3504799><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3504974><P>To be like you.
<SYNC Start=3507135><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3510179><P>I don't have time for this.
<SYNC Start=3512272><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3512682><P>-All a vampire has is time.<br>-Not this one.
<SYNC Start=3516914><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3518854><P>Right.
<SYNC Start=3520082><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3520356><P>The covens are coming for you.
<SYNC Start=3523018><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3523192><P>How are you going to spend your last<br>night, as you always have, alone?
<SYNC Start=3527891><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3528064><P>Why not?
<SYNC Start=3529292><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3530032><P>Why not share it with me?
<SYNC Start=3532398><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3536305><P>All right.
<SYNC Start=3537772><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3540509><P>This may be painful for a mortal.
<SYNC Start=3543910><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3544113><P>You're still attached to your skin.
<SYNC Start=3547241><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3548317><P>I don't care.
<SYNC Start=3550012><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3552621><P>Do you trust me?
<SYNC Start=3554418><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3558227><P>Yes.
<SYNC Start=3559717><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3568871><P>Then close your eyes.
<SYNC Start=3571237><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3648651><P>Marius was right.
<SYNC Start=3650619><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3650820><P>But I never understood<br>until I met you.
<SYNC Start=3653983><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3654557><P>What do you mean?
<SYNC Start=3656582><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3656759><P>You're beautiful to me<br>because you're human.
<SYNC Start=3660160><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3660329><P>Your frailty...
<SYNC Start=3662456><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3662731><P>...your short years...
<SYNC Start=3664665><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3667103><P>...your heart...
<SYNC Start=3668764><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3668971><P>...even as you think it's breaking.
<SYNC Start=3671804><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3676178><P>All that...
<SYNC Start=3677975><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3679415><P>...seems suddenly more precious<br>than anything I have ever known.
<SYNC Start=3684079><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3687356><P>I'm not as precious as you think.
<SYNC Start=3690189><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3699635><P>Do it.
<SYNC Start=3701068><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3704640><P>Please.
<SYNC Start=3706130><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3712414><P>Let me be with you.
<SYNC Start=3714644><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3716952><P>Let me know everything.
<SYNC Start=3719546><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3727663><P>You want to know everything?
<SYNC Start=3730188><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3732301><P>Come, then.
<SYNC Start=3733893><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3734170><P>I'll show you.
<SYNC Start=3735967><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3758394><P>What is it? What are we doing--?
<SYNC Start=3760919><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3806709><P>Is she all right?
<SYNC Start=3808267><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3812615><P>Get away! Get off me!
<SYNC Start=3815778><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3824493><P>Now you see?
<SYNC Start=3826120><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3826662><P>Are you ready?
<SYNC Start=3828095><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3829898><P>Now do you want it, huh?
<SYNC Start=3833163><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3836238><P>No.
<SYNC Start=3837364><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3837773><P>Of course you don't.
<SYNC Start=3840469><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3899768><P>They're pretty worked-up.<br>How you feeling?
<SYNC Start=3902566><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3902738><P>Hey, girls, come on!
<SYNC Start=3904467><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3905708><P>Okay, through here. Let him through!
<SYNC Start=3908871><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3909311><P>Back off, fella!
<SYNC Start=3910710><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3910913><P>Come on, children.
<SYNC Start=3912380><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3912581><P>Okay, guys. Come on!
<SYNC Start=3914742><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3917086><P>Let him through.
<SYNC Start=3919054><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3924626><P>Jesse!
<SYNC Start=3926025><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3928630><P>Jesse!
<SYNC Start=3929927><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3933802><P>Hello, David.
<SYNC Start=3935269><P><br>
<SYNC Start=3936372><P>I must show you my new<br>paintings sometime.
<SYNC Start=3939705><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4082851><P>Find Jesse.
<SYNC Start=4084045><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4132501><P>You want more?
<SYNC Start=4134469><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4137906><P>This one's for those<br>who've come for me.
<SYNC Start=4142275><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4322090><P>Akasha.
<SYNC Start=4323352><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4403004><P>Akasha?!
<SYNC Start=4405029><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4405674><P>Why so surprised, my love?
<SYNC Start=4408234><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4409010><P>You called, I have come.
<SYNC Start=4411069><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4412147><P>My love?
<SYNC Start=4413205><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4413715><P>Never fear me, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=4416275><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4417352><P>All your wishes have come true.
<SYNC Start=4419582><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4419754><P>My wishes?
<SYNC Start=4421415><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4423625><P>For a companion to share eternity.
<SYNC Start=4427186><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4429731><P>You're bold, like your music.
<SYNC Start=4433633><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4435503><P>You live your life in the open,<br>like I did long ago...
<SYNC Start=4440440><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4441610><P>...when I had a king.
<SYNC Start=4443373><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4443879><P>Had a king?
<SYNC Start=4445039><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4445480><P>He's no more.
<SYNC Start=4447175><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4447949><P>Now you are my consort.
<SYNC Start=4451407><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4452387><P>That's why I kept you safe.
<SYNC Start=4454548><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4455690><P>Alive.
<SYNC Start=4457214><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4458226><P>You?
<SYNC Start=4459716><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4461463><P>You thought it was all you?
<SYNC Start=4464261><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4467402><P>The ego of a king as well.
<SYNC Start=4470462><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4470672><P>Yes.
<SYNC Start=4472162><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4473441><P>I know you, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=4476774><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4477178><P>I know that you crave to have<br>the world at your feet.
<SYNC Start=4481239><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4482751><P>And I have come to give it to you.
<SYNC Start=4486209><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4488156><P>Where are we?
<SYNC Start=4490124><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4490992><P>We are home.
<SYNC Start=4492926><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4493495><P>We live everywhere<br>and anywhere we choose.
<SYNC Start=4498728><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4499134><P>The world is our garden.
<SYNC Start=4502865><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4647682><P>All these years I'd hoped<br>this place was real.
<SYNC Start=4651812><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4653988><P>For the first time in my life,<br>I feel like I'm home.
<SYNC Start=4659324><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4659894><P>Strange that this journey<br>should lead me here.
<SYNC Start=4663955><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4664165><P>This place that's haunted my dreams.
<SYNC Start=4667396><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4672774><P>Aunt, you're bleeding.
<SYNC Start=4675607><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4675810><P>You must be with your own.
<SYNC Start=4678040><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4680648><P>I'll always be watching over you.
<SYNC Start=4683173><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4683384><P>I want to stay with you forever.
<SYNC Start=4686114><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4687322><P>Forever is a very long time.
<SYNC Start=4689813><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4693161><P>Aunt Maharet.
<SYNC Start=4694788><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4704839><P>You haven't aged,<br>you haven't changed at all.
<SYNC Start=4708400><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4711346><P>I was once a mortal too.
<SYNC Start=4713678><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4714015><P>I bore a child before Akasha took me.<br>I took care of that child...
<SYNC Start=4718145><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4718319><P>...and her children,<br>and her children's children.
<SYNC Start=4721982><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4722557><P>This is our family.
<SYNC Start=4724821><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4724993><P>My way of coping with eternity.
<SYNC Start=4727553><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4729597><P>You are what keeps me connected<br>to the world of the living.
<SYNC Start=4734432><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4735103><P>When your parents died, I brought<br>you here to take care of you.
<SYNC Start=4739233><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4744746><P>Now is not the time.
<SYNC Start=4747510><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4748917><P>You were seeking answers<br>and now you've found them.
<SYNC Start=4752683><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4753087><P>The family is who you are.
<SYNC Start=4756818><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4847815><P>Drinking my blood allows you<br>to live in the light.
<SYNC Start=4851979><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4852186><P>And soon the sun will no longer<br>sting your eyes.
<SYNC Start=4857123><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4858326><P>This is but a taste<br>of what we shall share, my love.
<SYNC Start=4862820><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4863965><P>My king...
<SYNC Start=4865660><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4866501><P>...behold our kingdom.
<SYNC Start=4869402><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4870038><P>A kingdom of corpses?
<SYNC Start=4872404><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4874409><P>-Why?<br>-Why not?
<SYNC Start=4877810><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4878479><P>This is why you have risen?
<SYNC Start=4880276><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4880448><P>They believed in nothing.
<SYNC Start=4883781><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4884185><P>Now they are nothing.
<SYNC Start=4885743><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4892427><P>But you and l,<br>we will change all that.
<SYNC Start=4895487><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4896698><P>We will give the world something<br>to believe in again.
<SYNC Start=4901431><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4902570><P>Now come, my love.
<SYNC Start=4904663><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4905073><P>We have a score to settle.
<SYNC Start=4907132><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4919220><P>Since my mortal death,<br>I have watched...
<SYNC Start=4921882><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4922590><P>...l have guided and cared<br>for my human family...
<SYNC Start=4926890><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4927428><P>...generations beyond memory.
<SYNC Start=4930329><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4932433><P>This is why we must fight Akasha.
<SYNC Start=4936096><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4937438><P>-For the sake of your great family.<br>-The world we know is about to end.
<SYNC Start=4942239><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4942577><P>The only way to prevent this<br>is through Akasha's destruction.
<SYNC Start=4946570><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4946781><P>But how?
<SYNC Start=4948271><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4948883><P>When she gives blood,<br>she's vulnerable.
<SYNC Start=4951511><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4951686><P>Whoever takes the last of her blood<br>will not survive it.
<SYNC Start=4955554><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4955757><P>What about Lestat?
<SYNC Start=4957418><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4957625><P>Lestat has joined with Akasha.<br>He's lost to us now. Forget him.
<SYNC Start=4963586><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4986287><P>My children.
<SYNC Start=4987845><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4990024><P>It warms my blood<br>to see you all gathered...
<SYNC Start=4993118><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4993661><P>...plotting against me.
<SYNC Start=4995219><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4995430><P>-Akasha.<br>-Maharet.
<SYNC Start=4997864><P><br>
<SYNC Start=4998666><P>-You will address my king first.<br>-Lestat, what has she done to you?
<SYNC Start=5003501><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5006140><P>Lestat, step aside.
<SYNC Start=5008631><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5009143><P>Never.
<SYNC Start=5010132><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5010311><P>The world has changed<br>since you reigned.
<SYNC Start=5012973><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5013181><P>Then we shall change it back.
<SYNC Start=5015342><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5015683><P>Humans are animals...
<SYNC Start=5017810><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5018486><P>...brute creatures.
<SYNC Start=5020477><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5020655><P>-Their destruction can only make sense.<br>-We've found other ways to coexist.
<SYNC Start=5025888><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5026093><P>In silence! ln shadows and shame!<br>And for what?
<SYNC Start=5030462><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5030631><P>For respect of mortals?
<SYNC Start=5032690><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5032867><P>They are nothing to us.
<SYNC Start=5035028><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5035203><P>They are merely food.
<SYNC Start=5037000><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5037839><P>Akasha, please....
<SYNC Start=5039272><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5039474><P>You think you can change my will?
<SYNC Start=5042500><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5043144><P>I've had enough of this discussion.
<SYNC Start=5046136><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5046314><P>Join me or die.
<SYNC Start=5047906><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5048316><P>I will not.
<SYNC Start=5050011><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5050218><P>-I will not.<br>-I will not.
<SYNC Start=5052015><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5052220><P>I will not.
<SYNC Start=5053744><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5061929><P>Do you love me?
<SYNC Start=5063362><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5065266><P>-Yes.<br>-Then prove it.
<SYNC Start=5067996><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5070137><P>Kill her.
<SYNC Start=5071536><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5072607><P>-She's nothing to me.<br>-Just the same...
<SYNC Start=5075701><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5076677><P>...l'd like for you to kill her.
<SYNC Start=5079077><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5082950><P>-You will not touch her!<br>-You still think to challenge me?!
<SYNC Start=5087944><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5091292><P>-Now.<br>-No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.
<SYNC Start=5095228><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5096097><P>It's what I want.
<SYNC Start=5098031><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5104405><P>How sweet.
<SYNC Start=5106566><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5112747><P>I'm ready.
<SYNC Start=5114339><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5191125><P>See, my children?
<SYNC Start=5193218><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5194395><P>Remember your real family!
<SYNC Start=5197023><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5198332><P>Or join hers.
<SYNC Start=5199959><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5201235><P>Now...
<SYNC Start=5202759><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5204672><P>...give me my crown.
<SYNC Start=5206537><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5208209><P>Spoken like a true king.
<SYNC Start=5210404><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5213547><P>Come.
<SYNC Start=5215174><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5225393><P>You see how he obeys?
<SYNC Start=5228760><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5229230><P>You will...
<SYNC Start=5230561><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5231565><P>...or you will all die.
<SYNC Start=5234125><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5239874><P>That is enough, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=5241705><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5251619><P>That is enough, Lestat! Stop!
<SYNC Start=5253553><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5321655><P>You kill me...
<SYNC Start=5324180><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5324358><P>...you kill yourselves.
<SYNC Start=5327384><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5372473><P>Wait, Lestat.
<SYNC Start=5374270><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5377044><P>You must stop.
<SYNC Start=5378534><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5533500><P>She drank Akasha's last drop.
<SYNC Start=5536731><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5538138><P>She took Akasha's death into herself.
<SYNC Start=5542006><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5543410><P>She's not dead.
<SYNC Start=5545002><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5545980><P>She sleeps.
<SYNC Start=5548107><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5606707><P>Hello?
<SYNC Start=5608231><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5641041><P>Oh, my God!
<SYNC Start=5642770><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5643610><P>Jesse?
<SYNC Start=5645100><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5646313><P>Hello, David.
<SYNC Start=5647746><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5659426><P>David, this is Lestat.
<SYNC Start=5661519><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5662129><P>-Hello.<br>-I have something for you.
<SYNC Start=5666156><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5670003><P>I believe...
<SYNC Start=5671766><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5672072><P>...that you wanted this back.
<SYNC Start=5674768><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5676910><P>Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
<SYNC Start=5680676><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5690991><P>-Can I ask--?<br>-What's it like?
<SYNC Start=5692856><P><br>
<SYNC Start=5694461><P>Do you want to find out?
<SYNC Start=5696759><P><br>

 In New York City's war on crime,<br>
<SYNC Start=5046><P Class=ENCC> the worst criminal offenders are pursued<br> by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.<br>
<SYNC Start=10106><P Class=ENCC>
These are their stories.<br>
<SYNC Start=13026><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=15822><P Class=ENCC>
Not this again.<br>
<SYNC Start=17583><P Class=ENCC>
What do you think you're gonna find?<br>
<SYNC Start=18773><P Class=ENCC>
Motel receipts? Love letters?<br>
<SYNC Start=21539><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz, why are you doing this?<br>
<SYNC Start=24539><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=27272><P Class=ENCC>
Why are you, Henry?<br>
<SYNC Start=30272><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=31008><P Class=ENCC>
I think she's having me followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=34008><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=35274><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know what's wrong with her.<br>
<SYNC Start=36995><P Class=ENCC>
Yesterday she left me nine messages,<br>
<SYNC Start=38836><P Class=ENCC> telling me to be careful.<br>
<SYNC Start=41836><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=42654><P Class=ENCC>
I gave the cook the night off.<br>
<SYNC Start=44149><P Class=ENCC>
I thought we could all<br> have dinner at Mr. Chow's.<br>
<SYNC Start=46990><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, sorry, Mom.<br>
I have to work.<br>
<SYNC Start=48753><P Class=ENCC>
I can't make it either.<br>
I have to fly to Miami.<br>
<SYNC Start=51033><P Class=ENCC>
I won't be back till after midnight.<br>
<SYNC Start=53384><P Class=ENCC>
I can do an early lunch,<br> around 11:00.<br>
<SYNC Start=55762><P Class=ENCC>
 I can swing that.<br>
<SYNC Start=57156><P Class=ENCC>
I'm busy.<br>
<SYNC Start=58286><P Class=ENCC>
Never mind.<br>
<SYNC Start=60125><P Class=ENCC>
I just wanted us all to have dinner.<br>
<SYNC Start=63125><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=67986><P Class=ENCC>
If I were less trusting,<br>
<SYNC Start=68925><P Class=ENCC>
I'd think she's the one having the affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=71925><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=77309><P Class=ENCC>
I told you I'm gonna prove<br> how wrong you are, and I will.<br>
<SYNC Start=80437><P Class=ENCC>
Stay out of it, Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=81791><P Class=ENCC>
Please?<br>
<SYNC Start=83262><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=84313><P Class=ENCC>
You and Dad are<br> not splitting up over this bull.<br>
<SYNC Start=87313><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=91941><P Class=ENCC>
Big hands, great ass, ponytail...<br>
<SYNC Start=93906><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, what was his name?<br>
<SYNC Start=95176><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz, you remember that<br>
Welsh masseur at Bliss?<br>
<SYNC Start=97444><P Class=ENCC>
No.<br>
<SYNC Start=98368><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=99334><P Class=ENCC>
It's gonna be a boy.<br>
<SYNC Start=100540><P Class=ENCC>
What?<br>
<SYNC Start=101769><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, you mean Livvy...<br> my sister-in-law.<br>
<SYNC Start=104697><P Class=ENCC>
We just found out<br>
Monday she's pregnant again.<br>
<SYNC Start=107171><P Class=ENCC>
But how did you know?<br>
<SYNC Start=110256><P Class=ENCC>
Did she go off her Xanax?<br>
<SYNC Start=112444><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton, it's Mom again.<br>
<SYNC Start=113738><P Class=ENCC>
Would you please, please,<br> give me a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=115288><P Class=ENCC>
I just want to make sure you're okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=117414><P Class=ENCC>
I'll try you at work again.<br>
<SYNC Start=120414><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=130217><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton?<br>
<SYNC Start=132415><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I thought...<br>
<SYNC Start=134690><P Class=ENCC>
No, he still hasn't called.<br>
<SYNC Start=137133><P Class=ENCC>
I just have this terrible...<br>
<SYNC Start=139282><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=141431><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, it would help.<br>
Are you sure?<br>
<SYNC Start=146137><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=148488><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I'm... I'm sitting down.<br>
<SYNC Start=151255><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, man, I can't believe<br> how much that girl drank.<br>
<SYNC Start=155586><P Class=ENCC>
It looks like she helped<br> this guy park his car.<br>
<SYNC Start=158586><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=160052><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, wait.<br>
What's that? A little TV?<br>
<SYNC Start=163184><P Class=ENCC>
It's a video monitor.<br>
<SYNC Start=164435><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody left it on.<br>
<SYNC Start=166014><P Class=ENCC>
It's a live transmission from a camera.<br>
<SYNC Start=168467><P Class=ENCC>
It's got to be close.<br>
<SYNC Start=171020><P Class=ENCC>

<SYNC Start=226306><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=229195><P Class=ENCC>
We called you as soon as<br> we found his press credentials.<br>
<SYNC Start=231672><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster:<br>
He's a cameraman for Newstime.<br>
<SYNC Start=234307><P Class=ENCC>
His cell phone was in the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=235637><P Class=ENCC>
He's got messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=236992><P Class=ENCC>
We're getting his password<br> from the phone company.<br>
<SYNC Start=238832><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.<br>
<SYNC Start=240943><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=242478><P Class=ENCC>
Wallet's loaded.<br>
<SYNC Start=243927><P Class=ENCC>
Plastic's all accounted for.<br>
<SYNC Start=246438><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe one day we'll get lucky<br> and robbery will be the motive.<br>
<SYNC Start=249807><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=251567><P Class=ENCC>
Now, the light doesn't work,<br> but, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=255190><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=256116><P Class=ENCC> the bulb...<br>
<SYNC Start=258101><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=259740><P Class=ENCC>
It looks new.<br>
<SYNC Start=261580><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=264083><P Class=ENCC>
Webster?<br>
Yeah. His throat's been cut.<br>
<SYNC Start=267040><P Class=ENCC>
There's hardly any blood in the trunk.<br>
<SYNC Start=268431><P Class=ENCC>
There's no blood on the ground.<br>
<SYNC Start=270660><P Class=ENCC>
He was killed somewhere else.<br>
<SYNC Start=272094><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, they put his body<br> in the trunk, and his camera...<br>
<SYNC Start=275445><P Class=ENCC> they didn't realize<br> the camera was still running...<br>
<SYNC Start=278385><P Class=ENCC> and then drove the car here.<br>
<SYNC Start=280477><P Class=ENCC>
The tape's missing.<br>
<SYNC Start=282413><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he was working<br> and pointed his camera at the wrong news.<br>
<SYNC Start=285782><P Class=ENCC>
Of all places to ditch a car,<br>
<SYNC Start=287441><P Class=ENCC>
Long Island City would<br> not be my first choice.<br>

Morning mass.<br>
<SYNC Start=295142><P Class=ENCC>
St. Peter's.<br>
<SYNC Start=297233><P Class=ENCC>
Webster had a short walk to the pearly gates.<br>
<SYNC Start=300301><P Class=ENCC>
Assuming that's where he was headed.<br>

Newstime Offices 52 East 10th Street<br>
Wednesday, April 30<br>
<SYNC Start=307491><P Class=ENCC>
We were doing a story on a doorman strike,<br>
<SYNC Start=310001><P Class=ENCC> another on gypsy cabs.<br>
<SYNC Start=311700><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing more dangerous than that.<br>
<SYNC Start=312848><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he was working on a story of his own.<br>
<SYNC Start=314852><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, no. He was my cameraman.<br>
<SYNC Start=316758><P Class=ENCC>
If we could look at his computer...<br>
<SYNC Start=318518><P Class=ENCC>
It's not his computer.<br>
<SYNC Start=319809><P Class=ENCC>
It's the company's.<br>
<SYNC Start=321020><P Class=ENCC>
There could be names of sources,<br> all kinds of protected information.<br>
<SYNC Start=324318><P Class=ENCC>
"If your pictures aren't good enough,<br> you aren't close enough."<br>
<SYNC Start=326901><P Class=ENCC>
The war photographer, Robert Capa.<br>
<SYNC Start=328492><P Class=ENCC>
Webster's motto?<br>
<SYNC Start=330287><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I guess.<br>
<SYNC Start=331662><P Class=ENCC>
Is this Webster here?<br>
<SYNC Start=332931><P Class=ENCC>
Look. He was in the war on Iraq.<br>
<SYNC Start=336790><P Class=ENCC>
Was he embedded?<br>
<SYNC Start=338775><P Class=ENCC>
I don't think the kid<br> actually saw any action.<br>
<SYNC Start=341247><P Class=ENCC>
Eh, just, you know...<br>
<SYNC Start=342603><P Class=ENCC>
I can see he has some messages here<br>
<SYNC Start=344459><P Class=ENCC> from his mom last night.<br>
<SYNC Start=346315><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, last night.<br>
Every night.<br>
<SYNC Start=347810><P Class=ENCC>
The kid lived with his parents.<br>
<SYNC Start=349142><P Class=ENCC>
Do you mind if we keep these messages?<br>
<SYNC Start=350802><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sure his mom wasn't, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=352926><P Class=ENCC> one of his sources.<br>
<SYNC Start=354136><P Class=ENCC>
And if you find anything on that computer,<br>
<SYNC Start=356552><P Class=ENCC> you let us know.<br>
<SYNC Start=358657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=364311><P Class=ENCC>
- Christine Roberts?<br>
- Uh, she's not here, and I have to go out.<br>
<SYNC Start=367014><P Class=ENCC>
I'm a reporter for the...<br>
<SYNC Start=368049><P Class=ENCC>
You were going so fast,<br> we almost lost you.<br>
<SYNC Start=370429><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, look, a download off Webster's<br> computer from the property tax rolls.<br>
<SYNC Start=373887><P Class=ENCC>
Must be for the story<br> he wasn't doing on his own.<br>
<SYNC Start=376950><P Class=ENCC>
We'll take over from here, Jerry.<br>
<SYNC Start=378417><P Class=ENCC>
Mmm.<br>
<SYNC Start=379282><P Class=ENCC>
Can we come in?<br>
<SYNC Start=380575><P Class=ENCC>
The police. What choice do I have?<br>
<SYNC Start=383108><P Class=ENCC>
I'm Detective Goren.<br>
<SYNC Start=384564><P Class=ENCC>
This is Detective Eames.<br>
Uh...<br>
<SYNC Start=386028><P Class=ENCC>
- And you are?<br>
- Octavia Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=387627><P Class=ENCC>
I rent this place from Christine.<br>
<SYNC Start=389079><P Class=ENCC>
I moved in three weeks ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=390186><P Class=ENCC>
Do you want to see my green card?<br>
<SYNC Start=391846><P Class=ENCC>
It's not necessary.<br>
<SYNC Start=393278><P Class=ENCC>
You are in the art business.<br>
<SYNC Start=394624><P Class=ENCC>
I am a lawyer.<br>
<SYNC Start=396670><P Class=ENCC>
I am representing the estate of<br> a great collector in Santiago.<br>
<SYNC Start=400264><P Class=ENCC>
I found a buyer in New York.<br>
<SYNC Start=402107><P Class=ENCC>
The Webster Gallery.<br>
<SYNC Start=402954><P Class=ENCC>
These are going to the Webster Gallery?<br>
<SYNC Start=405682><P Class=ENCC>
He is my buyer.<br>
<SYNC Start=407379><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Henry Webster.<br>
<SYNC Start=408488><P Class=ENCC>
Does he have a brother<br> or a son named Clayton?<br>
<SYNC Start=413179><P Class=ENCC>
A son, yes.<br>
A funny name like that.<br>
<SYNC Start=414956><P Class=ENCC>
What's funny is Clayton looked up<br>
<SYNC Start=416464><P Class=ENCC> who was paying the tax on this condo.<br>
<SYNC Start=419464><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=420283><P Class=ENCC>
Why would he do that?<br>
<SYNC Start=421514><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he thought his father was paying.<br>
<SYNC Start=424272><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I see, because Henry<br> and I are having an affair?<br>
<SYNC Start=428020><P Class=ENCC>
Now that is ridiculous.<br>
<SYNC Start=429858><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, i-is there a reason<br>
<SYNC Start=430782><P Class=ENCC> why you haven't sent these to him yet?<br>
<SYNC Start=432225><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, the shipping label<br>
<SYNC Start=434238><P Class=ENCC> still has a date from a month ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=437429><P Class=ENCC>
I'm waiting for Henry to pay me.<br>
<SYNC Start=441301><P Class=ENCC>
How much does he owe you?<br>
<SYNC Start=442816><P Class=ENCC>
Two million dollars.<br>
<SYNC Start=444862><P Class=ENCC>
Well, there you go right there.<br>
<SYNC Start=446253><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe that's why his son is suspicious.<br>
<SYNC Start=448381><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, St. Peter's.<br>
<SYNC Start=449776><P Class=ENCC>
Right across from where<br>
Clayton was found this morning,<br>
<SYNC Start=452943><P Class=ENCC> dead.<br>
<SYNC Start=454438><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=456525><P Class=ENCC>
L-I'll bet you're gonna say<br> it was a coincidence.<br>
<SYNC Start=459328><P Class=ENCC>
- No. L-l...<br>
- No?<br>
<SYNC Start=460734><P Class=ENCC>
- I mean, yes.<br>
- Yes?<br>
<SYNC Start=463807><P Class=ENCC>
I don't understand.<br>
<SYNC Start=465060><P Class=ENCC>
There is nothing between Henry and me.<br>
<SYNC Start=469392><P Class=ENCC>
Nothing.<br>
<SYNC Start=471144><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=473848><P Class=ENCC>
Two million bucks worth of art is nothing?<br>
<SYNC Start=478625><P Class=ENCC>

The Webster Gallery 130 Spring Street<br>
Wednesday, April 30<br>
<SYNC Start=480633><P Class=ENCC>
I was in Miami most of the day.<br>
<SYNC Start=482720><P Class=ENCC>
I got back just after 1:30.<br>
<SYNC Start=485579><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton was supposed to be working.<br>
<SYNC Start=487075><P Class=ENCC>
I'm... I'm sure the people<br> in his office would know.<br>
<SYNC Start=488608><P Class=ENCC>
They don't. Do you know where<br> we found your son, Mr. Webster?<br>
<SYNC Start=492934><P Class=ENCC>
In Long Island City,<br> in an alley off Steinway Street.<br>
<SYNC Start=497177><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know someone from that neighborhood?<br>
<SYNC Start=499546><P Class=ENCC>
A young woman, Octavia Ruiz?<br>
<SYNC Start=502546><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=504038><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, yes. Yes, her.<br>
L... I know...<br>
<SYNC Start=506974><P Class=ENCC>
That has nothing to do with Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=508469><P Class=ENCC>
Well, we're trying to sort that out.<br>
<SYNC Start=511085><P Class=ENCC>
So far we've come up with two million dollars<br>
<SYNC Start=513241><P Class=ENCC> that you've given to Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=514939><P Class=ENCC>
That's coming from your wife, right?<br>
<SYNC Start=516616><P Class=ENCC>
I'm paying for a collection of prints.<br>
<SYNC Start=518356><P Class=ENCC>
As for the source of the money,<br> that's none of your business.<br>
<SYNC Start=520494><P Class=ENCC>
We checked your wife's pedigree.<br>
<SYNC Start=522359><P Class=ENCC>
It's amazing what one<br> copper mine can do for a family.<br>
<SYNC Start=525537><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. All right.<br>
<SYNC Start=527217><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz is advancing me the money.<br>
<SYNC Start=528878><P Class=ENCC>
It's a good investment.<br>
<SYNC Start=529989><P Class=ENCC>
It'll put the gallery on the map.<br>
<SYNC Start=532646><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, but she's having second thoughts,<br>
<SYNC Start=534100><P Class=ENCC> because she thinks that<br> there's something going on<br>
<SYNC Start=535762><P Class=ENCC> between you and Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=538152><P Class=ENCC>
My wife is very insecure.<br>
<SYNC Start=540850><P Class=ENCC>
What does it have to do with my son?<br>
<SYNC Start=543628><P Class=ENCC>
Well, she tried to get in<br> touch with your son last night.<br>
<SYNC Start=545815><P Class=ENCC>
She left messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=547353><P Class=ENCC>
That's just Lyz worrying.<br>
<SYNC Start=548622><P Class=ENCC>
She didn't like him working nights.<br>
<SYNC Start=549955><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe she had reason to worry.<br>
<SYNC Start=551178><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe she asked him to confirm<br>
<SYNC Start=552821><P Class=ENCC> her suspicions, to follow Ms. Ruiz.<br>
<SYNC Start=556047><P Class=ENCC>
In the first place,<br> there is nothing to confirm.<br>
<SYNC Start=557676><P Class=ENCC>
In the second place, my son<br>
<SYNC Start=559336><P Class=ENCC> would never humor my wife's paranoid fugues!<br>
<SYNC Start=561463><P Class=ENCC>
This time he did.<br>
<SYNC Start=563670><P Class=ENCC>
He checked the tax records on Ms. Ruiz's condo<br>
<SYNC Start=566414><P Class=ENCC> to see who the owner was.<br>
<SYNC Start=568033><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe he thought it was you.<br>
<SYNC Start=571033><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=575681><P Class=ENCC>
My son was not killed because of this.<br>
<SYNC Start=579703><P Class=ENCC>
I don't believe it.<br>
<SYNC Start=581971><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=584873><P Class=ENCC>
I almost told Henry everything.<br>
<SYNC Start=587123><P Class=ENCC>
L... l... I can't. I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=591133><P Class=ENCC>
It's a terrible burden.<br>
<SYNC Start=592258><P Class=ENCC>
I don't... I don't know how you live with it.<br>
<SYNC Start=593981><P Class=ENCC>
You have to believe that there is a purpose,<br>
<SYNC Start=596697><P Class=ENCC> that it's a blessing.<br>
<SYNC Start=598274><P Class=ENCC>
And... And know that Clayton will be all right.<br>
<SYNC Start=601806><P Class=ENCC>
He... He died near the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=604199><P Class=ENCC>
Three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=605673><P Class=ENCC>
It's a sign.<br>
<SYNC Start=607250><P Class=ENCC>
Surrounded by angels and saints.<br>
<SYNC Start=610591><P Class=ENCC>
He's at peace.<br>
<SYNC Start=612067><P Class=ENCC>
And he wants you to know that.<br>
<SYNC Start=615838><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=619853><P Class=ENCC>
The airline confirmed the dad<br> was on the flight back from Miami.<br>
<SYNC Start=622555><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Ruiz, on the other hand,<br> was at a gallery opening downtown.<br>
<SYNC Start=627139><P Class=ENCC>
A neighbor saw her come home<br> alone around 11:00.<br>
<SYNC Start=630203><P Class=ENCC>
Ruiz had anything to do with this murder,<br>
<SYNC Start=631798><P Class=ENCC> you think she'd make sure the body<br>
<SYNC Start=632998><P Class=ENCC> didn't end up on her doorstep.<br>
<SYNC Start=634639><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, that's not the only thing<br> that doesn't add up.<br>
<SYNC Start=636867><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, the lab found traces of animal blood...<br>
<SYNC Start=640318><P Class=ENCC> in the wound on the kid's neck,<br>
<SYNC Start=641550><P Class=ENCC> probably from the knife.<br>
<SYNC Start=642802><P Class=ENCC>
And then there's the bulb in the trunk.<br>
<SYNC Start=646639><P Class=ENCC>
The repair record on the car...<br>
<SYNC Start=649202><P Class=ENCC> shows it was replaced six months ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=653716><P Class=ENCC>
They last longer than that.<br>
<SYNC Start=656370><P Class=ENCC>
Well, unless it stays on all night.<br>
<SYNC Start=660111><P Class=ENCC>
It's the pass code<br>
<SYNC Start=661679><P Class=ENCC> for the voice mail on Clayton's cell phone.<br>
<SYNC Start=664679><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=666721><P Class=ENCC>
First message.<br>
<SYNC Start=668033><P Class=ENCC>
Where are you, sweetheart?<br>
<SYNC Start=669570><P Class=ENCC>
I wish you'd call me.<br>
<SYNC Start=671290><P Class=ENCC>
Next message.<br>
<SYNC Start=672706><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton, it's Mom again.<br>
<SYNC Start=673892><P Class=ENCC>
Would you please, please, give me a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=675515><P Class=ENCC>
I just want to make sure you're okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=677332><P Class=ENCC>
End of messages.<br>
<SYNC Start=679072><P Class=ENCC>
That was at 11:35.<br>
<SYNC Start=682552><P Class=ENCC>
Just about the same time<br>
<SYNC Start=683598><P Class=ENCC> as the last message she left at his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=686766><P Class=ENCC>
This lady's sick with worry,<br>
<SYNC Start=688161><P Class=ENCC> and she just stopped calling?<br>
<SYNC Start=691161><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=691385><P Class=ENCC>
I went to bed.<br>
<SYNC Start=692435><P Class=ENCC>
That's why I stopped.<br>
<SYNC Start=694297><P Class=ENCC>
Please be careful.<br>
<SYNC Start=697622><P Class=ENCC>
We will.<br>
<SYNC Start=700735><P Class=ENCC>
Is there a particular reason<br> why you were calling him?<br>
<SYNC Start=704977><P Class=ENCC>
We were very close.<br>
We talked often.<br>
<SYNC Start=707258><P Class=ENCC>
Uh, about your husband.<br>
<SYNC Start=710425><P Class=ENCC>
Your husband told us<br> you suspect him of having an affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=714254><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=717524><P Class=ENCC>
Did you ask your son to check up<br> on a woman, Octavia Ruiz,<br>
<SYNC Start=721634><P Class=ENCC> maybe watch her apartment,<br>
<SYNC Start=724922><P Class=ENCC> catch your husband there?<br>
<SYNC Start=726967><P Class=ENCC>
No. I would never ask him to go up there.<br>
<SYNC Start=729013><P Class=ENCC>
It's too dangerous.<br>
<SYNC Start=732013><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=732292><P Class=ENCC>
Um, up there?<br>
<SYNC Start=734467><P Class=ENCC>
The Bronx.<br>
<SYNC Start=735239><P Class=ENCC>
I found a woman's address<br> in my husband's wallet.<br>
<SYNC Start=739348><P Class=ENCC>
Mrs. Webster,<br> she moved three weeks ago,<br>
<SYNC Start=743539><P Class=ENCC> to Long Island City,<br>
<SYNC Start=745733><P Class=ENCC> near where we found your son.<br>
<SYNC Start=748733><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=754947><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry.<br>
I'm very upset.<br>
<SYNC Start=758274><P Class=ENCC>
You'll have to come back.<br>
<SYNC Start=761274><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=764499><P Class=ENCC>
You have a night-light.<br>
<SYNC Start=767499><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=769681><P Class=ENCC>
You had this a long time,<br> since Clayton was little?<br>
<SYNC Start=773015><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. He was afraid of the dark,<br>
<SYNC Start=776674><P Class=ENCC> and he just got used to having it on.<br>
<SYNC Start=780819><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. You didn't want him<br> lying alone in the dark.<br>
<SYNC Start=786157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=792309><P Class=ENCC>
She's the one...<br>
<SYNC Start=794847><P Class=ENCC> who opened the trunk to leave the light on.<br>
<SYNC Start=797729><P Class=ENCC>
She found the body.<br>
<SYNC Start=801350><P Class=ENCC>
Even though she didn't know<br>
Ruiz lived down the street.<br>
<SYNC Start=803782><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. She couldn't know that.<br>
<SYNC Start=806731><P Class=ENCC>
But somehow she knew where to look for her son.<br>
<SYNC Start=811440><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=813480><P Class=ENCC>
Her only outgoing calls were to her<br>
<SYNC Start=815059><P Class=ENCC> son's cell phone and to his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=817349><P Class=ENCC>
She got a call from a no-name,<br>
<SYNC Start=819068><P Class=ENCC> pay-as-you-go cell phone...<br>
<SYNC Start=820622><P Class=ENCC>
A 20-minute call,<br>
<SYNC Start=821608><P Class=ENCC> maybe to tell her where her son was.<br>
<SYNC Start=824046><P Class=ENCC>
A mother finds her son dead,<br>
<SYNC Start=825335><P Class=ENCC> she calls 911, she tells her husband.<br>
<SYNC Start=827175><P Class=ENCC>
She doesn't just go home<br> and wait for all hell to break loose.<br>
<SYNC Start=829855><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, well, she somehow feels responsible.<br>
<SYNC Start=831756><P Class=ENCC>
Because of her suspicions, her worries.<br>
<SYNC Start=833763><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. I'm starting to think...<br>
<SYNC Start=836681><P Class=ENCC> that this death was staged for her benefit.<br>
<SYNC Start=840784><P Class=ENCC>
To make her believe that<br>
<SYNC Start=842088><P Class=ENCC> it had something to do with<br> an alleged affair.<br>
<SYNC Start=845193><P Class=ENCC>
You find the perps,<br> you can always ask them.<br>
<SYNC Start=846937><P Class=ENCC>
Well, luckily,<br> they left a calling card.<br>
<SYNC Start=849820><P Class=ENCC>
The lab identified the animal<br> blood on the knife...<br>
<SYNC Start=852984><P Class=ENCC> being mixed chicken,<br> sheep and goat blood.<br>
<SYNC Start=857009><P Class=ENCC>
And this.<br>
<SYNC Start=859712><P Class=ENCC>
This is where the car was abandoned.<br>
<SYNC Start=861273><P Class=ENCC>
On the northeast corner...<br>
<SYNC Start=862807><P Class=ENCC> of a square being framed by St. Peter's Church,<br>
<SYNC Start=866054><P Class=ENCC>
St. Anthony's and St. Francis.<br>
<SYNC Start=868671><P Class=ENCC>
Now these are three saints<br> that correspond with orisha...<br>
<SYNC Start=873881><P Class=ENCC> spirits worshipped by people<br> who practice Santeria.<br>
<SYNC Start=879295><P Class=ENCC>
Some Santeria followers,<br>
<SYNC Start=881301><P Class=ENCC> they believe that this square...<br>
<SYNC Start=883124><P Class=ENCC> has mystical properties.<br>
<SYNC Start=885311><P Class=ENCC>
The killers might've thought<br> placing the body there...<br>
<SYNC Start=888721><P Class=ENCC> would protect them.<br>
<SYNC Start=891632><P Class=ENCC>
You think Santeria,<br> you think South America.<br>
<SYNC Start=894532><P Class=ENCC>
We think cutthroat art business.<br>
<SYNC Start=896480><P Class=ENCC>
You're on the verge of an important deal.<br>
<SYNC Start=898255><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody wants to stop it.<br>
<SYNC Start=899976><P Class=ENCC>
And since Ms. Ruiz wouldn't<br> torpedo her own deal...<br>
<SYNC Start=903243><P Class=ENCC>
That leaves someone<br> connected to you or your wife.<br>
<SYNC Start=905351><P Class=ENCC>
Someone that knows about<br> your wife's insecurities.<br>
<SYNC Start=907944><P Class=ENCC>
Well, that could be any of my friends.<br>
<SYNC Start=910744><P Class=ENCC>
She's got these moods where she thinks that<br>
<SYNC Start=912704><P Class=ENCC> money is the only reason<br> that anybody cares about her.<br>
<SYNC Start=916133><P Class=ENCC>
That's why this was so important,<br>
<SYNC Start=918485><P Class=ENCC> why I needed this t-t-to work,<br>
<SYNC Start=920469><P Class=ENCC> to be a success.<br>
<SYNC Start=922046><P Class=ENCC>
'Cause once you're financially independent,<br>
<SYNC Start=924072><P Class=ENCC> she would know that you love her for herself.<br>
<SYNC Start=926707><P Class=ENCC>
But it's only driven us further apart.<br>
<SYNC Start=929688><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe that's the point...<br> to drive you apart.<br>
<SYNC Start=932330><P Class=ENCC>
Well, now you got me thinking<br> that I should've had her followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=935698><P Class=ENCC>
Why?<br>
<SYNC Start=936969><P Class=ENCC>
Did she have you followed?<br>
<SYNC Start=940318><P Class=ENCC>
When I borrowed Clayton's car<br> one night two weeks ago,<br>
<SYNC Start=943038><P Class=ENCC>
I thought Lyz was having me followed.<br>
<SYNC Start=946791><P Class=ENCC>
I noticed them right after<br>
I picked up the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=948675><P Class=ENCC>
Two Hispanic men in a gray car. Um,<br>
<SYNC Start=951652><P Class=ENCC>
I let them pull up next to me at a light.<br>
<SYNC Start=953698><P Class=ENCC>
When they saw me looking at them, they...<br>
<SYNC Start=956698><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=957554><P Class=ENCC> they were surprised.<br>
<SYNC Start=958951><P Class=ENCC>
And they took off.<br>
<SYNC Start=961431><P Class=ENCC>
Where'd you pick up your son's car?<br>
<SYNC Start=963370><P Class=ENCC>
At the parking garage at his work.<br>
<SYNC Start=966194><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=FF3366>
Parking Garage 63 East 68th Street<br>
Monday, May 5<br>
<SYNC Start=968734><P Class=ENCC>
They parked over there.<br>
<SYNC Start=970149><P Class=ENCC>
You remember their license?<br>
<SYNC Start=972376><P Class=ENCC>
Uh...<br>
<SYNC Start=973953><P Class=ENCC>
No, l... I don't remember.<br>
<SYNC Start=976086><P Class=ENCC>
Did they smoke?<br>
<SYNC Start=978046><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. The tall one did.<br>
<SYNC Start=980275><P Class=ENCC>
Back here?<br>
<SYNC Start=982083><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, the short one wouldn't let him,<br> uh, smoke in the car.<br>
<SYNC Start=986007><P Class=ENCC>
Thanks.<br>
<SYNC Start=988053><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=990505><P Class=ENCC>
This print here...<br>
<SYNC Start=992449><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=994881><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. It repeats itself.<br>
<SYNC Start=998651><P Class=ENCC>
It's always parallel to the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1002287><P Class=ENCC>
And it always has more compression on the instep.<br>
<SYNC Start=1006242><P Class=ENCC>
He was leaning against the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1010659><P Class=ENCC>
So, the guy stood on his left foot,<br>
<SYNC Start=1014525><P Class=ENCC> crossed his right foot over his left,<br>
<SYNC Start=1016632><P Class=ENCC> held a cigarette in his left hand...<br>
<SYNC Start=1019390><P Class=ENCC> and leaned towards the column.<br>
<SYNC Start=1022680><P Class=ENCC>
Held onto the column with his right hand...<br>
<SYNC Start=1025008><P Class=ENCC> right about here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1028569><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe the orishas will be good<br>
<SYNC Start=1030364><P Class=ENCC> to us and give us a set of prints.<br>
<SYNC Start=1034198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1036728><P Class=ENCC>
The threat is gone.<br>
<SYNC Start=1039749><P Class=ENCC>
You're safe, Eduardo.<br>
<SYNC Start=1042263><P Class=ENCC>
But remember the promise you made.<br>
<SYNC Start=1044799><P Class=ENCC>
Their protection is not guaranteed for life.<br>
<SYNC Start=1048158><P Class=ENCC>
You have to keep earning it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1050486><P Class=ENCC>
I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=1052950><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1059909><P Class=ENCC>
If your men fail,<br>
<SYNC Start=1062321><P Class=ENCC> if they talk, Eduardo,<br>
<SYNC Start=1064653><P Class=ENCC> the orishas will be very angry.<br>
<SYNC Start=1068641><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1075916><P Class=ENCC>
They're bringing in<br> one of the guys from the garage,<br>
<SYNC Start=1077676><P Class=ENCC>
Nestor Reyes. The other one,<br>
Omar Sanchez, is still missing.<br>
<SYNC Start=1082468><P Class=ENCC>
What's that?<br>
<SYNC Start=1083859><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like a little crutch.<br>
<SYNC Start=1085031><P Class=ENCC>
It's for St. Lazarus.<br>
<SYNC Start=1086833><P Class=ENCC>
The followers of Santeria,<br> they wear it for protection...<br>
<SYNC Start=1089352><P Class=ENCC> against disease or death.<br>
<SYNC Start=1092712><P Class=ENCC>
What're you gonna do with it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1095712><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1099594><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know this guy.<br>
<SYNC Start=1102086><P Class=ENCC>
What about your cousin Omar?<br>
<SYNC Start=1103927><P Class=ENCC>
I don't got a cousin Omar.<br>
<SYNC Start=1105588><P Class=ENCC>
Little Omar?<br>
<SYNC Start=1106674><P Class=ENCC>
The one we found in your jacket,<br>
<SYNC Start=1108130><P Class=ENCC> under "known associates."<br>
<SYNC Start=1110673><P Class=ENCC>
He told us he knows you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1113673><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1114876><P Class=ENCC>
You don't got Little Omar.<br>
<SYNC Start=1117202><P Class=ENCC>
He told us why you parked the car<br>
<SYNC Start=1118426><P Class=ENCC> next to the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1120655><P Class=ENCC>
To be protected, right, Nestor?<br>
<SYNC Start=1123293><P Class=ENCC>
Somebody's telling you stories.<br>
<SYNC Start=1125054><P Class=ENCC>
That's Santeria stuff... that's crap.<br>
<SYNC Start=1127301><P Class=ENCC>
Little Omar doesn't think so.<br>
<SYNC Start=1130179><P Class=ENCC>
You should've seen him when we showed him...<br>
<SYNC Start=1131456><P Class=ENCC> what the guy you killed had in his pocket.<br>
<SYNC Start=1135100><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1139628><P Class=ENCC>
There's no way you could<br> kill him and get away with it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1142404><P Class=ENCC>
Not with St. Lazarus watching over him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1145306><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, man. Oh, man.<br>
<SYNC Start=1147953><P Class=ENCC>
We're dead men!<br>
<SYNC Start=1150021><P Class=ENCC>
Not if you confess.<br>
<SYNC Start=1152859><P Class=ENCC>
This killing wasn't your idea, was it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1155604><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1158734><P Class=ENCC>
The person who gave you the order...<br>
<SYNC Start=1161141><P Class=ENCC> that guy is gonna have to answer to orisha.<br>
<SYNC Start=1164226><P Class=ENCC>
Not you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1166509><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1170432><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. I tell you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1173527><P Class=ENCC>
It's Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1175285><P Class=ENCC>
Omar visited him up in Rikers.<br>
<SYNC Start=1177289><P Class=ENCC>
He told Omar what to do<br>
<SYNC Start=1178655><P Class=ENCC> and to leave the body next to the three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1181992><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1184470><P Class=ENCC>
Far as I can tell, Mr. Carver,<br>
<SYNC Start=1186478><P Class=ENCC> the only card you're holding is the uncooperated<br>
<SYNC Start=1188794><P Class=ENCC> hearsay testimony of an admitted killer.<br>
<SYNC Start=1192628><P Class=ENCC>
I wouldn't wait for us<br> to cooperate it before making a deal.<br>
<SYNC Start=1195971><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Mendez is already<br> facing drug and murder charges.<br>
<SYNC Start=1199910><P Class=ENCC>
I never talked to a Nestor.<br>
<SYNC Start=1202654><P Class=ENCC>
And Omar...<br>
<SYNC Start=1203972><P Class=ENCC> nobody seems to worry about Omar anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1207322><P Class=ENCC>
Because you had him killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1210322><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1211568><P Class=ENCC>
Things take care of themselves.<br>
<SYNC Start=1213593><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, well, the orisha doesn't<br> seem to be taking care of you anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1216727><P Class=ENCC>
I mean, otherwise we wouldn't be here<br> putting another murder on you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1222174><P Class=ENCC>
You killed someone under their protection.<br>
<SYNC Start=1225324><P Class=ENCC>
Nestor and Omar didn't take the time to<br>
<SYNC Start=1229120><P Class=ENCC> look through Clayton Webster's<br> pockets before they cut his throat.<br>
<SYNC Start=1234694><P Class=ENCC>
You're in prison.<br>
<SYNC Start=1237543><P Class=ENCC>
You're... You're looking down at a life sentence.<br>
<SYNC Start=1242919><P Class=ENCC>
But you're not afraid.<br>
<SYNC Start=1245430><P Class=ENCC>
And you feel safe from the laws of this world...<br>
<SYNC Start=1249800><P Class=ENCC> and the next.<br>
<SYNC Start=1253581><P Class=ENCC>
There's someone watching over you, isn't there?<br>
<SYNC Start=1257910><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1265497><P Class=ENCC>
You sure there's no connection with Clayton Webster?<br>
<SYNC Start=1269303><P Class=ENCC>
None.<br>
<SYNC Start=1270999><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1272380><P Class=ENCC>
Then Mendez just picked<br>
<SYNC Start=1274920><P Class=ENCC>
Webster's name out of a hat?<br>
<SYNC Start=1276292><P Class=ENCC>
Or someone picked him for him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1279273><P Class=ENCC>
Someone that could convince him that<br>
<SYNC Start=1280559><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster was a threat to him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1285342><P Class=ENCC>
And who would that be?<br>
<SYNC Start=1288415><P Class=ENCC>
Someone who could guarantee his safety,<br>
<SYNC Start=1290967><P Class=ENCC> who has the authority in this<br>
<SYNC Start=1293166><P Class=ENCC> other world that he believes in.<br>
<SYNC Start=1297014><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1298958><P Class=ENCC>
His priest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1301153><P Class=ENCC>
His Santeria priest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1304157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1306355><P Class=ENCC>
I signed the visitors sheet at the prison...<br>
<SYNC Start=1308164><P Class=ENCC> with the understanding that Mr. Mendez's<br> religious beliefs wouldn't be scrutinized.<br>
<SYNC Start=1311736><P Class=ENCC>
Actually, it's you we're scrutinizing, Mr. Bello.<br>
<SYNC Start=1314904><P Class=ENCC>
So far, we've found out<br> you did time in Texas for fraud...<br>
<SYNC Start=1318853><P Class=ENCC> in association with revival meetings.<br>
<SYNC Start=1321269><P Class=ENCC>
That was when you were under your legal name,<br>
<SYNC Start=1323369><P Class=ENCC>
Julian Bellonte.<br>
<SYNC Start=1324866><P Class=ENCC>
So you went from Bible thumping to Santeria.<br>
<SYNC Start=1327525><P Class=ENCC>
I came to Santeria a long time ago,<br> through an aunt.<br>
<SYNC Start=1331383><P Class=ENCC>
But I had to find my own path<br> before I could embrace it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1334774><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, so you're on a spiritual quest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1337308><P Class=ENCC>
I'm more interested in your quest.<br>
<SYNC Start=1339017><P Class=ENCC>
It has to do with the guidance<br> you give Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1342678><P Class=ENCC>
It's advice of a religious nature.<br>
<SYNC Start=1345049><P Class=ENCC>
Morning sickness.<br>
Still getting used to it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1347282><P Class=ENCC>
Santeria has commandments, huh?<br>
<SYNC Start=1349098><P Class=ENCC>
Don't kill. Don't steal.<br>
<SYNC Start=1352098><P Class=ENCC>
I guess Eduardo was a recent convert.<br>
<SYNC Start=1355303><P Class=ENCC>
Now that he has more time on his hands,<br>
<SYNC Start=1357124><P Class=ENCC> he's paying more attention to his soul.<br>
<SYNC Start=1360961><P Class=ENCC>
These colors are for Elegba,<br>
<SYNC Start=1363352><P Class=ENCC>
St. Anthony.<br>
<SYNC Start=1365294><P Class=ENCC>
Do you know a Clayton Webster,<br>
<SYNC Start=1367291><P Class=ENCC> the news cameraman?<br>
<SYNC Start=1369140><P Class=ENCC>
I try to stay away from newspeople.<br>
<SYNC Start=1371265><P Class=ENCC>
Well, don't worry.<br>
Eduardo had him killed last week.<br>
<SYNC Start=1374249><P Class=ENCC>
And this is an Ogun,<br>
St. Peter.<br>
<SYNC Start=1376417><P Class=ENCC>
Eduardo doesn't discuss his business with me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1378663><P Class=ENCC>
Clayton Webster's throat was cut.<br>
<SYNC Start=1381218><P Class=ENCC>
Knife left traces of animal blood.<br>
<SYNC Start=1383568><P Class=ENCC>
His body was found under<br> the shadow of three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1387681><P Class=ENCC>
The murder had ritualistic touches,<br>
<SYNC Start=1389501><P Class=ENCC>
Santeria touches.<br>
<SYNC Start=1391199><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sorry. I can't help you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1392938><P Class=ENCC>
W-W-We're sorry that we've stressed you out.<br>
<SYNC Start=1394918><P Class=ENCC>
- You know, your neck...<br>
- It was a fender bender last year.<br>
<SYNC Start=1398238><P Class=ENCC> that's all.<br>
<SYNC Start=1399142><P Class=ENCC>
Someone rear-ended me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1402142><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1402446><P Class=ENCC>
Well, i-it's funny you didn't see him comin'.<br>
<SYNC Start=1407510><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1411649><P Class=ENCC>
Julian Bello has a hack license.<br>
<SYNC Start=1413719><P Class=ENCC>
He got his accident driving for a limo company.<br>
<SYNC Start=1416186><P Class=ENCC>
They house their cars in Long Island City.<br>
<SYNC Start=1418761><P Class=ENCC>
That would explain why<br> he's familiar with the neighborhood.<br>
<SYNC Start=1420501><P Class=ENCC>
Might explain a lot if he drove the Websters.<br>
<SYNC Start=1422642><P Class=ENCC>
I'm not finding them on Bello's receipts.<br>
<SYNC Start=1425642><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1427152><P Class=ENCC>
Even if he was their chauffeur,<br>
<SYNC Start=1429644><P Class=ENCC> you see them getting mixed up with Bello's hoodoo?<br>
<SYNC Start=1431833><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, we're just observing phenomena,<br>
<SYNC Start=1433612><P Class=ENCC> not explaining it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1436968><P Class=ENCC>
Here we go.<br>
<SYNC Start=1438522><P Class=ENCC>
Bello made a drop-off at the Websters' last year.<br>
<SYNC Start=1445079><P Class=ENCC>
Passenger's an Ilene Maxwell.<br>
<SYNC Start=1449405><P Class=ENCC>
Well, looks like Bello was<br>
Ms. Maxwell's regular driver until...<br>
<SYNC Start=1456081><P Class=ENCC>
Looks like four months ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=1459264><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=FF3366>
Apartment of Ilene Maxwell<br>
1094 Fifth Avenue, Tuesday, May 6<br>
<SYNC Start=1460922><P Class=ENCC>
He never talked to me about animal sacrifices.<br>
<SYNC Start=1463844><P Class=ENCC>
My God, I don't even wear fur.<br>
<SYNC Start=1465663><P Class=ENCC>
Did Lyz Webster ever meet him?<br>
<SYNC Start=1467688><P Class=ENCC>
No. Lyz has her own adviser.<br>
<SYNC Start=1469960><P Class=ENCC>
Very reliable person.<br>
<SYNC Start=1471273><P Class=ENCC>
Very in tune with people like us.<br>
<SYNC Start=1473023><P Class=ENCC>
She's a psychic.<br>
She advises you too?<br>
<SYNC Start=1475321><P Class=ENCC>
I don't use Sylvia anymore.<br>
<SYNC Start=1476959><P Class=ENCC>
I have an astrologer now.<br>
<SYNC Start=1478922><P Class=ENCC>
When did you meet Sylvia?<br>
<SYNC Start=1480644><P Class=ENCC>
My son was in the hospital last year,<br> having his tonsils out.<br>
<SYNC Start=1484066><P Class=ENCC>
And the clotting factor in his blood makes even<br>
<SYNC Start=1486334><P Class=ENCC> minor surgery life-threatening.<br>
<SYNC Start=1488403><P Class=ENCC>
- You must have been very worried.<br>
- Yes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1490559><P Class=ENCC>
I was across the street from<br> the hospital having lunch,<br>
<SYNC Start=1492813><P Class=ENCC> and a woman came up to me,<br>
<SYNC Start=1494207><P Class=ENCC> introduced herself...<br> and said my son was going to be fine.<br>
<SYNC Start=1497578><P Class=ENCC>
That was Sylvia,<br> and she was right.<br>
<SYNC Start=1499930><P Class=ENCC>
And this was when Julian was driving you...<br>
<SYNC Start=1501262><P Class=ENCC>
- to the hospital and back.<br>
- Yes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1504462><P Class=ENCC>
And you were probably on the phone<br>
<SYNC Start=1506443><P Class=ENCC> talking about your son's condition, and...<br>
<SYNC Start=1508344><P Class=ENCC>
Yes, I imagine I was.<br>
<SYNC Start=1511572><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, you're not suggesting that...<br>
<SYNC Start=1514572><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1517364><P Class=ENCC>
I have a strong feeling about this, Susan.<br>
<SYNC Start=1520366><P Class=ENCC>
It's very...<br>
<SYNC Start=1523130><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia? Are you there?<br>
<SYNC Start=1525360><P Class=ENCC>
Susan, Sylvia will have to call you back.<br>
<SYNC Start=1526876><P Class=ENCC>
No, no. It's not your fault.<br>
<SYNC Start=1528695><P Class=ENCC>
She'll call you in a few minutes.<br>
<SYNC Start=1530481><P Class=ENCC>
Okay. Bye-bye.<br>
<SYNC Start=1533769><P Class=ENCC>
What did you see?<br>
<SYNC Start=1535268><P Class=ENCC>
Two people, a... a couple.<br>
<SYNC Start=1538330><P Class=ENCC>
The sky was red.<br>
I smelled sulfur.<br>
<SYNC Start=1541198><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
Sulfur... Red sky...<br>
<SYNC Start=1545209><P Class=ENCC>
That's lava. A volcano.<br>
<SYNC Start=1548548><P Class=ENCC>
You saw us in the South Seas.<br>
<SYNC Start=1552320><P Class=ENCC>
W-We have to leave now, Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1555540><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz can't handle it.<br>
I have to take it away from her,<br>
<SYNC Start=1558374><P Class=ENCC> and then we have to leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1559450><P Class=ENCC>
Hey, she'll grow into it.<br>
<SYNC Start=1562517><P Class=ENCC>
Remember how long it took you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1565048><P Class=ENCC>
Now she got what you promised her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1567952><P Class=ENCC>
And as soon as she fulfills her promise to you,<br>
<SYNC Start=1571337><P Class=ENCC> then we can leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1573809><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1575962><P Class=ENCC>
My relationship with Sylvia<br> doesn't concern anyone but me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1580332><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't she convince you<br> your husband was having an affair?<br>
<SYNC Start=1582747><P Class=ENCC>
Is that what Henry told you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1584114><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Webster, this woman is feeding off your fears.<br>
<SYNC Start=1586225><P Class=ENCC>
It's how she makes a living.<br>
<SYNC Start=1588110><P Class=ENCC>
You don't understand.<br>
<SYNC Start=1589256><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia has an accomplice with ties to a drug gang.<br>
<SYNC Start=1593224><P Class=ENCC>
He had your son killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1594974><P Class=ENCC>
Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=1596688><P Class=ENCC>
I don't believe that.<br>
<SYNC Start=1597961><P Class=ENCC>
Didn't Sylvia call you the night that Clayton died?<br>
<SYNC Start=1600617><P Class=ENCC>
No.<br>
<SYNC Start=1601806><P Class=ENCC>
We know you got a call.<br>
<SYNC Start=1603465><P Class=ENCC>
We know you found the body.<br>
<SYNC Start=1605801><P Class=ENCC>
We know you left the trunk open,<br>
<SYNC Start=1607437><P Class=ENCC> so he wouldn't lay in the dark all night.<br>
<SYNC Start=1610714><P Class=ENCC>
Now didn't she call you and tell you...<br>
<SYNC Start=1611982><P Class=ENCC> that she had a vision of<br> where you could find his body?<br>
<SYNC Start=1617229><P Class=ENCC>
Nobody told me.<br>
<SYNC Start=1620267><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1622643><P Class=ENCC>
It was you?<br>
<SYNC Start=1624445><P Class=ENCC>
It was your vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=1627445><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1629056><P Class=ENCC>
I've been given a very powerful gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=1632525><P Class=ENCC>
I don't talk about it<br> with skeptics and nonbelievers.<br>
<SYNC Start=1636733><P Class=ENCC>
Now please leave.<br>
<SYNC Start=1638996><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1647273><P Class=ENCC>
I can't believe this.<br>
<SYNC Start=1648912><P Class=ENCC>
Why not?<br>
A premonition about her family came true.<br>
<SYNC Start=1651912><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1651977><P Class=ENCC>
Her son was killed.<br>
<SYNC Start=1653474><P Class=ENCC>
Her husband's alleged mistress was implicated.<br>
<SYNC Start=1656822><P Class=ENCC>
All thanks to Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1658483><P Class=ENCC>
He convinced Eduardo<br>
<SYNC Start=1660323><P Class=ENCC> that Clayton was a threat to him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1661524><P Class=ENCC>
He told him to leave the body<br> near the three churches for protection.<br>
<SYNC Start=1664098><P Class=ENCC>
But his main agenda was to convince Lyz Webster<br>
<SYNC Start=1667920><P Class=ENCC> she really was psychic.<br>
<SYNC Start=1669379><P Class=ENCC>
That she would even believe in psychic powers,<br>
<SYNC Start=1671320><P Class=ENCC> let alone pay someone<br> to turn her into a clairvoyant<br>
<SYNC Start=1675317><P Class=ENCC>
People look for an edge in an uncertain world.<br>
<SYNC Start=1677587><P Class=ENCC>
Even people like Lyz Webster.<br>
Hmm.<br>
<SYNC Start=1679493><P Class=ENCC>
And people like Sylvia Campbell<br> and Julian Bello are waiting for them.<br>
<SYNC Start=1682455><P Class=ENCC>
They're pros.<br>
<SYNC Start=1683401><P Class=ENCC>
Their first appearance as<br> a duet was 14 years ago.<br>
<SYNC Start=1686115><P Class=ENCC>
They were arrested for fraud in connection<br>
<SYNC Start=1688067><P Class=ENCC> with a church they ran in San Francisco.<br>
<SYNC Start=1690071><P Class=ENCC>
"The Church of the Open Mind."<br>
<SYNC Start=1692583><P Class=ENCC>
Julian served six months.<br>
<SYNC Start=1694098><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1695392><P Class=ENCC>
They were arrested on another fraud charge.<br>
<SYNC Start=1697314><P Class=ENCC>
He got jail. She got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1699379><P Class=ENCC>
In New Orleans,<br> they opened a voodoo store...<br>
<SYNC Start=1701570><P Class=ENCC> where they promised to cast demons<br>
<SYNC Start=1703174><P Class=ENCC> out of a Mrs. Thelma Busfield for 20 grand.<br>
<SYNC Start=1706726><P Class=ENCC>
Julian got a year,<br> and again Sylvia got probation.<br>
<SYNC Start=1709415><P Class=ENCC>
He takes a plea,<br> so she can take a walk.<br>
<SYNC Start=1711767><P Class=ENCC>
Mr. Bello seems to be the one<br> to do the heavy lifting in the relationship.<br>
<SYNC Start=1716284><P Class=ENCC>
I would love to see the two of them in action.<br>
<SYNC Start=1719743><P Class=ENCC>
<font color=FF3366>
Apartment Of Julian Bello And Sylvia Campbell<br>
557 West 49th Street, Thursday, May 8<br>
<SYNC Start=1721863><P Class=ENCC>
She was his mother.<br>
<SYNC Start=1723889><P Class=ENCC>
He was her son.<br>
Of course she found him.<br>
<SYNC Start=1727150><P Class=ENCC>
We thought you might have helped her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1728604><P Class=ENCC>
The police department uses psychics<br> all the time to find people.<br>
<SYNC Start=1731551><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, l... I don't do work like that.<br>
<SYNC Start=1733637><P Class=ENCC>
L-l-It's too disturbing.<br>
<SYNC Start=1736637><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1738028><P Class=ENCC>
Well, if you had a vision of her son's death,<br>
<SYNC Start=1740601><P Class=ENCC> you wouldn't tell Lyz?<br>
<SYNC Start=1743236><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz knew there was a shadow on Clayton,<br>
<SYNC Start=1746667><P Class=ENCC> but she didn't know what it was.<br>
<SYNC Start=1749138><P Class=ENCC>
Well, did you make her aware of this shadow, or<br>
<SYNC Start=1754956><P Class=ENCC> did she sense it herself?<br>
<SYNC Start=1757184><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe it's the same shadow<br>
<SYNC Start=1758577><P Class=ENCC> that's been following you since Texas.<br>
<SYNC Start=1761387><P Class=ENCC>
Speak of the devil.<br>
<SYNC Start=1762578><P Class=ENCC>
The doorman told me you were here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1764310><P Class=ENCC>
They're asking about Lyz Webster and her son.<br>
<SYNC Start=1768001><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. And we were about to tell Sylvia...<br>
<SYNC Start=1770109><P Class=ENCC> about the connection to one of your Santeria clients,<br>
<SYNC Start=1773109><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1773212><P Class=ENCC>
Eduardo Mendez.<br>
<SYNC Start=1774489><P Class=ENCC>
It so happens, he ordered the hit on Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=1777078><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, what are they saying?<br>
<SYNC Start=1779347><P Class=ENCC>
It's the one I visit in prison.<br>
<SYNC Start=1781046><P Class=ENCC>
They're harassing everyone who...<br>
<SYNC Start=1784428><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1788352><P Class=ENCC>
What is it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1789877><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia, I'm here.<br>
<SYNC Start=1791730><P Class=ENCC>
Is she okay?<br>
<SYNC Start=1793020><P Class=ENCC>
She's fine.<br>
<SYNC Start=1794438><P Class=ENCC>
What is it?<br>
<SYNC Start=1796585><P Class=ENCC>
I saw water...<br>
<SYNC Start=1798386><P Class=ENCC> rushing water.<br>
<SYNC Start=1799725><P Class=ENCC>
A life sign.<br>
<SYNC Start=1802290><P Class=ENCC>
- What else?<br>
- I smelled fresh earth.<br>
<SYNC Start=1806320><P Class=ENCC>
It's new life.<br>
<SYNC Start=1809218><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1810467><P Class=ENCC>
Do you feel new life in this room?<br>
<SYNC Start=1813467><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1815144><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, are you having a baby?<br>
<SYNC Start=1817938><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. How about that?<br>
<SYNC Start=1820331><P Class=ENCC>
You'll have a brave child.<br>
<SYNC Start=1823579><P Class=ENCC>
Her clairvoyance...<br>
<SYNC Start=1825459><P Class=ENCC>
It's not just sights.<br>
She can also smell things.<br>
<SYNC Start=1829301><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. And the next time<br> you want to drop in, call ahead.<br>
<SYNC Start=1833114><P Class=ENCC>
I'll have a lawyer waiting.<br>
<SYNC Start=1834682><P Class=ENCC>
Come on. Let's go.<br>
<SYNC Start=1837195><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1838837><P Class=ENCC>
That's a neat trick.<br>
<SYNC Start=1840715><P Class=ENCC>
He knew I was pregnant from the store.<br>
<SYNC Start=1844002><P Class=ENCC>
If she had said "crab cakes,"<br>
<SYNC Start=1845669><P Class=ENCC> he would've said "crawling babies."<br>
<SYNC Start=1848958><P Class=ENCC>
Well, maybe it is a trick.<br>
<SYNC Start=1851407><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe the trick's on her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1854407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1856468><P Class=ENCC>
This can't be the Sylvia I know.<br>
<SYNC Start=1859387><P Class=ENCC>
Ms. Webster,<br>
<SYNC Start=1860943><P Class=ENCC>
I think that Sylvia believes that<br> she's clairvoyant,<br>
<SYNC Start=1863943><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1864827><P Class=ENCC> just as she believes that she can<br> heal with crystals and potions and faith.<br>
<SYNC Start=1868139><P Class=ENCC>
And she's sincere in her beliefs.<br>
<SYNC Start=1870472><P Class=ENCC>
And that she absolutely believes that<br> she can share this gift with you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1874734><P Class=ENCC>
She said she'd... she'd help me<br> develop my natural powers,<br>
<SYNC Start=1878395><P Class=ENCC> like Julian had helped her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1880217><P Class=ENCC>
She expected you to pay for this gift?<br>
<SYNC Start=1882362><P Class=ENCC>
Julian did.<br>
<SYNC Start=1884287><P Class=ENCC>
There was a consideration every month... $20,000.<br>
<SYNC Start=1887470><P Class=ENCC>
And a larger sum later.<br>
<SYNC Start=1890848><P Class=ENCC>
When you had proof you were clairvoyant.<br>
<SYNC Start=1892861><P Class=ENCC>
Yes.<br>
$500,000.<br>
<SYNC Start=1897993><P Class=ENCC>
But it went longer than you anticipated...<br>
<SYNC Start=1900873><P Class=ENCC> because you had doubts.<br>
<SYNC Start=1902935><P Class=ENCC>
And because Clayton...<br>
<SYNC Start=1906579><P Class=ENCC> was pressing you to stop seeing Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=1909275><P Class=ENCC>
He thought I was being exploited.<br>
<SYNC Start=1911829><P Class=ENCC>
You told Sylvia and Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=1913895><P Class=ENCC>
Yes. Julian said I should be more patient.<br>
<SYNC Start=1917819><P Class=ENCC>
And then you'd have the proof.<br>
<SYNC Start=1920819><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1923188><P Class=ENCC>
The night that...<br> that Clayton died,<br>
<SYNC Start=1928068><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1928702><P Class=ENCC>
I know it...<br>
<SYNC Start=1929973><P Class=ENCC> it wasn't Sylvia who called you.<br>
<SYNC Start=1932831><P Class=ENCC>
But it was Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=1935831><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1937116><P Class=ENCC>
He said Sylvia had told him<br> to lead me in a guided meditation...<br>
<SYNC Start=1942306><P Class=ENCC> to try and find Clayton.<br>
<SYNC Start=1944472><P Class=ENCC>
He interpreted what you saw...<br>
<SYNC Start=1948248><P Class=ENCC> until you were convinced.<br>
<SYNC Start=1950760><P Class=ENCC>
No, no, no. If... If it's all pretend,<br>
<SYNC Start=1952503><P Class=ENCC> how did Sylvia know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=1954628><P Class=ENCC>
When did she know?<br>
<SYNC Start=1955923><P Class=ENCC>
The next day.<br>
<SYNC Start=1957795><P Class=ENCC>
She had to have seen it in a vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=1960795><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1962852><P Class=ENCC>
Or Julian told her.<br>
<SYNC Start=1965852><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1973023><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, God.<br>
<SYNC Start=1976166><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, God.<br>
Clayton... it's all my fault.<br>
<SYNC Start=1980204><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1983536><P Class=ENCC>
They caught you when you were vulnerable.<br>
<SYNC Start=1987301><P Class=ENCC>
Now they're vulnerable.<br>
<SYNC Start=1990301><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1992584><P Class=ENCC>
Help us catch them.<br>
<SYNC Start=1995955><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2000209><P Class=ENCC>
I'm so glad you called me.<br>
<SYNC Start=2001519><P Class=ENCC>
L... I was sending good thoughts to you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2004519><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2004707><P Class=ENCC>
I see things clearly now, Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=2006486><P Class=ENCC>
Like photographs.<br>
<SYNC Start=2008350><P Class=ENCC>
Just like you said.<br>
<SYNC Start=2010393><P Class=ENCC>
I, uh, I made a promise to you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2013644><P Class=ENCC>
And a promise is a promise.<br>
<SYNC Start=2016644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2019257><P Class=ENCC>
It's too much, Lyz.<br>
L... I can't.<br>
<SYNC Start=2022744><P Class=ENCC>
No, no.<br>
L... I want you to have it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2026843><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2028407><P Class=ENCC>
Are you all right?<br>
<SYNC Start=2031407><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2033180><P Class=ENCC>
This morning, when I wrote your name on the check,<br>
<SYNC Start=2035042><P Class=ENCC>
I saw something...<br>
<SYNC Start=2037432><P Class=ENCC>
You and Julian in a room with gray stones.<br>
<SYNC Start=2040432><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2040658><P Class=ENCC>
There was a... a sheet of water,<br>
<SYNC Start=2042969><P Class=ENCC> a mirror and a man with a broken neck.<br>
<SYNC Start=2049033><P Class=ENCC>
He was asking a question about three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2052750><P Class=ENCC>
And the answer was wrong.<br>
<SYNC Start=2054629><P Class=ENCC>
It was a lie.<br>
<SYNC Start=2057122><P Class=ENCC>
The floor fell away.<br>
<SYNC Start=2060086><P Class=ENCC>
I saw you and Julian falling,<br> both of you falling through space.<br>
<SYNC Start=2066144><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2068032><P Class=ENCC>
Please, Sylvia, be careful.<br>
Please.<br>
<SYNC Start=2070636><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, no, no. Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2073808><P Class=ENCC>
Thank you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2076808><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2078545><P Class=ENCC>
All here.<br>
Next stop, airport. Huh?<br>
<SYNC Start=2082329><P Class=ENCC>
Next stop, downtown.<br>
<SYNC Start=2083985><P Class=ENCC>
I bet you know this one by heart:<br>
<SYNC Start=2085540><P Class=ENCC>
"Julian Bellonte and Sylvia Campbell,<br>
<SYNC Start=2088096><P Class=ENCC>
- you're under arrest for fraud."<br>
- Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2092335><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2094903><P Class=ENCC>
You'll sit here.<br>
<SYNC Start=2097133><P Class=ENCC>
And if you need something to drink,<br>
<SYNC Start=2099848><P Class=ENCC> you just ask the officer.<br>
<SYNC Start=2102848><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2123618><P Class=ENCC>
Let's put you, uh...<br>
Let's see, right here.<br>
<SYNC Start=2128337><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2130708><P Class=ENCC>
Everybody comfy?<br>
<SYNC Start=2132898><P Class=ENCC>
In case you're wondering,<br>
<SYNC Start=2134169><P Class=ENCC> when you exchanged Lyz's check<br> for the cashier check,<br>
<SYNC Start=2137004><P Class=ENCC> the bank notified Mr. Webster<br> because of the amount,<br>
<SYNC Start=2141046><P Class=ENCC> and he called us.<br>
<SYNC Start=2143720><P Class=ENCC>
And here we all are.<br>
<SYNC Start=2145850><P Class=ENCC>
That's a big number.<br>
Why'd she give you this money?<br>
<SYNC Start=2149555><P Class=ENCC>
It was a token of appreciation<br> for Sylvia's guidance and advice.<br>
<SYNC Start=2153293><P Class=ENCC>
We talked to Lyz after<br> we brought you in this afternoon.<br>
<SYNC Start=2157148><P Class=ENCC>
You know, l... l-It's...<br>
<SYNC Start=2160203><P Class=ENCC>
It's extraordinary.<br>
<SYNC Start=2162984><P Class=ENCC>
Y-You... Uh, what? What you... <br>
What you gave her..<br>
<SYNC Start=2165171><P Class=ENCC> what to call it.<br>
Second sight?<br>
<SYNC Start=2167393><P Class=ENCC>
Third eye? Sixth sense?<br>
<SYNC Start=2169376><P Class=ENCC>
- The gift.<br>
- Gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2174280><P Class=ENCC>
And Lyz said it didn't come to her overnight.<br>
<SYNC Start=2177749><P Class=ENCC>
For months,<br> she couldn't predict a sunrise.<br>
<SYNC Start=2179775><P Class=ENCC>
And then all of a sudden it fell into place.<br>
<SYNC Start=2182370><P Class=ENCC>
She had a premonition of her son's<br> death that was bang on the money!<br>
<SYNC Start=2185949><P Class=ENCC>
She even had a vision of where the body was.<br>
<SYNC Start=2190091><P Class=ENCC>
But there's something she can't figure out.<br>
<SYNC Start=2192956><P Class=ENCC>
She only saw one church.<br>
<SYNC Start=2195015><P Class=ENCC>
Then the next day,<br> you told her there were three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2199446><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2201278><P Class=ENCC>
How'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2205911><P Class=ENCC>
It's okay.<br>
<SYNC Start=2208586><P Class=ENCC>
How'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2212604><P Class=ENCC>
Sylvia, I asked you a question.<br>
<SYNC Start=2214245><P Class=ENCC>
She doesn't have to answer.<br>
<SYNC Start=2215696><P Class=ENCC>
I have to tell the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2218171><P Class=ENCC>
Julian told me.<br>
<SYNC Start=2219469><P Class=ENCC>
That night after he talked with Lyz,<br>
<SYNC Start=2222165><P Class=ENCC> he told me there were three churches.<br>
<SYNC Start=2225655><P Class=ENCC>
Julian told you.<br>
<SYNC Start=2228655><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2230613><P Class=ENCC>
So, how'd you know about the three churches?<br>
<SYNC Start=2235007><P Class=ENCC>
- Lyz told m...<br>
- No, you have to tell the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2238254><P Class=ENCC>
- Sylvia.<br>
- Julian, you have to tell them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2240880><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz had a vision.<br>
<SYNC Start=2242479><P Class=ENCC>
She saw us in a room...<br>
<SYNC Start=2244338><P Class=ENCC> w-with gray walls made of stone.<br>
<SYNC Start=2247490><P Class=ENCC>
Sh-She saw a mirror and<br> a man with a broken neck. Him.<br>
<SYNC Start=2252351><P Class=ENCC>
And... And she said that one of us lied,<br>
<SYNC Start=2255195><P Class=ENCC> and then she saw us falling through space.<br>
<SYNC Start=2257750><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, w-we have to tell them the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2261657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2264230><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa. R-R-R...<br>
She really saw that?<br>
<SYNC Start=2267530><P Class=ENCC>
I gave her the gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2269638><P Class=ENCC>
And-And you have the gift too.<br>
<SYNC Start=2273596><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2277083><P Class=ENCC>
Well, uh,<br>
<SYNC Start=2279130><P Class=ENCC> th-that means that Lyz's vision<br> must be the real thing, huh, Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=2284116><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, sweetheart,<br> you just have to tell them the truth.<br>
<SYNC Start=2289634><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2295357><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, Sylvia.<br>
<SYNC Start=2297487><P Class=ENCC>
Let's get you out of this gray room,<br>
<SYNC Start=2300139><P Class=ENCC> give you a chance to catch your breath.<br>
<SYNC Start=2303139><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2306172><P Class=ENCC>
J-Julian, tell them, or we're lost.<br>
<SYNC Start=2312868><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz saw it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2315034><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2319904><P Class=ENCC>
Lyz saw it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2322565><P Class=ENCC>
So, if you lie to us, that means...<br>
<SYNC Start=2325293><P Class=ENCC> you don't believe that Lyz has the gift.<br>
<SYNC Start=2327644><P Class=ENCC>
And you don't believe that<br>
Sylvia has the gift either.<br>
<SYNC Start=2333122><P Class=ENCC>
You know, l-I'll bet that...<br>
<SYNC Start=2335395><P Class=ENCC> that you can't let on for one<br> second with Sylvia...<br>
<SYNC Start=2339012><P Class=ENCC> that you don't have faith in her gift,<br>
<SYNC Start=2342270><P Class=ENCC> that you don't believe it.<br>
<SYNC Start=2345231><P Class=ENCC>
Because she'd be lost.<br>
<SYNC Start=2348821><P Class=ENCC>
Because in her heart and i-in her soul,<br>
<SYNC Start=2352687><P Class=ENCC> she believes in her own clairvoyance.<br>
<SYNC Start=2356748><P Class=ENCC>
And why shouldn't she?<br>
<SYNC Start=2359016><P Class=ENCC>
Because when she's in these trances,<br>
<SYNC Start=2362387><P Class=ENCC> she sees these things...<br> she actually sees them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2365421><P Class=ENCC>
And when she smells them,<br> she actually smells them.<br>
<SYNC Start=2369293><P Class=ENCC>
Isn't that right, Julian?<br>
<SYNC Start=2372293><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2384669><P Class=ENCC>
Partial epileptic seizures...<br>
<SYNC Start=2387774><P Class=ENCC> caused by a dysfunction...<br> in the anteromedial<br>
<SYNC Start=2390882><P Class=ENCC> and posterior temporal lobes of the brain...<br>
<SYNC Start=2394668><P Class=ENCC> and characterized by visual<br> and olfactory hallucinations.<br>
<SYNC Start=2399592><P Class=ENCC>
Sights...<br> and smells.<br>
<SYNC Start=2404535><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2411709><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, how long have you known?<br>
<SYNC Start=2414709><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2417399><P Class=ENCC>
Eight years.<br>
<SYNC Start=2419157><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2421410><P Class=ENCC>
They weren't that frequent at first.<br>
<SYNC Start=2424288><P Class=ENCC>
She thought it was a psychic trance.<br>
<SYNC Start=2426822><P Class=ENCC>
You thought you'd put her in the act,<br>
<SYNC Start=2429542><P Class=ENCC> puff her up until she believed...<br>
<SYNC Start=2432286><P Class=ENCC> that she could bestow this gift onto other people.<br>
<SYNC Start=2435546><P Class=ENCC>
She was convinced that it was a gift from God.<br>
<SYNC Start=2438445><P Class=ENCC>
It gave her life purpose.<br>
<SYNC Start=2440960><P Class=ENCC>
It made her happy.<br>
<SYNC Start=2443960><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2446464><P Class=ENCC>
Julian, this is Mr. Carver<br> from the D.A. 's office.<br>
<SYNC Start=2450393><P Class=ENCC>
What are we going to tell Sylvia?<br>
<SYNC Start=2454288><P Class=ENCC>
Are we gonna tell her that you told the truth...<br>
<SYNC Start=2458369><P Class=ENCC> and that you have faith in her gift?<br>
<SYNC Start=2461943><P Class=ENCC>
Or are we gonna tell her that you lied,<br>
<SYNC Start=2464720><P Class=ENCC> because you know that...<br>
<SYNC Start=2466909><P Class=ENCC> her gift is nothing but a haphazard firing of a...<br>
<SYNC Start=2471889><P Class=ENCC> defective brain synapse?<br>
<SYNC Start=2476367><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2478433><P Class=ENCC>
If I testify...<br>
<SYNC Start=2480700><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2482176><P Class=ENCC>
If I testify against Eduardo Mendez,<br>
<SYNC Start=2485341><P Class=ENCC> and I cop to this murder,<br>
<SYNC Start=2487987><P Class=ENCC> what are you gonna do for her?<br>
<SYNC Start=2490927><P Class=ENCC>
Last time I got out of jail,<br> it took me six months to find her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2494670><P Class=ENCC>
She was sleeping under an overpass...<br>
<SYNC Start=2497101><P Class=ENCC> on a pee-soaked mattress.<br>
<SYNC Start=2500167><P Class=ENCC>
She can't hold a job.<br>
<SYNC Start=2502495><P Class=ENCC>
She can't hack the drugs.<br>
<SYNC Start=2505726><P Class=ENCC>
She needs someone to take care of her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2510396><P Class=ENCC>
If you cooperate fully,<br>
<SYNC Start=2512683><P Class=ENCC> we'll see about getting her into a group home...<br>
<SYNC Start=2514662><P Class=ENCC> near where you'll be incarcerated.<br>
<SYNC Start=2518811><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2519920><P Class=ENCC>
No. But...<br>
<SYNC Start=2521130><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2522563><P Class=ENCC>
No, w-w-we'll make sure she gets in.<br>
<SYNC Start=2527158><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2531394><P Class=ENCC>
Okay.<br>
I'll tell you...<br>
<SYNC Start=2535582><P Class=ENCC>
I'll tell you everything you want to know.<br>
<SYNC Start=2538582><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2548913><P Class=ENCC>
You love her.<br>
<SYNC Start=2550670><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2551643><P Class=ENCC>
We don't do very well without each other.<br>
<SYNC Start=2554643><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2562564><P Class=ENCC>
He told us the truth. He told us<br> everything we need to know.<br>
<SYNC Start=2564809><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, thank God.<br>
<SYNC Start=2566084><P Class=ENCC>
- So we can go now.<br>
- I can't. I'm sorry.<br>
<SYNC Start=2569084><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2569562><P Class=ENCC>
But, Julian, Lyz said we're not supposed to fall.<br>
<SYNC Start=2573750><P Class=ENCC>
It's all right, baby. There'll be<br> someone there to catch you this time.<br>
<SYNC Start=2577957><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2581361><P Class=ENCC>
Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2583765><P Class=ENCC>
Julian.<br>
<SYNC Start=2585644><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2586936><P Class=ENCC>
True love. Probably<br> his only redeeming quality.<br>

</BODY>
</SAMI>
In a world where the messengers of truth... the couriers of justice, bra vely go forth... to complete their appointed routes...
Your mission... complete paper route in 30 minutes.
One lone hero stands out among the rest.
One fearless rider has the fortitude... to deliver the goods.
To stand up to the forces of darkness... the legions of doom, the armies of oppression... and the evil Ice Cream Man.
Paperboy.
Welcome to the ice age, paperboy!.
/ I scream, you scream /
We all scream for ice cream!
Oh, nuts!
I forgot the sprinkles!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Hey, Max.
Ohh!
A Tony Hawk sundae!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Oh, that Ice Cream Man sure is evil.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Huh!
Hah!
I will defeat you... with my complicated fighting move.
We shall see whose kung fu is superior. Hyah!
Yah!
Ohh.
Yah! Paperboy power!
Aah!
Ha.
Didn't hurt!
You can run, but you can't hide, paperboy!.
/ Everywhere /
/ Gonna do everything /
/ Gonna do my best to reach your sky /
/ 'Cause I don't care /
Whoo-hoo!
Huh?
Yeah!
Paper?
What took you so long?
I stopped for some ice cream.
Aah!
Get out of bed, jabrodie.
Get out of bed-Ow!
Heh.
OK, I dreamed it.
So maybe my life really isn't like that.
And maybe I'm not the coolest kid ever.
But today was the first day of junior high... and I was sure that things were gonna be different.
Ya-ha-ha!
I had a new look.
I was a baller, a shot-caller.
I was a player with phat attitude.
Or, as I like to call it...
Phat-itude.
Hi, Mom.
It's finished.
The house is perfect.
Just as
I'd always pictured it.
But let's keep that between you and me.
Meet my mom.
She's been putting the "finishing touches"... on our house for, like, six years.
You could say she's a bit obsessed.
This is my house.
My kitchen! Mine!
Morning.
This is my dad.
He works in advertising.
His boss, Mr. Foge, makes him wear goofy costumes sometimes.
Luckily, he's got us for support.
What is that?
Heh.
I'm Lieutenant Lobster.
For the Lobster Shack pitch today?
Do you really have to wear that?
Lily, come on.
Foge has got a dozen junior ad execs... lined up who'd be happy to be
Lieutenant Lobster.
Foged again.
But just for this pitch.
I better be off.
Off to junior high... my little soldier all grown up.
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.
- Don't break anything.
- OK, Mom.
Hey, Max?
You want a ride?
Um... that's OK.
I'll take the bus.
Yeah, the bus. Right.
You know that kid everyone thinks is weird... but he doesn't care what everyone thinks?
This is him.
He's my best friend.
His name's Robert, but we call him Robe.
Guess why?
Hey, you guys!
This is my other best friend.
Her name's Megan.
She never goes anywhere without her clarinet...
Aah! Oh!
Even when she takes a trip.
You OK?
Y eah, I'm tough like a tank.
Yeah, the septic tank.
Says the freak in the robe that smells like diapers.
Max, where's your bassoon?
Um... My bassoon...
I thought we were taking band together.
I've been thinking.
It's junior high.
Is band still cool?
Cool?
What are you talking about?
Since when have we been cool?
All I'm saying is, let's try to act cool.
Sweet! A can.
Mmm.
- Blech!
- Eww!
/ Today /
/ I changed /
/ But too late /
/ 'Cause every town feels the same /
/ I'm different /
/ And you're distant /
/ Add it up and it makes no difference /
For the yearbook.
How's this?
"Sheep arrive for slaughter"?
No, no, no!
Please!. Please!.
Don't make me go!
I don't want to go!
Does he know something we don't?
Here they come.
With their pimples and their braces... and their rickets and their lice.
Their snot-nosed, baggy-pantsed... high-pitched, squealing voices.
And yet, each one a rung on the ladder of my success.
A ladder that ends in a vast neon sign... that stretches across the night sky.
Principal Jindraike?
These came from your real-estate agent.
The sign, Mrs. Rangoon.
What does it say?
"Superintendent Jindraike. "
The sign on my office door.
That's what it should say.
Sounds so much better than
"Superintendent Knebworth. "
It's classier, too.
When Knebworth sees what I've done in his honor... the old dinosaur is sure to make me his successor.
But, first things first,
Mrs. Rangoon.
Set up the video broadcast machine device.
I want to address the acne-strafed masses.
Ooh-Aah!
Ow!
Curtis Junior High has a long... and fascinating history of colorful bullies.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
In 1985, Tomato-face Callahan.
He'd walk right up and shove a tomato in your face.
1991, Wedgie Jackson.
He invented the world wide wedge.
Which brings us to this year.
Troy McGinty.
Word is, he's gonna pound... on a different kid every day.
And he's devised his own special way... of letting the world know who he's coming after.
Max Keeble?
Here.
All right.
Julius Klinghoffer.
- Here.
- All right.
Lil' Romeo?
Yo, whuzzup?
I'm over here, wo dat.
OK.
Lil' Romeo's in the house.
I'm down with that.
Tina Michaels?
And now...
This is Principal Jindraike.
All students will report to the assembly hall... during third period for a special presentation.
Attendance is mandatory.
All must attend.
Not attending is prohibited.
That is all. Thank you.
Yes! The reviews are in.
Ha! Jindraike, two thumbs up.
I laughed, I cried.
The man's a genius.
- Principal Jindraike!
- What now, Rangoon?
The red light's still on.
I'm well aware of that.
Didn't even notice!
Good morning.
I'm Ms. Dingman, and welcome to Life Science.
You OK?
I can't feel my fingers.
...like this.
Pheromones.
Nature's dating service.
Odorless, colorless.
It's how many species attract mates.
A chemical process which causes... an irresistible attraction... in the opposite sex.
Allow me to demonstrate.
Would someone like to open the window for me, please?
You in the robe.
Aww.
Wow, that's cool!
You see? Irresistible.
/ Oh, baby, baby /
/ Eh, eh /
Are you OK?
Yeah! Yeah.
I'm fine.
You look kind of familiar.
I deliver your paper.
I'm Max, Jenna.
Oh, yeah.
You go to school here now?
You play the clarinet.
First chair.
I'm in band, too.
I play the bassoon.
Hmm. Well, I'll see you later.
I'll see you bassoon.
See you bassoon?
Ecch! Stupid!
Max Keeble.
Troy!
Troy McGinty, how are you?
First victim of the year there, buddy.
It's a big honor.
Know the guy you hung out with when you were little... but as you got older you went in opposite directions?
Troy McGinty wasn't always a bully.
I remember when he came to my fourth birthday.
The theme was
MacGoogles the Frog.
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
/ It's time to play a game /
/ With your favorite
Highland frog /
I don't like MacGoogles!
He's not real, Troy.
He's just a TV character.
Is there a wee laddie having his birthday today?
MacGoogles!
He's trying to eat me!
Scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat.
Troy, it's me, Mr. Keeble.
MacGoogles ate Max's daddy!
Aah!
Troy had grown a lot since then.
Whoa! What are you doing?
Where's Max?
I don't know.
Wasn't it your turn to watch him?
McGINTY:
Welcome to cooking with Troy.
First, you want to dip your little piece of chicken... in a nice, thick batter.
No. Troy, no!
- Hold it! Stop!
- OK, we're set.
Yaah!
No! Troy!
Aah!
Now you want to roll your piece of dead meat... in some bread crumbs.
Perfect.
And now that that's done... our bird should be ready to go in.
Aah!
Oh, gross! Ecch!
Hope you like lasagna.
Settle down.
Cease!
This Thursday,
Superintendent Knebworth... will be here to inspect the school.
And so I am upgrading my policy ofzero tolerance... to one of sub-zero tolerance.
Which is more than zero.
Cease!
And now, without any further ado... what's that I hear?
The pitter-patter of little feet?
Allow me to introduce to you the newest addition... to the Curtis Junior
High School Cottontails- three foreign exchange students from eastern Europe... and their names are... unimportant, because they're here... to lead us to gridiron glory.
Why, all they need is a place to play.
Students, I give you your new football stadium.
Ooh-yah!
Ha!
Eww!
You, there! Little boy!
Prankster!
What is your name?
Uh, Max Keeble.
I've got my eye on you,
Max Keeble.
You're on my list.
- It wasn't my-
- Sit!
Heh heh heh.
This is a bad junior high.
I can't believe what McGinty did to you.
Mr. Jindraike says if someone tries... to start a fight with you, just ignore them.
Ew! Robe! Ew!
Max, you can't go through the rest of the day like that.
I don't plan on it.
Where's he going?
How great.
/ Hey baby, hey baby /
/ Yeah baby, yeah baby /
/ Hey baby /
Cool.
Hey, man, you got any spare air?
/ Yeah, baby /
/ Yeah baby /
Whoo!
He calls his victims
"Investors"?
He's got all the latest technology... and he's looking to make a killing... in the stock market.
M- m-m-marching call!
/ You know the fella's good for the moola /
This guy, Dobbs, was once a stock-market whiz kid.
By age 10, he was a millionaire.
15. Meeting with Keeble.
Keeble.
By age 12, he'd lost it all.
Now he's obsessed with getting it back... one kid at a time.
Keeble!
Caught your act in the assembly.
Looks like you can use some help... with managing your portfolio.
That's my lunch money!
And you have it all in cash.
Kid, let me hold this for a while... and I'll set you up with a nice mutual fund.
What's going on here?
He's taking Max's lu-lunch money.
Is this true, Mr. Dobbs?
No. I'm just spreading some investment wisdom.
Speaking of which... how did Biomorph Systems work out for you?
Heh heh.
Best money I ever spent.
By the way, what do you think of Handspring?
Handspring?
It's moving today. I'd say buy.
- Thanks.
- No prob.
Uh...
Don't miss me. Ha!
Excuse me!
Anybody want my carrots?
What?
Keeble!
You may be under the impression... that I encourage horseplay and malarkey.
I don't encourage it.
I excourage it.
Excourage?
It means the opposite of encourage.
Look it up.
Elliot!
And so, young man, remember...
"Study" rhymes with "Buddy. "
Scram.
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?
I thought you said band wasn't cool enough for you.
Yeah, but I thought it over... and I've decided that band is pretty...
Hot.
Excuse me.
What?
What are you doing sitting in my seat?
Does it say your name on it or something?
Yes.
So, if you don't mind, shoo-shoo. Let's go.
Can you believe her?
- Hi, Jenna.
- Hey.
Welcome, everyone.
Settle, please.
I should tell you right away... you'll notice that we are a bit cramped in here... thanks to some temporary storage foisted on us... by someone who has absolutely no appreciation... of what we do in here.
Now, if you'll go to the beginning of the piece...
Can I help you football guys?
Yes, please.
Careful!
Jindraike. I'd like to-
/ Standin' here lookin' out on the world /
/ For a second nobody's lookin'back at me /
/ I never even notice where they go /
/ The sun is shining down and /
/ There's no one else around now /
/ Wish you were here to hear me say /
/ This is gonna be /
/ My greatest day /
/ How far would I go /
/ Just to hear everybody say /
/ This is gonna be /
/ My greatest day /
Hey, Tad. Did you miss me?
This is Tad.
He totally rules the animal shelter.
I helped nurse him when he was a baby chimp... and we've been buds ever since.
Hey, Max!
Hi, Marley. What's up?
Could you do me a favor and feed the goat?
Sure. What's going on?
Didn't you hear?
We're closing down.
Some creep bought up the property... and canceled our lease.
What's gonna happen to the animals?
We're doing the best we can to find homes for them... but we only got until the end of the week.
It's messed up, I know.
It's real messed up.
I couldn't believe it.
Something had to be done, but what?
I thought maybe my parents might have an idea.
They did.
We're moving?!
Yeah.
Foge wants me to head up the new division.
I can't believe this. When?
- Friday.
- This Friday?
Man, this is totally unfair!
I mean, my life is here, my friends are here.
We know that, Max.
But you'll make plenty of new friends in Chicago.
Chicago?!
This was gonna be my year.
Here.
Sweetie, we know this is hard on you.
It's hard on all of us.
Well, then I have a great, great idea.
Let's not go.
Foge is my boss.
He's counting on me.
Can't you just say no?
No. It's not that simple.
This bites.
He'll be fine.
But, Max,
Chicago's 1,000 miles away.
Better tell your parents to watch out for carjackers.
These guys'll just come up to you... at stoplights and take your car away.
I saw it on "20/20."
That's why they call it the Motor City.
Maybe you could hire a lawyer and legally emancipate yourself.
You can stay with me.
I'll ask my mom.
My dad'll give you a job here at the junkyard.
You know what?
Nice try, guys.
You know what?
Face it, I've been foged.
Ugh.
We meet again, paperboy.
OK.
Evil Ice Cream Man, me.
You're wondering why, right?
Ohh!
I once found a cockroach in my snow cone.
My mom called the health department... and he got nailed.
He's been trying to nail me ever since.
Drat! The fuzz!
This isn't over, paperboy!
Hello, officer.
Snow doodle?
Hey, look, it's dumpster boy.
It's Rinky Stinko, the garbage kid.
Ha, Rinky Stinko.
He just made that up.
Now, that's good.
Hey, Max, check it out.
I made some flyers to help save the animal shelter.
I thought you and I could put them up around school.
Why bother?
A flyer's not gonna make any difference.
He didn't mean that.
Cover me. I'm going in.
Aaah.
He moves, he fakes.
Rangoon, think fast.
Nice hands.
Now, pick up the ball... and put it in the case.
It's from Knebworth's
City Championship game.
I'm going on my walkabout.
Mrs. Rangoon, what's this?
Some of the kids are trying to save... the animal shelter down the street.
Kids? What kids?
The ones with the sense of caring and civic duty.
You there. Cease!
What is the meaning of this?
Hey, I didn't do that.
So you want to save the filthy little beasts, eh?
Perhaps you want me to give the animals my car?
Do you want me to give my car to the smelly goat?
Goats don't drive, sir.
I don't care what you want me to do.
The smelly goat will never get my car.
Ever.
The animals have nowhere to go.
Some creep's closing down the shelter.
I'm closing down the shelter, silly boy.
What?
All I need now is the right bulldozer.
I'm thinking big and yellow.
Where did you think
I was going to build...
Knebworth stadium, in your house? Ha ha.
Your house. That's rich.
There wouldn't be room.
Whoa.
/ Better watch out for the king of the hill /
/ He's really bad and totally chill /
/ Better watch out for the king of the hill /
Freak with robe?
All right, guys.
Hit the showers.
Come on, ladies.
Hello, freak.
Let me out!
Come on, let me out!
What's going on, huh?
McGinty's latest victim.
You gotta check this out.
Ha ha ha.
Let me out! Come on!
Let me out!
Come on, let me out.
- All right, OK.
- Come on, Max.
OK. It's OK.
He's a little claustrophobic, so he might...
Hurl.
What a waste of a perfectly good chili omelet.
Let me check the latest rates.
That's $3.00 for number one... and $5.00 for number two.
I have a bladder problem.
Sorry to hear it.
- Keeble.
- Get off me!
I worked really hard on that display.
Excuse me. New customers.
Can I help you, gentlemen?
- No, thanks.
- Keeble, shut up.
How much for a swirlie?
Take stall number 4.
No, no. Come on, Troy.
- No charge.
- Thanks, man.
Can we talk about this?
I'm gonna get my hair wet.
Come on, Troy!
Ow! Come on!
Water.
A recurring geographical feature which allows... a civilized society to develop.
For example, rivers, springs...
Mr. Keeble?
You're tardy, and you're dripping.
I have rules against both.
Now, class, another feature which allows... a civilized society to develop is a code of rules.
Without rules, society would completely collapse.
Do you agree with that statement, Mr. Keeble?
I guess so.
I guess you'll write me a 2,000-word essay... on the subject.
That's not fair!
Which I will look forward to seeing on my desk... drip-dry Friday!
This Friday?
This Friday!
Wait.
Friday was the day
I was moving... and this teacher was mean.
She let Dobbs steal my money.
She wanted to punish me when it wasn't my fault.
But if I wasn't gonna be here... what could she really do to me, right?
It was time to take a stand.
How come I can't do the essay right now?
Now, class...
Mmm. That's good.
A civilized society does need a set of rules.
Otherwise, people could do this.
Oops.
Did I say 2,000 words?
Make that 4,000!
Or... this.
Make that 8,000 words, and take your seat now!
8,000 words?
That's kid stuff.
How about 12,000 words?
Do I hear 12,000 words, ladies and gentlemen?
12,000 words!
Sold! For 12,000 words!
Get off my desk!
Okee-day.
Ohhh.
You're in serious trouble,
Mr. Keeble.
/ Yeah /
See ya.
Hello, sweetheart.
No consequences.
I could do anything
I wanted.
Excuse me.
Where do you think you're going?
If you're ever in the windy city... look me up.
Anything.
And now, all the people who had tried to run us down... mess us up, push us around... were in for a real surprise.
Told you it was gonna happen sooner or later.
Didn't I?
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.
/ Wait, see /
/ I do whatever moves me /
I'm closing down the shelter.
Pheromones- nature's dating service.
I keep my money in a piggy bank.
It just looks like you.
After all, I had to do something about the bullies.
All I needed was a little bit of help.
Because
I'm outta here in 2 days.
Don't you see?
This isn't just a plan.
It's-it's a planetarium.
Look, I'm gonna be the one they come after... but I'm not gonna be here... and that is the beauty of it.
I mean, you guys won't even know what I'm up to.
All you have to do is help me out.
And we'll have- what do you call it?
Plausible deniability.
Did you just make that up?
So we all down for the cause?
One question.
Can't we just have a going-away party instead?
We will, a huge blowout... when this is over.
So?
Marching call!
/ You know a fella's good for the moola /
Looks like somebody froze your assets, man.
Let's see what we can do about that.
Hey!
Step off, capitalist tool.
Man, why don't you go get a real job, fool?
I told you, their lunch money is mine, vendor.
Ha ha ha.
Yeah, that's right.
Trading hours are over.
Aah-Ohh!
Hello, Vladimir.
Aah!
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
/ It's time to play a game with your- /
Hmm.
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
/ MacGoogle- /
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
/ It's time to play a game /
/ With your favorite
Highland- /
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
/ It's time to play a game /
/ With your favorite
Highland frog /
And let me just remind... the citizens of Curtis Junior High... that we are now
T- minus... several hours... until the
Superintendent Knebworth visit.
That is all. Thank you.
I'm a walrus, hey.
The camera's still on!
OK.
I'm OK.
Sorry.
I know.
It's just that we have to be... very careful with the lab equipment.
Our budget is very tight... thanks to the new football program.
45 cents. Cool.
Let's check my grosses today.
Where's my handheld?
Hey, mister, my Fudgsicle's melting!
Oh, it's supposed to be melting.
People pay extra for that.
Now, beat it!
All of you, beat it!
The heat is on!
Fartknocker!
Evil Ice Cream Man's going down.
How great.
I sure am gonna miss you guys.
I guess you'll make new friends in Chicago.
Right, Max?
I guess so. I don't know.
I never really thought about it.
Hey, maybe you'll meet kids... exactly like us in every way.
You know, like clones.
Yeah. Maybe I will.
Well, there's still your going-away party.
There's gonna be a cake and everything.
- I baked it.
- Yeah, don't forget.
Tomorrow,
4:00, House of Robe.
I'm providing the ice cream.
What's going on?!
It's melting!
Hey, Max?
What are you doing?
Stuff.
Getting ready for the big move kind of stuff?
Mm-hmm.
I'm sorry we sprung this on you, Max... but it was sort of sprung on me the same way.
Uh-huh.
OK. Tsk.
What if I didn't take the job?
What then? A home... the food we eat, the clothes you wear- that takes a lot of money.
I just can't see why we can't stay.
Well, sometimes in life... you gotta do things that you don't want to do... because other people who have power over you... tell you to do them.
No, Dad, I mean, if you rise up... and-and show that you're not afraid... those people will no longer have control over your life.
What have you done with Max?
Who are you? Really?
Good night, kiddo.
See ya.
Unhh.
Ohh.
The window was open.
Whoa!
Robe.
The computer.
I'll get the breath spray.
Nature's dating service.
Whoa.
- What?
- Check it out.
Jindraike's using all the school's money... to build his stupid football stadium.
We can't let him get away with that.
Now his breath'll be pheromone fresh.
Don't worry about me.
I'm fine.
Here you go.
And now we add a little decoration.
Whoa!
Come on, let's get out of here.
Ow! Ow!
Robe!
Come on, man! Let's go!
Yeah, I'm trying.
Morning, Mom.
Hi, sweetie.
Whatcha doing?
You know, you just start out... by trying to pack everything really fast... and then you get caught up in all this old stuff.
Remember how the kitchen looked... when we first moved in?
Before it was perfect?
Not really. I was four.
Right. Mmm.
Sorry about the short notice, Max.
You having to leave your friends and everything.
Ah, it's OK.
At first,
I was really bummed out... but not everything's bad about moving.
That's what your father keeps saying.
I hope you're both right.
Troy McGinty?
How about that?
OK, no,
I won't do that anymore.
I promise. I promise.
Ohh. I lied. Sorry.
/ MacGoogles is me name /
/ I like a swampy bog /
No.
/ With your favorite
Highland frog /
No.
No, not you.
You're not even real!
Get away from me!
Aaah! Aaah!
Faster, janitor!
More commemorative red, white, and blue streamers.
Crazy Legs Knebworth.
What a champion he was.
Come on, you idiot.
He's coming!
Straighten up.
Straighten up.
Better. Ready? And...
Ahh!
At last! At last!
The moment we've all been waiting for.
Ah ha ha ha ha.
Crazy Legs. You look fit.
Elliot. It's been too long.
I agree completely.
Slip me that biscuit.
Ooh, that's a hot one.
Smile.
The reason Jindraike has a new football program... is to impress this guy-
Superintendent Knebworth.
You see, Jindraike wants his job so bad... he'd eat his socks.
How it saddens me... to think of your retirement,
Crazy Legs.
What an inspiration you've been to us all.
In fact, I've collected some mementos... from your glory days.
Well.
Remember this?
Eww!
It's your championship jockstrap.
We washed it. Ha ha.
Wash it again.
What's this?
Allow me to present...
Knebworth Stadium.
Knebworth Stadium.
How can you afford to do something like this?
I didn't approve any capital expenditures for Curtis.
The usual- bake sales, car washes... and cutting back on a few non-essential items.
- Fire extinguishers, milk.
- Excuse me?
Moving along- have you seen the toilets?
No complaints.
I need five laps to-
All right, that's weird.
Who turned out the lights?
Hey, check it out.
It's McGinty!
What the-
Hey, break it up.
Break it up.
McGinty.
He's... gonna eat me.
What?
MacGoogles.
"Look who's crying now. "
Would you guys get out of here?
So the second teacher says, "I agree.
"That's why they call it a lounge. " Ha.
Well, here we are... in the Curtis
Junior High library.
Hmm. Smallish.
Yes, but we're biggish on books.
Especially sports books.
Hmm.
The one we're waiting for is "Crazy Legs"-
"The Bobby Knebworth Story. "
Ohh! Ooh! Oh!
Ohh!
Didn't I order new computer workstations this year?
Jindraike?
We're having them upgraded.
Hmm. OK.
Well... if it isn't my favorite customer.
What can I get you, plump daddy?
What's this?
Who are you working for?
"If you want the ice back in your ice cream...
"meet me at the junkyard at 3:00."
Somebody's messing with me.
Hey, can I try the soup?
Everything set?
I guess so, but I still don't see... how this is gonna help save the animal shelter.
It's all part of the plan.
Max...
What?
I don't know.
I'd just rather spend our last day... hanging out than doing all this spy stuff.
- Uhh!
- Ow! What the-Big oaf.
They're coming!
Right on schedule.
- You ready?
- Check.
Lunch... is... served.
Check and mate.
Who threw that?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
/ Aim for me /
Food fight!
/ Aim for me, hit it /
/ It's a great big world /
Not on my watch!
/ Nothing /
/ Don't believe in nothing anyway /
/ Still got a lot to learn /
/ But we started out with nothing /
/ With my friends we 're going on our way /
Stop that this instant!
/ Your life will rearrange /
Oh! I saw that, young man!
Aah!
I'm taking names!
/ That's OK, we'll never come undone /
/ Aim for me /
/ They'll try to count you out /
/ But you gotta count yourself in /
If I get my shirt dirty, my mom's gonna kill me!
/ Not saying that I'm right /
/ See the trouble that we've been in /
"Jell-O Hello. "
No. "Cafeteria Hysteria. "
/ When it's said and done /
/ And you've got us on the run /
/ That's OK, we'll never come undone /
Aah!
/ Some people change /
You're all suspended!
/ You're so far from home /
/ Aim for me /
Ha ha ha ha ha!
/ Aim for me, aim for me /
/ Aim for me, aaah /
Aaah!
Aah!
What the-
Ohh!
That's it!
Robe did it! Aah!
/ Some people change, and your life will rearrange /
/ Even when you're so far from home /
/ When it's said and done /
Ohh! Aah!
Not having fun! Ow!
Aah!
And now, onto the piece de resistance.
The jewel in the crown of Curtis.
The cafeteria.
Let me tell you something about this school.
It blows!
It's mustard!
You can't ketchup, because it's mustard!
Yeah!
/ Some people change, and your life will rearrange /
/ Even when you're so far from home /
Please believe me when I tell you... this is my gift to you.
/ That's OK, we'll never come undone /
/ Aim for me /
Cease!
Sir, I assure you, this behavior... is utterly without precedent.
Plus, it never happened before.
Who?
Who started this?
If the culprit does not step forward... this instant... swift and horrible retribution... awaits each and every one of you.
Aah!
This place is nuts.
Crazy Legs!
Wait!
Uhh!
Pbbbt!
I pound on kids.
That's what I do.
That's what I do.
This can't happen to me.
You know what they're calling me out there?
The MacGoogler.
Troy, easy. Now,
I'd like to take you through... a childhood regression process.
It may bring up some unpleasant memories... but I think you'll find it helpful in the end.
All righty?
Mm-hmm.
Now, give
Mr. MacGoogles a hug.
Aah! Aah!
He's gonna eat me!
We've got some work to do.
$300 for a new handheld?
There goes my third quarter.
"Meet me 3 P.M. today at the junkyard...
"if you want to put your handheld back in your hand. "
"P.S. Bring the metal coil. "
Son, your mama found a metal coil... on the front porch.
Is it yours?
Metal coil.
I want my coil.
I want my handheld!
What did you say, punk?
I said, "I want my handheld. "
You want your handheld?
Yeah. You heard me.
I said, "I want my handheld. "
You want me to hold your hand?
No!
Need somebody to hold his hand. Little baby.
Little-
Give me the coil!
Oh, this? Huh? Huh?
Uhh!
No!
Oh!
Huh?
Huh?
Aah!
Yeehaw!
Meh-meh-meh.
Good, Troy! Now... can you help me find a link... between MacGoogles and your fears?
Was it something from your past... or somebody?
Keeble!
Keeble.
Hey, Max.
Hi, Jenna.
Do you want to hang out?
I'm meeting some friends at Buddies.
You know what?
I actually gotta kinda be somewhere.
Oh, come on.
Stay for one milk shake.
It'll be fun.
Well...
One milk shake.
You know what?
OK. All right.
One... milk shake.
/ Hit me, baby, one more time /
Ha ha ha!
So, you actually did set up... that whole monkey thing at the cafeteria?
Well, actually,
Tad is a chimpanzee.
You're so devious.
Well, it's really part of my whole new attitude- what I like to call my phat-itude.
Yo! Don't crowd the man, dude.
He has phat-itude. Git!
Yeehaw!
I wonder where Max is?
Don't worry. He'll be here.
/ School is out, let's enjoy the heat /
/ It's all you now, do it like you're playin' for keeps /
/ Destroyed right here for you to makin ' it cheap /
/ Old school, new school, come on, wiggle with me /
/ Jump and slide /
/ Now dip, that's right /
/ Now jump and slide /
/ Now dip, that's right /
/ You want it, you got it, ahh /
/ You want it, baby, you got it /
Megan, wait!
/ You want it, you got it, ahh /
Don't worry about us.
Just go back to your party.
It's not a party.
I was just-
I was just coming to see you guys.
Whatever.
I guess we're just not cool enough for you.
Don't say that.
But Megan-she likes you.
She really likes you.
Robe, wait.
You know what?
I've been waiting.
Now I'm going home.
Have a nice life in Chicago.
Well, can you tell her that I called?
And that
I'm really, really sorry.
- I'll tell her, Max.
- Thanks.
And don't forget the sorry part, please.
- I won't.
- Thank you. Bye.
Hey, champ.
You seen your mom?
Hey, honey, can you come here quick?
I got big news.
What's up?
Guess what?
We're not moving.
We're not?
Uh-uh. I finally gave Foge some of his own medicine.
You foged Foge?
Yeah. I quit.
We're gonna stay here.
I'm gonna start my own business.
Oh, sweetie!
Now you're gonna be the big cheese!
Not anymore!
Wait! We're not moving?
Uh-uh.
Oh, look at him.
He's so happy, he can't speak!
Ha ha ha!
Hey, honey, can you help me get this off?
I sure can!
I can't get it over my head with the gloves.
What was I gonna do?
I had to get out of this.
Max, this is gonna be great.
I finally get to be my own boss.
But, Dad, what about your responsibilities- the house, the food, my clothes?
What about my clothes?
Do I wear rags?
Max, I owe it all to you.
You're the one that helped me realize...
Foge was nothing but a bully.
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't have had... the courage to stand up to him.
I'm just a kid!
What do I know?
You OK?
You seem a little jumpy.
Yes! Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm cool.
So, see you tonight.
- Uh, yeah.
- Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe?
Who was I kidding?
I was Grade-A dead meat, and I knew it.
What I didn't know... is that I've left my friends in the same boat.
It's gonna be a long year for you, slim.
I'm gonna pound you every day.
And all thanks to your good friend Keeble.
Catch you around, huh?
Great.
Let's just round it off to all your money forever.
From here on in, you work for me.
Heh heh! Yeah.
In fact, the entire school was going to suffer... because of me.
Oh, stop smiling.
This is not a happy place.
Find Max Keeble.
I'd like to speak to him.
You better book a flight.
What?
Max Keeble moved to Chicago.
I just forwarded his file.
Mrs. Rangoon, a moment of your time, please.
Someone's got something important... to say to the students.
Someone's got something very important... to say to the students, and do you know... who that someone is,
Mrs. Rangoon?
It's me, Mrs. Rangoon.
Hmm. Yeah.
And wait till they hear it.
Attention, students.
Because of yesterday's crimes against the school... instigated by your former classmate Max Keeble... the following extracurricular activities... are now suspended- art, music, P.E... fun!
Suspended, discontinued, defunct!
Great. Your boyfriend
Max Keeble... just got us hosed.
He's just my paperboy.
I never really liked him.
Keeble!
OK. Today, class, we're going to review... some of the elements of grammar.
McGinty says he's gonna pound me... every day for the rest of my life.
Dobbs says I have to give him all of my money... forever.
Some plausible deniability.
Hi. Do you mind if I hang here for a while... because there's some people after me.
I did some stuff.
Yeah. You probably...
Yeah. I'm really sorry about the cafeteria.
But Jindraike has no right to do what he's doing... and now my friends are gonna get whaled on because of me... and I can't do anything about it.
Any kid can make a mess.
Takes a man to clean it up.
It took a man with a plunger... to make me realize that I had to do something.
I thought I'd stood up to the bullies... but all I'd really done was hit and run.
That's not courage.
That's ex-courage.
As you know, verbs are words that describe actions... so who can name a few?
Betray, deceive, lie.
How about burn... screw over, stab in the back?
Heh! Uh-huh.
Attention, students, this is Max Keeble speaking.
First I'd like to say to my friends Megan and Robe... that I know that I acted like a jerk... and I'm sorry for ever getting you involved in this.
I screwed up, but you guys are my best friends... and that's forever.
I don't know what else to say, but I'm sorry.
It probably doesn't matter to you anymore... but I'm not moving.
Keeble!
And McGinty and Dobbs... it's me you want, so leave my friends alone.
I may have run before, but I am all through running now.
You want me, I'll be in the parking lot, 3:00.
Cut!
End of broadcast!
That is all. Thank you.
Ah!
Hello, Max. Good to see you.
Glad you could make it.
Please, have a seat.
Anything I can get for you?
Sparkling water? Soda?
No? OK.
You've acted like a criminal... so I'm going to treat you like a criminal.
I'm not a criminal.
People who do crimes are criminals, like you.
You should be careful before slandering... your principal's spotless reputation... with wild and groundless claims.
They're not groundless, they're ground-full.
- Ground-full?
- Look it up!
I saw it on the screen.
You have been stealing from all the school budgets... to fund your stupid football stuff.
Saw it on the screen, did you?
Yeah, and it's true.
You're a smart little boy... but so am I!
So I fiddled with the budget.
Fiddlesticks.
It's my budget.
So we have fewer textbooks.
Big deal.
Textbooks are for nerds.
Fewer band instruments- who cares?
Band is for losers.
- Come on!
- Oh!
So the janitor has to work overtime for no pay.
He should pay me for the privilege!
Now, let me describe your next 24 hours.
I'm going to mete out a punishment to you... that is so severe, future generations... will refer to it as "The Keeble. "
They will beg on bended knee-
"Oh, please, sir.
Not the Keeble, sir.
"I swear I'll never misbehave again...
"if you'll just spare me... the Keeble. "
And spare them I shall, Max... for I am a merciful man.
Your transgressions are so immense... that I would be delinquent-
My bulldozer!
Oh, goody.
Oh, that's right!
You don't know!
You thought you saved the animal shelter.
It would appear-not!
Now stay there!
Don't go away.
Uhh! Hmm.
Uhh!
What do you think
Jindraike'll do to him?
What do you think
McGinty and Dobbs'll do to him?
/ We got evil trouble /
Maybe they'll just forget the whole thing.
/ Evil trouble /
/ We got evil trouble /
Or maybe they'll rip his head off.
We've got to do something.
Come on.
/ We got evil trouble /
/ We got evil trouble /
Good afternoon, Mr. Dobbs.
Always a pleasure, McGinty.
This is gonna be epic.
"Keeble canceled. "
Here's Jinny.
Keeble?
Keeble!
Sacrilege!
Open this door immediately!
Caged like an animal.
Ironic.
Aah!
Ow!
So, is my watch running fast... or is our Keeble friend running scared?
Somebody looking for me?
Keeble, welcome to our parking lot of pain.
Ha ha ha!
You know how doctors say,
"This won't hurt a bit"?
Well, I'm not a doctor, and neither is McGinty here.
He's right.
I'm not a doctor.
Yeah!
Oh, you know, that's too bad... because you're gonna need one.
Uhh!
Hold him!
Let him go!
Megan, I'm handling this!
So am I.
Ha ha ha!
What are you gonna do about it, huh?
This.
McGINTY: Oh.
OK.
Ha ha ha ha!
I'm so scared.
You should be.
We're taking back our school.
Yeah. No more being pushed around.
No more being stepped on.
No more Mr. Not-nice Guy.
Your reign of terror over the student body... has come to an abrupt halt.
What?
Yes, please.
From now on, you have to pay us... to use the restroom.
We're pulling your plug!
Throw them in the dumpster!
- Swirlie!
- Yeah!
Get them!
Aha! Aha! Ah!
It was all his idea!
It was his idea!
It was all McGinty!
Put me down!
Wait! Wait!
What are we doing?!
Getting revenge on the bullies.
But that makes us the same as them.
Don't you see?
I mean, I went about all this the wrong way.
We are no better than the bullies... if we do exactly what the bullies do.
I mean, we need to stand together... and make our school a better place for everyone!
For you and you and you and even you, worried kid.
- Man's got a point.
- Yeah!
What should we do with them?
Let them go.
No!
Ha ha ha!
Wow! How cool are you?
You know. Just-
A bunch of us are having a party this weekend.
Ninth graders only.
Except for you, Max.
I'm sorry. I can't come.
I'm meeting somebody.
Shoo shoo!
Whatever.
Nice move, Max.
You know what?
I think not moving... was the best move of all.
It's Jindraike!
He's heading for the animal shelter!
That's it! Run!
Scatter like the children you are!
Knock, knock. Anybody home?
Whoa!
Huh?
Giddyap!
All right! Who's first?!
I know!
How about the smelly goat?!
Baa!
Not today, Jindraike.
That's far enough.
On second thought, why don't we start with the boy... who tried to save the smelly goat?
I do not fear your dark powers, bald one.
Your kung fu's no good here, Max.
Oh, what is that-
Eek! Eek! Pbbbt! Pbbbt!
Traitor!
Uhh! Hah!
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Ooh!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Cease!
He did it!
All right, Max!
Yep! I did it!
The animal shelter was safe... the bullies were cooked... and Jindraike got fired for fiddling with the budget.
As for me and my friends, we were just happy... that the first week of school was over.
Now we could chill for the rest of the year.
I'll get you, paperboy!
Oh, man!

{1115}{1178}a destiny to fulfill.
{1179}{1235}As close|as your imagination...
{1236}{1278}exists a magical place...
{1279}{1343}where wondrous creatures|with incredible powers...
{1343}{1387}help make dreams come true.
{1415}{1483}It's the world of Pokemon.
{2261}{2353}People can capture Pokemon|to be more than just pets.
{2354}{2393}Human trainers|and their Pokemon...
{2394}{2464}compete against others|in amazing contests...
{2465}{2509}of skill and strategy.
{2510}{2613}The best trainers one day|become Pokemon masters.
{2614}{2681}That's a dream that|burns brightly for many...
{2682}{2753}but none more so|than Ash Ketchum.
{2800}{2865}The pride of Pallet Town|began his Pokemon journey...
{2866}{2907}on his tenth birthday.
{2908}{2994}That's the day he qualified|to become a Pokemon trainer.
{3008}{3084}Professor Oak gave Ash|his very first Pokeball.
{3085}{3136}Inside was|an electric Pokemon...
{3137}{3225}with whom Ash would spark|a lifelong friendship--Pikachu.
{3226}{3255}Pikachu!
{3256}{3301}Together, Ash and Pikachu|are determined...
{3302}{3340}to fulfill his dream...
{3341}{3399}of becoming the world's|greatest Pokemon master.

{5567}{5611}Don't tell me|you haven't heard about it.
{5612}{5637}No, I haven't.
{5638}{5673}What's the Voice|of the Forest?
{5674}{5706}Well, it's only a legend...
{5707}{5764}but everyone around here|believes it.
{5765}{5815}They say there's a sound|you can hear...
{5816}{5857}when the spirit|that protects the forest...
{5858}{5884}is time-traveling.
{5885}{5920}Time-traveling?
{5921}{5964}That's one of|its special powers.
{5965}{6043}It can go back and forth|between the past and the future.
{6044}{6077}Wow.
{6078}{6123}So if you hear|a weird sound...
{6124}{6174}stop and stay|completely still.
{6175}{6208}If the spirit|catches you...
{6209}{6257}it could carry you off|to a different time.
{6258}{6300}Don't worry.|I'll be careful.

{9821}{9858}Celebi?
{9886}{9940}Why should I hand it over?|What do you want with it?
{9941}{9984}I'm a Pokemon hunter, kid.
{9985}{10040}I make good money|off of rare Pokemon.
{10041}{10088}First I catch 'em,|then I auction 'em off...
{10089}{10118}to the highest bidders.
{10119}{10176}Well, you're not gonna get|your hands on this Pokemon!

{12291}{12355}I'll tell you why I'm here.
{12385}{12426}I'm here|because I heard a story...
{12427}{12465}that you almost|caught a Celebi...
{12466}{12538}somewhere in this forest|about 40 years ago--true?
{12539}{12590}I'm still a Pokemon hunter!
{12591}{12637}I'm not gonna tell you anything!
{12638}{12704}Heh heh.|We'll see about that.
{12929}{12955}OK.
{12956}{12993}Sneasel! Sneasel!
{12994}{13026}Sneasel!
{13230}{13274}What's that thing?
{13275}{13303}A Dark Ball.
{13304}{13330}What's it do?
{13331}{13384}Allow me to demonstrate.
{13532}{13590}The Pokemon I catch|with the Dark Ball...
{13591}{13628}become evil Pokemon...
{13629}{13718}and their power instantly|increases to the highest level.
{13719}{13777}Come on out, Tyranitar!
{14016}{14055}Hyper Beam Attack!
{14506}{14533}No, please!
{14534}{14579}It's gonna destroy everything!
{14580}{14606}Uhh!
{14607}{14678}Aah! Aah! All right!|All right!
{14679}{14728}I'll show you!|I'll show you the spot...
{14729}{14771}where I found that Celebi!
{14772}{14811}Heh heh heh heh heh.
{14812}{14869}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{14870}{14913}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{14914}{14986}I thought|you'd see it my way.
{15781}{15823}Today we find our friends...
{15824}{15868}waiting for a ferry|that will carry them...
{15869}{15910}to yet another Pokemon gym...
{15911}{15972}as they continue|their Johto League journey.
{15973}{16012}Brock and Misty are ready.
{16013}{16068}The passengers|are hurrying aboard...
{16069}{16135}and it's almost time|for the boat to leave.
{16135}{16178}But where are|Ash and Pikachu?
{16196}{16270}Well, if they don't come soon|they're gonna miss the boat.
{16271}{16303}T ogepi!
{16303}{16336}Crobat, go!
{16405}{16431}Crobat!
{16459}{16491}Cro!
{16491}{16522}My name's Dundee...
{16523}{16587}and I'm the best Pokemon|trainer in the whole town.
{16587}{16615}Well, my name's Ash...
{16616}{16680}and I'm a pretty good|Pokemon trainer, too.
{16681}{16744}Why don't you pick a Pokemon,|and we can have a battle.
{16745}{16768}Pika!
{16769}{16809}Croconaw, go!
{16841}{16875}Croconaw!
{16921}{16951}A Croconaw, huh?
{16951}{17001}Never battled|one of those before.
{17002}{17067}OK, Pikachu, let's go!
{17067}{17095}Pika!
{17096}{17194}Pokemon, Pokemon, Pokemon,|Pokemon, Pokemon
{17195}{17231}Let's do it
{18137}{18179}Thunder Shock Attack!
{20519}{20558}So, sounds like|you're all...
{20559}{20610}pretty interested|in Pokemon, huh?
{20611}{20635}Yeah.
{20636}{20681}I come from a place|just up the river...
{20682}{20717}and a lot|of real unusual ones...
{20718}{20753}Iive in the forest nearby.
{20754}{20793}Hey, if you could show us|where it is...
{20794}{20832}maybe we could stop|and check it out.
{20833}{20875}No problem.|We can get off...
{20876}{20908}at the next stop,|and I'll take you...
{20909}{20943}the rest of the way|in my boat.
{20944}{20982}Great. Thanks.
{20983}{21006}Pika!
{21007}{21042}ALL: Huh?
{21043}{21075}ASH: Ohh.
{21101}{21162}Hey, was that a Pokemon?
{21163}{21196}Looked like one to me.
{21197}{21276}You'll see the woods|around here are full of them.
{21336}{21401}There's one more possibility.
{21402}{21442}Did it look|anything like this?
{21443}{21491}Yeah, that's it, Professor.
{21507}{21545}It was a Suicune.
{21546}{21574}A Suicune?
{21575}{21617}What kind of Pokemon|is that, Professor?
{21618}{21664}It's one of the legendary|Pokemon, Brock...
{21665}{21701}and not very much|is known about it.
{21702}{21742}And according|to folk tales...
{21743}{21794}Suicune personifies|the north wind...
{21795}{21840}and it's believed|to have the power...
{21841}{21883}to purify tainted waters.
{21884}{21938}Wow, I hope I get|to see Suicune again.
{21939}{21996}Its sounds like|it's a pretty cool one.
{21997}{22039}Believe you me, kids...
{22040}{22096}those tales|are definitely true.
{22097}{22160}Really? How do you know that|for sure, Professor?
{22161}{22213}Have you ever seen|a Suicune before?
{22214}{22280}Yes, I sure have,|but only one time.
{22281}{22311}Wow! Where?
{22312}{22363}Hey, Ash, come on!
{22364}{22395}We've gotta go!
{22395}{22425}OK!
{22426}{22468}Uh, bye, Professor.
{22737}{22819}I wonder if I should've told him|before he hung up.
{22820}{22855}Hmm.
{22937}{22974}The quicker we get|into that forest...
{22975}{23025}the quicker we can look|for those Pokemon.
{23026}{23072}Maybe even that Suicune.
{23160}{23206}Those twerps won't get away now.
{23207}{23238}They're right beneath us.
{23239}{23285}Of course, they're|beneath us. They're twerps.
{23286}{23354}Now all we do is|swoop in and swipe Pikachu.
{23355}{23403}Uh-oh. Something's wrong|with my leg.
{23404}{23445}All this pedaling|is giving me a cramp.
{23446}{23470}Oh! Ow!
{23471}{23533}Aah! You can't cramp!|We'll crash!
{23967}{23993}All right.
{23994}{24042}What do we do now?
{24043}{24091}Don't worry, Misty.|You'll see.
{24125}{24148}-Whoa.|-Pi?
{24149}{24179}Toge?
{24289}{24343}Toge! Toge!|Toge! Toge!
{24547}{24571}Ha ha ha!
{24571}{24605}Toge-togepi!
{24710}{24746}Well, we're here.
{24747}{24801}Here? Where?
{24802}{24837}Look closer.
{24872}{24904}Tree houses?
{24905}{24938}Togepi!
{24939}{25014}That's right, Brock.|Welcome to Arborville.
{25347}{25370}Pika?
{25371}{25397}-Whoa.|-Prrri!
{25467}{25499}Stop right there!
{25500}{25534}Huh?
{25562}{25610}I suppose you kids|are heading into the forest...
{25611}{25643}to look for Pokemon.
{25644}{25680}Yes, ma'am.
{25681}{25730}Then you're gonna love|what you see in there.
{25731}{25787}I love what I see here!|My name's Brock...
{25788}{25831}and I'm studying to|become a Pokemon breeder...
{25832}{25881}but my specialty|is human relations.
{25882}{25904}Oh?
{25905}{25939}Please tell me your name!
{25940}{26003}My name's Diana,|and that's my grandma.
{26004}{26042}She's been guarding|the entrance to the forest...
{26043}{26073}since she was my age.
{26074}{26121}Listen for The Voice|of the Forest...
{26122}{26179}and if you hear it,|stop and be still...
{26180}{26227}or you will not get away.
{26228}{26263}The Voice of the Forest?
{26264}{26303}It's an old village legend.
{26304}{26353}Yes, it's a legend,|and a true one.
{26354}{26409}If you hear The Voice,|stop where you are.
{26410}{26440}Uh, we gotta hurry...
{26441}{26492}but thanks a lot for|the warning, ma'am.
{26493}{26519}Pika!
{26520}{26587}Diana, why don't you|come, too, and protect us?
{26588}{26640}Then she'd need|protection from you.
{26853}{26906}I wonder what|Diana's grandmother meant...
{26907}{26959}by 'The Voice|of the Forest. "
{26960}{27015}Maybe the sound of the wind|or the trees...
{27016}{27085}the water, or maybe|the voices of the Pokemon.
{27156}{27179}Pi?
{27180}{27247}Ohh. I wonder what that is.
{27248}{27282}Maybe it's The Voice|of the Forest.
{27283}{27311}-Come on!|-Pika!
{27312}{27337}Ash, no!
{27338}{27387}Hey, shouldn't we stand still?
{27388}{27435}Uh...wait up!
{27906}{27949}Bi.
{27950}{27974}Bi.
{28001}{28028}Bi.
{28097}{28139}Hey, it's a kid.
{28151}{28176}Is he OK?
{28177}{28202}He's still breathing.
{28203}{28234}Yeah.
{28235}{28269}Let's take him|back to Diana's house.
{28270}{28294}Good idea.
{28295}{28323}Yeah.
{28324}{28359}Bi...
{28360}{28426}I wonder what that light was.
{28459}{28528}Hey! Diana!
{28529}{28611}Diana! We need help!
{28611}{28668}Oh, dear. What's happened?
{28699}{28750}Hey, Ash, he's waking up.
{28811}{28862}Take it easy.|You're gonna be OK.
{28863}{28892}Pika.
{28893}{28923}Uhh.
{28951}{28976}Uhh!
{28977}{29032}What'd you do with that Celebi?
{29055}{29096}Hey, I'm trying to help you!
{29097}{29139}That's enough, you two.|Knock it off.
{29140}{29166}Settle down!
{29167}{29201}Who are you anyway?
{29202}{29226}Huh?
{29227}{29275}Where am l?
{29275}{29314}Howd I get here?
{29315}{29367}I carried you here|on my back, that's how!
{29368}{29398}What's going on?
{29399}{29430}MlSTY:|We found him unconscious...
{29431}{29478}when we were out|in the forest.
{29479}{29503}Oh!
{29503}{29552}Oh-oh-oh!
{29553}{29611}I can't believe it.|It's really you.
{29612}{29635}Huh?
{29636}{29670}You've come back.
{29671}{29729}Oh, thank goodness!
{29730}{29753}Uh, Grandma...
{29754}{29804}where did he|come back from?
{29805}{29850}Diana, I've told you|the story...
{29851}{29900}about what happened|when I was a young girl.
{29901}{29956}A little boy disappeared|from the forest.
{29957}{30011}But this boy can't be him.
{30011}{30051}Well, maybe it can't be...
{30052}{30092}-but it is.|-Huh?
{30191}{30233}Ah! You're the girl...
{30234}{30284}who gave me|the loaf of bread.
{30285}{30321}Yes.
{30367}{30397}Here.
{30398}{30477}I've kept this all these years|in case you ever came back.
{30607}{30677}This is my sketchbook.|How--
{30678}{30705}You've been away...
{30706}{30760}on a 40-year-long journey,|young man.
{30761}{30790}40 years?
{30791}{30818}What do you mean?
{30819}{30857}The legend says|The Voice of the Forest...
{30858}{30924}can catch a person and take them|on a trip through time.
{30925}{30973}-Huh?|-Through time?
{31133}{31156}Stantler?|Stan--
{31157}{31192}Stantler!
{31393}{31416}Uhh!
{31417}{31450}Where's Celebi?
{31451}{31486}What happened to Celebi?
{31487}{31511}Celebi?
{31512}{31567}Was there a Pokemon|with me in the forest?
{31567}{31609}We didn't see any.
{31610}{31668}The Pokemon you met|that day was a Celebi?
{31669}{31702}Yes.
{31703}{31764}We know Celebi|as The Voice of the Forest...
{31765}{31815}the spirit that protects it.
{31816}{31866}They say that Celebi|can travel through time.
{31867}{31903}You two must've been|in danger...
{31904}{31942}and Celebi just picked|the fastest way...
{31943}{31969}to get you out of it.
{31970}{32006}It's must've|escaped to the future...
{32007}{32039}and taken you along with it.
{32039}{32070}I'm afraid you're right.
{32071}{32138}Celebi lives|deep in the forest...
{32139}{32206}in a place we call|"The Lake of Life."
{32207}{32275}That's probably where|it's gone back to now.
{32275}{32342}I've got a feeling Celebi|still may be hurt.
{32355}{32427}I have to go back into|that forest and find Celebi.
{32427}{32452}I'll go, too!
{32453}{32478}Me, too!
{32479}{32503}So will l!
{32504}{32530}Togepi!
{32531}{32558}My name's Brock...
{32559}{32591}and I'm a Pokemon breeder.
{32591}{32615}I'm Sam.
{32616}{32639}And I'm Misty.
{32640}{32695}My specialty is water Pokemon.
{32695}{32726}My name's Ash Ketchum...
{32727}{32776}and I'm trying|to be a Pokemon master.
{32777}{32802}Pika!
{32803}{32851}Oh, yeah,|and this is Pikachu.
{32851}{32880}Pikachu!
{32881}{32931}Hi, Pikachu. I'm Sam.
{32954}{33019}Our glider|didn't glide very well.
{33019}{33087}Next time|we spring for a motor.
{33088}{33135}I wonder where|those twerps are.
{33136}{33192}We may never know.|Huh?
{33193}{33217}-Huh?|-Huh?
{33218}{33278}Well, well.
{33279}{33320}I can't believe my eyes.
{33321}{33355}Looks like it's a good thing...
{33356}{33398}we crashed after|all, eh, Meowth?
{33399}{33449}Come on, let's get down|and tail them twerps!
{33492}{33517}Pika!
{33518}{33554}Pikachu!
{33598}{33640}Pi--pi--pi--pi--
{33641}{33670}Pi--Pika!
{33671}{33700}Guys, look up there!
{33857}{33913}The Pokemon|are all together.
{33973}{34021}I'm coming, too!
{34133}{34179}Ash climbs just like a Mankey.
{34180}{34207}Togepi!
{34237}{34260}Pi!
{34303}{34332}-Aah!|-Pika!
{34401}{34466}Sam, maybe you should wait|down with Brock and Misty.
{34467}{34516}No. I have to find Celebi.
{34517}{34559}I couldn't|protect it before...
{34559}{34595}so I've gotta help it now.
{34645}{34747}I know how you feel, Sam,|but take it easy.
{34764}{34844}Pi! Pi! Pi! Pi!
{35024}{35063}Uh. Ah!
{35064}{35169}Bi...bi.
{35170}{35206}Hey.
{35207}{35237}Is this the Celebi?
{35238}{35261}Mm-hmm.
{35262}{35293}Come on, Celebi.
{35294}{35339}Bi. Bi!
{35375}{35435}Whoa! Unh!
{35435}{35491}Hey! What'd you do that for?
{35546}{35609}I think Ash just evolved|into a primate.
{35610}{35651}We're only trying to help you.
{35652}{35689}Bi!
{35721}{35746}Whoa!
{35747}{35795}What's going on?
{35795}{35851}Pika--
{35851}{35896}No, Pikachu, don't!
{35925}{35959}Don't be mad at it.
{35959}{35997}It's just afraid...
{35998}{36031}and it's hurt, too.
{36031}{36067}A hunter attacked it.
{36067}{36101}That's why it's scared.
{36102}{36151}OK. Here goes.
{36247}{36289}Celebi, we're your friends.
{36290}{36333}We don't want to hurt you.
{36334}{36369}We just want to help you.
{36370}{36396}Bi!
{36423}{36462}I tried to help you before.
{36463}{36508}Don't you remember, Celebi?
{36509}{36556}I got you away|from the Pokemon hunter.
{36557}{36591}It's OK.
{36591}{36637}Bi?
{36674}{36728}You just take it easy.
{36729}{36767}And we will, too.
{36768}{36802}There...
{36838}{36863}Bi.
{36895}{36921}Bi?
{36947}{36993}Uh...
{36994}{37035}Ha ha!
{37273}{37331}You're safe with me, Celebi.
{37331}{37355}Bi.
{37387}{37425}Bi.
{37466}{37502}Pik--Pik--Pik...
{37558}{37591}Brock, it seems really weak.
{37592}{37636}Yeah, we better hurry.
{37637}{37675}We'll take it|to a Pokemon center.
{37676}{37699}Pika-pi!
{37700}{37736}Who are they?
{37737}{37799}Prepare for trouble.|Your future looks grim.
{37800}{37855}And we're not afraid|to go out on a limb.
{37856}{37915}To protect the world|from devastation.
{37916}{37975}To unite all peoples|within our nation.
{37976}{38039}To denounce the evils|of truth and love.
{38040}{38095}To extend our reach|to the stars above.
{38096}{38127}Jessie.
{38127}{38154}James.
{38155}{38187}Team Rocket...
{38187}{38228}blast off|at the speed of light.
{38261}{38319}Surrender now|or prepare to fight.
{38319}{38360}Meowth--that's right.
{38361}{38411}Wobbuffet!|Wobbuffet!
{38412}{38451}Aah!
{38484}{38507}Hmm.
{38508}{38543}Do you think|they're gonna be OK?
{38544}{38579}Unfortunately, yes.
{38580}{38610}Hmm.
{38611}{38660}You twerps got lucky this time.
{38661}{38707}They're always lucky.
{38707}{38751}Wobbuffet!
{38777}{38820}Don't press your luck, blubbo.
{38843}{38879}Hang in there, Celebi.
{38903}{38958}Look, that's|the village up there!
{39001}{39047}Aah!
{39048}{39127}I've been looking|for that little Celebi.
{39127}{39157}Who are you?
{39158}{39196}A Pokemon lover.
{39197}{39225}Leave us alone!
{39262}{39295}What does he want?
{39296}{39363}He must be trying to steal|our Pikachu away.
{39364}{39403}Well, we won't let him!
{39451}{39497}Weezing. Weezing.
{39592}{39623}Huhh!
{39722}{39750}What's that?
{39751}{39779}A Tyranitar...
{39780}{39815}but there's something|funny about it.
{39816}{39846}Hyper-beam!
{40055}{40086}Here it comes!

{54464}{54487}Pikachu!
{54488}{54522}Thanks for taking us here,|Celebi.
{54523}{54559}Yeah.
{54560}{54595}These are good ones.

{54742}{54790}Bi-bi-bi-bi!
{55012}{55071}Don't you worry.|We'll find Celebi.
{55119}{55166}I'd rather find some lunch.
{55167}{55194}So would l.
{55195}{55226}Or a bathroom.
{55227}{55250}-Huh?|-Huh?
{55299}{55329}Lucky us!
{55330}{55358}It's a peach tree!

{55647}{55699}Ah! Ah!
{55700}{55732}-Hey!|-Hey!
{55863}{55907}Nice catch.
{55907}{55941}It was peachy.
{55975}{56000}Huh?
{56049}{56094}There goes our driver!
{56095}{56147}Wait! Come back!|Don't leave us!
{56148}{56196}We'll even chip in for gas!
{56578}{56625}Sammy, it's the middle|of the night.
{56626}{56671}I know, but I can't sleep.
{56801}{56832}Hey, that's great.
{56833}{56876}Thanks. When I meet|a new Pokemon...
{56877}{56916}I sketch him in this book.
{56917}{56948}Can I take a look?
{56949}{56977}Mm-hmm.
{57013}{57041}Hmm.
{57089}{57168}Oh, these are amazing!
{57169}{57222}This is like|a handmade Pokedex.
{57223}{57288}That's this machine that|has pictures of Pokemon.
{57289}{57351}I guess you know a lot|about the future, huh, Ash?
{57352}{57407}At least more than I do.
{57407}{57461}Yeah, I guess so...
{57462}{57534}but I'm sure glad I'm not stuck|in it like you are.
{57574}{57621}Oh, hey, I'm sorry.
{57838}{57922}Hey, I didn't mean|to make you feel bad, Sam.
{57923}{57956}Honest, I didn't.
{57957}{57988}That's OK.
{57989}{58035}I think I'll like|living in the future...
{58035}{58079}but it'll take|some getting used to.
{58079}{58111}Yeah. Probably.
{58112}{58185}But then I think about my mother|worrying about me...
{58186}{58234}and wondering where I am.
{58235}{58283}And I wonder|if she still wonders.
{58301}{58393}Oh. Yeah, me, too.
{58394}{58446}Hey, what about your mom, Ash?
{58447}{58489}I bet she worries about you...
{58490}{58538}when you're out on|your Pokemon journey.
{58539}{58603}Yeah, she worries, I guess.
{58633}{58689}Maybe that's just what moms do.
{58690}{58713}Mm.
{58757}{58798}Thinking about my mom...
{58799}{58842}gets me thinking|about her cooking.
{58843}{58876}Hey, I have something.
{58877}{58903}Huh?
{59042}{59095}Diana's grandmother made this...
{59096}{59149}but that was about|40 years ago.
{59150}{59195}Still looks|pretty fresh, though.
{59195}{59243}-Mm.|-Mm.
{59243}{59275}It's great!
{59275}{59323}Tastes like it was|made yesterday.
{59359}{59386}Pika?
{59387}{59435}Pika?
{59435}{59483}Bi? Bi?
{59588}{59628}What's the matter, Pikachu?
{59629}{59660}Hey, Ash, look.
{59661}{59685}Huh?
{59795}{59819}Oh.

{60179}{60225}Wow.
{60314}{60373}Look at all the Butterfree.
{60405}{60447}I hope you'll be free, Sam.
{60448}{60471}Huh?
{60472}{60516}I mean, to go back in time.
{60517}{60540}Oh.
{60746}{60806}-Oh.|-Oh.

{62106}{62131}Bi! Bi!

{62188}{62242}Bi-i!
{62278}{62326}Bi! Bi!
{62359}{62389}Bi!
{62390}{62435}Thought you'd gotten rid of us...
{62436}{62474}didn't you, twerps?
{62475}{62528}But Team Rocket doesn't|give up so easily!
{62529}{62565}Not you again.
{62611}{62659}All right...
{62660}{62733}we ain't leaving|without that Celebi.
{62734}{62839}Pikachu!
{62875}{62917}Nice try!
{62918}{62976}Togepi!
{63085}{63124}Oh!
{63224}{63251}Bi!
{63252}{63277}Celebi!
{63316}{63375}This ought to calm you down.

{64829}{64857}Aah!
{64858}{64942}I think that Dark Ball|belongs to me.
{64943}{64985}Aah--aah!
{65227}{65250}Ash!
{65251}{65275}-Pika-pi!|-Toge!
{65276}{65319}Huh?
{65546}{65593}Don't waste your time.
{65594}{65666}It's too late to save|your friend Celebi.
{65741}{65766}Stantler.
{65804}{65885}Because the sweet little|Pokemon you used to know...
{65886}{65934}doesn't exist anymore.
{65935}{65972}Here, see for yourself!
{66114}{66186}Celebi, get rid of them all!
{66422}{66458}Aah!
{66505}{66542}Pika!
{66912}{66942}I don't understand.
{66943}{67021}If Celebi's their friend,|I'd hate to see their enemies.
{67022}{67063}Excellent.
{67064}{67123}You're very strong, Celebi.
{67124}{67212}Now show me even|more of your power!
{67413}{67454}[Laughs]
{67455}{67539}With a Pokemon like you,|no one will ever stop me!
{67540}{67593}Celebi.
{67722}{67801}Celebi's building a nasty nest.
{67802}{67841}Oh, no!
{68102}{68125}Oh.
{68126}{68174}Oh, what is that?
{68175}{68199}I don't know.
{68200}{68229}Grandma.
{68230}{68269}We'd better go find out.
{68270}{68298}Right.
{68356}{68386}Mm...uhh.
{68387}{68413}Uhh!
{68414}{68459}Celebi! Uhh!
{68460}{68492}I've gotta--
{68493}{68523}Uhh!
{68524}{68555}Take it easy, Ash.
{68556}{68608}You might be hurt.
{68686}{68717}Hey!
{68718}{68785}Hi, guys! Just stay|right where you are.
{68786}{68837}We're coming down to get you!
{68838}{68883}Diana!
{68883}{68939}I can't believe|they found us!
{69681}{69722}Uhh, this is awful.
{69723}{69771}Forcing the Spirit|of the Forest...
{69771}{69814}to destroy the forest.
{69815}{69872}This is just despicable.
{69931}{69988}Do you think Jessie's|going to be all right?
{69989}{70067}Yeah, but I ain't so sure|about Celebi. Heh.
{70401}{70466}Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{70467}{70524}Uh, excuse me,|Mr. Masked Person...
{70525}{70563}but could you let me|out of here?
{70564}{70666}Not yet. I need a witness who|can report back to Giovanni.
{70667}{70716}I want the head|of Team Rocket to know...
{70717}{70771}just how powerful Celebi is...
{70772}{70827}and how powerful I am, too.
{70828}{70910}Celebi, the time has come!
{72360}{72398}I'm very impressed.
{72399}{72461}You and Celebi|are extremely powerful!
{72462}{72498}Now just get me down|from here...
{72499}{72546}and I'll recommend you|for a big promotion...
{72547}{72598}when you give Celebi|to the boss.
{72599}{72632}Ha ha ha ha ha!
{72633}{72724}I control the most powerful|Pokemon in the world!
{72725}{72780}Why would I want to give|something that valuable...
{72781}{72809}to the boss?
{72810}{72840}What do you mean?
{72841}{72902}Now the boss|has to be afraid of me...
{72903}{72978}because Celebi gives me|the power to destroy him!
{72979}{73044}With Celebi,|I can rule Team Rocket...
{73045}{73104}and the whole world,|if I want to!
{73105}{73209}Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha!
{73210}{73246}What is that?
{73247}{73304}The evil Celebi|must've created it.
{73305}{73336}Pika?

{85602}{85627}Bi?
{85628}{85661}Celebi!
{85662}{85687}Pika!
{85688}{85720}We did it!
{85721}{85788}Oh, no! Aah!
{85873}{85920}Aah! Aah!

{87223}{87267}Yeah, and so is Sam.
{87268}{87310}They've got Celebi, too.
{87311}{87334}Huh?
{87446}{87498}What's wrong?
{87499}{87562}I don't know.|Something bad.
{87736}{87760}The water.
{87761}{87793}Get it into the water!
{87929}{87975}ASH: It's not working.
{87975}{88011}But why not?
{88011}{88055}The forest is hurt.
{88056}{88097}The water's tainted.
{88098}{88148}The lake is dying.
{88149}{88197}But then-wait a second.
{88233}{88308}Suicune has the power to make|the water clean again.
{88309}{88363}Suicune,|if you clean the water...
{88364}{88394}we can save Celebi.
{89249}{89291}The legend's true.
{89292}{89356}The north wind|saved the lake.
{89473}{89558}Celebi, the water's clean again.
{89559}{89608}Pika.
{89707}{89748}It isn't working.
{89797}{89876}All right, then.|We'll keep trying.
{90014}{90114}See? These are those berries|we found in the forest.
{90115}{90161}Here you go.
{90204}{90228}Uhh.
{90286}{90314}Uh...
{90348}{90398}Heh. That's OK.
{90399}{90438}Uhh.
{90505}{90561}Uh, Celebi?
{90702}{90745}Celebi, you can't die!
{91003}{91052}Pika?
{91129}{91194}Celebi didn't do|anything wrong.
{91195}{91251}It was a human being|who forced Celebi...
{91252}{91294}to destroy the forest.
{91295}{91370}Celebi never even had a choice.
{91371}{91418}Uhh! And now--uhh--
{91419}{91482}it can't have a choice.
{91483}{91557}Now it's too late to choose|'cause Celebi is gonna die!
{92762}{92786}Toge-to?
{92787}{92811}Huh?

{99643}{99697}You tried to destroy|our forest, mister...

{99843}{99905}Scizor, Sneasel!
{99906}{99937}Uhh!
{99995}{100060}This is all a mistake--
{100061}{100113}a big misunderstanding.
{100114}{100152}Ohh!
{100153}{100185}Weedle!
{100255}{100331}I think the Pokemon|understand perfectly.

{100465}{100495}Suicune!
{100496}{100526}Thank you!

{101267}{101306}to travel back in time...
{101307}{101386}and I think it wants|to take you along, Sam.
{101387}{101459}Can you really|bring me back, Celebi?
{101460}{101512}Bi!
{101541}{101605}Looks like|you're goin' home, Sam.
{101606}{101663}Yeah, I guess so.
{101663}{101722}Don't worry.|It won't matter...
{101723}{101815}'cause wherever you are,|or whenever you are--heh--
{101815}{101852}we'll always be friends.
{101979}{102007}Bi.
{102098}{102166}Thank you, Ash.|You're a great friend.

{102532}{102580}I'll see you!
{102611}{102683}Good-bye!
{103011}{103080}Pikachu!
{103571}{103608}You were right,|Professor.
{103609}{103667}That Pokemon we saw|was a Suicune.
{103667}{103722}Yeah, and we met|a Celebi, too.
{103723}{103761}It even traveled through time.
{103762}{103804}Well, well,|it sounds like you saw...
{103805}{103885}some very rare and highly|unusual Pokemon out there.
{103886}{103933}Huh? What's the matter, Ash?
{103934}{103961}Uh...
{103962}{104002}You haven't said|a single word yet.
{104003}{104076}Didn't you enjoy your little|adventure in the forest, too?
{104077}{104123}Oh, sure, Professor.
{104123}{104153}But, you see...
{104154}{104197}I met this Pokemon trainer...
{104198}{104231}and we got to be friends.
{104232}{104281}But l--|I just don't think...
{104282}{104327}I'm ever gonna|see him again.
{104327}{104360}He decided to go back...
{104361}{104406}to where he came from,|Professor--
{104407}{104438}to another time.
{104439}{104466}Pika.
{104467}{104506}I wouldn't worry, Ash.
{104507}{104533}Oh?
{104534}{104595}True friendships can withstand|the test of time...
{104596}{104644}and I have a feeling|this one will.
{104645}{104729}I'm sure you and Sammy|will be friends forever.
{104730}{104773}Mm. Heh heh.
{104774}{104830}Thanks, Professor.|I think so, too.
{104831}{104865}Pikachu!
{104914}{104954}I think we'd better|get going.
{104955}{105003}Yeah, I don't want|to miss the boat again.
{105003}{105030}We'll tell you everything...
{105031}{105072}when we get|to Pallet Town, OK?
{105073}{105130}Fine. I'm looking forward to it.
{105185}{105210}Hey.
{105211}{105262}What's the matter, Misty?
{105263}{105320}Howd Professor Oak|know Sammy's name?
{105321}{105353}We never mentioned|it to him.
{105354}{105380}Yeah, that's right.
{105381}{105407}[Toot]|Pika!
{105447}{105555}Professor Oak's amazing!|He knows everything!
{105556}{105605}Pika!
{105606}{105641}Pikachu!
{105849}{105945}Hmm. It seems like|it happened only yesterday.
{106153}{106232}This is amazing.
{106233}{106280}This wonderful water's|washed away...
{106281}{106330}all my annoying aches|and pains.
{106331}{106398}I could just float along|like this forever.
{106399}{106444}Ahoy!|-Huh?
{106445}{106505}Jessie, thank goodness|you're safe.
{106506}{106550}Hurry up. Climb aboard.
{106551}{106577}What took you so long?
{106578}{106605}What have you been doing?
{106606}{106650}We had to wait|till it was safe.
{106651}{106686}But now the coast is clear.
{106687}{106715}Oh, good.
{107153}{107205}Hey, guys,|I feel all tingly.
{107206}{107234}So do l.
{107235}{107295}Heh. Isn't it fabulous?
{107343}{107429}Looks like Team Rocket's|floating away.
{111402}{111454}Yo, man,|we forgot to vamp out.
{111455}{111495}This ain't|the end of the song?
{111496}{111558}-No.|-Oh, man.

Every night, the same dream, the same strange planet.
But why?
What are they trying to tell me?
It's been 34 years since they arrived on this planet.
And not a day passes that the survivors...
...forced to live in barrier cities, do not live in fear.
I have vowed to end that fear.
I believe my dreams hold the key.
The question is, will I be in time to save the Earth?
Where are you?
This is a restricted area.
Do not move!
- What's she doing here captain?
- I don't know, but we're getting her out.
- You're coming with us.
- Behind you!
Hold it right there!
Damn it. Let's move, people!
Two coming through the wall!
Hold your fire.
Those tanks are flammable!
Ryan, Neil, let's go!
- Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
- There's a life form in here.
- There hasn't been life here in years.
- Well, there is now.
Life form or not, I'm taking you in.
Fine! Arrest me. But I'm not leaving without that life form.
It's gonna be one of those days.
Captain, the transport is not going to wait for us much longer.
- I understand that.
- It's in bad shape.
Oh please! Tell me we're not risking our necks for this plant!
I wouldn't even call it a plant.
It's a weed.
- I wouldn't even call it a weed.
- I need a minute to extract it.
Miss. That's a minute we do not have.
I'm afraid he's right about that ma'am.
Phantoms! We have incoming.
- Captain, we need to get out of here.
- Understood, sergeant.
- Could you hurry please Miss?
- Done.
- Captain?
- Yes, Neil?
Just so you know?
I agree with the "let's get out of here thing. "
Duly noted.
- Can I have this, please?
- Thank you.
- We're surrounded!
- No shit!
- Alright everybody! Just relax.
- Captain, we gotta get to higher ground.
Everyone, up top!
Go, go, go!
- Transport, requesting immediate evac.
- Affirmative.
Up here!
- Captain! - They're right behind you! - Captain, come on!
I've got you!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
All right, everybody, here they come.
You okay?
You gonna be all right.
Can you give me one good reason why I shouldn't arrest you?
I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.
- Not unlimited clearance. Not without authorization.
- Listen captain. I don't have time for this.
Do you realize you just risked the lives of my squad?
Look! I don't wanna talk about it.
The fact of the matter is...
- ... it was worth the lives of you and your men.
- You and your men?
- She thinks you're a man.
- I think she's an idiot.
- I know you're not a man.
- I think you're an idiot too.
- Very funny.
- Well, I do wanna talk about it.
Did it ever occur to you...
...that we would've volunteered to risk our lives had we been given a choice?
Well, nobody asked you to save me.
I don't believe this.
You have not changed a bit!
Gray?
Yeah. Nice to see you too.
- Welcome back, captain.
- We're clean.
- Let's make sure of that shall we?
- I hate getting scanned.
So, the scanners are probably worse for us than the Phantoms.
No probably about it captain.
These machines are suspected of causing sterility.
And I wanna have a little Neil Jr. calling me Daddy someday.
- That's a spooky thought.
- Why are you always busting my chops?
People, let's just do this thing. Alright?
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, next.
Looks like you've gained some weight.
It's called upper-body strength, Neil.
Get a girlfriend.
I'm working on it.
You know, my security rating allows me to bypass this.
Not today it doesn't.
Something's not right.
- About this mission? Or that woman?
- Both.
Next.
Listen, captain.. I think...
I don't care what you think, doctor.
You're getting scanned just like everybody else.
Oh shit!
- Captain!
- They got him.
There must be a mistake.
You came in contact with a Phantom sir.
Please remain calm.
Administering treatment shield.
- What level is he?
- Blue. It will be code red in 3-1/2 minutes.
We have to treat him. Now!
I'm sorry, but that's impossible.
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.
There's no time for that.
Get him to the table.
Hang in there, captain.
Locating pathogens.
Jesus, look at that thing!
- How much more time?
- Not enough.
When he reaches code red, the treatment shield won't be able to hold the alien particles.
Engaging bio-etheric laser.
- What's going on?
- Where'd it go?
What the hell is going on?
We've lost contact.
Infestation is moving deeper.
- Tracking.
- There's no time.
- Tracking.
- There is no time! You're gonna lose him!
His treatment shield is failing.
Found it.
Come on.
It's all right.
Don't worry.
You'll be back to normal in no time.
Uh.. Doctor, we need to scan you for infestation.
That won't be necessary.
I'll take responsibility.
Hey, doc.
Thanks for saving him.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but the military has impounded my ship.
- What's with her?
- What's with her and the captain?
What's with her and that stupid plant?
What?
Forward me the Phantom data and everything regarding the five spirits collected so far.
Yes, doctor.
Spirits? I thought we weren't supposed to use the "S" word.
Don't get smart with me.
Now let's see if that plant does the trick.
It's a match. We've found it.
Yes.
The sixth spirit.
It seemed today you broke nearly every protocol.
How long do you think this would have survived outside the barrier?
Aki, you know there are elements in the council and military just waiting for an excuse to shut us down.
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered this energy in the Phantoms? You.
And who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form?
You. You made it possible to harness that energy...
...for ovo-pacs, scanners, even the barrier.
The council knows that.
They trust you doctor.
We're so close to proving it.
But we still need this part.
And this one here.
Exactly two more pieces and we've solved the puzzle!
And we need to be free to find those pieces.
I want to show you something Aki.
- What is this?
- Read.
"All life is born of Gaia and each life has a spirit.
Each new spirit is housed in a physical body. "
- Doctor?
- Go on.
"Through their experiences on Earth, each spirit matures and grows.
When the physical body dies...
...the mature spirit, enriched by its life on Earth, returns to Gaia...
...bringing with it the experiences...
...enabling Gaia to live and grow. "
It's my old diary.
I wrote that 43 years ago, when I was the age you are now.
Dr. Sid!
Remember what happened to Galileo?
They threw him in jail because...
...he said the Earth was not the center of the universe.
That could happen to us.
Our ideas are unpopular, Aki.
If you have any notes or records that could be used against you...
...destroy them.
- Keep them up here.
- Right.
And stay away from your friend, the captain.
He saves your life, you save his life, this leads to that.
I was young once too, you know.
Doctor, there is a war going on.
No one's young anymore.
Ladies and gentlemen of the council...
...could you please explain why?
Zeus was completed a month ago.
If we attack the meteor with this, we will eliminate the Phantoms at their source.
General Hein, calm down.
At our last meeting, We voted 6 to 2...
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon to attack the Leonid Meteor.
We have re-convened today to vote on that very issue again.
Now, I'd like to ask the director of the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.
- Dr. Sid, please.
- Thank you.
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest is in the Leonid Meteor...
...that landed here 34 years ago.
What you see now are the records of every assault on the meteor to date.
Physical attacks have had utterly no effect.
This scene took place three months ago during a full-scale bombardment.
Now please note the Phantoms outside the meteor are indeed destroyed.
However, inside, many that were dormant come to life...
...and as you see, overall Phantom density remains the same.
The newly risen aliens respond to the attack...
...by burrowing even deeper into the Earth.
Now, this is very interesting to me Dr. Sid...
...because we see the same thing during surgery...
...when using bio-etheric lasers on Phantom particles, do we not?
Yes, indeed we do.
You see. the injured particles escape...
...burying or digging themselves deeper into a patient's body.
And when we increase the laser power to destroy these deeper particles...
...we have had incidents resulting in further injury to a patient...
...and in some cases...
...death.
And what exactly does that mean doctor?
It means there's a very good chance...
...the beam from the Zeus cannon will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.
Exactly! Thank you.
However, it also means that the beam energy may be too strong...
...injuring the Earth.
Injure the Earth?
You mean the Gaia.
- I mean...
- You mean the spirit of the Earth.
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.
Did he say what I think he said?
What are you doing?
I know what I'm doing and whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.
This is ridiculous.
Doctor, with all due respect...
...did you come here just to talk about some Gaia theory?
To tell us that the planet is alive?
That it has a spirit?
That's a fairy tale doctor and I'm sorry, but we don't have time for that.
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.
Ahh.. Oh.. So if I point a gun at the Earth and fire...
...I'm not just making a hole on the ground,
I'm killing the planet.
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory has not been proven.
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we still have to remove the Phantoms?
I think if there's any chance of success, we should take it.
- Don't you agree?
- Well, of course i do.
But there is an alternative to the space cannon.
Another method?
- Yes. A means of disabling the Phantoms.
- Please.
As we know, the aliens display a distinct energy pattern.
Now, it is a fact that two opposing bio-etheric waves...
...placed one over the other will cancel each other out.
It is theoretically possible to construct a wave pattern...
...in direct opposition to the Phantom energy.
We are currently assembling such a wave and are nearing completion.
Members of the council...
...gathering plants and animals...
...from around the world to fight the Phantoms is utter nonsense.
The Zeus cannon is a proven, effective weapon.
It will kill Phantoms.
Can we afford to wait for some crazy invention...
...some army of touchy-feely plants and animals...
...An invention that offers no solid evidence that it will destroy the aliens?
There is evidence!
Our partially completed energy wave...
...has successfully stopped
Phantom particles from spreading...
...through a terminally-infected patient.
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence that a terminal patient has been cured?
Not cured. The wave is not complete.
But we've succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient.
Where is the proof?
Here.
You may have bought us some time Aki, but i wonder at what cost?
Doctor, I can't keep hiding in the background while you protect me.
I want what life I have left to mean something.
Will you listen to me? When we find the seventh and eighth spirits...
If we find them.
What we need now is some luck.
Luck has nothing to do with it.
Faith and hard work, girl...
...coz I'll be damned if you're going to die before me.
The council decided to postpone firing the Zeus cannon.
I guess I put on a good show.
Mind if I tag along?
You'll probably get bored.
So, what are you doing?
Oh, I see. You're giving me the silent treatment.
I'm scanning the city for the seventh spirit.
Hurry up, Neil.
- Relax sergeant. Almost got it.
- What do you think you're doing?
We're just gonna strand them for a while.
Hey, don't look at me. It was his idea.
This was your idea?
We're just helping the captain out a little.
Yeah, come on Jane.
Where's your sense of romance?
You've seen how the captain looks at her.
It's amore, baby.
What's going on?
It's probably just a glitch.
- Listen, Aki...
- I'm still mad at you.
- You're mad at me?
- Leaving your helmet on.
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a little childish?
Hey! Well, I was just a little upset when you just packed up and left for the Zeus Station without saying a word.
- Well, now you know what was going on. Alright?
- Yeah. Now I know.
My operation had to be done in zero grav. Okay?
Fine.
And how about the fact that I was sent there on a job and you wouldn't even see me.
I was probably helping Dr. Sid collect spirit waves.
- Well, now I know.
- So I'm sorry!
Well, me too! So we're both sorry.
So will you tell me about them?
About what?
About the spirits you've collected.
I was infected by a Phantom during an experiment.
- Normally, no one could have survived.
- How did you?
Dr. Sid created a membrane around the infection, keeping me alive.
So the first spirit wave was me.
- The second was a fish.
- A fish?
The third was a deer I found in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.
The fourth was a bird.
Ever tried to track a sparrow from outer space? It's no fun.
- What am I saying? You probably would love that.
- You're right. I probably would.
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.
- I thought that was number six.
- What?
You skipped one.
The fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room.
I retrieved the sample in time, but she...
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls.
Even the Earth.
I told her that she wasn't dying just returning to the Earth's spirit...
...to Gaia.
She told me that she was ready to die.
She said I didn't have to make up stories to make her feel better.
Only 7 years old and ready to die.
I'm sorry.
I have work to do. I have to find the seventh and eighth spirits.
Don't, please.
You don't believe any of this, do you?
I just don't know, Aki.
Is this why you shut me out?
You should have told me.
I don't know how much time I have left.
Who does?
I better get back to scanning.
Captain Edwards...
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from
Old New York several days ago did you not?
- Yes, sir.
- What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?
She seemed very capable and determined, sir.
You and the Deep Eyes are being temporarily reassigned.
You will guard Dr. Ross when she reenters the wasteland.
- Understood, sir.
- You don't understand yet, captain.
Report any aberrant behavior in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.
Aberrant behavior sir?
The woman carries an alien infestation, captain.
We don't know what it may be doing to her.
The alien presence could be affecting her judgment.
They may be manipulating the doctor for their very own purposes.
Is the general suggesting that Dr. Ross is a spy?
The general is wondering why he's explaining himself to a captain.
She's had prolonged exposure to Phantom tissue.
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest and transported here for observation.
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.
Of course, sir.
Major, send some of our men to keep an eye on the good captain.
I'm convinced that these dreams are some form of communication.
Their message still eludes me...
...but they're coming faster now and that can only mean one thing.
The Phantoms inside me are beginning to win.
Our target is 50 klicks west of Tucson.
- Roger.
- Phantom concentration?
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.
So it's gonna be a real picnic.
Stick close to me. No heroics today. Okay?
Everything by the book.
By the book. Right.
If we drop energy buoys here, here and here...
...we should be able to land, acquire the target, and get out before the Phantoms even know we were there.
And the buoys will attract the Phantoms?
- Yeah.
- For a while.
So you're from the 307th's right?
Under General Hein?
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.
Captain, rendezvous for evac at vector 6, coordinate 279.
Roger that. Stay alert for hostiles.
Looks like they've taken the bait.
The seventh spirit should be just beyond that line of wreckage.
I don't see how any living thing could survive out here?
We'll find out soon enough.
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.
It was supposed to end the war.
My father's in here somewhere.
All right.
Let's move out, people.
I'll be damned.
A survivor.
What's it doing out here?
Hoping for life to return.
Is that our spirit, doc?
No.
We're closing in on the life form.
- Distance?
- Hard to say. We're very close.
I don't see anything.
- You're not gonna tell me it's him?
- That's impossible.
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.
How do you explain that? The pacs power our weapons, the barrier cities...
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.
And to create that energy we use living tissue. Single-cell organisms.
- You're telling me his backpack is the seventh spirit?
- Yes.
We have incoming. Captain? Do you read me?
- Captain?
- What? Say again?
You read me captain? We have incoming.
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.
I need a hand! Sarge!
- Those buoys? They're not working.
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?
- Of course I am.
Let's get the hell out of here!
Something's not right.
This shouldn't be happening.
Something's attracting them.
Aki!
- They're right on us, sir. Closing in fast!
- Jane, take the lead.
Fire in the hole!
Get us out of here, Neil.
- Sir, I would love to, but...
- Just do it!
- Sir?
- It's okay, that's it.
That doesn't look good, captain.
We have to get her to a hospital.
- You have your orders, sir.
- What the hell is going on here?
Dr. Ross is to be taken into custody now, sir.
Lower your weapons. That's an order!
Sir. We have no choice, but to relieve you of your command.
I won't let you do this soldier.
You'll gonna have to shoot me.
Stand down, captain!
Hang on, everyone!
That's enough.
Hands where I can see them. Everyone now!
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!
Neil, get us back to New York, fast!
The Deep Eyes are returning from the wasteland, sir.
Apparently, there was an incident.
It would seem the Phantoms were attracted to Dr. Ross.
The crew barely escaped with their lives.
And sir, Captain Edwards is still in command.
Issue an order.
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross placed under arrest.
All research materials pertaining to Dr. Sid's wave theory...
...are to be confiscated immediately.
That might not go over too well with the council, sir.
What a tragedy that would be.
This is perfect, major.
The good captain has opened the door for us.
By tomorrow morning, the council will be at our feet...
...thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us...
...to save them from the Phantoms.
How is she, doctor?
- She is dying.
- There must be something you can do.
Aki is fighting with only six of the eight spirits.
We'll have to implant the seventh directly into her chest plate.
It took a bullet.
I think it might be damaged.
We have to repair this panel quickly.
Her vital signs are dropping.
Aki is slipping away from us.
She needs a sympathetic spirit to help hold her in this world.
And I can think of no spirit better suited for that task than yours, captain.
- I don't understand.
- You don't have to understand.
You just be with her now.
You keep her here with us.
Aki? Where are we?
On an alien planet.
How is that possible?
I'm not entirely sure.
You seem pretty calm.
I've been having this dream every night for months.
Dream?
Well, whatever it is.
You're really here, aren't you?
What's happening to me?
Dr. Sid is implanting the seventh spirit directly into your body.
Then you're my spiritual support.
Gray, how sweet of you.
Look, I don't think you realize how serious this situation is.
Something you should see here, sir.
And I am watching what, major?
It seems Dr. Ross has been recording her dreams.
And why would I be interested in...
...her dreams?
This is it. This is our evidence.
She's under the influence of the Phantoms.
Dr. Ross' dreams should be all the council needs to authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.
The council is content to hide powering inside this barrier...
...while the world dies a little more every day.
I believe they need a push in the right direction, major.
Get together a group of your most trusted men.
What are they doing.
Why are they staring at us?
Not at us.
Welcome back, captain.
Is it over?
How is she, doctor?
She's gonna be fine.
But this is only temporary.
We'll need to find the eighth and final spirit to cure her.
Aki, can you hear me?
I finished it.
I know what it means.
I know what the Phantoms really are.
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!
We have them, sir.
Sir?
My wife and daughter...
...were killed by Phantoms in the
San Francisco Barrier City was attacked.
Did I ever tell you that?
I try to imagine what.. what that must have been like...
...seeing everyone around you fall over dead for no apparent reason.
And then, at the end, feeling something next to you...
...invisible...
...touching you...
...reaching inside your body...
You've lost family, haven't you?
Yes, sir.
That's why I trust you.
All of you.
You know what must be done.
Security override.
Perimeter breached.
Major, arrest these men.
- Take it easy.
- Stand up. Go.
You are relieved of your post.
Don't ask any questions.
Reduce power to Sector 31.
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms...
What I realize, major...
...is that we must force the council to take action against the enemy.
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.
Lowering power output to Sector 31.
Barrier breached in Sector 31, general.
They're coming through now.
Oh I think we can easily handle a few Phantoms in a contained space.
Relax, major. When this night's over, you're going to be a hero.
- Aki, I don't think...
- You were in my dream, Gray. You saw it.
That's just it. I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?
Captain, please, let her continue.
Alright. Why do you think we've never been able to determine...
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?
Excuse me, doc, but what friggin' relationship?
I mean you got your human-sized Phantoms, and your creepy caterpillary Phantoms...
...and your flying Phantoms and let's not forget my personal favorite...
...the big, fat, giant Phantoms.
Down, boy.
He's right. If you've spent as much time in the field as we had...
...you know there is no relationship.
It's like a zoo out there.
Precisely. I think the giant ones are like our whales or elephants.
But why would an invading army bring a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?
Unless their ship was kind of a crazy Noah's Ark?
We have always assumed that the meteor...
...was intended as a form of transportation.
Perhaps it wasn't.
The meteor is a chunk of their planet that got thrown into space...
...when they destroyed their world.
But how could they survive the trip across outer space on a hunk of rock?
They didn't.
Oh. This is all beginning to make a creepy kind of sense.
What do you think about all this, captain?
I think that explains why we never had a chance.
All our strategies are based on one assumption:
That we were fighting alien invaders.
Think of the dream, Gray. How they died.
Since then, all they've known is suffering.
They're not an invading army.
They're ghosts.
How many Phantoms?
More than enough to convince the council, sir.
Excellent. Sound an alert. Send a squad out to eliminate them.
Yes sir.
Alert status. Full deployment.
Sir. I have numerous Phantom contacts!
Well, of course you do.
Outside of Sector 31, sir.
And moving at incredible speed.
Major, What the hell is going on here?
They're in the pipes.
They're moving with the bio-etheric energy flow.
That's impossible. No living thing could survive in those pipes.
Well, we've got a big one heading this way.
Meta class, sir.
Oh, my God.
Hold your fire!
What have I done?
Come on, Neil. We need to find a way out.
You're our man. Think.
Captain, these walls are titanium alloy and the bars are pulse-sonic lasers.
I mean it's not like I can just wave a magic wand and...
- Wow! Neil, I'm impressed.
- That makes two of us.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
Proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
I think we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility.
- Here they come.
- But the others! Dr. Sid!
Deep Eyes'll take care of him.
Come on.
What's happening. Why can we see them now?
They must be carrying a residual charge from passing through the barrier.
Behind you!
All aboard, captain!
We need to find my ship.
If it was towed inside the city, it would be in the military hangar.
That's a big "if. "
Look out!
- Get us onto the platform.
- You got it.
Okay, now what?
We're going through the station.
- What?
- Captain, with all due respect...
- Excuse me, captain.
- The station.
We're going through it.
It's the only way.
So I gather this will be somewhat of a rough ride?
Doc, you've got a talent for understatement.
Hang on, everybody!
Doc?
Interesting.
- Anybody hurt?
- Captain.
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.
Ouch!
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- Right.
No wait! We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.
They're in my ship.
- No. No, doc. No drugs.
- Captain?
You heard the man.
We'll find the ship and be back for you.
- I'll stay with him.
- Me too.
Nobody's staying.
- Just give me a gun.
- You got it.
Give him a weapon. Do it!
We'll be back for you, sergeant.
You hear me?
I hear you, captain.
Now, get out of here.
Let's move out.
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.
It can be used to retrieve Ryan and transport him safely here.
However, we'll need to replace these spent fuel cells.
There could be some live ovo-pacs in the hangar.
Alright. Jane, check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the Quatro.
I'll go to the tower and rotate the airtray.
This city may be lost, but we are not.
Let's do this thing and get the hell out of here.
Gray, be careful.
You too.
Oh, yeah.
Neil, do you read me?
Loud and clear, captain.
This baby'll fly itself.
Flight path is set.
Beginning rotation.
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.
I'm reading an impound tractor attached probably to the ship.
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?
No sir. Permission to go outside and detach the coupling.
Do it.
There's the problem.
The controls are locked, naturally.
Jane, let me ask you something.
You think we're gonna get out of here alive?
I mean I wonder if anybody else has gotten out.
You think anyone's made it this far? Huh?
You think this eighth-spirit stuff is really gonna work against the Phantoms?
I mean what if it's all a bunch of mumbo-jumbo?
Jane, do you mind if we stop talking?
I'm trying to concentrate here.
What's happening down there?
Nothing we can't handle.
- Neil, what's your status?
- Almost there.
I want you two back inside.
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating with extreme prejudice.
Talk to me, Jane.
No problem here, captain.
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.
Jane, get out of there.
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!
Get the hell out of there!
The shield is powered and ready.
- Where are you going?
- To the cockpit.
The ship is set on autopilot.
We're in countdown to liftoff.
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!
Over here, you son of a bitch!
Gray, do you read me?
What's happening?
You and Sid are getting out of here now.
- No! We can't just leave everyone.
- Everyone's dead!
- I'm not leaving without you.
- I'm sorry, but you don't have a choice.
Goodbye, Aki.
Gray, come on!
I just...
I wish I could believe they were in a better place.
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...
...to include an area that we had previously overlooked.
The impact crater.
That's a strange place to find the eighth spirit.
Yes, really quite astonishing.
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.
Precisely.
Which suggests that the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.
I can't explain it at the moment, but once we get down there...
- ... you will understand...
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.
Yes, I expected that's how you would evaluate our chances.
Well, am I wrong?
No, I agree. We probably...
...won't live long enough to extract the eighth spirit from the crater.
Then why should we even try it?
Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.
If we can't bring the final spirit here...
...we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater.
Yes, exactly.
And how do we do that, exactly?
I can construct a device that...
...would attach to Aki's chest plate to gather the eighth spirit and then...
And then what?
And then we wait and see what happens.
That's it?
- That's your plan? We wait and see what happens?
- Yes.
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.
We keep scanning the surface from orbit...
- and maybe we'll find a compatible spirit somewhere else.
Aki?
I say we go in.
What caused the barrier to fail, General Hein?
I'm afraid it was only a matter of time...
...before the Phantoms developed an immunity to our barriers.
But I am relieved to see that you and the rest of the council...
...were able to evacuate to Houston without incident.
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.
The council has reconsidered your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.
I see.
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.
And, general...
...best of luck to us all.
Prepare to fire the cannon.
The target, sir?
The Phantom crater.
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.
Powering the shield.
Okay, we're over the meteor.
Do you have it in sight, doctor?
There are so many of them.
Wait.
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit moving along the crater's surface.
All right. Now let's take a closer look.
Ready to fire in three minutes.
Ovo-pacs at maximum.
Transferring plasma flow to auto.
Counter-thrusters are engaged.
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.
We have something on radar over the impact site, sir.
It's her.
Sir?
Just a traitor under the influence of the enemy.
Continue the countdown.
We'll take them all out at the same time.
We're closing on the Phantom.
Contact in 30 seconds.
Target locked.
Ready to fire on your command.
It's a match! It's a perfect match!
- Target scanners ready, sir.
- Fire.
What was that?
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.
- Aki, Captain, are you all right?
- A little shaken. Stand by.
Sid, the eighth spirit is not on our scanner. Do you have it?
The eighth spirit...
...has been destroyed.
- What are we going to do now?
- Nothing. This mission is over.
- We have to get out of here.
- Incoming!
What is that?
If you're getting us out of here, you better do it now.
Hold on!
I can't hold on to you.
Unable to maintain altitude.
Initiate emergency landing procedures.
Come in. Come in, please.
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?
- What is that thing?
- I don't know, sir.
Incoming message, sir.
General Hein,
You must cease fire immediately.
What you are looking at in the crater is the living spirit of an alien's home world.
Their planet was destroyed and part of it landed here.
This is not an invasion. It never was.
I see and what have we been fighting all this time, doctor? Ghosts?
Yes. Spirits that are confused, lost and angry.
Right. And these spirits are coming out of this Gaia thing.
General Hein, you have to listen.
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia.
Doctor, even if I believed in such nonsense...
...the fact remains the Earth is under attack from an aggressor...
...who must be destroyed at all costs.
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.
Firing on the alien Gaia will only make it stronger.
Well, since you're under the alien's influence, doctor,
I will take your protest to mean that we are...
...in fact pursuing the correct course of actions.
So i suggest you take your last few moments and prepare to meet your Gaia.
Continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed.
General, the system is overheating, sir.
We're going to hit it again and again and keep on hitting it until it's dead.
But, sir. We're not even sure if it's having any effect on the creature.
No effect? We've got them on the run, soldier.
This is our moment of victory. I order you to fire.
- The system won't allow us to fire again.
- We'll see about that.
Our shield is out. We're sitting ducks in here.
Come on!
This is not a good place to be.
What the hell is that?
That's not what I think it is, Is it?
Yes, it's Gaia.
This is definitely not a good place to be.
Hey, are you all right?
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.
Sid, do you read me?
Go ahead, I'm still here.
We're looking at Gaia.
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.
I think this explains why the eighth spirit appeared here.
Yes.
Yes, that's it!
A Phantom must have changed into the eighth spirit...
...when it touched a new life born from our own Gaia.
If so, it would've been given a different energy signature...
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.
You two could not have hoped for a better location...
...to find a new compatible spirit.
Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.
Staying right where we are may not be as easy as it sounds.
Don't shoot any of them!
You could very well destroy our last hope.
And what do you suggest I do, doctor?
Ask them to play nice?
Combat strategy is your area of expertise, captain, not mine.
I have a reading here in the fissure.
Do you see it?
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.
Well? Which one is it? Which one?
I'm having difficulty narrowing it down.
Just a moment, please.
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here.
Aki, we don't have much time. Aki.
With the hope of new life...
...has Gaia changed the Phantom within?
I have it.
Gray, get in here. I need you!
Do you hear me, Sid?
The wave pattern is complete.
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.
It found me, doctor.
Oh, my word.
I see now. I understand.
Well, I don't understand!
What the hell is going on?
Give me the ovo-pac.
I need to project the completed wave.
- But we'll be defenseless.
- Just do it!
I hope you know what you're doing, Aki.
- We can use the shield to project the wave.
- What?
Dr. Sid's theory was right.
I have it. The eighth spirit.
I'm cured, Gray.
- Are you sure you have the final spirit?
- Yes, I'm sure.
- But how? How can you know that?
- Don't worry. A Phantom told me.
Oh, great.
That's it. Shield on.
It's not working.
We have to do something before it's too late.
If this doesn't work, then it's already too late.
Gray, trust me.
I'll blast you all to hell.
Oh, no. No!
Get down!
- Warning. System overload.
- I know.
- Warning. System overload.
- I know!
But it must be done.
Fire.
Fire, damn you!
Fire!
Don't leave me, Gray.
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.
Looks like I was right.
No, Gray. Hang on, please.
I still have the wave.
We can get through this.
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're going to make it.
We both know that isn't true.
Help me.
Listen to me.
You saved my life once.
Now I want you to save yourself.
Gray, no. Please?
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.
Don't leave me, Gray.
You've been trying to tell me that death isn't the end.
Don't back out on me now that I finally believe.
I love you.
Oh, it's warm.

[Cackling]
Back, Stanley.
You are going back... back to when it all began.
Are you back yet?
Get back!
We haven't got all day!
[StanleyI [t was third grade.
The teacher was Miss Hudlapp.
She was kinda squat and lumpy.
She smelled funny.
- But she was kind.
- Class!
How many times have I told you?
In this class... we do not pound ten-penny nails into Stanley's head!
[Stanley] You know how some teachers have those kinda flaps on their arms... those big sacks of limp flab that, like, dangle?
- Aahh.
- It sounds weird, but for some reason, as I watched those big old flaps of hers,
- I began to feel...
- [Sighs] oddly... aroused.
And then the horror began.
- [Laughing]
- [Gasps]
[Grunting]
Young man, what's that in your lap?
Oh, it was useless...like putting a baseball cap on the Washington Monument.
And then, all at once, there he was...
Monkeybone!
- Hey, baby, I love your way!
- Oh!
- # Yo, monkey #
# Monkeybone #
- [Miss Hudlapp] Ooh!
- # Monkeybone #
Moo-coo! Moo-coo!
Moo-coo! Moo-coo!
How 'bout it, Doc... can you help me?
All in good time, my boy.
All in good time.
[Laughs Hysterically]
Oh, what a loser!
Oh, roll out the wacky wagons!
[Applauding]
Well, that's our pilot.
And the good news is... the Comedy Channel has picked us up with an order for six episodes.
And now I'd like you to meet the man who got it all started, the creator of America's most disturbed comicstrip, the man behind the monkey, if you will.
Ladies and gentlemen, please... Stu Miley!
- [Cheering, Applause]
- Come on, Stu. Don't be shy!
You can't go yet.
There's a potload of money here.
Besides, you haven't talked to Bill from Bazoom Toys, who's got great ideas.
Oh, Mr. Miley, do we ever!
Check it out. The Monkeybone phone.
Every kid's gonna want three and want their friends to have three.
Check out the slippers. You're walking, your tootsies are warm, you're laughing.
The Monkeybone backpack. If you're goin' to Europe, flip it around...
Stu. Stu. Stu, what are you doin'?
Come on. Come on.
We gotta talk to the guys from Burger God.
Burger God... aren't they the ones that found the rat gut in the french fries?
No. No.
No, they found a pig gut, which is different.
- Mmm.
- That's-That's practically pork.
- [Scoffs]
- It's a lot of real money, the kind of money that can buy happiness.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- I got the ring, Herb.
- The what?
- The ring. That ring.
- What ring? No.
- What-What do you mean?
- Tonight's the night, Herb.
- Why?
- Tonight is the night.
That girl pulled me out of a nightmare.
She makes me happy, Herb, not all of this stuff.
Right over here.
Do you see this door?
The cool thing is that you open it, you go out, it closes, and you can't get back in.
- But, Stu, you want to leave?
- Yeah.
- You're a hit! Everybody loves you!
- Come on!
Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with a bunch of these media creeps.
I just want to be us, home, alone.
Come on. Besides, I have something that I - I want to give to you.
Can't you give it to me later?
Yes, I could, but if later got here sooner, it... it would be a lot better.
Hi, Herb.
- Ah, yes.
- Herb...
Yeah. Oh... Yeah, that'll be good.
You got everything? Ah, yeah.
Stu, these are just prototypes.
They aren't the real products.
Just something for you to take home.
Just spend some time with them, get a feeling for them before you say "no."
- No.
- [Squeaks]
Stu, come on.
One more thing.
Actually, there's a couple of trucks to come with, you know, Monkeybone stuff.
- You guys mind waiting a little longer?
- [Car Starts]
Good night, Herb.
Of course. You guys get outta here.
You're a beautiful couple.
Look at this.
Now he won't let us leave.
- Who?
- The monkey! Hey, Herb,
Can you get this guy to move?
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Come on, please? Help me out here.
Stu, stop.
The monkey is good luck.
- Come on.
- I never had any good luck...
- until I met you.
- Everybody loves him.
You're gonna be a huge success, so just relax and enjoy it.

How you doin', little one, hmm?
You holdin' up?
I'm fine, Kimmy.
Fine.
At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
- The ring?
- Grandmother's engagement ring.
- The one he had me send so he...
- Good morning, Dr. McElroy.
Hello, Doctor.
Kimmy, this is Dr. Edelstein.
- Vital signs have stabilized. Good.
- Listen, Doctor, ... these machines are actually what's keeping him alive right now, right?
- At the moment, yes.
- Okay. Well, do you think...
- you could give me a realistic...
- Comas are unpredictable.
He could wake up today or tomorrow or...
Doctor, hey, sweetheart.
Our father took a long time to die, so Stu and I made a pact... that... when our time came... we wouldn't let it drag out.
So...
- which one's the plug?
- What plug?
The plug?
The one you pull?
Oh, God, Kimmy.
Don't even talk like that.
I need a realistic answer,
Doctor! Give me a date!
All right.
Three months.
There's always some brain damage, but after three months... the chances of coming back shrink dramatically every day.
Well, I want him to have every chance, Doctor.
We could... certainly give it...
[Sighs] three months.
[Owl Hooting]
Oh, poor Buster!
He hasn't eaten all day.
What's that?
[Dog Whimpers]
Stu did this?
Yeah, right about the time we met, when he first came to the sleep lab.
Jesus, honey.
He hadn't had a good night's sleep in years.
The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd just start right in painting.
How do you go from here... to cartoons?
- Switch hands.
- What?
Stu was right-handed, so I made him switch the pen to his left hand... to see what would come out, and we got the first Monkeybone.
- Wow. Two guys in the same brain.
- Yeah.
Which one did you fall in love with?
# [Nightclub Music]
[Bull]
Hey, Stu, why so glum?
At least they haven't pulled the plug yet. Have another 'tini.
No, I'm sick of martinis... and carnival rides and watching other people's nightmares.
- Hmm?
- The one thing I'm really sick of is...
Speaking of dames, I'd like to sing a tune about the beautiful Miss Julie.
She's conscious, boyfriend here's an eggplant.

Help! Monkey-napper!
Let me out. It's not my fault. I happen to be a figment of your imagination.
- Learn to act normally. I had to.
- Normal, huh?
- Hiya, Stu.
- Hello, Kitty!
[Growls, Barks]
- I brought you a refill.
- I'd love a stiff one, but Stu here forgot to endow me, equip me.
- Ow!
- Nothing for him. He's being repressed.
Is something wrong, Stu?
You seem... tense.
It's my girlfriend. I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
- [Monkeybone Struggling]
- Why didn't I just propose?
Right there. At least that way
I'd know what she said.
- I'd know if she's waiting for me.
- She is waiting for you, Stu.
I know she is.

We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like...
- Caviar. [Chuckles]
- I just saw a dream.
It was my girlfriend.
She dreamed that they were gonna... pull the plug on me.
[Laughing]
Give us a moment, will you, darling?
Toodles!
You see, Stu, you made this pact with your sister.
- Huh?
- No life support?
Pact? Pact? No life support?

- Pull the plug! Pull the plug, pleas...
- No!
That's wrong.
Julie would never agree to that.
They're pulling the plug at 9:00 a.m.
Anybody that dumb deserves to die!
- Can't you help me?
- Stu, I'm just the god of sleep.
- This is Death's bailiwick.
- Death?
[Grunts, Sighs]
[Panting]
Cheating Death... and this is extremely off the record... what you gotta do... is go into the Land of Death, sneak up right under Death's nose... and steal one of those Exit Passes.
Well, Hyp, thanks for the idea, and good luck with the shock therapy.
- [Laughing]
- [Hissing] Will you shut up?
He gave you a sign?
It doesn't sound rational, okay?
It's not rational.
I don't care anymore, Alice. We've got exactly six hours to wake him up.
Hey, look! Mr. Green Stain's got a dead one. What do we do now?

Chart number one is from five years ago.
This is the worst nightmare
Stu had at the sleep lab... abnormally intense alpha wave activity with a peak that lasted over a minute.
And this... Alice... this is earlier today.
- Holy shit.
- Wow.
He's caught in a loop... a nightmare loop.
- Does everybody know what Oneirix is?
- [Man] It's nightmare juice.
If those charts are right,
Stu's swimmin' in the stuff.
- We can decrease the levels.
- No, I want to give him a massive dose.
- That's not gonna stop his nightmare.
- Hutch, I don't want to.
I want to crank it up, take it right off the charts. I want to scare him awake.

That means bureaucracy.
You.
- Yeah. What's your name?
- Say something!
- Herb.
- Come here, Herb.
- [Monkeybone] Now?
- Please.
- Stand up straight!
- [Stu] I am standing up straight.
I want you to picture this with me, if you can.
- Y-Y-Yeah?
- You're a customer, you're about to die.
You're a little excited, a little fearful, and here comes the Grim Reaper.
Tell me, Herb, [Shouting] what the hell is he covered in?
- Uh, pea soup?
- [Monkeybone] Guacamole?
- As you requested, one Exit Pass,
- [Gasps]
O mighty wielder of the scythe.
- [Stu] Just behave!
- Exit Pass? Oh, what a coincidence!
I was just heading over to DownTown...
Don't bite me there!
I'd be happy to drop that off for you, if you don't mind!
- Herb?
- [Monkeybone] Yeah?
Could I see you over there, please?
- Monkeybone Whimpers]Over there?
- Yeah.
[Monkeybone]
Okay.
- Latta!
- [Growling]
[Growling, Snarling]
- Barking]
- Uh-oh.
- Impostors! Get that monkey!
- Get 'em!
Get in there! Go on, you Reapers!
Go, go, go!
Stu, Stu, Stu!
Geronimo!
Hiya!
[Whooping]
- That's it!
- Well done!
- Fire in the hole!
- Whose hole? Whose hole?
[Yelling]
[Alarm Blaring]
[Stu Panting]
Hey, Monkeybone, there's a train!
Arnold, now. Now!
[Screeching]
[Grunting]
Come on, Monkeybone!
Come on, buddy, you can do it!
Okay. All righty.
Take it easy.
- [Screeching]
- [Yelling] Help, boss!
Comin' in.
Whoo! Thank you!
Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you.
Yikes!
[Whooping]
[Whooping, Yelling]
Monkeybone!
What's the maximum safe dose?
The most we've ever used is, um, half a C.C.
Five C.C.s.
[Groaning]
[Whimpering]
[Monkeybone] Hold it, Doctor!
Stu, I'm comin'in!
- [Whimpering]
- Monkeybone]Oh, yeah!
- [Yelling]
- [Yelling]
- [Grunting]
- That's it! Now, hit those pedals!
[Sniffling, Sobbing]
- [Stu Pants, Laughs]
- Whoo! Yes!
Terra firma, we made it!
- Monkeybone, you saved my life!
- What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Look, we only have about five minutes.
Just that, now that I'm leaving, there's so many things I wanted to say to you.
Ah. Don't get mushy on me. I'll be fine, just drop me off at the bar.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal.
I wish I could take you home with me.
Ah, right back at ya, boss.
[Clicks Tongue] Right back at ya.
No joke, little buddy.
I really do love...
Whee!
I love you too... boss!
[Cackles]
Love you too!
[Whooping]
- [Whooping, Chattering]
- Wait! Monkeybone!
Don't do this!
Please! Wait!
- Nice work, little feller.
- Monkeybone, wait!
No, don't do this!
Wait!
- [Laughing]
- Let go!
Monkeybone!
We can talk about this! Come on, wait!
- [Creatures Clamoring]
- Come back here!
Wait! No, you don't understand!
He's got my Exit Pass!
Oh, I'm so sorry, Stu.
It's just all part of the deal.
[Laughs Sinisterly] We've got big plans for that body of yours!
What?
- No! This can't be happening!
- [Whooping]
[Screaming]
No!
Julie! Julie!
[Whooping]
- Stu?
- [Coughs]
Jul... [Hiccups]
Julie?
[Chuckles]
Whoa, baby!
- Stu!
- [Chuckling]
Two more little ticks of the clock, and...
Welcome home.
Oh, Stu!
Home sweet home, huh?
Actually, I was expecting something a little swankier.
[Door Closes]
You have to assume that Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise, with, uh, royalties, servants...
- I gave all the servants the day off.
- Oh.
- Cackling Like Monkeybone]
- [Laughs]
Honey, why don't you just rest on the sofa for a minute?
Okay? All right?
- [Gasps]
- Hmm!
Mmm.
Oh, bitchin' good cake.
- Good.
- You want a hunk?
No, thank you.
[Chuckles Nervously]
- [Champagne Pouring]
- Oh.
Here's to a celebration that should have happened three months ago.
Ahh!
- Stu?
- Hmm?
I want you to know I found the little surprise you left that night.
Mm-hmm?
If you were wondering what the answer was, it was "yes", and it still is.
- It is?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
With all my heart.
- And what was the question?
- You asked me to marry you.
- Marry you? [Laughs]
- Mm-hmm.
No, you did. Here.
- See?
- Oh! He did it!
No! No-no-no-no.
- Buster! Look who's here!
- [Barking]
Hello, Buster.
[Groans]
[Barking]
I've never seen him act like this before!
He's a lying son of a bitch!
Don't believe anything he says!
- He's got mental problems! Shut up!
- Ow!
- [Screeching Like Monkeybone]
- [Barking Continues]
# [Sultry Beat]
Oh, baby.
# [Volume Increases]
Ohh.
Mm-hmm.
- [Chitters]
- What are you watching?
Nothin'.
[Grunting Gently]
- Hmm?
- You think this is medically advisable?
- We got a doctor on duty.
- Well, as long as it's okay with Monkeybone...
- which it seems to be.
- Huh?
Oh. Huh?
# I've been feelin' trapped, baby #
- [Squeaks]
- # Tryin' to hold back this feelin' #
# For so long #
- # And if you feel like I feel, baby #
- [Buster Barking]

# Aahh, baby #
# Let's get it on #

Dive! Dive! Dive!
- Ow!
- Oh, God, Stu!
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my... Are you... Oh!
- [Gasps]
- [Grunting]
- [Gasps]
- Heads up! Feeding time!
[Screams, Moans]
[Screaming]
Ohh! What-What-What?
[Gasps, Whimpers]
What? What? Who are you?
- What do you want?
- Dinner.
You gotta move fast or you'll starve.
Here, have some popcorn.
They feed us the slops from the Morpheum Theater.
You hope for Milky Way, you settle for Skittles. I'm Steve... Steve King.
[BirdSquawks]
Stephen King?
What are you doing here?
I'm Jack the Ripper.
- I'm Lizzie Borden.
- How do you do?
- Attila the Hun.
- Attila the Hun.
# [Fanfare On Kazoo]
All hail the most glorious, the most esteemed,
Oh, enough! Enough, enough!
I'm hung over.
- Hyp, did you bring me cough medicine?
- That night-light I asked for?
- King, you pussy. [Laughs]
- Bite me, Poe.
- You set me up!
- Easy, pal. [Chuckles]
Just coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching those Exit Passes.
Steve was the last guy to do it, and that must have been 25 years ago.
Why'd you do it, huh?
Wh-What did I ever do to you?
It's nothing personal, Stu, it's just we need nightmares... fresh nightmares.
We'd die without 'em.
That's why we grabbed your body.
- I'm no nightmare-maker.
- That's the monkey's job.
- Monkeybone? What?
- [Laughs Maniacally]
Let's face it, Stu. Nobody wants to be a figment. It's a dead-end career.
So he gets fed up, he comes to us with a proposition:
We help him swipe your body, he helps us get a heap of brand-new nightmares!
- News flash, buddy: I'm a cartoonist!
- Sure!
But you got a girlfriend who's figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams.
And guess what. She just whipped up a big ol'batch of nightmare juice!
[Laughing]
Oh, we're predicting record box office.
What's plural for orifice? "Orifi"?
No, I wasn't in a coma!
All right, I was in a coma. It wasn't like I was "in a coma" and goofing off.
I was thinking up hilarious new bits the whole time!
[Laughing Wildly]
You see, it's all synergy.
The show synergizes the strip.
The strip synergizes the merchandising.
The merchandising synergizes the religion.
And the religion synergizes the Barbara Walters special!
And then, baby, we are all in... the United Empire of Monkeybonia!
No, really.
He's ready to merchandise, yeah.
We gotta move on this, so get the burger guy, the toy guys... the toy guys and the lunchbox people in here...
Herb, get off that phone right now.
You're exploiting him!
- Am not.
- Herb, he's not himself.
He's your friend. He trusts you, and you're taking advantage of him!
- Am not. I'm on the phone!
- Are too!
- My cocina.
- Hey, hey.
My refrigerator, where I store and chill my food.
And this... the oven, where I cook my food.
And if you'll step this way, you'll find my dining room, where I eat my food.
What is all this stuff about merchandising? You hate merchandising.
I know, baby, I do.
But look at it from another angle:
There's a potload of money here.
# I'm dirty as a manhole #
# Cover #
# I'm looking for my long-lost #
# Lover #
# She turned me out and now #
# I'm sinkin' #
- [Whimpering]
- # I'm just so easily led #
# When the little head does the thinkin' #
You two-bit simian stooge.
We didn't send you up here to shake your booty with a bunch of lingerie babes.
[Slowed-Down Voice]
But it's my fantasy.
I don't care!
We sent you up here to make nightmares!
Now, you get out there, and you get that nightmare juice, and you get to work!
'Cause you may be a free man during the day, but when you dream... your monkeyass is mine!
[Echoing]
[Buffer Whirring]
What the...
[Chittering]
- [Chittering]
- [Gasps]
- [Kissing Sound]
- Oh, baby, I'd really like to, but it'd put me in a lot of hot water.
Why don't you just give that back?
- [Woman] # Lovin'you #
- Oh, do you?
Well, in that case, why don't you give me a little preview?
- [Kissing Sound]
- # Makin'love with you #
# Is all I wanna do #
Sucker.
[Screeches]
Let go! Let go!
Let go of my pants!
- Stu?
- [Snores]
- Where have you been?
- Hmm?
Nowhere.
I was asleep.
Honey, don't lie to me.
I know you went out.
Nope. Not me.
You must be dreaming.
I know what this is about. You've been mad because I haven't proposed to you.
Oh, go on, admit it!
You've been giving me the stinkeye ever since that business with the banner.
- You, you and that dog.
- I have not been giving the stinkeye.
You're giving me the stinkeye right now.
Stu, you're wearing shoes and a poncho... with no pants, in bed.
[Mutters]
I know.
[Distant Screaming]
Well, did you all have sidekicks... figments, monkeys?
A raven.
Mine was a dog.
Man's best friend. [Scoffs]
I went through hell to get that Exit Pass.
And who got to use it? Cujo.
Miley, you got a visitor!
Kitty!
Oh God, Stu,
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you what was going on.
I really, really liked you.
Thank you, Kitty, but that doesn't matter right now.
The woman I love is living with a horny little monkey that looks like me.
- What a lucky girl.
- Kitty, listen.
Is there any way I can get a message to warn her about what Monkeybone is up to?
- Time's up! Break it up! Let's move!
- No, no. No!
- Give me a moment, just to look at him.
- Let's go!
- Stu!
- Feeding time!
As you know, Burger God is prepared to launch... our new Mega Monkey Meal.
- Uh, something wrong?
-A pig gut!
- How much is McDonald's offering?
- Less.
A pleasure to be in business with you.
[Laughing]
Here's another thing. The Natural
History Museum is kicking off... a fund-raising campaign and wanna know if you can appear at a benefit.
Oh, I get it.
We give the public the impression... that we're doing something charitable... brilliant!
Yes.
Yes, that's it exactly.
Now, I think you remember
Bill here from Bazoom Toys.
We have a little something here we think you might just like.
It's a prototype.
Codename: Little Jack Horner.
Go ahead, pull out his thumb.
- [Trumpets]
- [All Laughing]
- No, it's mine!
- Oh.
Say, could you fill these babies up with a particulate solution... of one part powdered chemical enzyme to ten parts water?
- Uh, Jerry?
- Sure.
- Yeah, yeah, I guess we could.
- All right!
You've got yourself a deal!
- [Trumpeting]
- [All Laughing]
Shall we shake on it?
Shake on it? That's not the way we do things in Monkey Land.
In Monkey Land, we rub our bottoms together.
Huh?
You heard the man.
Get your asses on the table.
[Cackling]
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting.
It's the nightmare juice.
It's gotta be.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
He's not Stu anymore.
The Stu I love is gone.
He spends all his time in the garage.
He says that he's... autographing.
[Laughing]
Nightmare in a butt!
- [Trumpets]
- [Laughing]
- [Buster Barking]
- Huh?
I think I hear a guinea pig.
[Buster Continues Barking]
Listen, let's bring him in for some tests.
I guarantee you're overreacting.
[Buster Barking]
Oh, actually, no, I don't think
I'm overreacting.
- [Screaming]
- [Barking]
[Growling, Barking]
- [Trumpets]
- [Whimpers]
Sweet dreams, you little bastard.
[Cats Meowing]
[Hypnos] Dog dreams?
This is completely humiliating.
That stinkin' monkey.
I can't believe it.
We give him a body, and he sends us dogs.
Shh.
Let's not think about dogs.
Let's think about... pussycats.
Oh.
[Laughs]
Oh, what a luscious surprise.
[Laughs]
[Both Laughing]
So, I thought, "What the hell.
I'm a big celebrity now.
I can get all the chicks I want.
Why get married?"
On the other hand, if you are married, no more stinkeye.
Plus, they can't testify against you.
Testify about what?
[Phone Ringing]
- Hello.
- Julie, it's Hutch.
- Oh, Hutch. What?
- The nightmare juice... it's gone.
Somebody switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid.
Grape Kool-Aid?
But who'd wanna...
Stu, are you sure you just wanna give these away?
- It seems wrong.
- Go, go, go, go!
Stu.
Stu!
Shh. Sh-sh-sh-sh.
Here. You'll need these for your trip.
What?
And this.
Kitty, you can't do this.
You're gonna get in trouble.
You're the one true-hearted man I ever met.
You find a way back to that girl of yours, and you make her happy.
Thank you.
What about the guard?
I'll take care of that rat.
[Purring]
Okay, Stu.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Good-bye, Kitty.
- [Guard] Hey, lady, what are you...
- [Kitty Snarling]
[Kitty And Guard Fighting]
[Guard Screams, Gurgles]
- [Gasps]
- Go! Just go!
Well, thank you, Kitty.
I'll never forget you.
And I mean that.
I'll really... never forget you.
[Kitty Snarling,
Guard Screaming]
Last one.
# [Vocalizing]
What kind of idiot sneaks into the Land of Death twice?
One that likes a good stretchin'?
[Laughs]
Shut up.
I wanna hear what he has to say.
Now, Death, I know you're mad at me, and I don't blame you.
But we're both mad at DownTown, and we're both mad at your brother, Hypnos.
So now you're gonna tell me it's all his fault and you were completely innocent.
No, I'm not gonna tell you that.
I wanted that Exit Pass.
I wanted it bad enough that I had to stare you right in the face to get it.
Why?
Because I...
I got a girl up there, and I shoulda...
I-I never...
I wanna tell her that I love her.
Oh, gosh, he loves her.
That changes everything.
- Ow! Okay, uncle!
- Sit down. Sit down right now.
Down, down!
And don't say another word.
Look.
I'm a simple person.
I do an honest day's work.
Why does everybody make it so hard for me?
You're switching bodies.
You're stealing Exit Passes.
I work a long enough day as it is.
Look, you can take my soul.
I-I don't need it.
You can turn me into a paper doll.
Just, please, give me one hour.
That's it.
[Assistant]
Hey, I love my girlfriend.
Well... you're gonna need a new body.
You know...
I don't generally do this, but...
I really like your comic strip.
- Really?
- Yeah, it slays me.
Death, coming from you, that's, you know, that's... Whew!
It's nothin'. But turn around before I change my mind.
- Huh? Oh.
- Turn around.
All right, could you bend over, Stu, please?
- Huh? Bend over?
- Yeah, just bend over.
All right.
Bye-bye.
[Screaming]
Come on. Come on.
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Fresh pancreas. That oughta pay for that new Mercedes.
And preparing to detach my round-the-world cruise.
[All Screaming]
Where am I?
What's wrong with my neck?
You broke it.
You're an organ donor.
[Bones Cracking]
Those are our organs.
Get back on that slab!
I will need this body!
- So, get back!
- Hey!
- 'Cause I gotta...
- It's a bone saw!
Yeah! Aah!
Oh, look!
- Get back here with that body!
- Whoa! Oh!
- What are you doing?
- Sorry! Sorry!
That's our body!
Whoa!
- There he goes!
- Get him! Get him!

Hey, Mr. Snyder, hey!
Oh, wow.

Buster! Oh, how've you been, buddy, huh?
You been good?
You been a good dog? Huh, yeah?
What do you got here for me, huh?
What's this?
I look like an idiot.
Damn!
[Buster Barking]
Stay. Stay.
Good dog.
[Barking]
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Hey, bus, wait!
Hey! Damn!
Hey!
Hi. Sorry.
- The organs are, uh, in transit.
- There he is!
- He's on the bus!
- They're in perfect working order.
They're working even better than we expected.
So, let's see what this... particulate solution is all about.
- [Trumpets]
- Oh! Oh!
[All Laughing]
Damn, what the hell is this stuff?
[Sighs]
[Door Creaking]
Oh, man.
Oh, this is weird.
[Shuddering]
[Distant Screaming]
Come back here, you!
Oh, my God, we've got a flasher.
- Isn't that Herb?
- Must be some publicity stunt.
The clothes have turned evil!
They're working together... shirts, socks!
Whole ensembles! For God's sakes, get rid of your tie!
No, no, no,
Herb, you ding-dong.
- [Herb Screaming]
- [Policeman] Come back here. Stop!
Uh, ladies and gentlemen.
[Chuckles]
Forget about the naked man with the purple face.

Your incredible, misguided generosity... has made this a very special day for the museum.
And also a very special day for me.
All thanks to a very special lady...

Julie? Operators are standing by.
Offer expires at midnight.
Doc, don't do it!
He isn't Stu.
He's Monkeybone!
All right, let's go.
That's it.
Say, babe, what did that creep call you?
He called me "Doc."
[People Chanting] Show me the monkey!
Show me the monkey!
- Come on, fella, let's go.
- [Struggling]
Please, please!
I have to talk to this man.
Okay.
Who are you? Why did you...
Why did you say those things?
Doc, it's all a mix-up.
We were in the Land of Death, he stole my Exit Pass... and that's how Monkeybone got my body.
See, all they had left for me was this stinking corpse.
- Thank you.
- Doc.
No, don't walk away!
He's only here to give people nightmares.
Doc, the dream... don't you remember?
They were pulling the plug, and I called out to you.
And you heard me, remember?
- [Buster Barking]
- Buster?
Yeah, come here, fella.
Don't lie to me.
Is it...
Is it you?
I had to come back, Julie.
I had to give you this.
I meant to give it to you before, the night it happened.
I was happy, Julie.
I really was.
Just try to remember me like that.
Okay?
Not like this.
[Grunting, Snorting]
What's wrong?
I'm crying too.
I just don't have any tears.
I'm all dried up.
Ladies and gerbils, you know the next part.
It's 50 bucks a swat.
Who's up first?
Oh, yeah.
No, this one's on me.
[Laughs] Here's your bat, babe.
Step right up.
Just cock the bat like this.
That's good.
- It's all right.
- [Gasps, Grunts]
[All Gasp]
We have to stop this. Those dolls have been tampered with. They're toxic.
Oh, that's okay, honey.
No problem.
No.
Monkeybone?
Back in the pack.
- Stu?
- I mean it this time.
Back in the pack!
Eek! Uh...
[Chuckles]
I can explain everything.
I was tired of being a figment.
It's dirty, menial work.
It's kind of like being a pool boy.
But even pool boys have their own bodies. Don't I at least deserve a body?
Not my body!
You get back in the pack, you bastard!
[Whimpering]
Back in the pack?
With the stinky gym socks and the moldy cheese sticks?
No!
I've got the body, and I am never getting back in that goddamn pack!
[Shrieks]
Oh, no, please, they're dangerous!
No, you can't!
[Shrieks, Chittering]
Come on.
Excuse me.
What is he doing?
- He's gonna jump.
- [Cackling]
[Gasps]
I love you.
- No!
- Monkeybone!
Let go, let go, let go!
- Did you sleep with my girl?
- Sleep with her?
- We did the whole Kamasutra twice.
- Oh, yeah?
Where's her birthmark?
[Both Screaming]
Come on.
[Screaming]
- [All Screaming]
- [Screams]
Bingo!
Hey, where'd you get that body?
It's a loner, okay?
- You sprung a leak.
- [Screams]
Ooh!
I think it can be saved.
Put it on ice.
- [Chattering, Yelling]
- Don't move. I'm coming at ya!
- [Screaming] Damn it!
- [Grunts]
- Whoa!
- I'll take that, young man.
Here, have another.
I'm dead.
No, stop!
That's ours!
- Thanks.
- That's mine!
- Ha ha!
- Ha ha!
[Screaming]
Come on, Monkeybone, let's do it!
Manoamano!
Hey, Stu, I got an idea... joint custody.
- I get the body on weekends, you get...
- Shut up!
I think
I can bring 'em down.

Hey! Hey, whoo!

- [Stu] Death!
Stu! You think I gilded the lily a little?
I do like to dress up when I come downtown.
So, how was she?
She, uh...
She was beautiful.
Ofcourse, I was decomposing at the time, but at least now she knows how much I love her.
So, I guess I'm yours.
Uh, excuse me, Death.
[Chuckles]
I hate to break up this little lovefest, but my little bladder is about to burst.
[Screams]
But I really gotta go!
[Groaning]
Hey, where... where's Monkeybone?
Back in your head where he belongs.
Stu, I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but on your own, you're a tad vanilla, so I didn't want to send you back without him.
What back? D-Did you...
You're sending me back?
- Yeah, I'm sending you back.
- Thank you, Death.
I like you. I'll take the South Park guys instead.
I hear they're dying to meet me. [Laughs]
Come on, Stu, come on.
Turn around.
- So, I should assume the...
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Stu? A little higher.
- Yeah.
Oh.
- See ya!

[Razor Buzzing]
Excuse me, that's our corpse.
We've been chasing it all over town.
Help yourself, pal.
All right, smart-ass, you prepared to cooperate now?

- [All] Whoa!
[Gasps]
Huh?
Uh, buddy, could I borrow your um...
- [Whimpering]
- Thank you.
[Buster Whimpering]
[Barking]
Hey, buddy.
How are you, huh?
[Laughing]
How are you?
Is it you?
Is it really you this time?
People, for the love of God, take off your clothes!
Take off your clothes!

- I'm gettin' somethin' on the sonar!
- What is it?
Strong reading from underneath the cap rock, sir!
- Possible oil flow?
- Still analysing.
It's, uh...
Sounds like, uh...
Tiny hammers.
Let's go skating!
- They're coming right at us!
- Take us to Elfcon three!
Take us to Elfcon three.
These guys aren't stopping.
- Take us to Elfcon two!
- Let's go to Elfcon two.
We have a partridge in a pear tree.
You take us to Elfcon one.
Let's rig for silent running.
- Look alive, everybody!
- OK, we're at Elfcon one.
- I lost it!
- What do you mean, you lost it?
Wait!
What the...?
Uh...
Sir, you're gonna want to hear this.
[Smokey Robinson sings]
## You better watch out
## You better not cry
## You better not pout and I'm telling you why
Find out where that music's coming from.
Santa, I've got her on the locator.
## He knows when you are sleeping
## He knows when you're awake
## He knows if you've been bad or good
## So be good for goodness'...
## Yeah, yeah, yeah
## You better watch out
## You better not cry
## You better not pout
## And I'm telling you why
## Santa Claus is coming to tow-...
- What now?
- It's just gone.
In the middle of the chorus!
Nobody needs to know about this.
Maybe we should mention the
Smokey Robinson thing, sir.
We're at
Elfcon four. All clear.
Curtis, what do you say we get you headphones this Christmas?
It's all right, everybody.
Let's get back to work.
Curtis, you're 900 years old.
Grow up!
Bernard.
You know I didn't break any of the rules - according to The Santa Handbook.
The handbook! Curtis, do you go pee-pee with that thing?
It says elves are encouraged to listen to music.
It makes them more creative, more productive and more alert.
Look out!
Aagghh!
- It's OK.
- Let's go!
Is he all right?
Wow! That's gonna leave a mark.
Oof!
Is that Blitzen?
Looks like Prancer.
- Who is that?
- It was Chet.
- A reindeer in training.
- Oh.
Hmph!
Well, please tell me that it's early in his training.
Wow! Nice fall.
Curtis, when are you gonna tell him?
Not now!
It's so cold up here.
How can you not be freezing?
You have not seen cold till you see where my dad lives. It's...
Don't be embarrassed.
My parents are divorced.
- No big deal.
- I'm not embarrassed.
- Why don't you talk about your dad?
- He doesn't like me to.
- It's complicated.
- Is he a spy?
No, he...
He works with toys and these...
Iittle people. Kids.
Can we just do what we came here to do?
Sure.
All right.
Charlie, this is really dangerous.
Someone could catch us at any moment.
Kinda exciting.
Well, you know, Danielle, I may not come out of this alive.
So, in case we don't see each other again...
Aagghh!
Are you OK?
Oof!
[## Danger Danger:
Naughty Naughty Christmas]
- Almost done.
- OK. I'm not leaving.
## I've been a naughty boy
## I didn't get a toy
## Santa Claus left nothing underneath my tree
## He knows that I've been bad
## But being good just ain't my bag...
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, Principal Newman.
OK, try it now.
OK, all right.
Here's what we need.
Get one more bolt on that flange and it's ready for Christmas.
Good work, guys. Whew!
Perfect job on suspension, you guys.
Thinkin' outside the box.
I love it.
- Do you want a cookie, Santa?
- Do I want a cookie?
Yes! What's fresh?
Oooh!
Sweet, just like you.
Alexander, let's think.
Take the hat off.
Too much counterweight.
Thanks, Santa. You're the man.
That's why they give me the big belly, so I don't fall over!
Hey, Joey! How's that static-free-tinsel coming?
Hey, guys, Santa wants to see the new tinsel.
I could come up there and take care of this the ugly way.
Or... we go outside and play some football.
Curtis, you need to tell him right now!
I don't know.
He's so happy right now.
And why do I have to be the one to tell him?!
Because I'm the head elf.
I don't give bad news.
It's one of the perks of my seniority.
Now, tell him!
Come on, pork chop. Bring it on.
Who you callin' pork chop, meatloaf?
Meatloaf?!
You wanna talk some trash?
I'll talk trash with ya.
- But first, I'm gonna blitz.
- Ready, set!
- I'm comin' after you, buddy.
- Seven swans a-swimming!
Six geese a-laying!
Five golden rings!
Hike!
Hey, who's got the ball?
I can see it. Let go of me.
He's too quick! He spins!
He moves! He's on the way!
And he might go all the... way!
Rumblin', stumblin', bumblin'!
Oh, they pile on!
OK, you win!
You guys aren't elves.
You're wizards!
No matter how many times you run that play I never see it comin'.
Santa? We need to talk.
- That's weird, isn't it?
- Uh-oh!
- These fit yesterday.
- Hot cocoa for you.
This is not a good time, Abby.
I sent Dasher down for some Brazilian cocoa beans.
- What's the bad news?
- What do you mean?
Whenever you play the designer bean card, you have bad news.
What are you doing with the naughty-and-nice list?
Don't shoot the messenger.
- It's... Charlie.
- Sheen?
- I thought he straightened out.
- Not that Charlie.
My Charlie. My son Charlie?
He's on the naughty list?
- There's gotta be a mistake.
- We don't make mistakes.
I'm sorry, Santa.
Please excuse me.
How could this happen? Is this what you were trying to tell me?
Great! You told him! Let's get you dressed for that meeting.
I can't have the meeting here.
I'm gonna have to see Charlie.
- Number two, tell him now.
- Tell me what, guys? Come clean.
- Santa, there's a clause.
- That would be me.
No, I mean there's another
Santa clause.
Curtis, in case you haven't noticed - this time of year, the malls are filled with other "Santa Clauses".
Yes, but there's another
Santa clause.
There was a first clause, but also a second clause.
Get on with it!
When the last Santa fell off your roof and you put on his coat, you found this.
Right. "He who wears the coat takes on the responsibilities of Santa Claus."
And the rest would be history, right?
But it seems our number two elf, the keeper of the handbook, overlooked the single most important detail in the history of Christmas!
Wow! One mistake in 900 years.
Look.
- I can't see that.
- Better now?
- Or now?
- Well...
- Better now?
- It's gettin' there.
- Or now?
- I can't see anything.
I see. Good, good, good.
I see it. OK.
"The card holder acknowledges a woman of his choosing..."
"True love... Not valid in the state of Utah..."
"Holy... matrimony?!"
- I gotta get married!
- Yes.
It's... the Mrs clause.
["Here Comes The Bride"]
What if I don't want to get married?
Oh, dear. The de-Santification process has begun!
The de-Santification?
Are you telling me that clause says if I don't get married...
I don't get to be
Santa any more?
Wh-... what about the kids?
What about the elves?
- What about you guys?
- It's not completely hopeless.
You still have time to find a wife.
- How much time do I have?
- 28 days.
28 days? So I've gotta... find a wife by Christmas.
Actually, Christmas Eve.
- I guess it's over.
- No! You can't think that way!
Please, don't give up hope.
Cos if you do, then we have to.
- Whoa!
Christmas is getting very complicated.
Santa?
Santa?
- Are you with us?
- I'm sorry, yes. Yes, I am.
Well, on behalf of Father Time and the Council of Legendary Figures,
I'd like to thank you for being such a gracious host.
- Hear, hear.
- What a lovely place.
Without further ado, let us convene the year-end conference.
- Tooth Fairy.
- Thank you, Mother Nature.
Fellow Council members,
I'd like to again propose a new name for myself.
- Oh, please!
- Good heavens!
In the past, you have rejected
Tooth Man, Tooth Guy and Tooth.
- Because they stunk.
- Today, I'd like to submit...
- Captain Floss.
- Nice!
- Plaque Man.
- And Roy.
- Roy! No.
No kid's gonna put a tooth under a pillow for a man named Roy.
This from someone in a diaper who shoots people's butts!
Wait a minute. I got it.
I got it. I got it.
Now, how about this?
The Molarnator.
The Molarnator! I like it.
Thank you, Santa. Can we vote now on the Molarnator?
All in favour of a name change for Tooth Fairy?
All right. And all opposed?
Easter Bunny?
- Sandman?
- Wha-...?
What happened?
Was I asleep again?
Name change for the Tooth Fairy.
Yes or no?
No. I'm sorry.
All right. Next item on the agenda. Santa? Status report.
OK. First, welcome to the North
Pole. Great to have you here.
This is our big time of year, so things are busy as usual.
There's a little speed bump in the road this year.
- You all know Charlie.
- I love Charlie!
- Great kid.
- Good boy.
- Sweet kid.
- Good teeth.
Well, Charlie... got himself on the naughty list.
- What?!
- Oh, my!
I'm struggling with the timing, cos it's...
I gotta be up here and I've also got to take care of Charlie...
That's every parent's dilemma: how to balance work and children.
Most people lose sleep over that.
Tell me about it! I have 33,000 offspring. All in private school.
Well, to top it off... I have to get married by Christmas Eve.
- What?!
- Otherwise I stop being Santa.
- What?!
- No!
The de-Santification process has already begun.
Wait a minute.
You do look thinner, and...
- Your beard is shorter! Right?
- You're right!
Apparently, it's called the Mrs clause.
Don't mess with me, Santa.
I'm pre-El Nino.
No, I'm not messing with anybody. What I'm saying is...
I have to find a wife in...
27 days, 20 hours and 1 7 minutes.
- Wow!
- It's what I do.
Wait a minute. Cupid!
Cupid, come over here.
- What do you need?
- Shoot me with a dart.
- Then I'll fall in love.
- First of all, they're arrows.
Second of all, no can do.
- Why not?
- Arrows have no effect on us.
If they did, I would have shot myself, met a nice girl,
Ieft the business years ago.
- Enough with the questions.
- You can't stop being Santa.
I don't want to.
Kids are 86 per cent happier since you've taken the job.
- He's right.
- This is all I want to do.
But what am I gonna do?
Well, you...
You can't be two places at once.
Maybe you can be.
OK, everyone, can I get the room for a minute? Thank you.
Can I just...? One minute.
Take a cocoa break.
Have a nice long break.
Relax, everyone.
I want to show Santa some improvements on the pantograph. Thanks.
Walk with me. I've tripled the RAM and reconfigured the circuitry.
I see you've externalised the power source to make better use of the electromagnetic energy.
No, it's just there cos it looks really cool.
Yeah, it does.
Wait a minute.
You tripled the RAM.
I see where this is going. I am not getting in that machine.
Besides, creating a copy of
Santa won't solve our problems.
- The elves'll know.
- But this would be a special toy!
- How's that, Curtis?
- I added a fuzzy logic circuit.
The duplicate will look and think just like you.
When you're with your family, dealing with Charlie, looking for a wife...
The toy will be up here melting in front of my fireplace.
No, the toy Santa will be dealing with business up here.
I can deal with business up here.
Santa, if the elves find out we've made a switch... Aaggh!
No! No!
This machine is not the answer.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You! You! Shoo!
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look, you can't get much better than that.
And I promise - it won't hurt a bit.
- I'm goin' in.
- I can't watch this!
Ow! Ow!
It's perfect!
That's because it's me,
Einstein.
- Santa, are you all right?
- Yeah, I got a shock in there.
Is there supposed to be a shock?
Aagghh!
It's naked!
Throw something over it.
- It's incredible!
- Yes, it is.
Can he talk?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho... ho!
- Not bad.
- Not bad yourself.
I can't put my finger on it, but there's something about you that I like.
There's something about you that I like!
- Watch him. I'll be right back.
- He's coming right back.
Ha-ha-ha!
- Bernard, I need your help.
- What do you mean?
What I mean is
I gotta go see Charlie and I want you to convince the elves... that... toy Santa is me.
- Hm. Have you seen that thing?
- I've seen it.
Keep the elves at a distance and say that I've changed my look, it'll work.
Santa, we're in way over our heads here.
If anybody can do this, it's you, number one.
I... I'm not gonna lie to all the elves.
I myself think he looks absolutely terrific!
Better and fresher somehow than he has in years.
There's now a more supple veneer to his skin and an added lustre to the thickness of his hair.
You could almost say there's a... a toy-like quality to him.
Most importantly, he's very happy with his new look, and I would caution you all not to point or stare or use the word "plastic".
OK? OK.
Thank you. That's all.
Back to work, please.
Comet, because I don't want to take Prancer.
I want to take a trip with you.
When's the last time we had a cruise?
I love you, buddy.
Besides, Prancer had too many apples. We know what that means.
Before you go, take a look at your watch.
Hey! Can't go anywhere without that.
- I've done some work on it.
- It's beautiful. It really is.
- You like it?
- The workmanship's fabulous.
It has a power reserve that measures how much magic you have left.
- It's at ten.
- That should be enough.
But if you use up any magic for any reason the level drops.
Santa, if it gets to zero - you won't be able to return to the Pole.
Uh-oh.
Then let's not let it get to zero!
- Now, look at me.
- Mm-hm?
What's the most important thing?
For you not to touch Santa?
For you to come back!
Thank you.
Comet, please just chill out a little bit, OK?
Come on! It's not like we're pullin' the sleigh. Right?
There's no packages.
It's one stop.
And I think I might have forgot we're gonna go see Charlie.
Scott! Hey!
You trimmed your beard.
Yeah.
Come here, big guy.
Whoa! Lost some weight there, huh?
- Slim-Fast?
- You don't know how fast.
- We should get going.
- Oh, OK.
How do you always know when there's a problem?
I see you when you're sleepin'.
I know when you're awake.
Which is a pretty frightening concept when you think about it.
We're really worried about Charlie.
He keeps upping the ante. This time he defaced school property.
- It's classic acting out.
- I'm blaming myself for this.
- We're both his parents.
- Where is he?
He's waiting for us in Principal Newman's office.
Something about her makes me want to deface public property.
Hello, Mr Calvin. Laura, Neil.
- Miss Newman.
- Principal Newman.
Haven't seen you since the last time Charlie was in trouble.
I've been travelling for work.
If you spent more time with your son there'd be fewer problems.
Then I wouldn't spend so much time with you, which is always such a pleasure.
A battle of wits. It's a shame you come unarmed. Excuse me.
Ouch!
Good morning, Principal Newman.
Mr Picardo, I want you to look into my eyes. What do you see?
It's dark. And it's cold.
It's your future, Mr Picardo - keep this up and you will spend your life stabbing trash.
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes.
- So what are you gonna do?
- I'm going to geometry.
Have a nice trip.
It's an affront to authority and blatant disrespect for property.
If this continues I'll have no other recourse than to suspend..
Excuse me. Is there a rest stop between here and the end of the lecture?
I'm more interested in why this happened in the first place.
So am l. Charlie, we're all worried about you.
It feels like you're trying to get someone's attention.
What's bothering you?
- Dr Miller?
- Neil.
- Neil, any theories?
- Well, frankly I have several.
Here we go.
Let's just order a pizza.
Scott, you're not helping.
I was listening to a tape series on child development last night.
You know what the problem is?
Excuse me, Neil.
It's four weeks until Christmas.
- That's a holiday in December.
- Oh.
Have you noticed the hallways?
Not a decoration, not a twinkle light, not an expression of the joy kids are supposed to be feeling.
- What kind of school is this?
- A public school.
A top-rated public school.
That takes effort. And money.
Spending any of that money on holiday decorations would take away from the things that truly matter.
Forgive me, but I think holiday cheer really matters.
What are we going to do?
We are worried...
Let me handle this. You know what you did is wrong. Right?
- I guess so.
- There's no guessing.
Guessing is gone.
It was wrong what you did.
And you're not gonna do it again. Promise me.
- OK.
- There you go.
He won't do it again.
Meeting is adjourned.
It most certainly is not!
Charlie...
You know what else?
Here's a little donation.
Why don't you buy yourself a wreath?
I am Santa Claus.
Boo!
Yeah. No, no,
I think that this is gonna work.
Good... Good job, Curtis.
Would it kill you to give a wholehearted compliment?
Ho, ho, ho.
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Santa?
- I need you to look at this.
- All right!
Nice!
No. I mean,
I need you to read it.
Well, let's try to be specific, shall we?
Ha-ha!
I'll take a look at it over at my desk.
- How does he know where it is?
- I programmed him that way.
He has most of Santa's memories.
OK, we need you to study everything that's in that book because it is the key to being Santa.
Right! I'll memorise everything in the book.
I'll follow all the rules.
Cos rules are very important!
- I like this guy.
- I can barely read this.
Hi, Santa.
Uh...
- Hi.
- Oh. You look...
Like he got a good night's sleep.
Like you got a very good night's sleep.
How about a nice chocolatey cocoa?
- Careful, it's hot.
- Of course it is.
Aagh!
Whoo!
That's delicious! I like cocoa!
Cocoa's superior refreshment!
Get me some more cocoa!
Whoo!
Right away, Santa.
Ho, whoa!
I think Santa feels a little buzz!
Whoooo!
Let me get this straight.
You were de-Santified?
And you only have 27 days to find a wife or you're out?
Yeah.
What are you gonna do?
We dated for three years before you got up the courage to propose.
That's a pretty serious commitment issue, isn't it?
Yes, Sigmund. I was afraid
I'd mess up the first time.
- I'm more afraid now.
- Dad, you can't give up.
There's never been a better Santa.
I appreciate that.
It's for the best. If l had spent more time with you, you'd spend less time in the spray paint industry.
Don't do that to yourself.
You have been a great dad.
And being Santa has made you an even better man.
I'm gonna go out on an emotional limb.
Don't try to make me cry.
Believe it or not, you have a great capacity for love.
I know you can find someone wonderful to spend the rest of your life with.
Don't let the facts that you have no time, no prospects and a paralysing fear of intimacy get you down.
Hm.
Have you ever helped anyone? Ever?
You know what I'm gonna do? I am gonna look through my phone book and see who's still single out there and not too bitter.
There's divorced moms at school who'll go out with anybody.
As promising as this sounds,
I don't need help with this area.
Your old man was a high-school legend. A double letterman.
I had a Mustang.
So as far as dating goes,
I think if anybody can stir up the old mojo it would be moi.
Come on! I don't think there's a woman out there that doesn't want a piece of this.
- Hi, Mom!
- Lucy!
- Uncle Scott!
- How's my little sweet pea?
Ohh! I haven't seen you in a long time.
- Tell me what's been happenin'.
- I learned to swim underwater.
- And I'm not afraid!
- That's amazing!
Maybe we'll have to go to the mall and... get some ice cream.
- Plenty of women at the mall.
- Charlie...!
Santa, look forward and put on a smiley face.
- Say hello to your elves.
- Ho, ho, ho!
You're doing a wonderful job!
Santa, when you said the bigger wheels, is this what you meant?
Ho, ho, ho!
You're doing a wonderful job!
You're doing great.
Dial it down on the ho-ho-ho's, but otherwise you're gold.
Ho, ho ho!
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Why don't you just say it? "You were right, Curtis. I was wrong."
OK, OK, I admit it.
They're happy.
They're working hard.
Everything's going to be fine.
This book is very interesting reading.
There's a lot of rules they're not following.
That's what I've been saying all along.
Things have gotten a little too sloppy around here.
Yes! Sloppiness means mistakes.
Mistakes aren't a good thing!
I might have to make some changes here.
- What do you have in mind?
- Let me show you.
There's many things.
Look here...
Neil, are you sure you don't have any other clothes I can borrow?
I mean, the idea tonight is to attract a woman.
- What are you talking about?
- I look like a limesicle.
I think it makes you look hot.
What do you think, Laura?
Honestly, what do you think?
Doesn't he look hot, Laura?
I think it's what's inside that really counts.
- Thought you liked the sweater.
- We'll talk later.
I'm off.
I may need to borrow a car.
I'm parked behind Neil. The minivan - I just had it washed.
The minivan.
OK, then. Well, wish me luck.
I got a needlepoint sweater, and a minivan...
See ya in about eight minutes.
Scott? Hey.
- Tracy!
- Yes!
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Here, why don't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
So, I'm so glad we finally got to do this.
- I'm pretty nervous.
- Oh, are you?
Laura says we have a lot in common.
I hear that you love this time of year also?
It's my favourite time of year and my busiest time of year.
- Whoa, look at the sweater!
- Yeah!
Some sweater.
Like I should talk!
I also have my Christmas charm bracelet.
- That's beautiful. Look at 'em!
- Yeah.
I wear it all year long just to keep the spirit alive.
That's gorgeous. A little teddy bear and packages. That's very nice.
- So what work do you do?
- I'm in the toy business.
- No way!
- Way!
- That sounds so creative.
- I love it.
- I love creative people.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
So what do you do?
I'm hoping someday to break into the music business.
- As a singer-songwriter.
- No way!
Way!
- What's your favourite music?
- Country-western.
- Ohh!
- Yeah.
- Do you like Shania Twain?
- Yeah!
## The best thing about singing at Christmas
## Is the cocoa, carolling and fun
- You know that one?
- I know that song.
## Go totally yuletide
- ## Takin' a sleigh ride
- You're good.
## Santa shirts, reindeer skirts
## Whoah-oh-oh!
- Hey!
## Watchin' the windows fog, drinkin' some eggnog
- That's good.
- ## Whoah-oh-oh!
## Fill up a stocking
## Spray on some flocking
Put up a tree!
Sports on TV!
## Uh, whoah-oh-oh
## I want to be free, yeah to feel the way I feel
## Ah, ah, ah, ah
Man!
## I feel like some Christmas
## Oh-oh, wow wow wow! ##
Whew!
You hated it?
It kind of scared me a little bit.
No, I just. I...
I just... I wasn't prepared for a performance, so if l...
I put myself out and that was not an easy thing to do.
If you can't support a woman's ambition, then I don't think there's any reason to continue this date.
- Dad?
- Hey, sport.
How'd it go?
Well...
Let's just say
I'm not bookin' a church yet.
Boy, I'll tell ya, women are hard to figure out.
- Tell me about it.
- You too, huh? Girl trouble?
Well, there's this one girl.
We just used to be friends and hang out at the mall and stuff.
Then one day I looked at her and I got this weird feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I started worrying about what to wear and what my hair looked like...
And then I wanted to kiss her.
How did she do that?
I don't know.
But they all can do that.
Oh, look at that.
The snow globe!
This is so beautiful. I remember when Bernard gave this to you.
He said all I have to do to see you is shake it.
Uh-huh.
Now, all you have to do is yell down the hall.
And I'm there whenever you need me.
Yeah.
I'm a little tired, Dad.
I'll see you in the morning.
OK.
- Good night.
- Night.
Can you turn the light off, please?
Yeah, cos it's such a big reach for you!
What do you mean it's not straight?
- Sure it's straight.
- Uh-uh.
- Maybe your head's crooked.
- Prancer's not this picky.
- Yes, he is.
- Hi, Comet.
- Hi!
I've got something for you.
Hey, Lucy, what have you got there?
Careful with the sweets.
He tends to overeat.
Uncle Scott, are you Santa Claus?
What? Why would you ask me something like that?
Cos you have a reindeer, and only Santa has reindeer.
Nonsense.
A lot of people have reindeer.
Name five.
Well... most of them live in Finland.
I can't pronounce their names.
Besides, reindeer are too stupid to make good pets.
Well, I think you're very smart.
Well, I think he's learning at an excellent rate.
Oh, really? This morning he ate a bowl of waxed fruit.
Wait a minute.
I need the naughty-and-nice list.
No.
It says I'm supposed to check it twice.
- Santa already checked it.
- No, I didn't.
- The real Santa.
- I am the real Santa!
- I'm sorry?
- I'm in charge here.
- What?
- I check the list twice.
That's the rule.
I like the rules.
- You know how I feel.
- You're misunderstanding.
No, I'm the rule-maker. I like the rules. Santa likes rules.
I've got a good idea.
How about we have some fun?
Huh?
- It's good to have fun.
- Right.
Santa, look over there.
See those elves?
Go ahead.
Go play some tinsel football.
Break!
- What's the object of tinsel football?
- Come on down.
If you don't have the ball, get it.
If you have the ball, run to the end zone.
OK, I'll go get the football.
Ready, hike!
I've got the ball. What are you gonna do? Who's gonna stop me?
Come on!
This is a lot of fun!
Oh, so sorry!
Come here! Stop! Slow down when I'm talking to you!
Come here, you! Come on.
He's headed east toward the main entrance!
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, Principal Newman.
Are Laura and Neil on their way?
No, I volunteered to go solo.
Oh. You look...
You've lost weight.
Feeling all right?
I was until I got this phone call.
Charlie, you promised you weren't gonna do this again.
What's the matter with you?
I'm gonna have to punish ya.
I'll ground him for... two months.
- I thought you were on my side!
- I'll go one better.
- You're suspended.
- But... Dad!
I'm as upset about this as you, but isn't there a punishment that doesn't mean takin' him out of school?
- What did you have in mind?
- We could...
Uh... ah...
Community service?
Huh.
That's not a bad idea.
OK, Charlie. I want you to start by cleaning up this wall.
I want everything off of there by tonight.
And then clean off every mark off every locker in this hallway.
- Every one?!
- Do as she says, Charlie.
But I have homework, tests to study for.
Not my problem. I have a detention group on Saturday.
So we will all get together at the rec centre and scrape off graffiti at 8am.
- See you both there.
- You say both of us?
No, l... I'm very busy. I do a lot of other community service.
That's good. You just got yourself elected parent rep.
And, Charlie...
We'll talk about the suspension.
Curtis, what is he doing in the naughty-and-nice centre?
- What's going on?
- I'm checking the naughty-nice list.
- I'm checking it twice.
- I already told you!
It's been checked. Don't worry.
I do worry.
There's a lot of mistakes.
I'll give you a big fat for instance!
In Denmark, there's a guy named Sven Halstrom right here.
He's a Dane. He was wiping his nose on his sister's shirt.
Yuk! That's not very nice!
And yet he's on the nice list.
We try to cut most children slack this time of year.
I don't understand that!
Kids are misbehaving everywhere.
They're running with scissors.
They're sticky.
"I'm not gonna stop this car!"
"No, we're not there yet!"
"Brush your teeth!"
"Pick up those clothes!"
It goes on and on.
But they're just kids!
Everybody misbehaves some time.
But according to
The Santa Handbook, naughty kids get lumps of coal in their stockings. Right?
We will make stockings.
In my opinion, they should all get coal in their stockings.
- Don't you?
- No! That's not how it works!
Get me the naughty-nice list.
Get me every list!
Get me everything.
[## Unwritten Law:
Unwritten Christmas]
Mr O'Reilly, Mr Leary.
You in charge of the gangbangers?
They're students, actually, and yes.
Keep 'em away from the car.
It's new.
I don't need some delinquent kids scratchin' it up.
They're not delinquents.
And don't worry about your car.
I'd worry about your legs in those shorts.
I thought only swimmers shaved their legs!
Whoa, good one!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Brought you coffee.
- Thank you.
- So you have a nice-guy side.
- I'm a man of many sides.
I'm a puzzle.
I'm a Rubik's Cube with pants.
- A laugh! Actual laugh.
- Dad, it doesn't come off.
- It's not supposed to come off.
Hence you've got to be careful where you put it.
Hence tagging is serious.
Hence your presence here.
Don't say "hence" any more, Dad.
It's really annoying.
Nicely done!
How do you do it? I have trouble with one. You have hundreds.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I was really good this year.
Is that so? Are you absolutely sure about that, Pamela?
I want a doll house and a swimming pool.
A swimming pool?
I'm sorry. She insisted on talking to you.
- It's not a problem.
- OK.
I'll tell you what. If you can promise me you'll be good,
I can guarantee you'll have a great Christmas.
- OK! Yeah!
- Come on.
Kids get so nutty this time of year.
- Is she a neighbour?
- No.
Oh. How did you know her name?
Oh, the... necklace, it said Pamela on it.
Oh, I guess I missed that. I'm gonna go check on this group.
You cost me, Pamela.
I just couldn't sleep thinking about all those rules.
Am I wrong? Am I right?
Does it matter?
Couldn't have been the three gallons of cocoa I had!
But you understand rules, don't you? You're highly decorated.
And look at that face.
There you go.
There's a face only a mom would like.
I don't have a mom, so I wouldn't know about that.
Now, it's time for the big event.
Guess what?
Son, it's show time!
You're in the spotlight.
Get bigger with it.
It's your big chance.
I need a little help.
I need a little muscle.
I need a little nudge.
Let's call yourself the little nudge!
This won't hurt - except for the electric shock through you.
See ya on the other side!
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi. Uh...
It looks like you're going out.
- Sorry. I should have called.
- No, it's OK. Come in.
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.
- Is there a problem?
- No, no. I just...
I wondered if, um...
If you would...
Do you want to go get some noodles?
Or pie?
But I don't want to keep you from your date, so...
Oh, it's not a date. It's the faculty Christmas party.
Is that your idea of a night on the town?
Noodles and pie?
- Yes. What would be your idea?
- Pizza and a movie.
- Thick or thin crust?
- Thin.
Good! Movie?
Two For The Road.
Audrey Hepburn, Albert Finney.
Movie's OK, but the car was the star. '53 MGTD.
Racing green, wire wheels...
Beautiful.
I'm impressed. That is a great car. My favourite car.
Didn't like driving 'em in the rain.
You have to push it to start it.
Other than that it's perfect.
It's perfect, though.
- I could drive you to your party.
- That would be great.
Except for, eventually,
I'm going to have to get home.
Well, l... I could pick you up.
So you're going to drop me off, then come back and pick me up?
- Yeah.
- Why don't you just stay?
- All right, I'll stay.
- I'll get my coat.
So, Mr Andretti, what are you driving?
You know...
I think you're gonna like it.
Mind if I ask you something personal?
Please.
- You look really different.
- The weight.
It's lndian teas and it's a lot of salves and stuff. It's...
- Do you want some cocoa?
- Uh, yes.
Cocoa.
You have thought of everything.
Well, this time of year, l... I really shine.
Yeah, I can't wait till it's over, though.
Streets are crowded, the malls are jammed, people max out their credit cards...
It's noisy.
When did you become such a cynic?
Oh. I don't know.
I used to love Christmas, too.
It was the only day that my parents didn't fight.
- Oh.
- Oh.
They were at each other all the time.
But on Christmas, they tried to make the holiday special.
My dad went through this charade so I'd believe in Santa Claus.
He put a cot by the fireplace so Santa could take a nap...
Like he has time to take a nap!
Consider the amount of gifts he would have to... deliver.
Why would he nap? He would probably need some coffee.
Yeah. And there was cocoa and cookies.
And carrots for the reindeer.
That's a good gesture.
The reindeer love carrots.
And the thought is important to them, too.
Yeah. And I'd wake up and the cocoa and cookies would be gone and the cot would be mussed and the carrots gnawed.
They swallow them. If they're fresh they'll eat 'em like that.
They love red bell peppers, too.
You know the stories.
If you read...
And there would be incredible presents under the tree.
One year was a rocking horse, and I named it Harvey.
And the next year was a little red wagon, which I made a lemonade stand, which was great.
And the last year was...
It was just... a Baby Doll. She was pink and soft and beautiful.
- Beautiful?
- Yes.
I believed in Santa so much
I'd get in fights at school with kids who tried to tell me that he didn't exist.
And one day
I came home with a bloody nose.
That's when my parents decided to tell me to... grow up.
I was devastated, and...
Good, Carol! This is great sleigh-riding conversation!
- I'm a terrible sleigh con-..
- It's fine conversation.
A person just wants something to believe in, you know?
Yes, I know. Yes, I know.
OK, we have cocoa.
We have a blanket.
We have a horse-drawn sleigh.
The only thing that's...
- What?
- It's snowing.
- Oh.
As if by magic?
That's what I was gonna say, that it should be snowing!

I owe you one.
It's a great party.
Look. That guy moved.
- Would you excuse me?
- Mm-hm.
Could I have your attention?
Your attention, please!
There we go. Hi. I'm Scott Calvin and
I just thought I'd step up here and... and say the word that we've all been longing to hear.
Fire!
OK. What I think, folks, is that a lot of you have forgotten what the true spirit of Christmas is all about.
Mm?
If you're not willing to dance or laugh or flirt or risk the buffet, I don't think we have much choice.
So before the choir gets out here I say we rock this house with a secret Santa! Huh?
Carol - happy, happy Christmas!
I think they're just decorations for the carollers.
She's afraid these are decorations for the carolling.
I think Carol is right about the carolling!
I'm talking about the packages that are backstage.
There aren't any packages backstage.
Ohh! There's none back there.
So I was mistaken when I saw this bag of gifts.
Maybe I'm wrong, but it sure looks like a bag of gifts.
Ohh! It's heavy like a bag of gifts.
Look at this! What's in here?
It's very heavy, very heavy.
John Pierce.
Doesn't your mom call you JJ?
Merry Christmas, JJ.
No way.
This is Toss Across!
I used to love this when I was a kid!
But I never told anybody.
Where did...? Who did this?
Grace Kim.
Yes, there you are!
Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.
- Tom Astle.
- Me! Sorry, Gordon.
- Hey!
- Haven't changed a bit!
- Gee, thanks.
- Lizzy Garcia.
- Here.
- There. Merry Christmas.
- Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots!

This is incredible!

- Here!
There she is. Katie. Jerry.

- Carl, you need a net.
- Not me!
This is great.
Hey, party animal, you want to play?
- I can't figure it out.
- It's beanbag tic-tac-toe.
No, I mean the secret Santa thing.
Someone tracked down all those wonderful antique toys.
Probably someone who knows his way around eBay.
- Yeah.
- Yep.
It was you. I know it was you.
I just can't figure out...
How did you do it?
Sometimes you don't need to know all the answers.
Speaking of which...
Even the principal needs a Christmas gift.
Merry Christmas.
Come on, open it. Rip it open.
Come on.
We're not gonna save the paper.
It's Baby Doll.
Come here.
- Did you call the office?
- No.
- Did they call you?
- It's not like that.
- Did you investigate us?
- No, I wouldn't do that.
Did you...? I told you about
Baby Doll an hour ago, and...
Did you send someone to...?
- No.
- No.
Well... I don't know how you did it.
It's like some kind of magic.
Yeah, sort of like some kind of magic.
And... and pretty much the last that I have.
What? Well, what...?
You know what?
I don't want to know.
What you did in there tonight for everyone was wonderful.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.
- Is that OK?
- Yeah.
Got this weird feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I'm, um...
I'm not... real good at this.
Where did that come from?
I don't know.
Hi! Merry Christmas!
Ho, ho, ho!
Can I have your attention?
Stop the work, please.
Everybody stop the work.
- Merry Christmas!
That's nice. I have a little announcement to make.
From this moment forward, we're not gonna make any more toys.
The children of the world don't deserve presents.
They're running rampant with naughtiness.
This Christmas we're gonna give those greedy kids exactly what they deserve.
A beautiful, high-quality yet low-sulphur variety of coal!
Quiet!
We have to focus, all of us, on the goals ahead.
And just to make sure that that happens...
Thank you, sweetie.
I... I hate to blow my own horn.
Stay where you are!
Don't be afraid!
Back! Back!
I was up late, couldn't sleep.
Milk wouldn't do it, cocoa is a little sweet, so I decided to make an army of toy soldiers.
They don't have a good sense of humour like me.
I would do what they ask you.
Which is what I'm going to tell you!
Don't listen to him!
This guy's not Santa!
- He's not Santa?
- He's a toy!
He has a rubber face and a plastic tushy!
Trust me!
Don't let him ruin Christmas!
Thank you for those kind words, Bernard!
Well, now that we all have an understanding, have a joyous and merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
OK, ready? Go!
This is what I call community service!
Here she comes. Duck down!
Hey!
Attention you hooligans behind that snow bank!
You have snowballed the wrong house.
Drop the snowballs, kick them away from the snow suits and keep the mittens where I can see them.
Your dad is hanging with
Principal Newman?
- Is he dating her?
- No.
Go to your homes.
Uh... pelt the ones you love.
- And a merry Christmas!
- That is really gross, man.
- Shut up.
There are things about me you should know. Personal things.
We don't need to rush things, Scott.
I think you need to know these things.
OK.
Um...
Remember the mistletoe, how it just showed up?
- Yes.
- And the sleigh.
- How magical that was?
- Yes.
Secret Santa Claus?
- That was me.
- Yeah?
I'm not this size much. I'm usually much bigger than this.
So am I sometimes.
I have a big white beard that's beautiful.
- I don't.
- I work a long way from home.
When I get back home,
I sleep for a long time.
See? OK.
It's not so bad so far.
You work far away from home and you sleep a lot.
You've never been to prison and you don't wear socks with sandals.
Well...
I'm Santa Claus.
What?
The suit, the red suit's real.
The North Pole is a place.
There are elves. They make toys.
They're beautiful and it's real.
- I exist.
- That's not funny.
- It's magical.
- Cut it out.
I'm telling the truth.
I told you something personal from my childhood and now you're making a joke out of it and it's not funny. It hurts.
I know how hard this is to believe, but connect the dots.
- Think what's happened.
- I know what's going on.
- Think about the little girl.
- You felt something for me.
Now you're acting like a mental patient because you're scared.
- I deliver gifts in a sleigh.
- lncredible.
I go down chimneys with burning logs and I still deliver gifts.
I'm not scared.
That's not what this is.
If you're trying to push me away, it's working.
Carol, don't make me leave.
Please.
- How could you pick her?
- I didn't.
You don't care any more.
I care more about you than anybody.
But it's a two-way street.
- You won't confide in me.
- You want it? Here it is.
- What? Talk to me.
- I don't live a normal life.
- You live a great life here.
- Just listen to me!
My friends get to go around saying, "My dad's a plumber."
"My dad's a pilot." "My dad's a dentist." You know what?
My dad is the best thing of all and I can't tell anyone.
You have no idea how hard it is, walking around with that secret.
And now you're going out with Principal Newman!
And you don't even tell me about it.
My whole life has become about secrets, and I hate it!
I'm sorry.
Forget about
Principal Newman, all right?
And forget about Santa.
I'm done.
My time's up.
Who cares any more?
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Lucy.
- What are you doing?
- Just shovelling.
Oh.
Charlie, is Uncle Scott
Santa Claus?
No.
Why would you think that?
I don't know.
- How come Uncle Scott was sad?
- What makes you think that?
I asked him to stick a straw in his nose and blow bubbles in his milk.
- And he said no.
- Whatever.
- Can you talk to him?
- I don't think so, Lucy.
- Did you have a fight?
- Sort of.
- Are you gonna make up?
- I don't know!
- Are you gonna be mad forever?
- Lucy!
- What?
- These are hard questions.
No, they're not. They're easy.
And you can't be mad at him forever, Charlie.
He's your daddy and you love him.

Aren't you supposed to get back to work?!
All of ya! You little idiots!

OK.
- Would you get that, honey?
- Yeah, sure.
Is S... Scott here?
- Who are you?
- Uh...
Curtis, a friend from...
Buffalo.
- Are you an elf?
- Of course not!
Why would you ask such a silly question?
How come you have pointy ears?
It's... because I never ate my green vegetables.
Do you eat your green vegetables?
Uncle Scott!
Yeah, I'm right here.
What's wrong?
Oh... Curtis! What are you doin' here?
There's a little trouble at the... plant.
It's OK.
Curtis is a very old friend.
We have a large, uh... firm.
We work together in...
- Buffalo.
- Buffalo?
We work together in Buffalo.
So... we're gonna talk business.
- What business?
- It's none of your business.
Soon I'm gonna be seven.
And then I can know things.
- Good night, Curtis.
- Good night, Lucy.
Good night, Lucy.
- What's up?
- Toy Santa's out of control.
He's locked up the elves, shut down the workshop, he thinks everybody's naughty and he's gonna give everyone coal!
- Why didn't Bernard tell me?
- He's under house arrest.
Bernard?!
Fly back with me to the North
Pole to save Christmas!
I can't. I have no magic left.
I'm out of magic. Look.
Grrrr!
- I thought you had Comet.
- Yeah, we...
Yes! Come on!
Hey, Comet. We just...
Comet?
Comet?
Look at me.
- Comet...!
What are ya doin'?
- Eating sugar is bad for you.
What do you mean, you didn't eat this?
Who did?
A squirrel?!
Get this. You gotta fly both of us back to the North Pole.
- Yeah, tonight.
OK. I'll help you up.
All right? Ready? You've got to help me a little here.
Pull.
Ai! Gah!
Good. OK, we almost got it.
That's OK.
OK, now, help me.
Can ya move anything?
Fire in the hole! Get away!
Whoa!
Eat some roughage, will you?
- Oh, what about the jet pack?
- It burned up on reentry.
What am I supposed to do?
Grow wings?
I hope he doesn't have too many stops to make tonight.
You and me both, pal.
OK. Let's just get it over with.
OK.
One, two...
Three!
- What's going on down there?
- Are you sure about this?
What? The old toaster trick?
When we were kids we used to do this to get a little extra cash.
- Works every time!
- I can't watch this.
- You ready, buddy?
- All right. Let her rip.
One, two, three!
Ow!
Oh, Scott!
- Scott, are you all right?
- Mom!
- Yes?
- I lost another tooth.
Should I put it under my pillow?
Yes!
By cuspids!
Shhh.
This way. Come on.
Curtis, get the door.
It's a Tooth Fairy ambush.
What do you people want?
I only carry $20 in change.
Tooth Fairy, it's me, Santa.
I've lost the weight and the beard, but it's me.
I know Santa. Santa is a friend.
And you, sir, are no Santa.
I am too.
How did I know I could capture you by holdin' on to a wing?
You wanted to change your name to Captain Floss or Plaque Man.
Or, as I recall, Roy.
And it was Santa's idea to call you the Molarnator.
- Who's the kid?
- One of my elves. He's an elf.
Ow.
Santa!
The Molarnator at your service!
- A little altitude, please!
- What?
Could you possibly fly a little higher?
Oof!
- What?
- Never mind!
Principal Newman?
What is it, Charlie?
You keep asking me if there's something bothering me.
Well, there is. I...
I couldn't talk about it before, but...
I want to talk about it now.
OK. Go ahead.
- My dad is Santa.
- Oh, please. Not you too.
Hold on.
If you have no feelings for my dad, then fine.
But if the only reason for not being with him is that you don't believe in him, you're making a big mistake.
Oh, Charlie...
Here.
I want you to take this.
Look into this and... try to remember what it was like when you were little and you still believed in Christmas.
Seeing isn't believing.
Believing is seeing.
You haven't seen anything yet!
- Curtis?
- What? Ow!
- What do I do?
- Slow down.
OK.
Piece of cake. Attaboy.
There you go.
Why can't you fly higher?
Tooth Fairy, I want to thank you. I'll never forget this.
I wish I could do more, but I gotta go.
Denver just started a new pee-wee hockey league.
Before you go,
I want you to know that nobody, nobody was braver than you were today.
You should be proud of your wings.
- They're not too girly?
- Not on you.
Wouldn't it be easier to go through the workshop?
No. That way Santa and his soldiers would be expecting us.
Sound military strategy involves taking your enemy by surprise.
It's good strategy.
Sometimes being a despot is a tough business.
Come on.
It's Scott, isn't it?
Yeah. What are you supposed to be?
A better, stronger version of what you used to be - with a flawless complexion,
I might add.
- Look, it just glistens.
- Listen to me. I'm back now.
So untie us. Let the elves go and give me back the coat.
No can do! It's Christmas Eve!
I have coal to deliver!
And I don't want those naughty kids to suffer!
Boys! One, two, three!
And... one, two!
Try to keep up!
Let's go. Move it on!
Try to...
This is just too tight.
This is all my fault.
I thought I could create another Santa.
My elfin pride blinded me to all reason.
There's only one Santa.
Well, I've done a pretty rotten job.
I didn't check the list twice.
My kid thinks I betrayed him.
I hurt the woman I love.
I ruined Christmas.
Charlie!
How'd you get up here?
Scott!
I got to fly in with the Tooth Fairy.
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.
Brush between meals and don't forget the floss.
And if anybody cares,
I'm exhausted.
And she... has a beautiful smile.
- Thank you for everything.
- No. Thank you.
I am... the Molarnator!
Whoo!
Come on!
Hyah!
Get out of the way!
What are you doing?
- You gotta save Christmas.
- How am supposed to save...?
- No, no, no.
- Please. Don't worry.
Whoa!
Slow down.
Stay.
Whoah!
Oh, Chet...
Ouch! Ow! Oh, oh, oh!
Thanks. Excuse me, pork chop.
OK. Chet, this is it.
You ready to rock and roll?
- Chet?
- Yeah. He's still in training.
- Has he had much flight time?
- About a minute and a half.
- He's had a lot of crash time!
- Curtis...!
- He's just a baby.
- All right.
Let's see what this baby can do.
- Oh, boy.
Ready to go, buddy?
You know what we gotta do.
Hyah!
Chet! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Chet, Chet.
You gotta focus, Chet.
OK, everybody! Outside, now!
Almost there, boys. Let's go!
- Chet, whoa!
Snowballs, on three!
One!
Two!
Three!
OK, elves...
Let's get 'em!
Whoa, whoa! Not so far!
- Whoa, Chet!
- Whooh!
Back for more action, eh, scooter?
- Chet, Chet!
Cut the chitchat, Chet!
Why is this such a problem?
Come on!
Where do you think you're going?
- Go, go!
- Hyah, boy! Come on!
Faster!
The lead.
The one in the front, Chet!
Leave my reindeer alone!
- Go! Go! Go!
Come on! We got to get them before they get out the hole.
Stay away from my lead reindeer!
- Whoo!
Holy Hannah, he's an action hero!
Hyah!
What are you doin' up there?
I can't see where I'm driving.
You are a sad, strange little man.
Whoa!
You're gonna fall... I hope!
That's a good way to lose an eye!
Look out! You're scaring me!
Can I help you?
Honey, I'm home!
Loser!
Hey, I'm supposed to wear this coat! How about a little elbow?
There you are.
That's gotta feel good.
You want the shoe?
Take it off. Go ahead. Go on!
Uh?
What are we gonna do now, smartypants?
Watch out!
The building! Left, left!
Oh, well.
The town'll break the fall.
Look out!
Yo, Tony! Hey, Brian, stop me!
Oof!
Get off of me! Now remember, rules are very, very important!
I want hot chocolate.
Hey, guys, back up. I've got a special place for him.
You idiot! Wait a minute, something's shocking me.
- You were great.
- Sounds like you were too.
- We've got ten minutes.
- Where is Carol?
- Carol! Are you all right?
- Yes!
- Where are you going?
- I gotta deliver gifts.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- No.
- You gotta get married.
Excuse me?
Carol, l...
I cannot continue being Santa... unless I find a Mrs Claus.
Oh. So that's what the whole noodles and pie thing...
- You just needed a wife.
- No.
No?
- Yes.
- Yes?
Yes, I was looking for a wife.
No, I didn't figure on falling... in love.
You love me?
- This is all happening so fast.
- Well, there's no pressure.
Good.
I mean, if I don't get married
I just won't deliver the gifts and children everywhere will stop believing, the elves will lose their jobs, the North Pole will disappear and Christmas will be gone.
- Get down on one knee.
- Hm?
Do it. Now.
Say "Carol."
- Carol.
- Uh-huh?
Yeah?
You say this is happening all so fast.
You say this is happening all so fast.
But you've known me your whole life.
But you've known me your whole life.
When you were little and alone...
- Santa...
- I can take it from here.
..Santa was always there for you.
And I will be, as long as you continue to believe in me.
I know I'm asking you to leave everything at home, but I can guarantee you that this is worth it.
This place...
This place is all about magic and love... and wonder.
And occasionally a thin-crust pizza and a movie and a long winter night.
Is there a school here?
Yeah, we have one, a school, but the elves need a new principal.
Cos as of late some of the elves have been acting a bit impish.
Carol...
- I love you.
- You do?
Would you be my wife?
I will.
Thank you.
I've got it from here.
I will.
By the powers vested in me by me,
I now pronounce you Santa and Mrs Claus.
Well, go on now. Kiss her!
Awwww!
- Dad, we gotta go.
- Walk me to my sleigh.
We gotta go! When we get back, we start making some more toys.
All right. Well, Mrs Claus, you might want to get some rest.
You see, tomorrow begins vacation season for me, which means a three-month honeymoon for us.
Nothing tropical. You do not want to see this in a Speedo.
Don't be home too late.
And so it begins.
Boys, we've got some toys to deliver!
Hyah!
Lucy?
What, Charlie?
Come downstairs.
I want you to see something.
Lucy.
Watch this.
Uncle Scott?!
- Do you have any twos?
- Go fish!
You are Santa!
I knew it was you all along.
- And you were right.
- Uncle Scott...
You look all rosy.
Are you feeling better?
I'm feeling much, much better.
Is there anything else
I should know about?
I don't know. But Charlie has something he wants to tell you.
OK.
You know, I was exactly your age when I found out my dad was Santa.
- But I couldn't tell anybody.
- I can't tell anybody either?
No. But knowing it isn't a burden.
It's a gift.
Most kids stop believing in
Santa when they grow up.
But I get to believe in him forever.
I love you, Charlie. Thank you.
But do we still get toys?
If you ever get to bed and go to sleep like the other kids.
Oh... OK!
- Merry Christmas, Lucy.
- Merry Christmas, Santa.
Sport, I gotta fly.
- Easy, boys, easy.
You're gettin' it, Chet.
Look, Charlie!
Merry Christmas, Comet!
All right, boys!
Hyah! Ho, ho, ho!
- Hyah!
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!
Nothin' wrong with a straight line, Chet.
Chet! Chet!

Hey!
What the heck are we doin' out here?
Agh!
Look, if we're gonna dance... dance like this.
All of us!
Everybody, you idiots!
Hey, lady!
Watch this!
Ever seen a toy do this?
Where you going?
Whoo!
Merry.
No!
No!
With a sigh
You turn away
With a deepening heart
No more words to say
You will find
That the world has changed
Forever
And the trees are now
Turning from green to gold
And the sun is now fading
I wish I could hold you
Closer
Merry!
Merry!
Merry.
Merry, it's me.
It's Pippin.
I knew you'd find me.
Yes.
Are you going to leave me?
No, Merry.
I'm going to look after you.
Hands off!
That shiny shirt, that's mine.
It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else.
I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!
You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.
The scum tried to knife me.
Kill him!
That's for Frodo!
And for the Shire!
And that's for my old Gaffer!
Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.
I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.
Not if I stick you first.
Sam!
Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
Sorry for everything.
-Let's get you out of here.
-It's too late. It's over.
They've taken it. Sam...
...they took the Ring.
Begging your pardon, but they haven't.
I thought I'd lost you.
So I took it.
Only for safekeeping.
Give it to me.
Give me the Ring, Sam.
Sam.
Give me the Ring.
You must understand.
The Ring is my burden.
It will destroy you, Sam.
Come on, Mr. Frodo.
We best find you some clothes.
You can't go walking through Mordor in naught but your skin.
We did it, Mr. Frodo.
We made it to Mordor.
There are so many of them.
We'll never get through unseen.
It's him, the Eye.
We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.
There's nothing for it.
Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.
The darkness is deepening.
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.
It's only a matter of time.
He has suffered a defeat, yes...
...but behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.
Let him stay there.
Let him rot! Why should we care?
Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.
I've sent him to his death.
No.
There is still hope for Frodo.
He needs time and safe passage across the plains of Gorgoroth.
-We can give him that.
-How?
Draw out Sauron's armies.
Empty his lands.
Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
Not for ourselves.
But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.
Keep him blind to all else that moves.
A diversion.
Certainty of death...
...small chance of success...
...what are we waiting for?
Sauron will suspect a trap.
He will not take the bait.
Oh, I think he will.
Long have you hunted me.
Long have I eluded you.
No more.
Behold the Sword of Elendil.
The city has fallen silent.
There is no warmth left in the sun.
It grows so cold.
It's just the damp of the first spring rain.
I do not believe this darkness will endure.
Look, the Orcs...
...they're moving off.
You see, Mr. Frodo...
...some luck at last.
Move it, you slugs!
Come on! Faster!
Come along, you scum....
I'll whip you down to the bone, you....
Come on!
What have I told you?!
Get up!
Come on, you slugs!
You two are going straight to the front line!
Now, move it! Go on!
Fall in! Move it!
To the Gate, you slugs!
Now, move it!
Don't you know we're at war?
Company, halt!
Inspection!
Sam, help me.
Mr. Frodo!
Stand up, Mr. Frodo.
Stand up!
It's so heavy.
Oh, no.
What do I do?
What do we do?
-Hit me.
-What?
Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.
Get off of me!
Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.
Get off of me!
Break it up! Break it up!
Oi! I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down!
Go, Sam. Now!
Move along, scum!
Back in the line!
You maggots!
Get back into the line, you slugs!
Dig it, you slugs. Move it.
Move it!
I can't....
I can't....
I can't manage the Ring, Sam.
It's.... It's....
It's such a weight to carry.
It....
Such a weight.
We're going that way.
Straight as we can.
There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need.
Mr. Frodo.
Look.
There is light...
...and beauty up there...
...that no shadow can touch.
Take mine.
There's a few drops left.
There will be none left for the return journey.
I don't think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo.
Frodo, get down!
Hide!
Frodo!
Where are they?
Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!
Let justice be done upon him!
My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.
Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?
We do not come to treat with Sauron...
...faithless and accursed.
Tell your master this:
The armies of Mordor must disband.
He is to depart these lands, never to return.
Old Greybeard.
I have a token I was bidden to show thee.
Frodo.
Frodo.
-Silence.
-No!
Silence!
The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.
Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.
Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?
And he did, Gandalf.
He did.
And who is this?
Isildur's heir?
It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.
I guess that concludes negotiations.
I do not believe it.
I will not.
Pull back.
Pull back!
It's gone, Mr. Frodo.
The light's passed on, away towards the north.
Something's drawn its gaze.
Hold your ground! Hold your ground.
Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!
I see in your eyes...
...the same fear that would take the heart of me.
A day may come when the courage of Men fails...
...when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship.
But it is not this day.
An hour of wolves and shattered shields...
...when the age of Men comes crashing down.
But it is not this day.
This day we fight!
By all that you hold dear on this good earth...
... I bid you stand, Men of the West!
Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an Elf.
What about side by side with a friend?
Aye.
I could do that.
Do you remember the Shire,
Mr. Frodo?
It'll be spring soon.
And the orchards will be in blossom.
And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.
And they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields...
...and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.
Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
No, Sam.
I can't recall the taste of food...
...nor the sound of water...
...nor the touch of grass.
I'm...
...naked in the dark.
There's-- There's nothing.
No veil between me and the wheel of fire.
I can see him...
...with my waking eyes.
Then let us be rid of it...
...once and for all.
Come on, Mr. Frodo.
I can't carry it for you...
...but I can carry you.
Come on!
Aragorn.
Elessar.
For Frodo.
Look, Mr. Frodo.
A doorway.
We're almost there.
Clever Hobbits to climb so high!
Mustn't go that way.
Mustn't hurt the precious.
You swore!
You swore on the precious!
Sméagol promised!
Sméagol lied.
Frodo!
Eagles.
The eagles are coming!
Frodo!
I'm here, Sam.
Destroy it!
Go on! Now!
Throw it in the fire!
What are you waiting for?
Just let it go!
The Ring is mine.
No.
No.
No!
Yes!
Yes!
Precious! Precious!
Precious! Precious!
Give me your hand!
Take my hand!
No!
Don't you let go.
Don't let go.
Reach!
Frodo!
Frodo!
It's gone.
It's done.
Yes, Mr. Frodo.
It's over now.
I can see the Shire.
The Brandywine River.
Bag End.
Gandalf's fireworks.
The lights in the Party Tree.
Rosie Cotton dancing.
She had ribbons in her hair.
If ever I was to marry someone...
...it would've been her.
It would've been her.
I'm glad to be with you,
Samwise Gamgee...
...here at the end of all things.
Gandalf?
Frodo!
Gimli!
Now come the days of the king.
May they be blessed.
This day does not belong to one man...
...but to all.
Let us together rebuild this world...
...that we may share in the days of peace.
My friends...
...you bow to no one.
And thus it was.
A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.
And the Fellowship of the Ring...
...though eternally bound by friendship and love...
...was ended.
Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey...
...we found ourselves looklng upon a familiar sight.
We were home.
Hi.
Hey, watch the pumpkin.
More of the same, Rosie.
Good night, lads.
How do you pick up the threads of an old life?
How do you go on...
...when in your heart you begin to understand...
...there is no going back?
There are some things that time cannot mend...
...some hurts that go too deep...
...that have taken hold.
There and back again... a hobbit's tale, by Bilbo Baggins
Mr. Frodo?
What is it?
It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.
It's never really healed.
"There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale by Bilbo Baggins.
And The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins."
You finished it.
Not quite.
There's room for a little more.
Bilbo once told me his part
In this tale would end...
...that each of us must come and go
In the telling.
Bilbo's story was now over.
There would be no more journeys for him...
...save one.
Tell me again, lad, where are we going?
To the harbour, Bilbo.
The Elves have accorded you a special honour...
...a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.
Frodo...
...any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?
The one I gave you.
I'm sorry, Uncle.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Oh.
Pity.
I should like to have held it one last time.
Well, here's a sight
I have never seen before.
The power of the Three Rings is ended.
The time has come...
...for the dominion of Men.
The sea calls us home.
I think I'm...
...quite ready for another adventure.
Farewell...
...my brave Hobbits.
My work is now finished.
Here at last, on the shores of the sea...
...comes the end of our Fellowship.
I will not say, "Do not weep"...
...for not all tears are an evil.
It is time, Frodo.
What does he mean?
We set out to save the Shire, Sam.
And it has been saved.
But not for me.
You don't mean that.
You can't leave.
The last pages are for you, Sam.
My dear Sam.
You cannot always be torn in two.
You will have to be one and whole for many years.
You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.
Your part In the story will go on.
Well...
... I'm back.
Lay down
Your sweet and weary head
Night is falling
You have come
To journey's end
Sleep now
And dream
Of the ones who came before
They are calling
From across
The distant shore
Why do you weep?
What are these tears
Upon your face?
Soon you will see
All of your fears
Will pass away
Safe In my arms
You're only sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls
Call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rises
The ships have come
To carry you home
And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All souls pass
Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say
We have come now to the end
White shores are calling
You and I will meet again
And you'll be here
In my arms
Just sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls
Call?
Across the sea
A pale moon rlses
The ships have come
To carry you home
And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
Grey ships pass
Into the West
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey was a really clumsy kid
On the first day of first grade
I'll tell you what he did
He tripped over a pencil box
Flew up in the air
Landed on a kangaroo who pulled out all his hair
He needed first aid in the first grade
First aid in the first grade
First aid in the first grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
Where is Route 59?
First aid in the second grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey was a really clumsy kid
Lights! Lights!
He fell out of a fishing boat
Splashed into the sea
Landed on a moray eel
Who bit him on the knee
He needed first aid in the third grade
He needed first aid in the third grade
He needed first aid in the third grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
I get to meet Twippo.
Twelfth grade.
Now Billy Joe McGuffrey
Was a really clumsy kid
On the 12th day of 12th grade
I'll tell you what he did
He walked into financial aid
Fell and broke a bone
Showed them all his bills and got a great big college loan
He needed first aid in the twelfth grade
First aid in the twelfth grade
You could buy a zoo with all the doctor bills he paid
Yeah, Twippo.
Let's do another Twippo song.
- I love Twippo.
- Me, too.
But I'm the only one who gets to meet him, because I won the Twippo Sweepstakes.
You don't have to rub it in.
It's great that you won the contest, Laura, but let's try not to brag about it.
Nice one with the lights, Bob.
My pleasure. For the next song, maybe I can drive into the river.
Yeah.
Drive into the river, Bob
Oh, drive into the river, Bob...
Or maybe you could help me with the map.
I'm sorry.
Is there anything you want me to tell Twippo when I meet him?
Look out!
- My ticket.
- Quick, get it.
- The map.
- Sorry.
My ticket.
Do you mind?
I'm stuck.
Get it! Get it! Fix it! Stick it in! Put it back!
Porcupine!
Tree.
Cabin.
Underwear.
Well, I'm glad that's over.
Did you say something?
- Oh...
- Dear.
Am I in heaven?
Smells like Wisconsin.
Well. Nobody got hurt.
Wow. What a shot.
Hey.
What's that?
What's "Seafoo"?
Maybe it's like tofu.
Only saltier.
I can't believe I did that.
Oh, yeah? Well, if it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be in this mess.
I said I was sorry. I'll do better next time.
There isn't gonna be a next time.
Mr. Bob? How are we gonna get to the Twippo concert?
Yeah.
We're gonna miss the Bald Bunny song.
I don't know.
I don't know about any bald bunnies.
I'm a bald bunny
Ain't got no fur
Even if we make it to the concert,
I can't get in. I lost my ticket.
Serves you right. It's your own fault for waving it around in my face.
I have to go to the bathroom.
You know,
I'm usually not that clumsy in the car.
Two flat tires.
Usually, I'm quite dexterous.
How in the world are we gonna change two flat tires?
Where's the phone?
I lost my ticket.
If you hadn't been teasing me with it, we wouldn't be in this mess, Laura.
May we help you?
Porcupine.
- I need to call my wife.
- Here.
May I please use the bathroom?
- Down the hall, first door on the left.
- Thank you.
Captain Ahab's Moby Blaster. My favorite.
What do you want?
Well, sirs. The asparagus hit me in the head with a guitar, and an angry mother porcupine shot out our tires and one of her babies got me.
- And I need to use your phone to call...
- A tow truck.
...my wife.
- I see.
- Next to the Moby Blaster.
- Thanks.
- Well, in the meantime, would you like to have a seat?
Maybe enjoy a nice combo platter?
Steak, steak
Eat it, eat it
Shrimp, shrimp
Need it, need it
Steak and shrimp
Steak and shrimp
Need to, need to eat it, eat it
Do you prefer "poking" or "non-poking?"
Non.
Good one, Phillipe.
You are one clever pea, no?
Voilà. A skewer for the scampi.
We are
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything
We just stay home and lie around
Please make yourselves comfortable.
I will be back to take your order.
Why don't you two wait here.
I'm gonna go call a tow truck.
Maybe we can still make it to the concert on time.
Yeah, everyone but me.
Hey, it's your own fault for teasing me.
You're just getting what you deserve.
I'm coming with you, Mr. Bob.
See, the guy, one guy, all he does, he just folds these napkins.
The napkin guy.
- He works at night after everybody's gone.
- Yeah.
You know, he used to fold maps.
No. No. Listen to me. He takes one spoon, he takes one knife, and he takes one fork, and he rolls it up in a napkin. He's the one that makes it into that little swan shape.
Excuse me.
- How's it going?
- Hey. What's up?
Who are you?
Who, us?
Yeah.
We are The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything.
You know that's right.
- Nothing.
- Zilch.
Nada.
Didn't you hear our song?
Well, yeah, but...
Look, sonny... Can I call you sonny?
- Junior.
- Hey. Pretty close.
Look, Junior, we couldn't help but notice you were having a little thing with your friend over there.
Yeah. You weren't being very nice.
Well, it's her own fault.
She was teasing me, and now she's getting what she deserves.
Right.
Junior, we've seen these types of situations before.
- Happens all the time.
- What you need is a little compassion.
And maybe some scampi.
Hey, I saw that in the menu.
What is that? What's "compassion"?
That's a hard question.
Well, compassion is when you see that someone needs help, and you wanna help them.
That's what I thought you'd say.
- They all do.
- Yep.
We find it helpful to illustrate with a little story.
- A story?
- Yep.
You know, we call ourselves
The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, but that's not entirely accurate.
Yeah. Remember when we did that one thing with that one guy?
- Do I ever.
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
Are you guys still doing that pirate thing?
Watch your tongue, matey, or we'll have to...
- What will we do?
- We won't do anything.
We're The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, remember?
That's right.
You got off easy today.
We need more
Mr. Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls.
Yeah. And root beer.
I told you, boys, no more cheese curls until you pay your tab.
You still owe me from last week.
But you'll take away our chance to win the Mr. Twisty's Twisted
Cheese Curl Sweepstakes.
Come again?
Inside one of those bags of cheesy goodness is a golden ticket that'll change our lives forever.
Well, you could work here for me.
That way you could earn more cheese curls.
- That sounds good.
- Okay.
So what do you know how to do?
Well, I'm pretty good at lawn darts.
Ping-Pong. I can play Ping-Pong.
Croquet is my specialty.
When do we start?
Monday's good for me.
We were short on cash.
It seems not doing anything didn't pay very well.
So what do we do now?
Nothing.
You are a genius.
Are these fish fresh?
- You bet.
- Oh, yeah.
What?
They were fresh when we caught them.
- That's right.
- Two weeks ago.
Ninevites.
Beside the fact that we were low on funds, this was a memorable day because he showed up.
Jonah.
Now, Jonah was a prophet of God, which means he was one of the very special people
God used to deliver messages to Israel.
He was kind of like a mailman, except his letters came straight from God.
Anyway, Jonah loved helping his friends by bringing them God's messages.
Sometimes the messages were good.
Sometimes they were not so good.
But when a prophet talked, everybody listened.
What's the word, Jonah?
Yeah, what's the word?
Stop right here, Reginald.
Dear people,
I bring you a message from the Lord.
It's a message of encouragement.
Do not fight, do not cheat
Wash your hands before you eat
There is nothing quite as sweet
A message from the Lord
Be a friend
Say your prayers
Heaven loves a heart that cares
That is why I've come to share a message from the Lord
And if you follow God's commands
There will be peace throughout the land
You will live long and happy lives
With your sheep
Your kids
Your wives
Don't eat pigs
Don't eat bats
Don't eat beetles, flies or gnats
Stay away from all of that
A message from the Lord
Do what's right
Don't provoke
Put four tassels on your cloak
Do not laugh
It's not a joke
A message from the Lord
Do not fight
Do not cheat
Wash your hands before you eat
There is nothing quite as sweet
A message from the Lord
All together now.
Be a friend
Say your prayers
Heaven loves a heart that cares
That is why he came to share a message from the Lord
And if we follow God's commands
There will be peace throughout our land
We will live long and happy lives
With our sheep
Our kids
Our wives
Do what's right
Don't provoke
Put four tassels on your cloak
Do not laugh
It's not a joke
A message from the Lord
Don't do drugs
Stay in school
This is quite a lot of rules
Follow them and you're no fool
Follow them and you're no fool
A message from the Lord
A message from the Lord
All right. Good show, everyone.
Thank you very much.
That was pretty much Jonah's life.
Town to town, bringing God's messages to his friends.
Not a bad gig, overall.
So, every night before he went to sleep,
Jonah would pray and ask God if there was a new message for him to deliver.
And this night, there was a message that would change Jonah's life.
A new message? Yes, what's that?
People being unkind? Lying? Stealing?
Oh, dear. Sounds like a standard
"turn and repent" to me.
All right, name the town.
I'll be on my way first thing in the morning.
Where is it? Jericho? Damascus?
What? Nineveh?
I'm not aware of any Ninevehs in Israel.
No, I don't think...
You mean that Nineveh?
That Nineveh wasn't in Israel at all.
It was the capital of Assyria, and it was the biggest, meanest city around.
Now, the people of Nineveh were particularly mean to Jonah's people, the Israelites.
They lied. They stole.
But worst of all, they slapped people with fishes.
They even slapped each other with fishes.
They didn't know the difference between right and wrong.
The Ninevites were so mean, in fact, that most Israelites, including Jonah, wished God would just wipe Nineveh off the face of the Earth.
Needless to say, Jonah was shocked that God would want him to deliver a message to his enemies.
You don't want me to go there.
You don't know what Nineveh is like.
Perhaps you've never been there.
Well, of course you haven't.
A god like you would never go to a place like Nineveh.
Or for that matter, neither would a prophet like me.
No, it cannot be
Your messages are meant for me and my brothers
We are your chosen people
And Nineveh
Well, they're not
There must be some mistake
A big misunderstanding
It's really hard to take
How could you be so demanding?
For years I've been your messenger from Moresheth to Gath
But Nineveh should get no chance to turn
They've earned your wrath
No, it cannot be
Your messages are meant for me and my brothers
We are your chosen people
And Nineveh
Well, they're not
We're the good guys
And they're the bad guys
Please, don't send me there with a message of your mercy
Damascus or Jerusalem
I'll be there in a minute
Any town in Israel, just ask me
I'll be in it
Shiloh, Gilgal, Jericho
Just say the word
But Nineveh
That is just absurd
Joppa, Aphek, Jezreel
They're all just fine
But Nineveh
Nineveh.
No.
Nineveh is where I draw the line
No, it cannot be
Your messages are meant for me
Yep. It sounded like God wanted to offer mercy to the Ninevites.
The tow truck's on its way.
You know, Junior, I love your dad and all, but that's the last time
I pick him for a copilot.
What's going on?
We're telling a little story.
You should listen, too.
As I was saying, it sounded like God wanted to offer mercy to Jonah's enemies.
What's "mercy"?
It's what this whole story is about.
I thought it was about compassion, remember?
The menu?
Yeah. There's that, too.
Better check your menu again.
We got two specials today, and they go hand in hand.
Compassion is when you want to help someone who needs help.
Mercy is when you give someone a second chance, even if they don't deserve it.
This story is about both of them.
That's right, my cucumber friend.
You can't have mercy without compassion.
But mercy is even more important.
Jonah was afraid God was going to give Nineveh a second chance, that he was going to help them, even though they didn't deserve it.
So what did he do?
Well, never before had he gotten a message from God that he didn't want to deliver.
He didn't know what to do.
Good morning, Jonah. What's the word?
What? Nothing. There is no word.
Nothing at all?
No. Nothing at all.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm very busy.
Good morning, Jonah. What's the word?
Stop it. There is no word. Nothing.
I've got to get out of here.
There is no word.
I have no new messages.
And above all, I am not going to Nineveh.
Sorry, sir.
I can't sell you a ticket to Nineveh.
What? Who are you?
The name's Angus. I sell cruise tickets.
There's nothing like a cruise on the Great Sea to clean the sand out of your wicket, aye?
But you can't sail to Nineveh.
It's landlocked. See?
You can't go by sea. You gotta go by land.
But I don't want to go to...
Hello, Mr. Jonah. What's the word?
He's going to Nineveh.
Oh, really?
I am not going to Nineveh.
Why on earth would I want to go to Nineveh?
In fact, I'm going in the opposite direction.
What's the farthest thing in the world from Nineveh?
Well, if you have a few days, you could sail down to Egypt.
It's lovely this time of year.
There. I want to go there.
Tarshish?
Why, that would take weeks.
It's the other end of the world.
Perfect. How much?
Even if you had the money, no one around here has the time to sail all the way to Tarshish.
Then again.
We couldn't possibly.
We're very busy with cargo and stuff.
You know, pirates have to pillage and plunder and...
That really takes it out of you...
Yeah, and ALF is on in a half hour, so I don't think we should...
And besides that, we don't really sail.
At all.
So, the answer is no.
Money is no object.
Next stop, Tarshish. I'll hoist the mainsail.
- I'll pop the popcorn.
- I'll get the moist towelettes.
Where did we put them?
Hey, Larry, have you seen the towelettes?
- I got it. I got it.
- No, those are baby wipes.
Sorry.
My fault.
Even though we'd never sailed before, we took to it like a fish to water.
Thar she blows.
Where?
Right there. Next to the grill.
Got it.
Six-zero.
Seven-zero.
That's a skunk. I win.
Yeah. All right. Yeah.
What do you say, Jonah? Two out of three?
No. I'm done.
When we get to Tarshish, Ho Hos on me.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
He winny at the Ping-Pong
We get the Ho Ho and the Ding Dong
Ding dong
Once we finally got out to sea,
Jonah went below deck to rest a bit.
What have I done? What have I done?
You are powerful and attractive.
What? Who's there?
You do not run from your problems, but confront them face to face.
The bag. It speaks.
What did you do that for?
Mr. Twisty?
Who's there? Show yourself.
Hello.
What are you?
Who, me? My name is Khalil.
I am a caterpillar. Well, that's only half true.
My mother was a caterpillar.
My father was a worm.
But I'm okay with that now.
Khalil?
Khalil. You've got to get your gut into it.
I bet you are wondering why I am here.
You tidy up around the ship?
No. I do not work on the ship.
I am a small business operator.
A traveling salesman.
I sell Persian rugs door to door.
See?
- Lovely.
- By the way, do you know where this ship is going?
- Yes, Tarshish.
- Tarshish.
What a trip.
You know, that may be just what I need.
The Persian rug business has not been going very well around here.
But I still have a positive mental attitude because of my motivational tapes.
You are a skilled metalworker.
I am a skilled metalworker.
I did not know that.
Yes, well, that's lovely, Carlyle, but if you don't mind,
I think I'll just get some rest.
Jonah?
You are Jonah.
- You know me?
- Of course I do.
You are the most famous prophet in the whole world.
- Well, I don't know if I'd say...
- I sell your licensed merchandise.
Look. I have the Jonah rugs, the Jonah plush toy with sound chip.
A message from the Lord.
A message from the Lord.
Well, I'm flattered.
You are huge. You are a celebrity.
Well, I...
From town to town, delivering God's messages.
What a life. You are a big shot.
No, it's really...
The man God can count on to deliver his messages.
Yes, well...
You and God are like peas in a pod.
Like two humps on a camel, you always sway the same way.
That is a good one.
You know, humor runs very deep in my family.
My uncle was a big star back at a comedy club in Nineveh.
The Taj Ma-Haha. Standing room only.
And then he was hit with a fish.
I am telling you, those people do not know right from wrong.
Nineveh.
You are sad now, my friend?
Something about Nineveh makes you feel sad inside?
I don't really want to talk about it.
I just need some rest.
You do not have to tell me.
- Good.
- Because I already know.
- You do?
- Yes.
There is a woman in Nineveh, is there not?
A beautiful young asparagus.
- She is waiting there for you, no?
- No.
You were promised to be married, but your job is now in the way.
The woman's father is the head of an international ring of camel thieves.
This very day, you set sail for Tarshish to deliver a message that will break the back of the camel thieves, but in the process, will break the heart of the woman you love.
Insight runs very deep in my family.
Do not worry, the first one is free.
Please, Carlyle, I just need to get some rest.
It's Khalil.
But you can call me Carlyle if you want to.
When we get to Tarshish, you can deliver the message, and I'll sell the plush toys.
We can be a team.
A message from the Lord.
Well, sweet dreams, traveling buddy.
We can make our plans to save those camels tomorrow.
You are a go-getter.
Yes, which way is Tarshish?
Right this way. You can't miss it.
Thank you.
Jonah.
What? Who is it?
Jonah, where are you going?
It's you, Lord.
I'm going to... I'm going...
- Jonah.
- I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
- Jonah.
- I can't hear you.
Jonah.
I can't hear you.
Jonah.
Jonah. Jonah. Jonah.
No. I can't hear you.
Come on, wake up. We got trouble.
What? What's happening?
We're in a storm. Like I've never seen before.
If we don't do something quick, we're gonna sink.
We seem to have sprung a leak, traveling buddy.
Hey. What are you doing here?
Didn't I tell you to get off my ship, you lousy leaf eater?
Well, yes.
But, you see, my new friend and I are going to Tarshish to break the back of the camel thieves.
Crime fighting runs very deep in my family.
Why, if it wasn't for this storm,
I'd make you walk the plank.
And you, how can you sleep at a time like this?
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.
We're all gonna be fish food if I don't get some help.
Well, what can we do?
Get up and pray to your god.
Maybe he'll have mercy on us and spare our lives.
Somebody up there must be really upset with somebody down here.
Wait a minute. That's it.
All right. You two, follow me.
You got electric eel?
Nope. Go fish.
One more card.
You are one cheating buccaneer.
How am I supposed to cheat at Go Fish?
I don't know.
All right, you lazies.
Game over. Shuffle them up and deal us in.
But...
Okay. Here's the deal.
The way I see it, there is a reason for this storm.
Somebody up there is really upset with somebody down here.
And it ain't gonna let up until we know who that somebody is.
It could be any one of us.
I have my suspicions.
But we won't know for sure until we figure it out scientifically.
All right men, Go Fish.
Loser takes a swim.
- You got a perch?
- No.
- You have any pickerel?
- No.
You got a muskellunge?
Nope. Go fish.
Oh, dear.
I am most desperate for a lobster.
Sorry.
Drat.
You got any bass?
Yeah.
- Octopus?
- Bluegill?
- Tuna.
- Halibut.
You got any trout?
What a goose I am. It's a match.
I had it all along.
I thought for sure...
All right. I admit it. It's my fault. All my fault.
I'm the one to blame.
But I... The worm...
I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the god of heaven, who made the sea and the land.
And I'm running away from him.
He told me to go to Nineveh, but I didn't listen.
You know, I don't like those people.
- Fish slappers.
- Yes.
So I ran. I ran, and I ended up here.
And now everyone's in terrible danger all because of me.
I'm afraid the only thing left is to be thrown into the sea.
You don't have to do that. We've got a plank.
You can just walk off.
Yes. Thank you. You're too kind.
Well, Jonah, old buddy.
It was nice knowing you.
Normally, you'd be entitled to a refund, but under the circumstances, you know, with you dying and all...
No, I don't suppose a refund would do me much good now, would it?
Thanks. You're a trouper. Ain't he a trouper?
But the camels...
Hey. Wait a minute.
I just remembered something.
Maybe you don't have to walk the plank after all.
Every winter, my cousin from Moose Lake asks me to take care of this.
- Cool.
- What is it?
This, my friends, is a Jupiter 1,600 horsepower, high-octane, dual propeller, pull ignition outboard motor.
With the optional chrome trim package.
- Cool.
- What is it?
It gets us back to Joppa.
Well, how does it work?
That I don't know.
Perhaps I could help.
- You know, technical competency runs...
- I know, very deep in your family.
Our reputation precedes us.
Well, then, it appears that one should pull the cord, and then perhaps push this black bubbly thingy.
No. Maybe it's the other way around.
Perhaps if one first pushes the black bubbly thingy and then pulls the cord...
See?
Yep. That's how it works.
It has been delightful, but I must go now.
Oh, Lord, don't let us die for this man's sin.
And don't hold us responsible for his death, because it isn't our fault.
Oh, Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons.
And keep my duckie safe.
- Amen.
- Amen.
That was easy.
Well, should we pull him back in?
I don't see why not.
Something touched me!
There's something in the water!
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- I'm hurrying!
Hold on, Jonah!
- Aim this time!
- I was aiming!
- I can never tell where you're looking.
- You should talk.
Hurry!
Fellows, please!
- Pull it back in. Hurry!
- Okay, okay! I got it!
- Let me do that!
- No, no! I'll throw it!
Fellows, please!
Come on! Give it here!
I said, I got it!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Perhaps I can be of assistance.
Man the cannon!
Aye-aye, Captain!
We ain't got no ammo!
Yes, we do!
Fire one!
Fire two!
Hello?
Fire three!
I'm coming, traveling buddy!
Traveling buddy? Where are you?
Look, a bowling ball.
If I could only find some pins.
You found better than that, traveling buddy!
It's me!
Oh, my.
So forget about Tarshish.
All we need to do is get this whale to swim to Nineveh!
You give the message. I sell the plush toys.
We'll be right back on track.
Carlyle, please don't speak to me.
I'm having a rather bad day.
Well, you don't need to be so down about it,
Mr. Grumpypants!
Look around you!
We're inside a whale!
We're going to be digested!
Do you know what that means?
Of course I do!
Digestion runs very deep in my family.
I'm just trying to have a positive outlook, you know.
You know, the difference between you and me is that you see the whale as half empty, but I see the whale as half full!
I don't know what that means.
Neither do I.
I might as well face it.
God gave me a job to do, and I disobeyed him.
I ran the other way.
I've done something terrible, and now I'm getting what I deserve.
I'm going to die here in this whale.
Have you ever seen anything so pathetic?
This boy needs some help!
What? Who's there?
Take it easy, Jonah.
We're on your side.
How did you know my name?
How did you get in here?
Were you in the bowling ball, too?
No. That's not how we get around.
No, we came straight from the big man himself.
You mean...
And just like you, we deliver his messages.
- So, you're prophets, too?
- Not exactly.
You see, we work on a slightly higher level.
- You do?
- And, Jonah, we've got a message for you.
You're feeling pretty blue
You didn't do what God requested
Yeah, I'd be moping, too
If I was gonna be digested
This ain't a pretty picture, no
I said, it ain't a pretty sight, no
You ran from God this morning
And you're
Whale chow
Tonight
Hold up
Hang on
Not so fast
Your life ain't over yet
See, we're here to tell you all about
The forgiveness that
You can get
You see, ours is a god of mercy
Ours is a god of love
And right now he gonna lend a helping hand from up above
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored how his love your life enhances
You can be restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god of second chances
Ain't it good to know a god who gives a second chance?
Why, that's enough to get a smile from Mr. Grumpypants
So if you say you're sorry for all the stuff you do
We know that he'll be ready with a second chance for you
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored
How his love your life enhances
You can be restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god of second chances
Our god is the god
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
God gives a second chance
Second chances
Second chances
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored when you're restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god
Second chances
Second chances
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored when you're restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god
Second chances
If you believe
God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do

God's love is true
Then you should know what you should do
Second chances
Second chances
Praise the Lord
He's the god of second chances
You'll be floored when you're restored from your darkest circumstances
Our god is the god
Second chances
Second chances
Our god is the god
So, from inside the whale,
Jonah prayed and asked God to forgive him for not obeying.
He told God that if he got another chance, he would go to Nineveh, even though he didn't like those people very much.
So, did he get another chance?
Shouldn't you be looking out for your tow truck?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That can wait.
Did Jonah get another chance?
Well, God saw that Jonah needed help, and he wanted to help him.
That's compassion!
But did he give him a second chance, even though he didn't deserve it?
You know, mercy?
After three days, Jonah noticed something strange happening.
Reginald! Good to see you.
Yes, well...
So God told the whale to burp up Jonah, and Jonah got his second chance.
And just like he promised, he headed straight for Nineveh!
Turn back!
Turn back! Turn back!
The slapping!
Turn back!
Turn back! Turn back!
Go in, give the message, get out.
Go in, give the message, get out.
Who goes there?
Yes. My name is Jonah.
And I'm a prophet from...
You're not from here, are you?
No, you see, I'm from...
That would make you a stranger, wouldn't it?
Well, yes. I suppose so. But I...
We don't like strangers.
No. Yes, I've heard that.
But, you see, I have a...
So why are you here?
Well, I have a message.
A message? For who?
Well, for everyone! For the whole city.
You've got a message for the whole city?
- The whole city!
- That's rich!
I'll alert the king.
"Your honor, a bleached asparagus has a message for us all."
- "Most important!"
- I do not think this is going very well.
Let's just go home! I did what you said.
I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
- Jonah?
- What?
It is our friends from the ship!
What on earth? What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Yeah. You were... You were...
Fish food!
The whale spit us out like so much bad couscous, and here we are now, delivering the message to Nineveh.
But they wouldn't let us in, so I guess we're going home.
Hey, I bet we could get him in.
Hey, look! It's the cheese curls blokes.
Right.
Coming back for a visit, are you?
- Yep.
- Yep.
Is that fellow with you?
Yes, he's with us!
You're with them?
Yes, indeed!
Why, I sailed halfway across the world with these fine gentlemen.
All right. You can come in.
Enjoy your stay in Nineveh.
What was that all about?
How did you do that?
Remember that money you gave us?
By the way, you aren't gonna want that refund, are you?
Good. 'Cause we spent it, every last penny, on cheese curls.
- Cheese curls?
- Yep.
One thousand four hundred and fifty-eight bags of Mr. Twisty's Twisted Cheese Curls!
And you'll never guess what we found in bag 497.
The golden ticket.
We won the Mr. Twisty's
Twisted Cheese Curl Sweepstakes!
And the prize was...
But in addition to our enviably fashionable headgear, we also got a tour of the Mr. Twisty's factory, right here in Nineveh.
Which, despite its unseemly location, was a splendid experience.
And, believe it or not, in this town, we are famous.
Hey, look!
Here comes a city official to greet us.
Hello!
We were in the neighborhood, so we thought we'd...
These are the men. Arrest them at once.
But...
Excuse me. What have they done?
Thievery.
High theft against the Royal City of Nineveh.
That's ridiculous.
Is it?
No! Wait! I thought they were free samples.
Take them away!
You can't do that.
I'm sorry, are you with these men?
Well, yes, I suppose.
Hello. What are you doing?
Wonderful. It must be time for my speech.
Hey. I can't move.
I can't move, either.
What? Have I got something on my face?
This doesn't look good.
I'm sorry, guys.
I thought they were free samples.
They were right out there in the open in a big bowl.
- Very misleading.
- Don't go blaming yourself.
No. Blame him.
"Let's put it all in cheese curls," he says.
"No," I say, "We need a balanced portfolio!"
A little stock, a little bonds, a little cash, or cash equivalents.
And then maybe some snacks.
But, no. "Put it all in cheese curls," he says.
Man, you gotta plan for the future.
What? It got us here, didn't it?
Not "here" literally, but...
We were somebody! We were celebrities!
We are going to die!
People of Nineveh.
These four men and that small, whatever it is...
I am a caterpillar. Well, that is only half true.
...have been found guilty of high thievery against the Royal City of Nineveh.
For their punishment, the slap of no return!
What's so funny?
Observe.
What is happening that is making you all cry like little babies?
Why on earth do you take snack food so seriously?
People of Nineveh,
I give you King Twistomer.
It's Mr. Twisty.
Well, that explains it.
He looks happier on the bag.
Your Royal Gourdliness, these are the perpetrators of the heinous act against your curls of cheese.
For their punishment, the slap of no return!
Proceed.
Wait!
Won't you at least give the guilty parties a chance to speak in their own defense?
You may speak.
Well, as I understand it, the snacks in question were right out in the open in a large bowl!
I think we'll all agree this was somewhat misleading.
Don't you think?
Slap them.
No! You don't understand!
I'm not really with them.
I mean, how could I be?
While they were taking the tour,
I was in the belly of a whale!
What did you say?
I said, while they were on the tour,
I was in the belly of a whale!
But you're not dead.
No! That's just it!
I was in the whale for three days and nights!
Then I prayed to my god, and the great monster spit me up on the shore so that I could bring you all a message.
Asparagus, here in Nineveh, we bow to the Great Fish.
We celebrate the Great Fish in our art.
Yes, I noticed.
If what you are saying is true...
Yes. How do we know if he is telling the truth, sire?
Smell him.
Your Highness?
Smell him.
I'm terribly sorry.
I've been meaning to shower, but...
He has been in the Great Fish.
We must hear the message.
What? The message. Yes.
The message.
- What was the message?
- Come on!
It's been so long, I...
Yes.
Stop it!
Stop cheating. Stop lying.
And, especially, stop slapping people with fishes or this entire city will be destroyed!
A message from the Lord.
Well, the king was very upset.
He had no idea they weren't supposed to do that stuff.
No one had ever told him before.
"A decree from the king!
Let everyone call urgently to God.
"Let them give up their evil ways and their violence.
"Perhaps the god that brought this man out of the Great Fish
"will give us a second chance."
And let the asparagus and his friends go free.
So, the King and the people of Nineveh said they were sorry, stopped the fish slapping and started being nice to people.
- Wow! That's great!
- Yeah!
Everyone must've been really happy, right?
Well, almost everyone.
- Yes, thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- So long.
- Thank you!
Yes, thank you very much.
You see, Jonah figured God wouldn't really forgive the Ninevites.
I mean, they had done some terrible stuff.
No.
He figured God had something else in mind.
What are we doing?
It's time to watch the fun.
And what fun would that be?
Well, I did what I was supposed to do.
I warned them that they were going to get in big trouble.
So, now that they've had their warning, it's time to watch God wipe them off the face of the Earth!
I picked a safe distance so we won't get singed.
This is going to be great!
The bad guys finally getting what they deserve.
So, Jonah waited for God to destroy Nineveh.
Even now,
God was compassionate towards Jonah and caused a plant to grow that shaded him from the hot sun.
Yes! Very nice. Thank you.
Very nice.
Jonah kept waiting.
But it didn't seem like anything was happening.
He wondered if maybe God was forgetting something.
All right. I did my job.
So, fire! Brimstone! Whatever! You pick!
Right over there!
I'll just sit here under my weed and wait.
What happened?
What? How could you?
All your whining made me hungry.
It was just a weed.
Just a weed? It was my shade!
It was my friend!
Oh, dear Lord, how could you let this happen?
Would you look at yourself!
You care more about that weed than about all the people in Nineveh!
Well, I...
Why are you here now, instead of back in the belly of that whale?
Because God is compassionate!
He wanted to help you.
And because he is merciful, he gave you a second chance!
Oh, yes, and I'm very grateful...
Has it ever occurred to you that maybe God loves everybody?
Not just you! That maybe he wants to give everyone a second chance?
- Well...
- He saw that those people needed help, that they didn't know right from wrong, and he wanted to help them.
And that is why he sent you.
And when you told them what they were doing wrong, they said they were sorry.
They put down their mackerels and their halibuts, and they asked God for a second chance.
And, by golly, he gave them one!
Don't you see? God wants to give everyone a second chance.
And so should we.
Well, if they get a second chance, those fish slappers, well, then it would be better if I were dead!
I wish I were back in that whale!
You are pathetic.
You know, patience runs very deep in my family, but not that deep.
I am out of here.
What? What are you doing?
I wanted to be big and important, just like you.
But the world doesn't need more people who are big and important.
The world needs more people who are nice.
And compassionate. And merciful.
That's what I want to be.
You can find yourself a new traveling buddy. Goodbye.
- You can't just leave!
- Can and am.
But who will I talk to?
You can't just leave me here all alone?
Hello?
Carlyle? Reginald? Carlyle!
Khalil! Khalil! Khalil!
The end!
Wait a minute.
- It's over?
- Yep.
- That's how it ends?
- Yep.
But what did Jonah learn?
The question, my friends, is not, "What did Jonah learn?"
The question is, "What did you learn?"
Well, I learned that we need to help people who need help.
And we need to give second chances, even if they don't deserve them.
But what's that got to do with us?
Hey, Tomato.
Your friend there, the big asparagus.
If I'm not mistaken, he didn't do such a good job helping you with the map.
It was a disaster.
He said he was sorry and that he'd do better next time, but no way.
Mercy.
I guess everyone deserves a second chance.
Yep!
Now get out of here before my crab legs get cold.
You know, that still wasn't a very good way to end a story.
Well, what do you want?
A big musical number?
Well, yeah!
Who do they think I am? Twippo?
Yes?
- Twippo!
- Twippo!
What are you doing here?
Well, I have a concert tonight, but I'm running late.
Can't find Route 59 to save my life!
I stopped here for directions.
We're going to your concert tonight.
At least, we were.
And then porcupines!
And underwear!
And pirates!
And now it looks like we aren't going to make it at all.
Good heavens!
Well, if it's a ride you need,
I've plenty of room on my bus.
You can all come with me.
Yeah. Everyone but me.
Laura, you can have my ticket.
But, Junior, it was my fault.
Why, that was a very merciful thing to do.
Tell you what.
I'll give you all a ride to the concert, and I'll make sure you all have backstage passes!
Speaking of mercy, have any of you heard the story of a man named Jonah?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Well, would you like to hear a song about it?
Is it like the Bald Bunny song?
Not really.
It's more of a big musical number.
Perfect!
When I was a boy
I went to church back home in Arizona
And that is where I heard the tale
Of a man whose name was Jonah
Now, Jonah was a prophet
But that's not why he's remembered
We tell the tale 'cause in a whale
He nearly was dismembered
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to me
Exactly what God wants to see
And, yes, that is the point
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Now, Jonah set sail
On a pirate ship in a dreadful gale
Got eaten up by a giant whale
But managed not to be dead
You'd think he would learn a lot from being saved from an awful spot
But the second chance that he had got he didn't want to be spread
So poor old Jonah
Now he's all alone
Gotta use a megaphone to get it through to his head
Hey
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
If you've been watching, you can spot it
He did not get the point
Now, true, in your life you probably don't ride on a camel
And you probably won't wake up inside a large aquatic mammal
But all the same, like Jonah there is something you can do
Everyone deserves to get a second chance from you
Compassion and mercy
From me to you and you to me
Exactly what God wants to see
And, yes, that is the point
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
Jonah was a prophet
- But he really never got it
- Sad but true
Jonah was a prophet
I beg your pardon.
I hate to break up the party, but who needed a tow?
Have we met?
This is the song that runs under the credits
These are the credits
So this is where it goes
Has nothing to do with the movie so we'll say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
There once was a song that ran under the credits
That went with the movie
But this is not that song
Has nothing to do with the movie so we'll say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Wouldn't it be nice if the song under the credits
Had something to do with the movie you just saw
But that's not the case
So for now we'll have to say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
There should be a rule that the song under the credits
Remotely pertains to the movie's basic plot
That rule has not been made so for now we'll have to say
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Come on
Where you going?
I don't think we're done yet.
I'm gonna go home and take a nap.
Come on. We have contractual obligations to finish this one.
They paid for a full 79 minutes of entertainment, pal. Get back in the booth.
Wake me up for the prequel.
Come on. We were just starting to have fun.
Hey. What? Oh, man. I need a Tums.
What? What, are we done?
You mean, that's it?
If you want me, I'll be on the porch.

Well, then you wouldn't mind writing us some passes so we could, uh, practice some new moves?

She has been acting rather strange.
- Is it drugs?
- No, no.
I...I think it's her hormonal development.
She just ate six peanut-butter- and-jelly sandwiches and an entire carton of ice cream.
And what do you make of this, hmm?
It's April's soap.
Well?
What do you think?
I think you need more things to fill out your day.
Okay?
Are we done?
[ Laughs ]
[ Cellular phone rings ]
[ Beep ]
Hello?
[ Jessica crying in deep voice ]
All right, who is this?
I should have made love to you when I had the chance.
Ohhh...
Father Mulcahy?
[ Beep ]
[ Children shouting playfully ]
[ Gasps ]
[ High-pitched ]
Tell me I'm beautiful.
On the inside.
Look, uh...
Jessica has a problem.
She's only gonna make us wait an hour this time?
What about the class trip to Six Flags?
She took so long in the bathroom, we all missed the bus.
Our parents had to drive three hours to pick us up.
I had my period, okay?!
[ All gasp ]
[ All laughing ]
Okay, now that everybody's up to speed, can we start thinking about how I can get my life back?
Um, that's definitely gonna cost you a few votes for prom queen.
Yeah.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.
Come on, you guys, let's get serious. Stop dicking around.
[ Laughter ]
Guys!
I've got cheerleading competition, the prom.
None of my clothes fit.
I think I'm going bald.
And how am I gonna go to school?
She's right.
Okay...
Iet's think.
What could have caused this?
[ Gasps ] Maybe it wasn't an accident.
It's gotta be one of the people who hates Jessica that did this.
Yeah.
What are you talking about?
People don't hate me.
[ Exhales deeply ]
You see, Jess... because you are so beautiful and perfect...
Uh-huh?
...certain people might misconstrue some of the mean and hurtful things you say and do to them.
Although the things you say are funny...
[ Laughs ]
...people tend to focus more on their own public humiliation and shame.
So you're saying... people think...
I'm perfect?
Let's make a list of all the people who hate Jessica.
You know what would be a shorter list?
All the people who don't hate Jessica.
[ Laughter ]
You bitch!
[ All screaming and laughing ]
[ Screaming and laughter continue in distance ]
Easy on the coffee.
[ All laughing ]
Ha ha ha ha!
Ho ho ho!
- Ugh!
- Ohh!
[ Chuckles ]
Ugh!
[ Gasps ]
- Ugh!
- Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Ha ha ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
[ Gasps ]
- Ugh!
- Agh!
[ Laughing ]
[ Gulps ]
Huh?
Oh, hi.
Good morning.
[ Groans ]
Did you sleep well?
Mmm. Surprisingly, yes.
You have any... special dreams?
Not particularly.
Hmm.
You sure?
Why?
Oh, my God, my first boner!
[ Giggles ]
[ Brakes squeal ]
- RlCHlE: There you are!
- Ah!
You're the gardener from the service, right?
[ Mexican accent ] si.
Damn lawn's a mess.
It's my daughter's responsibility to look after it, but you know teenage girls. si, si.
"Teenageros."
Sorry. Richie Spencer.
Ah, um...
Taquito.
Oh, Taquito.
There's the mower.
There's your bag of fertilizer.
- Oh, ho! [ Gasping ]
- I'll let you get to it.
[ Salsa music plays ]
Damn, I love the smell of fresh-cut grass.
[ Air hisses ]
Gracias, but...I'm not sure
I'm old enough, señor.
[ Laughing ] Yeah, right.
What is the drinking age in Mexico -- 40?
Come on, take a load off.
You can finish in a minute.
[ Sighs ]
Hope you don't mind the light beer.
I had to cut back on account of the bloating.
Know what I mean?
I also had to give up the spicy food on account of my asshole.
[ Farts ]
Ah!
We're amongst men, aren't we?
[ Breathes deeply ]
"Stinko de mayo."
You like that car?
That's my daughter's.
Pretty nice, huh?
It would have looked even better in red.
That's what my daughter said.
We used to go out back on
Sundays and toss a few baskets, shoot the shit.
But she's got her own stuff going on now.
Who could blame her?
Whole family's falling apart.
What?
Things with the wife -- forget about it.
I mean, we sleep in the same bed.
Might as well be separate countries.
That is, like, so sad.
Ay-yi-yi!
Ay-yi...yi.
I tried everything.
Nothing worked.
I even got out the razor and gave myself a porn-star trim.
Wanna see? Check it out.
Aah!
Boy, she used to be wild.
The sex was great.
We'd be going at it, and she could still find a way to twist around and kiss me on the mouth. señor, information too mucho.
Emotional "scarro" -- disgusting.
It's good talking to you,
Taquito.
Oh!

APRlL: Come on, Hildenburg, don't play dumb.
You hate Jessica, you're good at this science crap.
Now, just confess and give us the antidote.
April, it's physically impossible for a woman to transform into a man overnight.
So you're saying that you had nothing to do with this.
Look...
Iet's just pretend this was an alternate universe where I actually believed you.
Why would I want to help
Jessica out, anyway?
[ Scoffs, sniffs ]
Jessica!
[ Sighs ]
Hildenburg...[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry that I humiliated you in front of the entire school... and the visiting 8th-graders.

Well, it is cold in here.
[ Laughs ]
So you never put a hex on me?
Oh, I put plenty of hexes on you -- to give you dandruff, make your hair fall out, make one of your boobs bigger than the other.
[ Laughing ] Oh, I think you got me with that one.
Heh hee hee! Ah hee hee!
[ Light laughter ]
There's some powerful cult magic at work here...
Iike an ancient spell... or voodoo... or Santeria.
What's Santeria?
It's a Latin-based form of witchcraft.
It originated in Africa and then eventually made its way to Cuba and Brazil.
Bianca!
I knew it.
Most of its rituals involve a chicken.
That sounds delicious.
I mean, interesting.
EDEN:
There's a way to tell.
A true practitioner of Santeria bears the mark of the scorpion tattooed on their back.
Bianca's always hanging out at that dance club -- lnstant Tang.

By that, I mean... my girlfriend's panties... which I carry with me... to pee in... if I don't make it in time... to the bathroom.
What?
You don't pee in your girlfriend's panties?
What kind of gay club is this?
Hey, everybody, check out this guy -- not peeing in his chick's panties.

Excuse me... do you have to be in here for this?
Well, it's part of my job description, but if you're one of those shy guys, you try that stall there.

Uh...there's someone in there.
And they're gonna be in there for a long time, too.

Oh! I've never done this before.
It's going all over.

Um, anyway, a-as I was saying, you haven't really provided me with --
Look, uh...

Uh, I'll be honest with you.

Y-You -- you -- you play the tuba?
Yes... in the honor band.

There's a myth of her using the earrings to escape a bad marriage.

But she didn't know that she had to bring the earrings back together, and she lived out her life as a slave girl.
Now, it appears that this myth is anything but.

I only want to have sex with her, but that's not what it's about.

I want it to be perfect.

I was in love.
How do you know for sure, anyway?
I think it's when you find someone that you can really be yourself with... share anything...you know?
You mean like best friends?
Yeah.
Love's when you can't even imagine what your life would be like without that other person, when words don't come close to how your heart really feels.
And even though it doesn't make sense to other people, you know you're meant to be together.
Yeah.
And you spend all night thinking about him.
And in the morning, you've never felt more rested.
Oh, it's like you have to grab on to something,
'cause it seems like your whole body's about to float away.
[ Gasps excitedly ]

Okay...
- [ Exhales sharply ]
- What?
I have an idea.
What? What, what?

WOMAN ON TV: Here's a bizarre story for you -- police are now searching for the hot chick bandit -- a beautiful young woman who lures men into dark alleyways, beats them senseless, and takes their wallets.
Well, we thought maybe she needed some help.
Yeah, we're helpful guys.
So we went into the alley, and then she starts wailing on me.
And let me tell you -- she didn't hit like a girl.
Luckily, Fitzy, the good guy that he is -- he was hiding behind a dumpster with a video camera.
Looks like she worked you over pretty good.
Yeah, well, don't get me wrong --
I got some shots in.

I wan to say that thanks for coming please excuse us for a poor-decorated place because we are still building our tower however we hope everyone to let our generous sponsors to see our exhibition first after the WW2 there were many generous people in Europe just like all of us here are all so determined and had started a organization to prevent human rights to be violated for hundreds of times however until now we still failed thank you very much many people still share our vision and shall continue to fight for it continue to fight against enmity prosecution and every violence moves excuse me what's the matter are you worried about everyone here to get the vision?
I am just hoping that
Everyone here will get a vision it is vision that made them to do this job once more if this world is real there were so many abnormal people most of them will not join our activities
I have an idea can we stop this exhibition of human's violence and change it to exhibit some human helping others? hiding the truth cannot help the others
I ask you. In your heart which one will you choose to be the man who kill people or the man being killed
I still have something to do nice to meet you we will talk later ah, thanks what is the progress our exhibition is quite successful

I just turned the truth of universe translated to something you understand but you must be chaste you mast not kill any living things
I have not killed it
I just want to eat it right, I got the answer for your question
Is it?
Is it? listen why? There are ten in each package of hotdog but in Hotdog-package you can only find eight hotdogs the reason is that you always need more hot dog so no matter how many times you have succeed or failed you never feel enough it is a good try
I hate you knowing other means you have wisdom if you know yourself, then you are preached
Enough for your philosophy
I have found the target
Stay in your position.

You are very welcomed in here
Brother Tian-Xing
Let me find a place for you to rest
Please drink another cup of our fine tea
I also want to drink tea, I’m thirsty
I traveled a lot lately, did I lie?
Hello Brother
We hold it like this then release
Brother, who's that young man?
A thief
You shake hand pretty hard
It's a little pity, its not strong enough
A thief? Why did you bring him here?
There is no fish in the clearest water
I understand
My uncle told me the thing that happen Sixty years ago in Chon-Zhen temple
You are the next in line to protect her
He was very young
I can never forget that day
The magical power of the scroll
We have been preparing for this for Sixty years
This is the Sheep Year, its almost coming?
I have a few good students in this Temple
And a very promising heir
Very good
I didn't use any strength yet
You think you can win, but you can never beat me
This is what you think
I am sure
This doesn't only depend on study, you also need to fulfill the prophecy
I believe you will agree also
The prophecy is not suitable to use on a common thief a common thief
Prophecy holds a mean for everyone, or else it will have no meaning yes you put your hands away first
No
We are only playing
We'll play next time
Ok, next time
You were helping me to escape
I thought I should help you
Start now then
Here, this is special medicine
Its effect is very strong, smoothing, and cooling
Here, is my special medicine
I made this with my piss
This is gorse
I'm sorry
What?
I'm looking for a person named Kar, I heard he works here
Why would a beautiful girl like you look for him?
He might be in trouble
You are right
Its been a long time, and he is still not back to prepare for tonight’s movie
So you haven't seen him today?
Don't worry he can take care of himself
I just call him to help for some parts.
What about the others?
I don't know why, but I feel this kid have lots of potential.
He said so, too
- Can u do me a favour to send this to him?
- Am I looking like a secretary?
I beg you
No problem
You must learn how to inosculate stabilization is important when you moving make the attack at the same time when you defend
All your weapons you used when you want to attack are wrong.
The point is not to be angry but to be peaceful focus on the concinnity instead of the strength
To know yourself instead of your enemy
How can you do that? you cant see the air, but it in your lung indeed just like the blood or the body or bone or the water or clay
If you understand is, it will be much useful face the air with the same attitude
You should step on just like step on a piece of stone
You should swim just like swimming in the sea.
What you should do is to believe
Do you believe the law of gravitation?
If you don’t believe it, it will not exist get down you should take the scroll carefully, don't lose it over there stay here this is air group, the target is at roof no no retreat, I was shot no! Help me are you ok? listen to me, I’m sorry about the scroll thanks for your saving
I am almost dead
I am a thief not a hero

Kar don't you wanna know the truth? are you gonging to tell me? are you gonging to tell me? who the hell are you the lansquenet the boss is a Nazi who is infatuated with famine and ghost in the past don' be scared god is real and eternal what you said sounds like you just came from another world in fact
I just want to know whether you a believer of Buddha, but
I know that my hair is too little do u like the music? yes that's great
I'm going to call my future wife as you wish
I was in Kashmir to study the Lysenkoism of domestication until Strucker found me again
Strucker, he is the leader he wanna change the world according to his mind every kind of race all religion and complexion must be erase, actually it's destroy all races will be destroyed
If such a crazy thing is true you should rescue the scroll, not me
I regard about my life, but I also regard all of world what about? this is just a recipe of steaming noodle it's noodle soup although you are my granddaughter but if you make mistake, I will punish you definitely where is the scroll it's with my body and spirit
I’ve escaped here for a long time several times its very dangerous
The scroll must be very safe formerly you've protected the scroll for 16 years?
Look at you, you are still young any protector of the scroll is being took care by time if protector gets sickness, he will heal if get injury, he will recover that's because of the protector of the scroll is also protected by the scroll how are you? sorry, the show time is postponed would you like to have some free popcorn don’ need, thanks board of health hey, I got "A" certificate of health
A young man who worked for you living here
You are violating The Sanitation and Safety Codes
I don't know what you are talking
Could this remind you of something?
I should call police, you crazy monk
I am not freak
But I am a monk
Hi, Mr. Hideo
My boss is not here so you can't find him
I call loudly bad girl
Mr. Hideo
Kar is here
I am sorry, Kar
I should not have got you involved with this mess
I just thought it should be perfect
I got a crazy idea
And you will be the one to realize it
I told you
They will not give up until they get the Scroll and me
We can hide in a safe place and forget about all
Bye Kar
We are going to take off
Monk!
Monk!
Fuck, open the door
Somebody? let's go
I am sorry if I waked you up
Do you remember we had met before?
This monk is with me
This monk is with me
He is my friend
Stop it, he is my friend.
Hi
Listen to me
You can not do it alone
Protecting the Scroll is just my own duty
So I do not need other people's assistance
If it need me to protect the Scroll for 60 years, I will do it
I should be temporarily safe here
I will leave tomorrow
So what about me?
Kar, I am sorry
But it will be better for both of us.
No, you can not put me away
I have experienced so much
Nothing to worry about
They are coming
No, my brother
Where are you going now?
Where is him
Downstairs
Stop!
Why?
Because I do not want to protect the Scroll
I just want to read it and get the power though I should share eighth some ones
Are you kidding?
Trust me, I can bring us out of this city
My monk brother
Do you know, before the end of World War II
We invented an interrogation machine
It is so painful that everybody could not resist
They all hurry to confess before their death
Now let's make a test
No, let me go
What are you doing?
We have made an agreement!
How can you believe
I am willing to share the ultimate power with you?
Start the hydraulic system
The hydraulic system started
What a crap! there is nothing in his brain
Find that monk the Captain is a good man
He can send us to the place we chose
Are you alright?
I am fine
I brought me to the right way, I should thank you, Kar
According to the tradition,
You should make a phone before you visit the girl's home
It is midnight now
She could refuse us if we call her but if I show my handsome face before her
She cannot reject my smart face
I do not listen to monk's opinion about the girl
Hide here at evening that is a bad idea
Must believe your own instinct
Can you find a safer place than a guarded house?
How can we make ourselves into it
Why ask me? You are the thief.
OK
The key to enter the house is to lead away the guard and do it quickly
Leads away the guard and do it quickly
No one now? help me up
You jump up by yourself this time, ok?
OK
It's all right. I'm calculating the distance
I know
You really do not want to jump?
I don't think that is good
I don't think that is good
I don't think that is good
I don't think that is good
OK?
Look do you feel dizzy?
I am all right
Good
You are enjoying looking at me, right?
Yes, enjoys pretty much
.... Let's go...
OK. I must forget what I've learned before
All the universe laws cross the air just like step on the stone and swim in the sea
What you need to do is just believe it
What you need to do is just believe it
What you need to do is just believe it
What you need to do is just believe it
Check it, is there anything?
An Rare insect and fatal reptile's amateur
My God, bad girl
Kar, Why do you come here?
You've lost this one, right?
Not LOST but you stole it.
Of course NOT liar. you are a thief do you think that I will believe you?
I'm a good man, and I would not have stolen it
You can not cheat me
It seems you cannot be cheated
OK, I did steal it
But I just want to borrow it
It is silly to give it to you in this way
Sometimes I'm really a bastard
I lied about the necklace but my identity is true
You mean I'm rich
Yes. Look at you, I thought you are as poor as me
But you are rich
You know nothing about me
I think I know
You seems like that?
Why you came?
Because I thought I can believe you
Threw is some mystical writing grained on that monk's body
Then there is
Madman of The World War 2 who wants to rule the world
You are mad?
Are you all right, Kar?
He will be all right
What do you want to do?
You should not have asked this question
You should ask yourself why. every evening, you leave this imperial palace
Then hurry back at morning
I respect you, but I don't want others to teach me how to live
I have never thought you how to live your life.
I only suggested you to live an...
One complete life is certainly better than two
Incomplete life and more joyful
Kar
I should have phoned you
Sorry, my life is too complex
My father is Aiyinqulisf
What? That Devil Aiyin?
That's great, You are the princess of Russian Mafia
My name is Jade
My father is in the federal jail for 20 years.
So this is why I don't want others to know my things.
Only on the street that I can find my self back
He will fight for love in the Jade Palace two. Of the three prophesy have been finished
What?
Just prophesy.
Smart
Be careful, his body is invaluable
They must find your address in the theater
We must go, quick
Go where?
Go to the urban district of the human rights organization headquarter
Should it be useful?
The one who just destroyed my house is the organization's CEO
I saw it in the exhibition
My father often said
The most place of security is a place which nobody concerns
No one would think it is just the headquarter where the most serious criminal of human rights hides in
Thanks.
I will go alone to rescue the monk, he is...
Let me help you.
Do you like my armor car?
Kar
We can go through the tunnel the water pipe towards the headquarter building.
Woo... .
Your father's collection in the garage is wonderful
These are not my father's
At my childhood, father told me
About you
At start I thought it is fiction just made up to roar me to sleep
Until one day he showed me this
Is it strange?
Why I can always find you around?
Oh, my name is Nina
You don; t have a name, right?
This tattoo is very sex
You were tattooed to which part?
To here, so it seems I must scan it by every inch
Right, it is hard work but must be someone to do it.
We may be killed, you know?
Leaves here
You dare to go with me... you are really brave
Bravery and madness together...
In this situation, we will be killed
It is the worst choice
Absolutely.
Look at me, monk.
Time is completely ineffective to you.
But I'm old.
But this will help Nina watch out!
Stop him
Nina, what is going on? Quick
You two go to the right side
Don't move
Hey, be gentle
You have indeed potential.
The monk is below, I feel.
Follow me, be careful.
Give it to me
The Last Part
Where is the others?
Where is the last part of the scroll?
I have already copied it down
Just to prevent you alike from getting the text.
Damn, be quick.
Go up, quick.
Aaa...
Kar
How are you, my dear?
Nice to see you here.
To tell you,
I don't have the patience with you
My god.
Are you all right?
I'm OK.
Let's go to kill him
I will do it alone.
Really? Is it me that rescued you?
Kar, back.
No.
My god.
The last part or I kill you
If you kill me, you will never see the scroll
Maybe you don't care sacrifice yourself
But can you let him be killed?
The Last PART.
Or I will release.
Kar, remember, you can win.
Monk. If I cannot get it,
I will take away you and scroll as well.
For the last 60 years, I have been giving you chance to change your attitude
I won't be changed
Hello!
Everything is end
Not yet you are the next. When you rescued me, you finished the 3rd prophesy
My time is over, but yours is at the start
Finished...
Aaaa...
Be careful!
Jade
He will be with crowd of white cranes
Still be able to defeat groups of enemies
I've already got tired of punch this loser
He will fight for love in the Jade Palace
He will rescue the one who he has never seen and not his brother as well
Your two have completed the three prophesies
No matter it is two incomplete lives or a complete life
I think you are not the only one who is invarlumne
She is coming.
You are ready, but have the last thing to finish
It is the last volume of the scroll
This is the second part
You two cannot be departed
Enjoys your vacation
What are you doing?
Check what has gone.
I still remember the first time you hugged me
Yes, I remember it
Why does the hotdog is ten in each package but hotdog-package only has eight in each one?
It because you cannot be satisfied during all your life.
Therefore you should satisfy with
- What you can frequently obtain
- The hamburger
You answered correctly.
Let's run it.

Hey, punk.
I been thinkin'...
You been thinkin'?
That's a change of pace.
Got a pretty big mouth for someone so...
- Don't say it.
- So short.
He ain't short!
I'm not short.
I'm just height-challenged.
What's height-challenged?
Better than bein' brain-challenged.
You wanna back that big mouth up of yours and play me one-on-one for your jersey?
Ox, leave him alone!
What's the matter, Calvin?
Don't push Murph, man.
Would you guys just stop this?
Calvin, let's just go.
No, no.
Let me handle this.
Exactly how are you gonna handle this?
Listen, if I say no...
He beats you up.
OK. Now, if I say yes...
He still beats you up.
And you'll lose your jersey.
Listen...
I can take him.
I mean, Kobe wouldn't back down from no challenge.
Allen Iverson wouldn't back down from no challenge.
And MichaelJordan sure as heck is not backin' down from no challenge,
And neither is Calvin Cambridge.
E-Excuse me.
Take a number, Ox,
'cause you're about to be served.
[Kids Laughing]
Theyjust don't make these things for...normal-sized people, you know?
That's gotta hurt.
Go on ahead and laugh if you want, but you guys won't be laughing when I get 5 new jerseys from the family who's gonna adopt me.
You ain't gettin' adopted.
Yes, I will,
'cause I have a destiny.
All orphans are special.
All orphans have destinies.
Maybe in books, but you wanna name a real one?
Moses.
[Kids Laugh]
And Nelson Mandela and Marilyn Monroe and Daunte Culpepper.
Who plays in the NFL.
James Avery:
This calls for champagne.
Man...
I want a family like that to adopt me.
Look how theyjust get along with each other.
That's what I really want.
Kid: Oh, man, why'd you do that?
All right. Kids... let's get to work.
Murph:Fresh candy.
Reg:Please?
Right here.
Hi. Would you like to buy some candy, ma'am?
Hi. What about you?
Fresh candy. $2.00.
Hey, you guys wanna buy some candy?
If you don't buy, I don't eat.
[Mumbling]
Hey, you want some candy?
Reg:It's for the Chesterfield group home.
Calvin:
Candy bar, anybody?
Can we have some candy?
Please, Daddy?
No. We'll get treats inside.
Girls, don't ever give money to a kid like this. It's a big scam.
Joad is down low.!
He's open.!
Tracy Reynolds, you need to pass the ball!
But Tracy shoots!
Both:
And it's nothin' but... rim.
And the Knights lose by one.
What was Tracy Reynolds thinking?
No! No!
Man!
Look at the coach.
He's on fiire!
Let's go back to work, man.
Go back to work?
Nobody buys when we lose, Murph.
Man,you didn't even sell half your candy.
We could lose our TV privileges...again.
Is that Coach Wagner?
I think so.
S-Stay right here.
I'll be right back.
Valet: You have a good one.
Thank you.
Hey, coach.
Bet you could use some candy after that one.
Tough loss.
You shoulda seen it up close.
You had it won!
You diagrammed the perfect play!
Sure, Harrison didn't set the low pick, but why didn't Tracy pass the ball?
Son...that is one for the ages.
Hey, wait a minute.
It's 1 0:00.
It's a school night.
Do your parents know you're out this late?
I'm an orphan.
And I'm out here selling candy so that I can raise money for the group home.
Oh. Well... listen, how 'bout this, uh... will that get me a chocolate bar?
No.
I can't charge you, coach.
I don't even know if the money really goes to the... to the group home.
What's your name, son?
My name is Calvin.
Calvin Cambridge.
Calvin, have you ever seen the Knights play in the arena?
No, sir.
Well, since you won't take my money, how about if I get you some tickets for Sunday's game?
Really?
You can pick 'em up at will call.
I will! Thanks, coach.
Nice talking to you.
Murph!
Hello. Good to see you.
There's, uh, children everywhere, so...
[Low Background Chatter]
He's so adorable.
I'm feelin' good about this, y'all.
Today's the day
I'm gonna get adopted.
You ain't gettin' adopted.
None of us are.
Face it. We're like dogs.
Parents only want the puppies.
So much for me being special.
Hey, things could change.
I mean, your destiny could be right here and you don't even know it.
Calvin!
Where are you going?
Off to do that history homework you owe me since yesterday?
Yes, Sister Theresa.
OK, Murph, there is a winter coat here that's just right for you.
Try it on.
Sister Theresa, do you know anything about these shoes right here?
I'm not sure.
[Whispers]
It's a perfect fiit.
Well, the guy who dropped them off said they used to belong to some famous basketball player when he was a kid.
Um...which... which basketball player?
Uh... you know, the... the tall bald one.
MJ.
Murph, Reg, come here, look.
Look at the shoes.
MJ.
MJ?
MJ?
All: It can't be.
MichaelJordan?
Was it MichaelJordan?
Go. Do your homework.
It's gotta be! MichaelJordan wore these sneakers, man.
Did you say...
MichaelJordan?
Yeah. I said MichaelJordan.
Give 'em back.
They could be anybody's.
Let me take a look.
No, man.
They're his, man.
Yeah, how do you know they're not?
'Cause no one ever gives us nothin' good.
Just abandoned junk that no one wants.
Like us.
Murph: We're not junk.
Well, I want 'em!
Oh, yeah?
Then go get 'em.
[Snoring]
I want those sneakers.
Murph!
Murph!
[Squeak]
- Hmm?
- Wake up!
I gotta get those sneakers.
Suppose Ox is right and they're not MJ's.
They are MJ's sneakers.
I know they are.
Then we'll get 'em in the morning.
Not in the morning.
Not while Ox is around.
Besides, they'll get ruined in the rain.
I gotta get 'em now!
Well, Calvin, seems like a really great idea.
Unh.
Aah!
Calvin, be careful.!
Don't fall!
[Thunder]
Ohh.
[Thunder]
Oh.
Ohh!
Whoa.
The tickets were there just like Coach Wagner said.
I can't believe we're gonna see a real NBA game.
Oh, me, neither.
How'd you get those tickets?
We just did.
I'm telling Bittleman.
Ox, you can rat on us to Mr. B, but, uh, you'll miss the game, too.
Yeah! Yeah!
He just dunked the ball!
He dunked the ball!
Geoff Witcher:
The Knights have one more chance here to chip away at this lead before halftime.
They're not shooting well.
Open at the wing is Reynolds.
He puts it up...
Oh, no good.
Oh, man.
Reynolds misses another shot, and that's the end of the fiirst half.
Minnesota Timberwolves out in front of the Knights by 1 2, and once again, the Knights did not play very good basketball in the fiirst half.
Hey, good half.
Good half.
Good half.
We're in great shape.
Great shape.
We'll win it back. Yeah.
Henderson, attaboy.
It's permissible to run in this game, incidentally.
Yeah. Dvigatsya, Krilov.
Dvigatsya. Yeah.
Man: Tracy.
Tracy Reynolds, hey, what a wizard.
You're a magician out there tonight.
Small favor.
Oh, no. No, no.
I don't do halftime shows, man.
I'm not some chalupa giveaway.
Hey, those chalupas upped attendance by 4,000.
You're familiar with Mr. Granger, the man who owns the team?
I have a very good relationship with Mr. Granger.
He hasn't called me in 4 years.
He called this morning.
And he's ready to clean house if we don't put some asses in those seats.
Hello, Los Angeles!
And welcome to your halftime show!
Tonight, some lucky fan will get the chance to go one-on-one with Tracy Reynolds, the straw that stirs your L.A. Knights.
Yeah, T-time, baby! Yeah!
Check your ticket stubs.
If your number is called, come on down!
And bring your 'A"game.!
Drumroll, please.
[Drumroll]
Come on.
Whoa. Oh,jeez.
[Drum Stops]
I have the winning ticket.
Getting excited, Tracy?
Yeah. Yeah, very excited.
Well, so am I.
And here we go.
"Section 4..."
"row 1 4... "
That's our row, that's our row.
"Seat 2. "
I got the ticket!
Come on down!
Show us what you got!
Naw, I got the ticket.
Listen, you little runt, if you can't score on me, how you gonna get by a Knight?
Oh, shoot, here come a redcoat.
Security.
Psych!
Stop.
And here comes our winner now.
All right. Heh heh.
Well...boy, this is gonna be some contest.
Well, son, what's your name?
Ahem.
Ca...Calvin Cambridge.
Well, Calvin,
I'd like you to meet Tracy Reynolds.
Man, this is...this is crazy.
This is so cool.
How you doin', little man?
Tracy.
All right.
I'm playing Tracy.
I'm playing...
I can't even say it.
I'm so happy.
I'm playing T-time.
[Amplifiier Feedback]
Wait a minute.
Was this supposed to do that?
[Thump Thump Thump]
Man, this is kind of loud.
Hey, stand up.
Can you hear me?
- Murph, stand up.
- Calvin!
I can't hear you.
Calvin, up here!
I still can't hear you.
Jump up and down like a rabbit or something.
The crowd is eating this up.
Don't embarrass the kid.
Let him score twice.
Once.
Twice!
Once.
Hey, Murph, we gotta get one of these.
OK, OK, Calvin.
Very good.
Now, you're gonna have 60 seconds, OK?
Let's get the show on the road!
All right, all right.
You ready, little man?
Man:Hey, kid, tie your shoe.
Thank you, sir.
We like our players to be loose, not their laces.
[Whispers]
Make me like Mike.
OK...go!
Good luck to you, all right?
Here we go.
Whoo-hoo. Hoo-hoo.
Aw.
- You like that?
- I'm jealous.
- Whoo-hoo.
- Aw, OK.
Got that?
Very nice.
Calvin has just won himself an L.A. Knights sweatshirt.
Computer: Chessmaster 2000.
Would you like to play a game?
And we begin.
Pawn to queen 4.
That was really nice.
That was really nice.
Really? Thanks.
Can't go that way.
Can't go that way.
I didn't know it was like that.
Yeah, you didn't know it was like that?
Uh-huh, can't go that way, either.
Come on, now.
Tracy Reynolds.
Man, I play "D."
That's what I'm playing.
Oh.
Whoa.
Oh.
Whoo!
How did I do that?
Now, how did he do that?
He just won a signed basketball with an impressive 30-footer.
That one was sweet, wasn't it?
Nobody said nothing about this kid embarrassing me out here.
That's your last shot, little man.
Recess is over.
Bernard: One more shot, and he wins $ 1,000.
Tracy Reynolds, baby.
You got what, 9 seconds?
Let's do it.
I'm really sorry...
It's all right, little man.
Come on, little man.
Come on.
Come on, what you got?
It's my gym, baby.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
Back. OK.
Uh-huh.
[Total Silence]
Y...es.
Computer:Pawn takes Knight.
Hah!
[Silence]
All right, Calvin!
Whoo!
[Raucous Cheering]
Yeah.
Go, Calvin!
I guess this would be a bad time for me to ask for your autograph, huh?
Hi there! Oh.
Playing a little checkers I see, huh?
Computer:Error. Error.
I was about to win.
So, are you the man I see about Calvin Cambridge?
OK, let me get this straight...
You guys want to have Calvin play for the Knights?
Right.
Why?
I been coaching 3 5 years.
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard of.
Well, you didn't see him play at halftime.
Hey, coach.
Hi...again.
Am I gonna be a Knight?
[Softly]
He's 4 1 l2 feet tall.
I know.
Can you imagine the press we're gonna get?
Look, coach, I know attendance is in the crapper, OK, and I'm not averse to using the word "gimmick."
This is about making money.
I see. And speaking of money...
Ah, yes, money.
Mr. Bittleman,
I'm prepared to make you an offer of $5,000 for a one-day contract.
Ah...well.
Uh, seeing that
I'm Calvin's guardian, uh...
I do have to make certain that nobody takes advantage of him.
You mean except for you?
Hey, I resent that.
Uh, Mr. Bittleman, uh, perhaps, uh, perhaps, uh... an extra 2,500 might help ease your worries.
Deal.
Good.
I always knew that there was something special about Calvin.
Wow, man, you're on the Knights.
I can't believe you're gonna get to play in the NBA.
I still can't believe what happened to me yesterday.
Whatever I wanted to do with the rock, I could do.
Whatever I wanted to do on the court, I could do.
And there he was...
Tracy Reynolds, NBA superstar... and I outplayed him.
Yeah, man.
And you hit that "J." Fade-away.
Calvin: That was a swish.
That was a swish.
You alley-ooped yourself off the backboard.
Reg: Yeah, that was hot.
But...how?
That's a good question.
I don't know.
All I know is that before I had these...
All: Sneakers.
I couldn't play like that if my life depended on it.
Murph, hand me that ball.
Man... you're like some weird basketball Cinderella.
[Whispering]
Yeah, and the clock's gonna strike midnight if somebody fiinds out.
Wow, I wish I was going with you.
Me, too.
We'll be rooting for you.
- Come on, let's go.
-Yeah.
Hey, everybody.
Hey, Trace, you need to get your notebook out
'cause the kid is back to school you again.
Ha ha ha. Your mama.
[Laughter]
Hey, Tracy, look,
I'm sorry about the other day.
No, no, no.
It's all right, little man.
No need to be sorry, all right?
You got lucky.
It's all right.
Hey, I'm Joad.
Why don't you take the locker next to mine?
Here's your uniform, Calvin.
Special ordered... ofiicial shirt, shorts, socks, and sneakers.
Uh, but I like my own sneakers.
Oh...ours aren't good enough for the kid.
No, it's nothing like that.
It's just that
I play better in mine.
Play?
You just have to look good.
What do you mean?
Coach, may I please ask you a question?
Sure.
Coach, I have a lot of friends here tonight, and, uh...
I was just wondering... wondering, am I here to play, or am I just here for show?
Calvin, I'm gonna be straight with you.
You were hired tonight just to increase attendance, not to play.
Man.
But...I saw the tape of that halftime show you put on.
You got some game.
I am honored to have you on my team.
Thanks, coach.
You bet.
Whoo.!
Whoo.!
Geoff: We've got a bigger than usual crowd tonight, and a lot of it is curiosity.
The Knights have a brand new player.
He's 4-foot, 8-inch Calvin Cambridge, joining us straight from the playground of the Chesterfield group home.
Reggie, your reaction.
Geoff, this is unprecedented.
I can't imagine what the Knights players are thinking. We'll see what happens.
We're gonna fiind out shortly.
Both clubs are taking the court as we get ready for tonight's opening tip.
Go Knights!
What was that?!
Admiral! Admiral!
The admiral just waved at me.
He just waved at me.
Admiral!
Hey...
Come on! Hey! Hey!
Geoff: Coach Wagner of the Knights has seen enough.
He wants and gets a time-out.
Let's go. Let's go.
Good hustle, baby.
What?
Come on, guys.
It's not funny.
Now, offense, is there any play that's gonna work for us tonight?
I have an idea.
Oh, man.
I've been watching, and they're vulnerable from the weak side, especially to a pick set away from the hoop.
Why don't we run the give-and-give-and-go?
You mean the give-and-go?
No, see, they'll be expecting that.
Have Tracy feed the ball to Henderson.
Henderson's gonna feed the ball toJoad.
Joad's gonna pass it back to Tracy.
As Henderson sets the pick,
Tracy's gonna take the shot.
I like it.
Oh, no. No.
I'm not gonna run some play by some snotty-nosed kid, man.
Damn straight, coach.
Fine. Henderson, you're out.
Tracy, you take Henderson's slot.
Calvin, you take the shot.
What?
Have you lost your mind?
- You said I could play anybody I want.
- Yeah, well, I didn't mean him.
Am I the coach or not?
You are. For now.
Can you believe it, Reggie?
It looks like the kid's gonna play.
A rousing welcome for the man they came to see, the little fella,
Calvin Cambridge, into the game for the Knights.
Calvin! Run the play!
What's he doin'?
- Run the play.
- No.
Would you just run the play?
Time out! White!
Why'd you call time out?
Uh...I gotta pee.
He's gotta pee.
Announcer:
Calvin Cambridge is calling for a bathroom break?
I guess when you gotta go,
Reggie,you gotta go.
[Crowd Laughs]
Yes!
The crowd is roaring.
That can mean just one thing.
That little guy,
Calvin Cambridge, has taken care ofbusiness in the locker room and is back on the court.
He's done.
Ladies and gentlemen, this kid's for real.
He can play some basketball.
## Tied up, tied up ##
## You got me so ##
## You got me so ##
##Doo doo do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do ##

Slam dunk over David Robinson.!
Unbelievable.!
1 2 seconds to go, the Knights trail by 2.
Trying to fiind some way to actually come back and win this thing.
It's good.! The Knights win.!
Am I a genius or what? Huh?
Tell me I'm a genius!
Announcer:
This is the NBA on NBC.
The big story in the NBA:
Calvin Cambridge, the 4-foot-8 dynamo, has now signed a lucrative contract with the Knights.
And no wonder, after he led them to a come-from-behind win over the Spurs with 27 points?
That kid was unbelievable.
Did I just see the admiral saluting him at the end of the game?
You know, Cambridge's contract makes him the youngest, and the shortest person ever to sign a deal with the NBA.
He's lean, he's mean, he's 1 3.
Yeah, now all the kids are gonna be saying,
"I wanna be like Calvin."
Well, I guarantee you one thing, this orphan will not be an orphan for long.
I can't believe you're going on the road with the Knights.
Can I fiit in your suitcase?
Hey, what about me?
Bittleman.
Hey, Calvin, this is great.
Well, uh, I'm proud of you.
Listen, uh, when you're on the road, uh, people might want to adopt you.
But you should realize it's, uh, only because you're a celebrity now, and, uh, they're just after your money.
Besides,your contract forbids it.
Wait a minute. Forbids it?
Oh, yeah.
Didn't I tell you?
Uh, I signed your contract as your guardian, so, um, as long as you're playing for the Knights, that can't change.
Hey, coach, check this out!
Pretty good.
Welcome to
Self-Hypnosis for the Fearful Flier.
During today's peaceful flight, you'll transport yourself into a state...
Tracy.
What?
Relax. Flight's fiine.
Just came by to say hello.
OK, my bad. I'm sorry.
You are familiar with the NBA mentoring program, are you not?
Oh, no. No. No. No.
You don't even know what I'm gonna ask.
No, I do know what you're gonna ask, and it's not gonna happen.
You're trying to punish me.
No.
The kid's rooming with you.
I think it would be good for both of you.
[Crash]
We're goin' down!
[People Laugh]
Whoa. Whoa.
No. No. No.
There is no way in the world
I'm gonna be roomin' with that kid.
I'm callin' my agent.
You know why?
'Cause it ain't gonna happen.
This gonna be so cool roomin' together.
Uh, my boy Murph says I snore.
I think he has to be trippin' sometimes.
Maybe we could rent NBA Street.
Or if you don't like that, we could play Monopoly.
Or if you don't like Monopoly, then we couldjust sit around and rap, because I love to talk.
Oh, yeah, I noticed.
Have fun, Tracy.
[Laughs]
All right, look.
Coach says I gotta room with you, so let me set down the rules right now.
First of all,
I ain't your boy, OK?
I'm not gonna be playin'
Monopoly with you,
Game Cube, Rubik's Cube...
Anything with a cube,
I ain't playin'.
Third, you know, I'm not gonna be tuckin' you in at night, and I'm defiinitely not gonna read you the Three Little Bears, you got that?
Whoa! Look at this!
Do we always stay in places this fancy?
Mm-hmm.
OK.
All right, I'm goin' out.
Oh, um, w-would you like some company?
No. No,
I wouldn't like company.
Well, what do I do?
Uh, well, um... oh, call room service, get some food.
But what's room service?
Right. Right. OK.
Here's what you do.
You pick up this phone, right?
Mm-hmm.
And you dial "6".
Tell them what you want and they'll bring it to the room...for free.
For free?
For free.
You got it. Eat up.
No, you gotta be messin' with me, right?
No, I'm not.
Try it yourself.
For free.
Hello?
Uh, yes.
Um, is this room service?
Yes, it is.
And will you really bring me up some food for free?
Well, sure.
Anything you like, sir.
You will?
OK, um, in that case,
I'll have a pepperoni pizza, french fries, and cake, ice cream, and lobster tails.
Lots oflobster, lots of seafood.
Chicken fiingers, french fries...
[Calvin Moaning]
Ah, man.
[Groans]
Um, you know what?
Let me...
I just want to clean up just a little, OK?
Well, that's OK.
No. No. No. I just want to clean up this...
Hey, you're so beautiful,
I have to clean up for you.
No, it's all right.
OK, so I'll be right back.
Calvin, I need you...
Calvin, what are you doing?
What are you making such a mess for?
You were right about room service.
OK, Calvin. Calvin.
Know what?
I need you to get lost.
OK? I don't care where you go, just get lost.
Joad wants to play NBA Street.
No, Calvin, not in there.
Calvin, no! Calvin!
Calvin! Calvin!
[Hushed]
Calvin! Calvin!
Hey.
[Chuckles]
Hey, you know what?
The maid forgot to come today and, you know, maybe we could go to your place?
Is someone else in here?
Because I thought
I heard some voices.
Oh, there's...Really.
There's no one in there.
Oh, my God.
Oh, where'd he come from?
You're Calvin Cambridge, aren't you?
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?
We're gonna get you out of these clothes and get you some air, OK?
Oh, brother. Here we go.
[Burps]
Oh! You are just the sweetest thing!
[Giggles]
Isn't he just the sweetest thing?
[Mutters]
Tracy, you should have told me
Calvin was your roommate.
Yeah, well, it must have slipped my mind.
See, me and Tracy are tight.
So that's why I call him T-time.
So cute.
So, what's your nickname for Calvin,
T-time?
I don't have one yet, but, oh, so many of them come to mind.
Is that better, baby?
Yeah, I think T-time needs some, too.
Oh! Ha ha!
$2,000 jacket.
Gettin' water on a $2,000 jacket.
Couldn't you just eat him up?
Sorry about taking your girl.
She's not my girl, and you didn't take her.
I don't know what it is.
It's like some type of curse.
The girls just like me.
Can we go to sleep?
Well, aren't we gonna say our prayers?
'Cause at the home we always say our prayers.
We're not at the home.
Well, I can't go to sleep until I say my prayers.
Then say your prayers.
All right.
Well, aren't you gonna say 'em with me?
Bow your head.
Bow your head.
Both:
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.
God bless Murph,
God bless Reg,
God bless Coach Wagner,
God bless MichaelJordan, and God bless Tracy.
Amen.
Anybody that you want to bless?
A girlfriend, or your parents, maybe?
No, my parents are gone.
Hey, um...
I'm sorry.
I guess that makes you an orphan like me.
Yeah, I guess.
Why don't you get in bed?
All right.
Good night.
There's just one thing.
Can we sleep with the light on?
'Cause at the home we always sleep with the light on.
OK, we'll sleep with the light on.
Satisfiied?
I don't wanna hear another sound tonight, OK?
Good night.
[Snoring]
[Snoring Louder]
Oh, man.
What's the matter, Tracy?
Late night?
Yeah, real late night. Heh.
Ain't that right, Trace?
Really? How late?
See, there's this girl named Janet Kelly came up to the room, fiine as can be.
She picked me and Tracy up.
We didn't come back to the room about 1:00 in the morning.
He doesn't know better, but you know the rule about the ladies in the room, and last time I checked, curfew was midnight.
No, it was his snorin' that kept me up all night.
Oh, you always got an excuse.
Look, if you think helping him break curfew is gonna get you out ofbein'his mentor, you're mistaken... and if you miss curfew again,
I'm gonna have to suspend you. Got it?
Yeah, I got it.
You know what, man?
You got to learn how to chill.
Tracy, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.
Don't worry, man.
I won't mess up again.
I promise.
Yeah, I know it's not gonna happen again.
You know why?
Because you're gonna go your way, and I'm gonna go my way.
Tracy, we still gonna be cool on the court, though, right?
Man.
Um, Mr. Iverson, sir, uh,you're one of my favorite players.
Who are you, the mascot?
I was wondering, may I please have your autograph, man?
Players don't ask players for autographs.
- Player?
- After the game?
[Cheering]
[Buzzer]
How'd he do that?

You just need to get back to that sandbox where you came from.
- Sandbox?
- Yeah.
How you gonna say
I gotta go to the sandbox?
Your last name's Kidd.
Look at the back of your jersey. Look.
Relax.
See what you got.
Pat Croce:All of a sudden, things are clickin'for the Knights.
Ever since Calvin's arrived, there's teamwork.
So what's is it like for you two playin'together?
Well, um, it's been, uh...
It's been great!
Really great!

They're like...
They're like a pack of tigers, you know, chasing those things with the stubby little horns.
You know, you've seen those deer-like things, and they isolate one of them, and then they pounce!
Good to see ya.

Yes, it's Calvin Cambridge bobblehead doll night, but everybody's wondering what's keeping the Knights?
"Who were the U.S. Presidents of the 20th century?"
Can't she wait till after the game for his homework?
No homework, no game.
But I've gotta get Cal...
You got a problem with that?
I got dogs bigger than him, man.

See, I call Tracy "T-time."
Hey, T-time, how come you haven't given me a nickname yet?
I don't know.
See, I've been thinkin' about somethin' like
"C-square," or "C-cam," or "C-bridge."
I'm gonna pick up some allergy medicine.
I might pick up some sleeping pills so you don't keep me up with your snorin' all night.
Oh, um...well, uh, can I go?
Heh. Well, uh, no.
Hey, um, Trace, but, um, well, l...
Dang.
Don't take it personally, Cal.
He doesn't even like to spend time with his own family.
- Family?
- Yeah.
I thought he didn't have any parents.
No, he's still got his dad.
Hejust doesn't talk to him.

How come you told me that your dad was dead?
And he really isn't?
- Calvin, look, look, no.
- Why?
I don't wanna talk about this right now, OK?
But I don't understand, Tracy.
I would do anything... anything... to have a father.
Don't worry about it.
Wait right here.
Ah. Excuse me.
I'm here to pick up my order.
I can help you with that.
What's the name?

Um, do you have a name for me?
Allegra.
Allegra?
That's a very pretty name.
Allegra.
Is that French? Spanish?
It's your allergy medicine.
See, I knew that. I knew that
'cause my parents was from France.
Come on.
Now these are your sleeping pills.
Red cap.

So take one right before bed.
Got it.
This is your allergy medicine.
Blue cap. Take one twice a day.
- [Car Horn Honks]
- OK.
2 once a day. I got it.
[Honks]
Thanks for your help.
Oh, and Tracy... that crossover move you do to your left, you're telegraphing it.
Oh. See, I knew.
I knew you knew about Tracy Reynolds.
I knew you...I knew.
See, I knew you would...
Yeah. Well, bye.
What-What took you so long?
It's almost curfew.
Don't worry.
[Yawns]
We'll be back at the hotel in a minute.
You all right?
Yeah.
It's like butter, baby.
What? What?
Are you all right, man?
Uh, yeah. I'm good.
You sure?
Mm-hmm.
Mmm. I'm good.
I worry about you sometimes, Tracy.
[Snoring]
Tracy.
What? What's up?
What's up? What?
[Sniffs]
I don't want you doin'nothin'crazy like fallin'asleep on me.! Man, wake up.!
OK, OK, all right.
Put the pool in back, put the diving board in the shallow end.
And I'm all good.
This is all so...
Tray!
Tracy!
- Tracy!
- [Snores]
Man.
I can't see squat.
Dang!
Hmm? Allegra.
Huh?
[Sighs]
Tracy... you better hold on for this one.
[Tires Screech]
- [Crash]
- [Cat Screeches]
Dang.
Bellhop.
[Clang]
Hey, Trace. Trace.
Check it out.
Calvin got benched for goin' out joyridin' last night.
What'd he do somethin' like that for?
I don't know.
He did it to keep you from getting suspended.
What?
How do you think you got back last night?
Listen, um,
I'm sorry you got suspended.
And this is really hard for me to say, but...
I appreciate what you did for me.
You had my back...C-dog.
You're welcome, T-time.
All right. Now listen, the team really needs you to win so why don't you get some sleep, all right?
You really that afraid of the dark?
Yeah.
Hmm.
Listen, don't worry about it.
'Cause, you know, we all have our fears.
Like me and this whole flying thing, man.
- Yeah.
- It scares me.
Well, see, my thing is, you're getting on the plane.
Mm-hmm.
That's brave.
Hmm.
Right.
OK, OK. So since I'm brave in gettin' on this plane, why don't you be brave... and turn off the light?
[Sighs]
I don't know.
Hmm.
[Sighs]
Are you prepared for that big test tomorrow?
Yes, Sister Theresa.
Reg, you have to help me, please.
I'm not helping you with your geometry.
Why?
Because I don't understand it any more than you do.
Welcome, everybody, and follow me into the room.
[Chattering]
Who are all those people?
Parents, here to see you.
What's wrong, Murph?
I mean, that's a good thing, right?
Good for you.
It doesn't do us any good.
Murph.
Congratulations.
Go get adopted.
What's wrong with him?
What do you think?
I don't know.
Bittleman told me that I couldn't get adopted.
And you believe Bittleman?
Coach Wagner On Phone:
His contract says nothing about adoption.
Look, why would you send all of these people here?
Calvin deserves a home.
You're only interested in making money off him.
Look, with all due respect,
Coach Wagner, child custody law is very complex.
Mr. Bittleman.
Coach Wagner:Just because you signed his contract as his guardian...
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.
Coach Wagner:
Wait! I'm not through talkin'...
Yes, what is it, Calvin?
You lied to me.
What are you talking about?
You told me no one can adopt me.
I never said that.
Look, Calvin, bear in mind I have cared for you way before you were rich or famous, and all of those people in there, the only reason that they're interested in you is because you're famous.
I'd like to see for myself.
Well, that's fiine.
I will, um... make arrangements with the very best candidates.
What do you think about that, my big man?
We've been doing musical dinner theater now over 6 years.
... In over 27 cities.
... Mm-hmm.
No more hard-knock life for you, Calvin.
#The sun'll come out tomorrow #
# Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow #

We run a tight ship, Cambridge!
Roll call 0600!
I think you're gonna flip for my sugar-free seaweed rice cream.

#Away #
You see, Calvin?
You're best off here... with me.
Hey, yo, Trace.
Tracy: Hello?
It's me, Calvin.
Calvin. Wait. You're here?
Yeah, I'm here, and it took me 4 busses to get here, too.
Uh, all right.
Dang.
Man, this is where you live?
Calvin, what are you doing here?
Hey, I just can't wait to see the inside.
Calvin.
Calvin, wait. Calvin.
Come on, Calvin.
Tell me why you're here.
Aw, this is tight.
Look at all the stuff you got, man.
Yeah. Yeah, it's tight.
So come on, man, tell me what's up.
Why you here?
I wanna check your place out.
You know,just look at your crib and everything.
What do you call this game?
I have no idea.
It came with the house.
Oh, man.
So you're not gonna tell me why you're here?
We need one of these at the orphanage.
OK, OK. So I take it you don't wanna tell me what's goin' on with you.
I understand.
It's your prerogative.
That's cool.
No, I mean, nothin's goin' on.
I mean, everything's all right.
Everything's goin' real well.
Everything's perfect.
Uh, everything's, uh, you know, uh...
All right, man.
Everything's goin' real terrible right about now.
My best friend Murph, he's mad at me.
Bittleman lied to me.
He set up the worst parents in orphan history to come meet with me.
And then, on top of that,
I have a geometry test tomorrow, and I hate geometry.
Mmm.
All right, well, listen,
I'm sure the right parents are gonna show up for you, OK?
It's just a question of time, so you gotta have a little faith.
All right?
But in the meantime... call your boy Murph.
- Right now?
- Right now, yes.
Good friends are hard to come by, so you gotta keep things straight with 'em.
You have your geometry work with you?
Yeah.
You know a little somethin' about geometry?
[Chuckles]
Do I know about geometry?
Ha ha ha!
Do I know about geometry?
Take-Take your time on that call, and, um, meet me outside.
I gotta...
I know geometry, but let me...
OK, now, the key to the whole geometry thing and gettin' the hang of these triangles is to super-size them.
- Super-size?
- Super-size.
You painted your house.
All right, look. Tell me what triangle this is right here.
All right, look. Tell me what triangle this is right here.
Um...
I'm not familiar with this one.
I don't know.
All right.
Let me give you a hint.
So you got MJ over there posting up a small point guard, right?
You got Rodman over there on the other side of the court with his hair.
Now Pippin comes to screen for Michael.
So what do you got?
Well, this is the Bulls' triangle offense, right?
Right.
We're just givin' room for Michael to isolate.
Isolate. Isosceles.
An isosceles triangle.
Exactly.
The Lakers use this triangle offense.
This triangle has equal sides for Kobe and Shaq.
Equal sides. OK.
This is an equilateral triangle.
There you go.
See, you're gettin' it.
You're gettin' it.
OK. OK.
Uh, I got this.
You got this one?
- OK, now this is us.
- Uh-huh.
And you know the type of triangle offense we use is the acute offense... well, the acute triangle offense.
- OK.
- That's because
Calvin Cambridge is so damn cute.
Oh, man, give me a break.
I'm the cute one.
- No, I am.
- No, see.
Look at the picture.
I'm the cute one.
- No.
- OK, go ahead. Fine.
All right. So...
OK, see, here's Joad, right?
- Right.
- This is Joad.
Joad's gonna take the ball out.
He's gonna pass all the way to you.
- OK.
- You're right here.
- Right.
- See me?
I'm gonna be headin' down court for the full-court lob pass just like this, right?
Oh, hey, Calvin. Calvin.
Don't put paint on my windows, all right?
But I'm gonna be wide open.
You gotta pass me the ball.
I'm warning you, all right?
Don't do it.
And then...
Wham!
2 points for me and the assist... to Reynolds.
Oh, OK.
So you think you're cute puttin' the paint and then messin' up the house, huh?
Well, let me see what we've got.
Let's say if I went and did...
Oh! Aw. Hey!
Orange looks nice on you, man.
That's not funny.
No, it really is funny
'cause it looks nice.
It goes nice with the blue and...
Oh, really?
Yeah. You kinda look like a rainbow or...
Well, the orange looks really nice...
Calvin, I know you're not gonna do that.
- Oh!
- On you!
You really think it's funny?
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doin'?
Cal. Calvin.
Calvin. Whoa!
[Laughs]
Aah!
[Buzzer]
You must be Tracy.
You must be Murph.
Yeah, that's me.
What's up, Murph?
Hey, Cal.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm pretty good.
But can you believe the cab ride here cost 50 bucks?
You should have took the bus.
Tracy, can you lend me 49.50?
Heh. All right, Murph.
I'll go get my wallet.
So what have you guys been up to?
Geometry.
Think you could teach me?
##All I'm tryin'to do is get my dough on ##
##I'm your boy,you're my girlfriend ##
##Stop, hold up ##
##I ain't in no kind of rush to grow up, so slow up ##
##I'm just playin'the game ##
##Let me warn you, girl ##
##Before you get rough with me ##
## You might think you got me, but you never really get me ##
##So don't trip if you see me doin'my thing ##
##I told ya ##
##I'm just playin'the game ##
## Yeah ##
##Playin'the game ##
- Aah!
- Whoa!
Cannonball!
When Calvin Cambridge comes to your town, you'd better watch out.
Well, that was the fiinal word from Gary "the Glove" Payton tonight after the Seattle Sonics battled it out with Cambridge and the Los Angeles Knights.
Yeah, now you know what it feels like to be in the glove.
It's more like a mitten, Gary.
Kenny Mayne: The Knights rallied around Cambridge after that, and before it was all over,
Payton got the gate.
Get him outta here, Ref.
Rich Eisen:
And Kenny, how about the way
Reynolds jumped in to protect Cambridge?
How about that?
They're startin' to come together, Rich.
The team's gelling at this point, and with 3 games left in the season, they are only 2 wins away from their fiirst ever trip to the play-offs.
## Take it to the top ##
## Get your head in the game ##
## Get your head in the game ##
## Get up out your seats or you got no one to blame ##
##Rise up, giddyup ##
## The Knights is flyin'higher ##
[Cheering]
The Knights win!
Yes! Ha ha ha!
Whoo!
- Oof.
- Aah!
Coach, great game.
Great game.
Fellas, unbelievable.
Hey, guys,
I gotta pinch myself.
One more win and we're in the play-offs, and you know what that means for every man in this organization?
Bonuses. Ha ha.
Contract renewals.
We'll all have jobs next year.
You two together... this works.
Come on. Let's go.
So you still haven't met any parents you liked?
I don't know.
Nobody seems right.
Murph:
Maybe nobody seems right because you already met the right person.
What right person?
Tracy.
[Chuckles]
Tracy.
Listen, Murph,
Tracy can't even take care of himself.
[Chuckles]
You like him.
Yeah, so?
That doesn't mean he wants to adopt me.
Well, why don't you ask him?
Listen, Reg, Murph...
Tracy's not big on families.
He doesn't even talk to his own dad.
I mean, how can you have a dad and not talk to him?
Man, that's nuts.
It ain't cool.
Can you do anything?
You're back again?
Yeah, uh, I got a surprise for you.
Somebody I want you to meet.
Oh, OK.
I hope she's wearin' a bikini.
Nah, it's not a woman.
It's-It's your number-one fan.
Well, it has to be a woman, right?
[Sighs]
Calvin, why'd you bring him here?
This is your dad.
You don't want to talk to him?
Listen to me.
Now stay out of my business and get him out of here. Now.
[Buzzer Sounds]
How could we lose to the Bulls?!
We were out of synch, especially Cambridge and Reynolds.
What's the matter with you two?
This was your gimme.
Now you have to beat the Raptors or we're out,you got that?
We're gonna have to tighten it up, guys.
Pull this thing together.
Damn it!
All right, listen, Cal...
[Sighs]
- [Sighs]
- What's wrong?
I give up on ever fiinding somebody to adopt me.
Well, I wouldn't do that just yet.
Well, hello, Calvin.
We've been waiting for you.
We're the Boyds.
We're from Bel Air.
Hoo-ooh.
Hmm?
What's the matter?
You've had something on your mind all night.
Nah. No, I haven't.
It's Calvin, isn't it?
As we hit the end of the regular season, the big story is this weekend's showdown between the Los Angeles Knights and the Toronto Raptors.
Both teams need a victory to make the play-offs.
Man, this is personal.
It's play-off time, and my job is to shut Calvin Cambridge down.
Besides, what does a little kid know about the play-offs?
For the Knights to have any shot at winning this game,
Reynolds and Cambridge better get back in synch, and Cambridge better bring every weapon in his arsenal.
Ha. Hey, man.
How you doing?
Fine.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hey, I wanted to ask you, uh, is it true what you said about Calvin's, uh, sneakers?
I guess.
"I guess?"
Don't "I guess" me, you idiot.
Is it because of the sneakers?
Huh? Huh?
Uh-huh? Yes?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. OK.
All right, hey, thanks.
Ha ha. Cool, cool.
Cool.
But I have to wear my sneakers.
Right, right.
But-But they're sneakers.
They're not...They're not proper attire for brunch at the Boyds.
You just want to make your best possible impression.
So put on these shoes, look good, and maybe you'll get adopted.
Go on.
All right, Murph.
Guard these with your life, all right?
I will.
Good luck with the Boyds.
I hope they're the right ones.
Yeah, me, too, man.
See you later, man, all right?
Make me like Mike.
[Crowd Cheering]
I guess they don't fiit me, Mom, huh?
Where are they?
Where are what?
The sneakers.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Bittleman:
I don't want to do this.
No! Not my mom's picture!
No.!
All right. I'm gonna ask you one last time.
Where are Calvin's sneakers?
All right, you're not gonna tell me?
OK, all right, here we go then.
I'm gonna light it.
Say good-bye to mom.!
Bye. There she goes.
- Bye, Mom.
- No.! No.! Stop it.!
Burning.
This is your fault.
It's your fault.
No! They're in the attic!
Attic! Attic...Ow!
Ah! Good! All right.
Good. In the attic.
Good, good. Good.
All right.
Now, you want to see this again?
Do not say anything to Calvin.
[Classical Music Playing]
[Gasps]
I'll get it! l-It's all right.
It's all right.
I'm-I'm really sorry.
It's OK. I know. It's OK.
[Overlapping Conversations]
Excuse me, uh, Mr. Williams?
It's possible.
My dentist, Frank Nister, said that I might be able to fiind you here.
Who's Nister?
You know, the guy with the ear.
Um, my name is Stan Bittleman.
What can I do for you,
Mr. Bittleman?
I'm looking for a, uh, sports broker, uh, to make a sizable investment in the Raptors to beat the Knights.
Why are you speaking in code?
You want to place a bet?
How much?
[Whistles]
That's a lot of money.
You good for it?
Of course I am.
What makes you so confiident?
Well, let's just say
I have a good feeling that Calvin Cambridge is going to have... an off game.
Tell me more.
We were gonna wait till later to tell you this, but, um, well, I can't wait.
Calvin, tomorrow we're going to fiinalize your adoption, and you will ofiicially become a Boyd.
A Boyd?
Yeah, a friend of mine told me this would be a pretty good place to come.
Any place would have been great.
Calvin?
I want to talk to you about something, man.
Something, um... something pretty big.
What?
Well...
I don't know.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
Just thinking about what's best for you and-and for me.
Yeah?
Well, l...
Absolutely, coach.
Oh. Um, Tracy,
I would like you to meet the Boyds.
The Boyds are gonna be my...
[Sighs]
My parents.
Mr. and Mrs. Boyd:Hi.
Mrs. Boyd:
Very nice to meet you.
It's...It's nice to meet you, too.
Um... you guys are very, very lucky.
Don't we know it?
[Chuckles]
What-What was the big news that you wanted to tell me?
Oh, oh, right. Right.
Um, you know the pick-and-roll, right?
I'm gonna do the pick, but I ain't...
I ain't gonna do the roll.
That-That was the big news?
Yeah.
It's nice to meet you guys.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
Ooh! Dear, we better claim our seats.
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, uh, we'll see you after the game, son.
God, that sounds great.
[Cell Phone Rings]
Hello?
[Whispers]
Here.
Yo, is anybody there?
Tell him. l-It's Murph, and I got something to tell you.
I screwed up big time.
I didn't mean to tell him, but then...
But then Bittleman was gonna burn my mom's pictures. I had no choice.
Murph,just slow down, man.
Tell him what?
I told him about the sneakers, and now they're in Bittleman's safe.
That-That's just crazy.
The sneakers are right here in my gym...bag.
Oh, no!
What are you gonna do?
The game starts in 20 minutes!
Wait. I have an idea.
[Whispers]
I'll meet you ASAP.
ASAP. Got it.
Wait. What's ASAP?
[Sighs]
All right!
Bring it in, gents, bring it in.
Let's go.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where's Cambridge?
What, man?
He's not here?
Check the bathrooms.
[Crash]
Oh, man! Dang!
[Crowd Applauds]
Geoff:And the opening tip goes to the Raptors.
With Calvin Cambridge nowhere in sight, a lot of things may be going the Raptors'way today.
OK, look, if you guys were gonna ask me what I'm about to ask you, I'd run.
So if anybody wants to run,
I understand.
Geoff:
Here come the Raptors again.
They're making it look easy on a breakaway.
Slam dunk by Vince Carter.
The Raptors are red hot in this one.
Toronto already leading by 9, and here they come again.
The question the Knight fans are asking is "where the heck is Calvin?"
Here come the Knights on offense, up from the back court to the front court.
Tracy Reynolds...
Calvin: Get him, guys.!
Come on, tie him up.!
Hey, hey! Stop it!
Get him, get him!
Ow! Aah! Stop!
Stop, I say! Stop!
Give me the combination to the safe.
Geoff:
He's going towards the basket.
Windmill slam dunk.!
We better think of something else.
Get him with those!
Oh, yeah, get them.
Those are the hard chess men.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I got his head.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's going on?
Oh, good, oh, good.
I am glad to see you.
All right,yeah,
I'm really glad you're here.
What are you doing?
I'm getting my sneakers back.
Let me out of this.
Wait. No, no.
Just hear me out, Ox.
Please.
You may hate me, you may hate the world.
But whatever our differences, you're still one of us.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
You're not one of him.
Well, heh heh, don't listen to him.
No, Ox, don't listen to Bittleman.
He doesn't even care about you, Ox.
Oh, right, yeah,
I don't care about you.
Of course I care about you.
We're friends, right, man?
Right?
OK.
You just let me out of here, you idiot.
I'm not an idiot.
- You got that?
- OK.
- OK?
- OK!
Geoff:
...will go on to the NBAplay-offs, and it will be the fiirst for the Knights...
Because I'm not the one tied to a chair, am I?
Geoff:lf Calvin Cambridge is gonna get here, he better get here quick.
Toronto running away...
I gotta get back to the game.
You know, if I was an idiot,
I wouldn't be able to remember the combination to your safe, would I?
[Orphans Chattering]
42 left...
Come on, Ox.
Come on, come on.
27 right...
Come on, one more time.
Come on, one more, one more.
...and 1 5 left.
- Yes!
- Yeah!
[Grunting]
I'm gonna get you, Calvin!
I'm gonna get you!
[Scooter Engines Rewing]
What?!
- Hey!
- Whoa!
- Darn it!
- [Groans]
Whoa! Aaah!
No!
Ha ha!
Ah!
Unh!
[Scooters Leaving]
[Cheering Together]
Yeah, Murph!
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!
See you inside!
- Good luck, Calvin!
- Go get 'em!
Give me the sneakers, Calvin.
Your game... [Panting] is over.
[Revving Scooter Engine]
Aaah!
Uhh.
My game is just beginning.
[Buzzer Sounds]
Geoff: The third quarter comes to an end, and the Raptors leading the Knights big by 2 1 points.
Woman:
Yeah.! It's Calvin.!
There he is.
Ladies and gentlemen, he's here.!
[Crowd Cheering Loudly]
Crowd: Calvin.! Calvin.!
Geoff:
Calvin Cambridge has arrived.
The crowd reacting as he comes onto the court.
However, is it too late?
The Knights are trailing by 2 1 points.
They have never been able to make up that kind of a defiicit.
Calvin, where have you been?
I'm sorry, coach.
So am I.
Nobody shows up after 3 quarters and plays.
Sit on the bench.
Wait a minute, coach.
You gotta play Calvin.
No.
Just listen to me for a minute, OK?
Now if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be here in the fiirst place.
Now, listen, we can still do this, but we're gonna need him.
Now, come on, we started as a team, let's fiinish as a team.
Joad: Play the kid.
We could still win, coach.
We can.
Yeah! Yeah!
Geoff:
Here come the Knights.
Geoff:lf I didn't see it with my own eyes,
I wouldn't have believed it.
But they'rejust one point behind the Raptors in this game.
We gotta steal the ball on the inbound play.
And if we don't get the steal, who do we foul?
They all shoot good free throws, coach.
Well, we better get that steal.
Ready?
- Players:Break.!
- Let's go.
Geoff: The Knights need a steal right here.
Carter being guarded by Cambridge.
He comes in with it.
And he's got the ball...
It's stolen by Cambridge.!
What a big play by the little guy.!
- [Whistle Blows]
- Wagner: Time-out.!
Break!
Geoff:
Time-out called by the Knights.
[Whispers]
Oh, no.
What's the matter?
I'm done, Trace.
What do you mean?
It really wasn't me that was playing.
It was the sneakers.
Tracy, the sneakers were magic.
Now they're gone.
Come on, now. No.
Now's not the time for jokes, OK?
I'm not playing games.
Listen to me.
We're gonna need you to win, so you know what you gotta do?
You gotta be brave.
I believe in you.
Coach Wagner:
All right. Tracy inbounds to Calvin.
Calvin,Joad's gonna set you a pick.
If they double-team you, get the ball back to Tracy.
Listen, guys.
Whether we make the play-offs or not, it's gonna be my last game.
- What?!
- What?!
Player:
What are you saying, man?
I'm ready to be a regular kid again.
It's what I want.
Come on, y'all.
I got faith in you guys.
Let's go out, and let's go win this thing, man.
Come on, now. Let's go.
Let's go, let's play.
[Players Chanting]
Teamwork on 3.
All: Teamwork!
Geoff:Biggest moment of the season for the Knights.
It comes in to Calvin Cambridge.
The little guy goes to the dribble against Vince Carter.
Drives right, the shake-and-bake...
It didn't work this time.!
I can't do this.
What are you doing?
You can do it!
Calvin:Shoot it.!
[Buzzer Sounds]
Yeah!
Geoff: The Knights win.!
The Knights win.!
Ladies and gentlemen, the Knights are going to the NBAplay-offs for the fiirst time in franchise history.!
Unbelievable.!
Yes!
Play-offs, baby!
We did it, man!
Yeah, man, we did.
[Sighs]
Guess I won't be seeing you anymore?
Hey, Trace, come on, man.
The press wants to see us, man.
Come on.
Oh, Calvin.
Congratulations, my dear.
We're going to Le Cirque to celebrate.
You'll love the French cooking.
Oh,yes.
[Chuckles]
Um, I'll meet you guys outside at the car, OK?
Oh, OK.
All right, dear.
We're so proud of you.
Wonderful,just wonderful.
Play-offs, play-offs!
Play-offs!
Yeah!
Congratulations, Calvin.
I'm gonna miss you, coach.
We're gonna miss you, too.
But I'm glad you fiinally got what you really needed.
There'll always be a place on this team for you.
Thanks, coach.
Good luck.
I wonder what's keeping Calvin?
Wow.
Never thought you'd turn down the Boyds.
Me, neither.
Somehow, it just didn't feel right.
Welcome back.
Thanks, Murph.
Come on.
So, man... you gotta tell me.
What was the best part about being in the NBA?
Room service.
Room service?
What's room service?
You're in your hotel room.
You pick up the phone, you dial 6.
Tell 'em what food you want, they'll bring the food up to your hotel room... for free.
Nah. You're just...
You're just messin' with me, right?
Nah, not at all.
We should have that around here sometime.
We should.
We should.
Room service?
[Softly]
Tracy.
So now you're telling me that after everything that we've been through together, that's what you like best?
Room service?
What are you doing here?
I'm here with the team.
You see, the Knights are sponsoring the home now.
That's...That's great.
Guys, guys, uh, a little to the left.
How's that?
That's good. Good.
Reg, whatever happened to the guy that used to run this place? Bittleman?
No one's seen him since
Calvin's last game.
Something about a bet he didn't have the money to cover.
There's gonna be a lot of changes around here.
Yeah. I can see that already.
Yes.
Yeah. Too bad you're not gonna be around to enjoy it.
What do you mean?
Well, things are going great with the team now.
Everything's going well with my father.
I have furniture in the house, but still something's missing.
And I heard it through the grapevine that you're still looking for a father.
Yeah.
Yeah?
That's great.
Because what I'm missing is a son.
Thanks...Dad.
Murph!
Hey, Murph, come here.
Um, you know what today is, right?
What?
It's 2-for-1 orphan day.
You take one orphan, and then you get another one.
2-for-1 orphan day.
I mean, if that's OKwith you.
Hey, Murph.
Hey, T-time.
You know, I'm gonna take
Calvin home with me today.
Congratulations.
Thanks.
But you know what?
We were kinda hoping that you'd come, too.
You mean...
Murph, we're going home.
We're going home!
Yeah.
That's right, we're going home.
- Yeah.
- Dad?
Can we get an allowance?
Allowance?
- Yeah. Can I drive the Escalade home?
- You wanna drive the what?
Do we get season tickets?
Tracy: Whoo.! Ha ha.!
[Laughing]
All right, let's get some sleep, guys.
Here you go.
All right.
Good night, guys.
Good night, Dad.
Good night, Dad.
Hey, you want me to leave the light on for you?
Nah, I'm cool.
[Snoring]
[Clap]
[Muffled Grunt]

Don't cut. Don't cut.
Yeah, we are.
Oh, now I gotta act before I play a game.
I gotta do that again.

SANTORINI, GREECE
They've found another one.
There'll be no treasure left for her.
Mark the location.
That's the Frenchman.
And over there, Kristos.
They're all coming. All except one.
All right, follow Kristos.
When he dives, we dive.
Maybe we'll get lucky and find whatever's down there.
Look at that, Jimmy. Look!
Why isn't she slowing down?
- Whoa!
- Whoa!
- You were asking?
- I knew it!
Hello, boys. You're all wet.
Many raiders are here, and you make us wait!
But you know I can't resist a bit of fun.
What's all this fuss about?
What do they think is down there?
I don't know what they think, but I think it's the Luna Temple.
The Luna Temple?
My sons! If it's not on television, forget it!
- It was built by Alexander the Great.
- A Greek, if you don't know!
Alexander collected treasures and stored them in two places.
The majority went to his library in Egypt.
But his most prized possessions went here... the Luna Temple.
By law, no one was allowed to record its location, and in 330 BC it was...
...swallowed by the sea.
- Destroyed during a volcanic eruption.
Lost for ever.
Until yesterday.
If even half of it is intact, it will be the greatest find since the Pyramids.
The others are heading along this shelf.
- That's based on the currents?
- Yes.
This, Gus, is why I was late.
It's a geological, taken two hours after the quake.
The epicentre was here, five miles northeast of us, but...
...look at the currents along the shelf now.
Wait! They've shifted.
So, while they're all diving there, the ruins will actually be...
...here.
Let's go.
Something wrong?
First, Alexander doesn't record the temple's location.
Then, God wipes it from the earth with a volcano.
Now, even the currents change.
Lara, maybe this temple's not meant to be found.
Everything lost is meant to be found.
Don't worry.
It's incredible!
It's unbelievable! Whoa!
- Oh, my God.
- This is huge!
Thank you.
Wonderful.
Jimmy, this is wonderful!
- Do you see what I see?
- Oh, my God!
It's incredible.
Nicky, look at this.
We're going to be rich!
Lara! What do you say to two handsome Greek partners?
Well, when you find two, let me know!
- She's talking about you.
- No, you!
Pack the gold coins.
- Lara, what is that?
- It's mine.
What is she doing?
Lara! That column is collapsing!
Aftershock!
- I think that's a sign to leave!
- Two minutes!
- Lara, we need to leave now!
- We've got to move!
Keep packing. This thing is going to collapse. Take those two.
- We have to hurry up.
- Go, go! Come on!
Lara!
Lara? Lara, it's us, Hillary and Bryce!
She's disorientated.
That's normal after three days.
Nice day for a dip.
Gentlemen, there is an expression:
"It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."
Yet that is precisely what I've been doing for some time now...
...whether it be sarin gas for Mr San, improved typhoid for Mr Krev to use in the Balkans, enhanced cholera for Mr Duvalier.
While these weapons serve their purpose, there have always been limitations.
Stable diseases aren't lethal.
Deadly ones burn out too quickly.
Mother Nature can only be fooled so much.
Deploy my weapon, and your enemies, however great, will collapse from within.
Rather like Mr Monza's collapsing right now.
- What the hell is going on?
- Monza told Ml6 about this meeting.
That's why the change of location.
He was going to turn me over to them and then seek asylum in the West.
A smart man would've known
I was on to him.
He would never have got on the plane.
But I knew you would.
You actually thought you could fool me.
That, gentlemen, is the sound of a traitor dying.
That was an accelerated form of Ebola, deadliest disease known to man.
Highly contagious.
However, as with all known diseases, there exist stockpiles of antiserum in the West.
There is no antiserum for what I am offering you.
No treatment. No vaccine. No cure.
The world's never seen anything like what I've uncovered.
Uncovered?
Yes. I've branched out.
Archaeology.
That is the account at the Landesbank in Bern.
$100 million each, if you please.
- Where's Chen Lo?
- He has the orb, but Ml6 is on to him.
- How?
- He doesn't know.
Rather than risk bringing it, he's waiting.
I have just told a cabin full of men about
Pandora. The clock cannot be reset.
Tell him to bring the orb at once.
You'll find the killers.
Don't take it out on me!
- Bryce, what have we got?
- I haven't loaded your images yet.
- What about references to an orb?
- I checked.
Inventories of the Luna Temple do not list any orb.
I want you both to list every orb ever mentioned in Greek history.
Every one?
That's... liable...
...to be...
...thousands.
Then we'll read thousands.
Start with that one.
Perhaps you'd like some tea while you wait?
No, they wouldn't. Tea is for guests, the door is for intruders!
They're from Ml6.
I can tell from their soft hands and pressed suits.
They make decisions and leave the dirty work for others.
- I've no interest in...
- His name's Chen Lo.
Along with his brother Xien, he runs a ring of bandits, the Shay Ling.
They deal in guns, diamonds, antiquities to sell on the black market.
They followed you when you arrived in Santorini, where they killed Gus.
- Why?
- For this.
Our listening post in Malta intercepted that fax.
It was sent from Chen Lo to a man named Jonathan Reiss.
The scientist? Won the Nobel Prize?
He's now the foremost designer of biological weapons in the world.
His creations have been at the heart of bio-terror in the past 15 years.
Reiss's disdain for life is legendary.
He doesn't care who his weapons kill.
A modern-day Doctor Mengele.
We know Chen Lo followed you to obtain the orb, and thus deliver Reiss.
We don't know why.
Candidly, that terrifies us.
Reiss is not to be trifled with.
Pandora's box.
Reiss is going to use the orb to find Pandora's box.
The Greek myth?
Pandora opens a forbidden box and unleashes pain into the world?
That's the Sunday school version, yes.
How do you think life began?
Shooting star? Primordial ooze?
In 2300 BC, an Egyptian pharaoh found a place he named The Cradle of Life, where we, life, began.
There he found a box, which brought life to Earth.
The pharaoh opened it, but all that was left was the Ramante, or anti-life.
The plague, the companion to life.
- Companion?
- Nature is about balance.
All the world comes in pairs.
Yin and Yang, right and wrong.
- What did this plague do?
- It levelled the pharaoh's army.
A soldier was dispatched to transport the box to the end of the world.
2,000 years later,
Alexander the Great reached India, where his army was ravaged by a plague after finding a box.
India?
That's where the soldier brought it?
Alexander felt the box was too powerful, so he returned it to its home,
The Cradle of Life.
It has never been seen since.
- And this Cradle of Life is where?
- No one knows.
Alexander used a map with the box, which he then hid from the world.
But the name he gave this map was "Mati", and the literal translation for the word "Mati" is eye.
The orb is the map, hidden in the Luna Temple by Alexander.
Reiss will use it to find Pandora's box, and when he opens it, he will unleash a weapon more powerful than you could ever imagine.
The markings form a pattern, but even if I figure what they mean, we still can't read the whole map because we've only a partial view.
- We have to figure out how to read it.
- Right. Thank you.
On behalf of Her Majesty, recover this box before Doctor Reiss.
Oh...! Well, now that I have
Her Majesty's permission...
- Tell me where to find the orb.
- It's in China with Chen Lo.
We'll assign two of our best agents to help.
I don't want them.
- Expertise in archaeology doesn't...
- I didn't say that I don't need help.
But you won't get me there in time.
I need someone inside the Shay Ling.
Their methods, their hideouts.
- I need Terry Sheridan.
- Not if he were the last man on Earth!
Terry Sheridan, ex-commander with the Royal Marines, turned mercenary and traitor.
Put that man on the trail of a weapon he can sell to the highest bidder?
Open!
I am your host, Armin Kal.
Welcome to Fantasy Island.
Croft.
Hello, Terry.
What do you think of my new place?
It's not quite Croft Manor.
What? A key to your heart?
To a flat in Zurich.
You can pick another city, if you want.
Your record expunged, your citizenship restored.
- By?
- Ml6.
Ml6...
Would that make me Faust, or the Devil?
Pick one, because Ml6 will also arrange a new identity.
- Yeah? You think I need their help?
- Having two faces doesn't count.
What do I have to do?
- Take me to the Shay Ling.
- The Shay who?
Chen Lo took something from me and I want it back.
Is that you or Ml6?
Also, I've arranged for £5 million when we succeed.
- Call it "second chance" money.
- Or life insurance for you.
I don't need any.
You and I, working alone?
It's easier to see through you that way.
So what if, afterwards,
Ml6 decide that me back in the world isn't such a great idea?
Then I feel sorry for whomever they get to come after you.
- You've authorisation to kill me?
- Any time, for any reason.
Why don't you just do it, then?
What is it they say? "Hell hath no fury..."
You're not that good.
The Shay Ling are like ghosts, Croft.
They move constantly, and their home is the most remote mountain region in China.
Region?
You'll have to do better than that.
Get me into China, and I'll get you to them in a day.
No guns, no money, no weapons of any kind.
Talk about taking the fun out of life!
They've spies all over China.
We slip in to Beijing undetected, then we go by truck.
Truck? I was thinking about something a little faster.
A little faster?
This is a little faster, but the Chinese will track the pod.
- There won't be any pod to find.
- Will there be any of us to find?
- Ready? Now.
- Ready for what?
The ditching was good, Croft.
I'll give you that.
But we'll never find a vehicle in a place like this.
Oh, it's so lovely to see you.
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.
Your clothes, guns and knives are over there.
And I took the liberty of tuning your bike.
- May I?
- Yes.
- Lara.
- Ah!
- What is the happy couple up to?
- Accessorising.
- Where are we on reading the orb?
- All maps have a key, a legend.
The orb's key's not there, it must've been lost.
Or somewhere in the temple.
Go through every image I took near the orb.
The key must've been linked to it in some way. Right, bye, then.
It's unlike Lara to take a partner.
Where are you two going?
We'll take a nice little trip, breathe some fresh mountain air, stop by my friends, the Shay Ling.
The Shay Ling watch all the roads, we'll go round the back.
- We'll go straight.
- Maybe you didn't hear me.
The Shay Ling have men on every road from here to Luoyang.
Not every road.
- A bit rusty?
- It's coming back.
I expected more from a Scot.
I don't expect anything from an Englishwoman!
Good, 'cause you're not gonna get anything.
The fun's over.
From now on, it's by foot.
- Best to reconsider that "no gun" rule.
- No.
OK.
And don't be looking at my ass.
- Where do I fit in?
- You're the guide.
I mean, when you think back on the vast scheme of your adventurous life, where do I fit in?
Was I the love of your life or just another bump on the road?
Was I time well spent?
Four months, more good than bad?
Come on, it had to be more than that, am I right?
You're right.
It was five months.
- You're laughing at me.
- Because I used to find you charming.
I am charming.
You're late!
Tilt your head back. Do it!
You might see again in an hour. Maybe.
What's this? It's not there.
There's no orb.
Is there anything you can tell me about this?
- Hello?
- You didn't like your messenger?
I didn't. But I liked the men
I lost in the temple.
You underestimated Lady Croft.
I underestimated how much this orb is worth.
There's so many horrible diseases in the world.
Things we are particularly susceptible to as children.
You could be holding little Shiho or Tai by the hand, as a mysterious ailment ravages their bodies.
You kill them, and I will give your orb to Lady Croft.
She's a few miles away from here as we speak.
I wonder how much she would pay.
I'll pay you an additional $12 million.
It will be yours once you've delivered the orb along with Lady Croft's body.
- You don't know where they are.
- You're impossible.
You pretended to know so I'd get you out.
This isn't a tomb, Croft, and the Shay Ling aren't mummies.
They're killers.
But if you don't trust me...
I'm sorry to have to do this, but you're wasting time.
You want to shoot me? Shoot me.
Personally, I'd rather you do it...
...than them.
Well, Terry, what part of "never come back again" didn't you understand?
You wanted to find the Shay Ling.
Come on!
The only way to get into their place is as their prisoners.
- You might've told me that before.
- You would've believed me?
Make Chen Lo a better offer than his buyer. He'll cross them.
Even if his buyer's Jonathan Reiss?
You might've told me that before!
- Were you really gonna kill me?
- I bet she would have.
I've seen her in action.
Didn't Terry tell you?
The last time any of us saw him, he was riding away with a truck...
...full of my Ming vases.
And sitting next to him...
...was his sister.
How is she?
You... shouldn't have come here.
It got me out of prison.
Besides, the lady has a good offer.
- Better than Reiss.
- Really?
- Should I take it?
- Take it.
Or you and I ransom her and the thing back to the British for triple.
Let's talk.
Not you, Terry.
Lady Croft and I.
You wait here. Catch up.
I'll be four minutes.
Terrific.
There is something
I think you will appreciate.
This is the largest group of terracotta warriors I have found.
The King of Chin made them for use in the afterlife.
To fend off enemies he made in this one.
Sounds like we could both use a set.
I will be happy to sell some to you.
I hope you're as entrepreneurial with the orb.
You lost men, I lost men. I see no reason we should both lose again.
If I want double what Reiss offered me...
- Is it here?
- It's worth a lot.
Then you know Reiss will kill you the moment you give it to him.
- Your government assures my safety?
- No.
But I will.
That must hurt, saying that to me.
Take the offer.
- You presume to give me orders?
- Take the offer before it expires.
No.
- Then I will have to force you.
- Then I will have to kill you!
Has it been four minutes yet?
That was nice.
It's too bad you're on the wrong side.
Tell me where the orb is and it spares your life.
The Flower Pagoda, in Shanghai.
9 p.m.
This is mine.
Now, we're even.
Now!
Remember that "no gun" rule?
I reconsidered.
You know there was a staircase we could've used?
- Lara, are you all right?
- Smashing.
I'm on my way to Shanghai, and I need you to look at something.
It was in the Luna Temple.
I'm betting it's the key to the markings.
She's holding some sort of musical instrument.
It's sound.
- That's brilliant.
- The key must be linked to it.
I'll start decoding the images.
Get the rest. Bye.
- Miss you.
- Bye!
Oh, well.
Just like old times.
I think that's the first time you've actually smiled because of me.
Why did you do it?
I started thinking I was tired of doing things somebody else's way.
It'd always be somebody else's way.
So you abandon your men and betray your country?
Leaving my men and my country, that didn't hurt as much as I thought.
But leaving you did.
You're a hard act to follow, Croft.
You know why you and I get along so well?
No.
We are two of a kind, me and you.
- We are nothing alike.
- I don't think we're alike.
But I do think we're a pair.
Opposite sides of the same coin.
- My men have the roof covered.
- Set down in the square instead.
My men will also have things covered.
OK, fine.
OK, Sean, let's go!
They're landing in the square.
- We're in the wrong position. Stairs?
- No time.
- Rooftops?
- No.
I've got a plan.
Stay here. Wait for my signal.
Here's the money, come and get it!
Wait for my signal, huh?
- Give me that box!
- Money first!
- Give me that box now!
- No! You first!
Christ! Get us out of here!
Take us up!
Take it up!
Go! Run her over!
- Yeah?
- We tried it your way. Now we try mine.
- Bring it to the top of the pagoda now!
- OK.
Got you!
Come on! Hold it up!
- Come closer!
- Raise it higher! Higher!
- My regards to your brother!
- Too late.
Croft, what are you doing?
Take us up!
Move! Go!
Let's go! Move!
I'm tired of you pointing that at me.
You OK?
- Never better.
- Looks like we lost the orb.
I wouldn't go vaulting into thin air for nothing.
I've put a tracer on the crate.
Got it. Look.
Impressive.
A weapons lab in the middle of the city? No way.
He must've dumped that crate.
No, it's here.
One of the buildings?
No.
It's exactly where we're standing.
Part of me allowed for the possibility that Pandora's box was just a legend.
But now I know it's there.
- She escaped.
- She has no idea where we are.
We take no chances.
Have everything we need to make an antidote transferred to the jet.
I need an out for two people.
Mid-city. Soon.
What? Are you crazy?
- Are we set?
- Piece of cake.
Hello.
- So much for easy.
- What is that?
He's already decoding the orb.
Bugger!
Headset.
You've gotta get everyone out.
What do you suggest, the fire alarm?
Not bad. But that's just the alarm.
There's no danger.
Do you think anyone here is paid enough to take that chance?
Don't even think about it.
It's her.
Yes?
Damn!
I'm glad, Lara!
That would've been too easy!
Give me your best!
How's that?
- I'm going off-line.
- No, don't!
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Hello, boys.
Did you understand the medallion?
Yeah. The markings are sound waves.
We've translated all the markings, roughly half the orb.
Let's complete the set, then.
I'll send the rest of them to you.
Then finish the translation and transmit the sounds back to me.
We need more back-up.
Smart girl.
Move!
Don't shoot her! Not until we're sure the computer has done its job.
You honestly believe you'll be able to control what's in that box?
Really, Lara, you disappoint me.
Have we received payment from all the buyers?
No, you don't want to control it at all.
You're using the buyers.
They'll release it as just another weapon, and the world blames them.
What's left of the world blames them.
Once I have the virus,
I'll make enough antidote to protect the best and the brightest.
Heads of corporations, heads of state. Life will go on.
You've never thought,
"The world would be better without certain people"?
I can certainly think of one person
I could do without.
There it is.
I'm sorry, Lara. You'd have been welcome in my world.
Piss off.
Shoot her between the eyes.
No mistakes.
Asshole!
I'm gonna get you.
Follow me!
You're mine.
Bingo! Two one-way tickets out of Hong Kong.
Parachutes!
Something a little faster.
Come on!
Our rendezvous point is two and a half, maybe three miles.
You're aware that no one's ever gone further than one mile?
- I am now.
- This way!
- Right, you go first.
- No, you go first.
I'll go first!
Holy cow!
Follow her.
Hi, Terry. Good to see you.
I suppose you want paying, then?
We agreed on $200?
No, $300! Expenses.
So this...
...rock is the map?
Yes, it is.
I've never seen anything like it.
Have you?
And it's the only way to find that box?
Just think, you could take it and walk out the door.
No. Window's better, off the ship faster, harder to track.
Croft, do you really think
I would do that to you?
You can break my wrist, but I'm still gonna kiss you.
Not exactly what I had in mind, but OK.
- Why didn't you shoot Reiss?
- What?
He must have walked right past you in the lab.
Why didn't you shoot him?
No clear shot.
I didn't know where you were.
I'll inform Ml6 of the completion of your service.
You'll have your money and your life.
- Don't waste it.
- This is no time to split up.
Yes, it is, before you make the wrong decision.
OK, you want to leave? Go ahead.
But don't pretend it's to try and save me.
You're afraid you might not pull the trigger.
Afraid of letting your guard down, of letting anyone in.
I'm not leaving because I couldn't kill you.
I'm leaving because I could.
Good morning.
Might I borrow your television?
It's important.
Cheers. Lovely.
- Hello, Bryce.
- Hello, Lara.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Right. Sending the last images of the orb... now.
Got them.
Translating... Done.
Send the sounds.
Sending it now.
No, nothing.
Oh, well, back to the drawing board.
No, wait. The tones are being distorted.
Send me the file.
Look, Lara, I...
I really don't think that's gonna work.
Yes, it will. Ever heard your voice on a tape recorder? Same thing.
Why are we having this discussion?
Send me the file.
- Sending it.
- Thank you.
Lara!
Lara!
Africa. It's in Africa.
- Somewhere near Kilimanjaro.
- Great, Lara.
How long for Reiss to fix his computers?
Twenty-four hours at the fastest.
Ask Kosa to meet me north of his village.
0800 hours. Bye, then.
A bit faster than twenty-four hours, I'd say. Out!
Africa it is.
- Kosa? How are you?
- Lara?
- You had the jeep cleaned.
- I know how you like your equipment!
- Where are you? I can't see you.
- Don't worry, I can see you.
Where are you coming from now?
Keep going straight, keep your speed steady.
Lara! Welcome back!
Do you ever do anything the easy way?
And risk disappointing you?
I've lost my friend and
I'm not sure where to go...
Nice shirt.
She went to Kilimanjaro to play with the elephants.
Kosa, we've never been here, have we?
We didn't come to this area before. Why?
I've seen that mountain before.
The box is there somewhere.
The locals call it
"The Mountain of God".
There's a tribe that makes a home on it that might help us.
Leave this object and go.
Leave this object and go.
And never speak of it.
To trespass on The Cradle of Life is to risk flooding the world with death.
Men are coming for the box.
Unlike me, they won't look at it with fear or respect.
They will open it. They want to use it.
I'm sorry if I have to disturb your gods to keep this from happening.
But I will do whatever I must.
Do you truly understand what you are doing?
Are you truly prepared for what you are about to learn?
Some secrets must remain secrets.
These are very heavy burdens, very lonely burdens.
If you find the box, you will have to carry them.
I am prepared, sir.
He warns that no one who has looked for the box has come back.
He says the land beyond the canyon belongs to the Shadow Guardians.
Shadow Guardians?
They do not sleep.
They never rest.
They move like the wind.
And anything that walks their land will die.
And the Cradle itself?
Only with the orb can it be revealed.
Inside you will find a place of madness.
Sky and Earth are one.
Direction, meaningless.
He's going to give us twenty men to take us as far as they can, to The Cradle of Life where the box is hidden.
We're getting closer.
He said you're right.
The Cradle of Life lies near the summit.
- He wants to know how you knew.
- The orb.
He says he will not turn back with the others. He'll go as far as we go.
- He will fight the Shadow Guardians.
- You're a very brave man.
What is he saying?
That your accent is funny.
Get down!
Get down!
Back! Back!
Back! Get back!
Thank you, Lara, for leading us here and for finding the orb.
However, you have seen the exact position.
You could save me hours, days even.
Help me, I'll make it worth your while.
No.
Think of what I'm offering you.
Let her go.
A chance to find out how it all began.
Life, Lara, the origin of what we are.
Don't tell me you're not tempted.
- That's what got Pandora into trouble.
- They told me you wouldn't do it.
And I told them you would, rather than lose two of your closest friends.
- Take us to The Cradle of Life.
- I'm sorry, Lara.
It's your destiny to see what's inside.
He is right. It's just beyond the canyon, remember?
Such a short walk might save your friends.
Well, if it spares my friends...
I'm up for a walk.
I'm sure she'd understand.
You should've told her we were hostage.
He'd never have found her.
I don't suppose either of you know how to fly a helicopter?
I can.
- What?
- What?
I've got over 150 hours between flight simulation games, models...
And in the real thing?
- Two.
- Two?
You're only gonna fly it once I'm out, so remember your two hours well!
It's through here?
Move, baby.
What was that?
You! Check it out!
Keep moving!
What are you doing?
Back in formation now!
Holy shit!
Don't!
They seem to react to movement.
They're gone.
We're close. I've seen it in your eyes.
Take me to Pandora's box.
- I don't know how.
- Do it now!
You were the one who wanted to go for a walk. So start walking!
The next one will be higher.
Only with the orb can it be revealed.
Only with the orb can it be revealed.
All right. I'll need the orb.
Do you want to see
The Cradle of Life or not?
You tell me what to do with it.
Don't think you can outwit me, Croft.
Oh, do shut up!
So, this is The Cradle of Life...
Here we are.
It's all yours. Time to be a hero.
There it is.
Perfect, isn't it? All that power in such a banal container.
When Pandora saw inside the box, she cried black acid for tears.
And, as it was a woman who found the box,
I see no reason to break with tradition.
A woman should collect the box.
Go on!
It is impossible to reach.
Now take it!
Take it!
I don't think so, Reiss!
You OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- There you go.
- You come prepared.
- I know how clumsy you are.
Hillary and Bryce?
They're fine.
Thank you.
What was that?
Thank you.
Let's get out of here.
Terry? What are you doing?
You're joking, right?
We're taking this with us. This is ours.
You're not walking out of here with that box.
So you're saying we just leave it, when it's worth a fortune?
- Put it back.
- I don't think so.
It could kill millions of innocent people.
- Now you're being dramatic.
- Put it back.
No!
I've helped you keep this away from Reiss. This is my reward.
I'm taking it with me.
So it's come to this, has it?
Well, you do have authorisation to kill me.
Better do it, then.
'Cause if you think standing in front of me is gonna be enough...
You don't have it in you to stop me.
See, all your beliefs...
...all your ideals, they're not real.
I am. And you've loved me.
You think you're strong, but you'll not choose them over me.
- Now move.
- No.
Fine.
The box is safe now.
Some things are not meant to be found.
Didn't you ever do anything the easy way?
I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
- Lara, are you OK?
- All right?
This is... very touching.
You know us, always making friends, having a laugh.
Getting married...
What?
This is a wedding ceremony and you are the grooms.
Good luck, boys!
Go!
