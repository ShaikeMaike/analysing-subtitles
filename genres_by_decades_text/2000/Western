Think she'll get over thisaway?
Might.
Best bed them down.
Come on, Tig.
There she goes.
Looks like we're in for it.
You see them?
Can't see them.
Can't hear them.
You ever seen one this bad?
Not since Noah and the flood.
Well, you should know, Boss, since you was there.
What did you say?
He said, "You should know since you was there. "
Well, even that wasn't this damn wet.
One thing's certain.
Noah never shoveled as much bull from them he had aboard.
Let's rustle up some grub.
Mose?
Hey!
- That hurt?
- Yeah.
Mose, still got them cards?
Yeah, I got them.
Get them out, and let's have us a game after breakfast.
Button!
Pull them plates under here.
You gonna play them cards, Mose, or stare a hole through them?
Don't rush me.
I'll take four.
Oh, for pity's sakes.
"Take four. "
All right, that's it.
I'm out.
Me too.
A man's trust is a valuable thing, Button.
You don't want to lose it for a handful of cards.
Well, at least it ain't raining.
Get yourself dressed, Button.
Help Mose get things cleaned up.
Then you walk out and look for them horses.
Looks like you could use a little muscle there, Charley.
You just keep on like you are.
You'll get your chance soon enough.
No need to ask for more chores, Mose.
Every man's got to pull his weight.
Yeah, but my weight is half of yours.
You know, it's hard to figure
Charley sometimes.
I ain't even sure if he likes me.
He likes you.
You know, Boss had some pause about hiring me on.
Too big to get around on horses and work them cows.
Afraid I'd eat too much.
It was Charley that talked him into it, and I ain't one to take a man's confidence lightly.
You know I ain't, either.
I know you ain't, but it's best to keep remembering it if you want respect when you're riding with men like Charley and Boss.
Button, pull.
Pull it.
Button!
Button!
Quit playing with that dog and pull the wagon!
Pull it!
- Pull!
- Oh, yeah!
Yeah.
That's it.
Hey, hey!
Look at that!
Old Boss sure can cowboy, can't he?
Yeah.
Broke the mold after him.
Main bunch is working towards water.
We'll go up-country, find the rest, and we'll push them there.
Look at that.
A couple of damn kids.
Anyway, once we get them, we can start driving them back closer to camp.
It'll be a while before we see another town.
Could use supplies, coffee and such.
Mose!
Ow!
Mose!
You'll have to ride back to that town we passed.
When you want me to go?
Tonight.
I'll go.
I can go.
How long you figure, Charley?
Without cows slowing things, maybe one day there, one back.
Sounds about right.
Come on, Boss.
I can do it.
Sure you can, boy.
Just don't know if that town's ready to have you turned loose on it just yet.
English!
Damn! Shit!
Bullshit!
By God, if you're gonna pick your feet like a monkey, you do it downwind.
Swear to God, old Tig takes better care of herself.
Starting to think it was a mistake not getting you on in some town to learn a trade.
I don't like towns.
Never liked them.
Oh, you're just saying that
'cause you heard me say it.
Get yourself a trade and set up in a town.
You'll always have a roof over your head, a bed up off the ground, and food no further away than a café.
Ain't that so, Charley?
That was a big help.
Might as well be talking to this horse.
Put your boot on, Button.
Let's go to work.
Course, if you was to live in a town...
You'd have to clean up some.
Otherwise, no one could stand the stink.
What you do that for?!
Cheating at cards.
Cheating.
I apologized to you for that!
Eh, Boss?
I apologized to him for that.
Evidently he ain't over it yet.
It's getting dark, Boss.
He could have got hurt between that town and the camp.
Probably just taking his time.
Don't suppose he got into a poker game, do you?
Wouldn't gamble your money, Boss.
What if he's lying out there waiting for us to come along?
We'd never find him tonight.
Now, come on down from there.
He's worried.
- You worried?
- Yeah, I'm worried.
Been worried since yesterday.
Should have sent me.
Mose can look out for himself.
Then why ain't he here with us?
Well, you never was wanting to go to towns.
Well, I don't want to go now neither.
But we better find him, wherever he is.
All right.
You and me strike out early.
Button can watch the outfit.
Button, come on down from there and get supper a-working.
Most likely be back before suppertime.
But three sets of eyes, it's better than two.
- You stay with the wagon.
- Come on, Boss.
No one is gonna bother it.
We haven't seen a single person since we set up the camp.
I always feel better if someone's close around.
You been working hard, deserve a little loafing time.
Stay right here.
Stay, Tig.
Wants to go.
She acts like she does, but she don't.
Still got the heart, not the legs.
You keep that rifle close.
Always liked me a sidearm with some heft.
Took this off a man who couldn't pay all he owed for some cows.
Damn fine weapon.
Always noticed you favor something light, don't you?
Set it right down.
Thank you.
Hello!
- Howdy.
- Howdy.
Like to feed and water them, curry them down with saddles on.
Okay, that'll be four bits each.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
Not planning on staying long?
Long as it takes to find who we're looking for.
Maybe I can help you gents.
I been here since Harmonville was Fort Harmon and we still had soldiers to chase off Indians.
I know everybody in town and for miles beyond.
Big man needing a haircut, about 30.
That's his rig right there.
Oh, yeah.
Know who you're talking about.
Very friendly young fella.
Looks like he's been living out of saddlebags most of his life.
Got his horse in the corral.
Ride with you, does he?
Know where we can find him?
Yeah.
Yeah, he's up in the jailhouse.
He got into it with some cattlemen over at the general store.
- Some cattlemen.
- Yeah.
Busted them up pretty bad, too, before Marshal Poole came up and hit him over the head with his gun barrel.
Yeah, he's lucky he didn't get shot in the back.
You might want to keep that in mind when you're talking to Marshal Poole.
Saddle his horse.
That cover what he owes?
Oh, yeah.
Name's Percy if you should need anything else.
Much obliged.
Hold on.
How long you had him here?
I brought him in here yesterday afternoon.
It wasn't easy getting him into the cell.
Why is that?
Goddamn bear.
Size of it.
Evening.
Name's Boss Spearman.
This here's Charley Waite.
Evening.
Believe you have a friend of ours.
Name's Mose Harrison.
Yeah, I got him here.
He started a fight in the general store.
Mose don't start fights, just finishes them.
I just said he started it.
You said he didn't.
Maybe you're calling me a liar.
You got a charge against him?
I got plenty.
Inciting a fight.
Disturbing the peace.
Creating a public nuisance.
Take your pick.
Hear tell he got hit over the head.
He'll be fine.
Well, I come to get him.
Well, you pay the fines, and you can have him.
How does $50 each offense sound?
Like robbery.
Lot of money.
Oh, yes, a lot of money.
I been waiting for you,
Mr. Spearman.
My name's Denton Baxter.
Be your men Mose tussled with.
That's right.
You know, folks in Fort Harmon country don't take to free grazers or free grazing.
They hate them more than they used to hate the Indians.
I expect by "folks," you mean ranchers like yourself.
I got the biggest spread around.
Bigger than any three or four put together.
Built it up with me own two hands, piece by piece, along with this town.
And there ain't no free-graze cattle gonna take the feed off my cattle on this range.
Free graze is legal.
Times change, Mr. Spearman.
Most folks change with them.
A few holdouts never do.
You know, a few years back, a free-graze outfit came through.
One night, the cattle got stampeded, the wagons caught on fire, and one of those boys was shot off his horse in the middle of it all.
Shot in the back, was he?
Your man's horse and rig are at the livery barn.
You can take him with you when you leave tonight.
And come sunrise, you hitch up your wagon and get your damn free-graze cattle moving and keep them moving till you're out of Fort Harmon country!
Now, you let Mr. Spearman fetch his man so he can be on his way.
Charley.
- Mose.
Mose.
Looks like someone's put the boots to him after he was down.
Does it?
Mose, you gotta get up.
Charley, I'm glad to see you.
I don't much like this town.
Here you go.
Boy, they really lit into him.
You got a doctor in this town?
Yeah.
Doc Barlow.
It's the house up behind the barn by the church.
Look for a picket fence.
He's got a sign out front.
Oh, my.
Bring him right in.
Lay him down in there.
I'll fetch the doctor.
Get his legs, Boss.
Easy, easy.
Good.
I'm Dr. Barlow.
Boss Spearman.
Charley Waite.
Patient there's Mose Harrison.
He works for me.
These wounds are old.
Easier to treat if you bring him in right away.
Your marshal had him, and he don't keep a friendly jail.
This is the man who was in the fight with Dent Baxter's men?
He certainly gave as good as he got.
Broke the arm of one.
Knowing them, they had it coming, I expect.
Let's see what we got here.
- Aah!
- Easy.
- Easy, Mose.
- Easy, Mr. Harrison.
Nobody's trying to hurt you on purpose.
I'd say you got a couple of broken ribs.
Gonna need to get this shirt off.
Sue, I am gonna need some soap, some water, and some alcohol.
I want you to drink this,
Mr. Harrison.
- That's it.
Let's clean up these cuts on his face.
He's got a nice gash in his scalp there.
I'd say to good health, but then I'd probably be out of business.
We'll drink to good health for them that have it coming.
The two of you can wait in the parlor.
Be better he didn't travel.
Well, he'll have to.
How much I owe you, Doctor?
We're even.
I figured I made enough off the damage he did to Baxter's men.
Wish he'd have made you wealthy.
Ma'am.
Doc Barlow's got him a pretty wife.
Notice that, did you?
Well, I ain't dead.
Glad to hear it.
Sweet, too.
Treated us as good as anybody.
That's a real lady.
A woman like that makes a man think about setting down roots, eh?
Doc looks like a real hardworking feller.
Probably working away on making some little ones, too.
Creates quite a picture, now, don't it?
Yeah.
Heard they're worth a thousand words.
Hey, Tig.
Now, where do you suppose he is?
Goddamn kid.
Button's all right, Boss.
Anyone done him harm, they'd have gone through the wagon.
Reckon you're right.
Here he is.
If you're awake, you might want to see this.
- Where you been?!
- I seen it before.
Out with the herd.
I thought I told you to stay with the wagon.
- What happened to Mose?
- Did you hear what I said?!
Yeah, but what happened?
Run into a little trouble in that town.
Looks like more than a little.
Are we moving on?
We always do, don't we, once we've grazed off a place?
Did I do something wrong?
Just leave him be for a while.
Here.
Have some coffee.
Made fresh, for a change.
There was three riders scouting up the herd this morning.
Where?
Maybe half a mile out.
Just sitting there, looking at the cattle.
Same ones?
Four this time.
Country's filling up.
Maybe we should push on.
Do no good, Button.
I seen them like Baxter before.
He means to have this herd or scatter it to the wind.
If he was gonna take the herd, why not just keep you in town?
Marshal already had Mose.
Wants us all in one place.
Far from there when it happens.
Don't make no sense, him telling us to move on and all.
Weren't the only thing he said.
Most time, a man will tell you his bad intentions if you listen, let yourself hear.
A few years back, a free-graze outfit come through.
That weren't no idle story.
Let's find out for certain.
Beautiful country.
A man can get lost out here, forget there's people and things that ain't so simple as this.
How long we been riding together, Charley?
Nigh on 10 years.
Mm-hmm.
You know what they call that, call it a decade.
Long time.
Been a lot of change since then.
What's on your mind, Boss?
Way I figure it, we can leave the cattle and run, or you and me can go in the dark and stop them before they scatter the herd.
You reckon them cows are worth getting killed over?
The cows is one thing.
But one man telling another where he can go in this country's something else.
That rancher sat in that jailhouse, sneering and letting his lawman lay down the law till he figured it was time to show us that he gave the orders around here.
Ooh, sticks in my craw.
Well, we sure as hell owe them for what they done to Mose.
Yeah.
I'll saddle the horses.
You two keep a sharp eye out.
Got the scatter-gun.
We'll be watching for them.
You'll want to douse that fire.
Button, keep to the wagon.
I don't want to see you out in the open.
Okay?
I got some sugar in that town.
It's in the wagon.
I wouldn't want to have him coming down on me like these cowboys.
What the hell's the matter with you, Gus?
You're twitching all damn night.
Damn back's so sore from being flung into that stove.
Feel like I been humped by a 300-pound whore.
Well, Gus, I'd say you got off easy.
Look at my face.
Well, you can bet Butler will square things with that big man for breaking his arm and all.
Did you hear it snap?
I heard it snap.
Lucky for him he shoots with either hand.
One twitch, and you're in hell!
Now, get on your feet, all of you!
Now, throw them guns on the ground.
I ain't a-gonna say it again.
And kick them away.
Which one of you's got a sore back?
Which one?
Him.
- You're Gus?
- Yeah.
Ought not gang up on a man three-to-one.
Ohh!
Wait a minute, mister.
- It wasn't our idea to jump him.
- Shut up, Wylie.
Get up, you son of a bitch.
- What's your name?
- Vince.
Mighty nice tie-down you got.
You're a gunhand, are you?
- You fast?
- No.
Uh-huh.
How many riders does he have?
I said, how many riders?
The rest are on their way to your wagon.
Uhh! Aah!
You want to smile now, go ahead.
Be a while before he's of use.
Charley, throw me them saddlebags.
Put your spook hats on.
The ones in your belt, put them on.
Now get your britches off.
Not taking my britches off for nobody.
You listen out of your good ear now.
Now, get them off!
Pretty scary bunch, eh, Charley?
Get belly-down, flat-out!
Uhh!
Get your peckers in the dirt.
- Hyah! Hah!
Hah!
If I hear so much as a twig break...
I'll come back and kill you all.
Charley.
Charley!
No Tig come to meet us.
Ooh.
The bastards.
They shot the boy, but he's alive.
Is that Mose?
He's dead.
Shot him in the head.
Charley?
Charley?
Charley, get the lantern and the whiskey.
Yeah.
Come on, wake up.
Charley.
They shot him here and cracked him in the head here.
We'll have to dig that bullet out.
You done good, Boss.
Him going in and out like that.
I don't know.
He lost a lot of blood.
A whack on the head can make a man strange for the rest of his days.
Well, you done all you can.
He needs a doctor now.
If Button lives through morning, you take him in the wagon and move on.
You just gonna sit out here waiting with them cows?
That's right.
And I'm gonna kill every son of a bitch that comes to take them.
For one man on open ground, you sure got a lot of killing in mind.
You know I never gone against you, Boss.
Always let you do most of the talking.
But he needs that doctor back in that town, and I aim to take him.
If you want to come, we'll go together.
Otherwise, you do what you have to do, I'll do the same.
You think they'll let you waltz in there and waltz out?
I don't figure into it.
Button deserves every chance we can give him.
All right.
But I aim to kill Baxter and those that done this.
And if that marshal gets in the way, I'm gonna kill him, too.
So you best get your mind right about what's got to be done.
I got no problem with killing, Boss.
Never have.
Looks real nice, Charley.
Yeah, a man ought to have something to show he was here.
Be gone in another big storm.
Don't matter none.
He's got your dog for company.
He'd like it you put old Tig with him.
Yeah, he was more
Mose's dog in the end than he was mine.
Be right to say some words.
You want to speak with the man upstairs, do it.
I'll stand right here and listen, but I ain't talking to that son of a bitch.
And I'll be holding a grudge for him letting this befall a sweet kid like Mose.
Well, he sure as hell wasn't one to complain.
Woke with a smile.
Seemed like he could keep it there all day.
Kind of man that'd say
"good morning" and mean it, whether it was or not.
To tell you the truth, Lord, if there was two gentler souls,
I never seen them.
Seemed like old Tig wouldn't even kill birds in the end.
Well, you got yourself a good man and a good dog, and I'm inclined to agree with Boss about holding a grudge against you for it.
I guess that means "amen. "
God.
Charley, you all right?
I'm fine.
Seems like you was, you know...
I said I'm fine.
Just got some old feelings coming up.
You know, we never asked each other much.
That's always been okay with me.
I figured it was okay with you.
But you said some things the last couple of days.
Things that seemed like they had kind of a history to them.
Hey, Charley?
Don't stand behind me, Boss.
When I was a kid, a bunch of us would go into the woods with our peashooters.
Nothing fancy, just enough to kill a bird or a squirrel, maybe something larger if we was lucky.
Killed my first man in them woods.
Held the paper on our farm, and after my pa died, he'd come around to get payment from my mom in any way he could.
Weren't much older than Button when I shot him in the throat.
Knew there'd be more killing, so
I run off and joined the Army.
War was on.
They was only too happy to have me.
My first skirmish was like hunting with my friends.
We just sat up in some trees, and they came marching at us.
Must have been a hundred of them dead after the smoke cleared.
Went around and shot the rest who weren't.
Those of us with the knack was made into a special squad so we could travel light and on our own into enemy territory.
Orders were pretty simple.
Make trouble wherever we could.
With room like that, it wasn't long before we was killing men that weren't even in uniform.
Seemed like that went on the rest of the war.
After that, I come West.
Lot of call for a man with them skills.
And I put them to work for men just like Baxter.
Every once in a while,
I almost get through a day without thinking about who I am, what I'd done.
He drifted off again.
No better, but no worse, either.
You're a real honest man,
Charley.
Well, I ain't gonna lie about Button.
Not Button I'm talking about.
- Mr. Spearman.
- The doctor in?
No, he's not here.
We got a boy that's hurt bad.
Here, put him in the examining room.
It's not his hearing, ma'am.
He hears real well when he's awake.
Mr. Spearman, I'm checking if there's blood in his ears.
It could mean a fractured skull.
Are you the boy's father?
No, ma'am.
His name's Button, and he works for me.
It appears that's not very healthy.
You know the way to the parlor.
Sit down.
I'll be a while.
Well, I don't think it's a fracture.
Concussion's more likely, but it's bad.
I have to admit, we don't see a lot of people shot.
I cleaned and dressed the wound.
Doesn't look infected.
What about the fever?
He needs to lay still and let his body do its work.
No offense, ma'am, but we come a long way to see that the boy gets looked after proper by Dr. Barlow.
Now, where's he at?
One of Dent Baxter's hands came and fetched him out to the ranch.
Some men there had an accident night before last.
You must tell me what happened,
Mr. Spearman.
Baxter sent his men to stampede the herd, and I figured me and Charley to stop them.
Surprised them where they was hiding, and we had at them.
Them's the one Dr. Barlow's putting back together.
We got back to camp, others had shot Mose in the head, shot Button, left him for dead.
Oh.
Shot our dog.
I'll be getting money.
It's not necessary.
We pay our way, ma'am.
Please, sit, Mr. Waite.
Button.
Is that his real name?
Please, sit.
Yeah, it's the only one we've known.
He's just a boy.
Yeah.
Picked him up in a Texas town a few years back, living off café garbage.
Couldn't speak a word of English.
Thought we was doing him a favor.
What about you?
Hmm?
You know that the marshal works for Baxter.
People saw you ride in.
There's payment to be made by them that done this.
Don't intend to run.
We could wire for the federal marshal.
If he started riding today, he wouldn't make it for a week.
With the storm coming, maybe longer.
We're obliged to deal with the marshal and Baxter ourselves.
What about Button?
Well, he's fighting for his life.
We're gonna do the same.
Whatever's needed for Button, you do it.
If he wakes, he's gonna need to stay here a couple days so we can watch him.
Whatever's best for him.
Can't stay away from my little paradise, gents?!
Believe Satan says the same at the gates of hell, old-timer!
We'd like to put the horses up.
Had a tough trail.
I'd like to set the wagon yonder.
Help yourself!
Hurry up, though!
I seen it like this before!
Big one's coming!
Hyah, hyah, hyah!
Son of a bitch.
Sorry, Charley.
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Maybe you should have built it in another spot.
Ah, mercy.
Get the dog!
Get the dog!
Get the dog!
It's a dog there, Charley.
Take this.
There he is.
Back here, Charley!
To your left!
To your left!
Get him!
Get him!
You all right, Charley?
Yeah, considering
I've just been swimming.
I owe you, mister.
That's a sweet pup you got there.
Remind you of anyone, Charley?
Small version.
Too small to be let out in this weather.
Belongs to my daughter.
I tried to grab him, but the water was too fast for me.
If you're going into the café,
I'd be proud to buy you both a cup of coffee.
Coffee would be good about now.
This is like the storm that washed away Gunnison
10, 12 years back.
The water come down from the mountains.
Nowhere to go but straight into town.
- Killed a lot of folks.
- It's okay, Bill.
Town's been here a long time, Mack.
It'll be here a lot longer.
That's right, Papa.
Every once in a while, a good storm washes through and leaves her as clean as a baby's bottom.
Got to look on the bright side, gents.
Marshal.
Meat and spuds, Les, as always.
That should cover our meal.
Worth a man's life to walk across that road tonight.
Thanks for the coffee.
Well, appreciate what you done.
That'll be two bits.
Two bits.
I'll be having words with you two.
And we'll be having more than that with you, Marshal.
No need to make the café messy... with folks.
I've got a warrant sworn out for your arrest for assaulting Baxter's men.
We got a warrant sworn for attempted murder for them that tried to kill the boy who's laying over there at the doc's.
Swore out another one for them that murdered the big fellow you had in your cell.
Only ours ain't writ by no tin star bought and paid for, Marshal.
It's writ by us.
And we aim to enforce it.
Is that so?
We got no quarrel with none of you folks.
Baxter's men bushwhacked our friend and shot him dead.
Shot a 16-year-old boy, too.
And clubbed him so hard...
He might not live.
Tried to take our cattle.
Your marshal here ain't gonna do nothing about it.
You don't like free grazers in this town.
We don't much like being here.
But a man's got a right to protect his property and his life.
And we ain't letting no rancher or his lawman take either.
We got no intention of harming bystanders.
Anyone who helps or comforts these goddamn lawbreaking free grazers is gonna have to deal with me.
Your call, Marshal.
We don't have to settle this here and now.
You ain't going nowhere in this weather.
But I'll be seeing you gents real soon.
You can count on that.
That marshal ain't gonna wait.
That son of a bitch is gonna get some men, come looking for us.
He's gonna need us locked up tight in that jail by the time Baxter hits town,
'cause if we ain't,
Baxter's gonna start to think that maybe Marshal Poole ain't worth what he's paying him.
You got something on your mind, just spit it out.
Well, I say we take him right at the jail.
Lock him up, wait for Baxter to come riding in.
Hell, Charley, why don't we just ride out to Baxter's ranch and go straight at him, too?
Well, I'll fight wherever you want, Boss.
You just make the call.
God damn it.
Now, hold on, Charley.
Hold on.
Well, you asked me.
I told you.
Charley, come on in out of the rain, would you?
Come on.
Come on.
Just getting testy in my old age.
Sounds like it's not such a bad idea.
Just roll it around is all I ask.
All right.
What'd you think of my speech in there?
Liked it.
Maybe I ought to run for mayor.
Well, I believe officeholders got to be living, Boss.
Come to see about the boy.
He's asleep.
But, please, come in.
Are you sure, ma'am?
We're a mite rank.
We don't want to mess your house.
No, no.
No, please, it's all right.
Come on in.
Thank you, ma'am.
There you are.
I can't get my fingers in.
We can't get our big fat fingers in these holes.
- Too many broke knuckles.
Oh, let me get you something bigger.
- No, ma'am, we can make do.
- No, no. It's all right.
It's just nice to be sitting at a table set with fine china.
Those were my mother's.
They were the only things of hers that survived the trip out here.
I don't know why
I bring them out.
I can't hold them, either.
Guess it just makes me feel good.
I say what's on my mind, good or bad.
I admire that.
Try living with it.
See that?
No need for a wife or home.
We're just like a... an old married couple.
So, is it marriage that scares you two
- or putting down roots?
- No. Who'd have him?
All rangy and mangy like a rough old dog.
How about I hold your head underwater for just a little while?
I married once.
Never knowed that, did you, Charley?
Had a wife and child.
Sweet little spread, too.
It was nothing fancy, but we was young.
Loved each other.
Never had a cross word.
They caught the typhus and died.
And after that, home didn't seem a place to spend time.
Believe I've changed my mind on that now that I'm getting on in years.
If Button lives and we survive Baxter,
I swear I aim to see to it there's a home he's sleeping in instead of the cold prairie.
Have yourself a last cup of tea, Charley.
I'd like to see Button again,
Miss Barlow.
Of course.
I know the way.
Whew.
Been riding with him 10 years.
Never said nothing about being married.
Where are you and Mr. Spearman spending the night?
Don't rightly know.
It... depends on circumstances.
You mean Marshal Poole?
We have a spare room.
It's yours if you want it.
Couldn't do that, ma'am.
We'd be putting you in a spot with the marshal and Baxter.
Besides, it's a small town.
Wouldn't look right, particularly with the doc away.
I'll take those.
You know where they go?
I saw.
Thank you.
Been raining like hell ever since we got here.
Water washing right down
Main Street.
Charley saved a pup from being washed away.
Looked a little like old Tig.
Now, if you can, you got to listen and pay attention.
'Cause I got something important to say.
I ain't been looking after you for you to go out this way.
The world ain't a perfect place, Button.
But you got unfinished business here.
So you come back, you hear me, now?
You come back.
Kind of dumb talking to him like that.
No.
No, it's good.
You all right, Mr. Spearman?
Believe I'm as right as a man can be under the circumstances.
Circumstances? That's just what
Mr. Waite called them.
I asked him to reconsider, and I'm asking you.
By "reconsider," you mean tuck tail and run?
I mean save your life and his.
He'll listen to you.
Charley thinks for hisself,
Miss Barlow.
He's a good man, and he knows what has to be done.
I'll be paying you now for whatever else Button needs.
In case it goes bad for Charley and me, maybe you and the doc will see we're taken care of properly.
I'd like to put pen to paper if you have them.
Yes. Of course.
Mr. Waite?
Look at my face.
- Oh! Sorry!
I'm sorry.
It's all right, Charley.
Okay?
It just be us.
It's all right, Charley.
It's all right, Charley.
It's all right.
I'll get it.
Jumpy is all.
She ought not to sneak up like that.
She weren't sneaking.
I scared that woman half to death.
Yeah.
Scared me a little bit, too.
Well, that's how it is, Boss.
Ain't a pretty picture.
Got your wits about you now?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It weren't as bad as it looked.
I'll bet.
Go! Hyah!
Two whiskeys, barkeep.
Barkeep!
Two whiskeys.
You see that sign?
Around these parts, free grazers is the first.
Now, he asked you twice.
Ain't gonna ask again.
Hey, Bill, it's all right.
These are the fellows that saved my dog.
I couldn't serve them if they saved Jesus himself.
Mr. Baxter would have my job.
Baxter the owner?
That's right.
Give me a bottle.
I'll serve them myself.
You know I can't do that.
Now we'll have our drinks.
Believe I'll have me another.
Yes.
Well, looks like the rain's let up a bit.
Well, if it don't, there'll be trout fishing right on Main Street.
I'd like you to meet my boys.
Ray and Cory.
We run a freight outfit when the weather cooperates.
Boss Spearman.
And the marksman here is Charley Waite.
Is all that true, what you said in the café?
Yeah.
There's a kid at the doc's house put on death's doorstep by Baxter.
Doc's wife's caring for him until he comes back after the storm.
Doc's wife?
Yeah.
Miss Barlow.
You mean Sue?
That's right.
Well, she'd make somebody a fine wife.
But she ain't the doc's.
That's his sister.
His sister?
Ain't his wife.
Good evening, Mack.
Ralph.
Ray, Cory.
Whiskey.
This is Ralph Peterson.
He runs the general store.
That's where I was when the dog got free.
You fellers the free grazers,
I expect.
No offense.
Personally, I don't stand with others around here about free grazers.
There was a fight in your store about a week or so back.
Some of Baxter's men jumped our friend.
He was a big feller.
Yeah.
I saw the whole thing.
That big feller drubbed the hell out of them other three.
Broke one's arm.
Be a gunhand named Butler, would it?
That's what they say.
Felt bad about your friend.
Is he all right?
He's dead.
That's too bad.
Seemed like a nice young feller.
It's a shame what this town has come to.
You could do something about it.
What?
We're freighters.
Ralph here's a shopkeeper.
You're men, ain't you?
I didn't raise my boys just to see them killed.
Well, you may not know this, but there's things that gnaw on a man worse than dying.
Hey!
Evening, gents.
Evening.
Better get out of this weather, or your bones are gonna be even stiffer than mine.
Heading into the saloon to do just that.
Come looking for you boys.
I'd have bought you a drink if you was earlier.
Then turn around and do it now.
Marshal's got men waiting to waylay you back at the livery.
Another one's in your wagon.
And then there's another in the shed across from it.
Marshal with them?
No.
He's sitting up there all by his lonesome in that warm, dry jailhouse with his feet up waiting for them to bring you in.
Or kill you.
Well, thanks for the warning.
Like I told you, never been partial to the marshal's ways.
Dent Baxter's either.
You're near the only friend we got in this town.
I'll be buying a drink or two.
You keep it quiet, all right?
Time's come.
How you want to play it?
Well, I work for you, Boss.
I'll play it however you want.
Nobody works for anybody here,
Charley.
Now, the name Butler mean anything to you?
You hear names when you're on the other side of things.
He as fast as they say?
He's a killer.
Know him if you saw him?
He ain't hard to recognize if you know what you're looking for.
Yeah.
Too bad if we get shot up tonight before we get a chance at him and Baxter.
Sure as hell is.
Tell you what,
I'd like to sit someplace dry while the marshal's men sit out in this rain.
Won't be so steady come morning.
Small town.
It's hard to hide even at night in this weather.
What do you want to do?
Yep.
Heard me an idea sounded pretty good.
You did, did you?
Well, all right.
He's alone.
Get your hands up.
You must be plumb crazy.
Shut up.
You're dead men.
Didn't he tell you to shut up?
What's that?
Chloroform.
Stole it from the doc's.
You gonna arrest me for that, Marshal?
Jesus.
Well, looky here.
He's asleep.
No.
Looky here.
Put 'em down.
This way.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
You like it, you son of a buck, you?
- Huh?
A little bit more?
A bit more?
A bit more.
Wasn't no call to leave me setting out like that.
- There wasn't a lot of time.
- I ain't bait, Charley.
I hear you.
Best you remember it.
Well, I guess you ain't gonna let me forget, are you?
Starting to enjoy that part, aren't you?
Sorry if we woke you.
No, no.
You didn't.
- Come to see if...
- Go see for yourself.
Hey.
- Hey, Boss.
- Hey.
You gave us a fright, pard.
Thought we was gonna lose you.
Just taking a little nap, that's all.
It's good to have you back.
We owe you, Miss Barlow, and we thank you.
You best thank God instead.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll... give that a try.
Well, I expect you men are hungry.
Button just ate.
I thought I'd make myself some breakfast.
Two more mouths wouldn't be any bother.
I'm just gonna change.
You.
You should try to sleep.
He will.
Now, you do as she says now.
Yes, Boss.
Okay.
Boss?
Yeah?
Mose?
I'll be along in a minute,
Charley.
Be seeing you, Button.
Aah.
If you don't mind my saying, ma'am, you look...
Tired.
Oh.
It's been a long night.
Why don't you sit?
Let an old cowpoke cook up some breakfast.
No, I couldn't let you.
Sure, you could.
Thank you.
I want to apologize for earlier.
Oh, no, no.
There's no need.
You were startled.
No, it was more than that.
I've been trying to put some bad times behind me.
But sometimes they don't stay put.
Always makes me feel better to let things breathe a little.
Not bury them.
I'm learning that.
Trying, anyway.
Well, that's all any of us can do.
Just glad Button's getting better.
Don't believe I've ever seen
Boss so worried.
Well, the doctor will be on his way home as soon as the storm's passed.
By the doctor, you mean your brother?
It's just we've been thinking that you and the doc was... husband and wife.
Oh.
You did?
Didn't find out till last night.
Thought you was married, Sue.
Why, no.
I'm...
I'm not, Charley.
Well, that's good.
I mean that's good to know.
Otherwise, we'd been thinking wrong.
We wouldn't want to do that.
No.
No, of course not.
Much obliged to you, ma'am.
You're very welcome,
Mr. Spearman.
Thank you, Sue.
Take care of yourself,
Charley.
Are you just gonna go off like that without saying nothing?
Ain't nothing to say.
I seen how you look at that gal and the way she looks at you.
It ain't right to walk away without a word.
What do you want me to tell her, Boss?
We probably ain't gonna make it?
Be a big fat comfort.
I don't know what you should tell her, Charley.
I wish I'd have said more to my wife before she passed.
This may be the last time she sees you in this world, Charley.
Or you her.
So tell her whatever you can.
'Cause she's entitled to more than just your backside walking away.
Charley.
I'm not sure what's worth saying or not.
Well, you don't have to say anything.
Yeah, I do.
Boss is right about that.
He's right about a lot of things.
It's just...
I'm not who you think
I am, Sue.
I've... been places.
I've done things.
Most of them, I'm not proud of.
You know, I always hoped somebody gentle and caring might come along.
Years pass.
A small town and all.
And your hopes begin to fade a little every day until you hardly remember what they were.
I've seen who you are, Charley.
The way you looked after that boy and the respect you give Boss.
It might be little bits.
But they're enough for a woman who looks.
Men are gonna get killed here today, Sue.
And I'm gonna kill them.
You understand that?
Yes.
I want you to have this.
It's always brought me luck.
I... can't take your locket.
It's not your choice when it's a gift.
It's a good likeness of you.
It's my mother when she was young.
She's beautiful.
I want you to know that if I don't ever see you again that I meant everything
I said to you and I appreciate everything you said to me.
Ain't nothing that happened in this old town been a surprise.
Except you.
I'll be seeing you,
Charley Waite.
Happy?
Yeah.
If you are.
Morning, boys.
Brung you breakfast.
Hey, you kids.
Come away from there.
Come on.
You get along.
What do you suppose this looks like?
It don't matter.
Whole town knows there's a fight coming.
They just hope it don't spill over to them.
Well, if I'm gonna get killed,
I got a hankering to soothe my sweet tooth.
Morning.
Morning.
What can I do for you fellers?
Thinking about some candy.
- Candy?
- Yeah.
Yes, sir.
Candy.
Got anything you want.
- Got jawbreakers.
- Yeah.
Gumdrops, candy canes, licorice, caramel, honey crisp.
Jujubes, lollipops, milk chocolate...
Looking for something special.
Now, what's the most expensive you've got?
Well...
Ooh.
I got just the thing.
- This is dark chocolate.
- Yeah.
It comes all the way from Switzerland, Europe.
That's near France, see.
They call it bittersweet.
Melts in your mouth.
- You tried it?
- No.
How do you know it melts in your mouth?
Well, truth is we can't afford it ourselves.
Mm-hmm.
I'll take two.
Don't you want to know how much?
Nope.
Yes, sir.
And three of your finest cigars.
My friend and me got a hankering for Switzerland chocolate and a good smoke.
Now, these come all the way from Havana, Cuba.
Thank you.
- Anything else?
- No. That'll do it.
How much I owe you?
It's... $5.
Charley.
Here you are.
Believe I'll enjoy these later, Boss.
Yep.
You ought to do yourselves a favor and ride on while you still got time.
Tried minding our own business.
This is good.
Worth every penny.
You're gonna get yourselves killed.
Try that, Ralph.
Go on.
Sitting right here in front of you.
Never even tried it.
Shame to go forever without taking a taste of something.
Charley, let's go.
Percy!
Up here!
Brought you a cigar.
All the way from Havana, Cuba.
You don't say?
I've heard about them, but I never had one.
Much obliged to you.
What do you think?
Better than them crappers
I usually smoke.
So, you're gonna make your stand down here?
Yeah.
But out there around our wagon.
Not much choice without getting a lot of innocent folks shot up.
Like to place some guns and ammo where we can get to it on a short run.
Help yourself.
We'll try to stay out of your barn.
Might not be able to.
Best bring in your livestock.
Be wishing you good luck now.
Thank you.
It's a pretty day for making things right.
Well, enjoy it.
Because once it starts, it's gonna be messy like nothing you ever seen.
I ain't survived my years without being in some fights, Charley.
I ain't doubting your grit, Boss.
You got more than any man
I ever known.
It's just that...
I don't mean to be hard.
It's just the other night, them fellows back in them trees we let go.
It was my call, Charley.
I can see now it was probably a mistake.
It's not what I meant.
I mean, maybe it was.
But the fact is it's what I always respected about you.
What I always appreciated.
How you treated other people and how you treated me.
How you never look for no trouble.
That kept me from trouble.
But it's found us here, Boss.
And if we're to have any chance, you'll...
You go on and talk, Charley.
I'll hear you.
I'm almost certain they'll be overly confident in their numbers.
Especially if we're standing right out here in front of them.
It's not like we'll have any advantage.
But if they're out there with us, then they won't have as much as they might have otherwise.
I don't figure all of them to be killers.
Only two or three like Butler will have done much of it.
I'll be looking to him.
The others will be hired men.
Probably saddle tramps.
Maybe ex-Army.
The rest will be cowpunchers.
They won't want to line up in front of us.
It'll happen fast once I start.
So just keep yourself moving forward.
And they'll either move or root.
Maybe even freeze up.
It don't matter which.
You just start right in on them with that scatter-gun.
When you've done both barrels, drop it, pull your pistol, and make a run for that building where we stashed them others.
I'll be trying to do the same if I can.
Right.
Sounds like you got it all worked out.
Yeah.
Except the part where we don't get killed.
Best smoke these while we got the chance.
Yeah.
I'm thinking about getting out of the damn cattle business.
You never said nothing except nag me and Button about getting ourselves out.
Well, maybe my own words struck a chord.
Thought maybe
I'd sell off the cattle and have enough to start up a saloon somewhere.
Man could stay cool in the summer and dry in the winter.
Some dancing girls might be nice, you know?
Have to get me some.
Yeah.
"If I die, please sell my good horse and my good saddle and my guns to buy a tea set for Miss Barlow. "
"Charley Waite. "
"Postscript...
I like this one.
But I don't know. "
"Princess pattern. "
Oh, hell.
What's the matter?
Oh.
Looks like you waited too long.
Kind of like us and free grazing.
Well, good is good.
Melted or not.
Looks like you're plumb chained, to your work, Marshal.
Get up, Poole.
He ain't worth a damn.
Get them all up!
Sobered up!
Ooh.
I got a feeling there's gonna be a new marshal in town.
All right!
It's time to settle these free grazers.
Oh, you leave your horses.
We're walking down to their wagon.
When we get there, you better empty your guns in them.
Or I'll damn well shoot you myself.
Now, you three skirt the buildings.
Get into the alleys on the side.
- Come on.
Hayley!
Come away from there.
Finish these later.
Okay.
I'm not going to my maker without knowing your given name.
Mine ain't Waite.
It's Postelwaite.
Charles Travis Postelwaite.
What's yours?
Sure ain't Boss.
I mean it, Boss.
I'm asking you straight up.
It's Bluebonnet.
Bluebonnet?
Bluebonnet, yeah.
No middle name?
No, just Bluebonnet Spearman.
And don't you tell no one.
I want to hear you swear an oath. Now, go on.
I swear it.
All right.
Okay.
Just in case.
Said eight.
Count five.
You should have run when you had the chance, Spearman.
Not much for running from cowards.
I see the marshal ain't with you.
You won't find it so funny when you're all shot to hell and dying.
- You the one killed our friend?
- That's right.
I shot the boy, too, and I enjoyed it.
Hayley!
Back up!
Where's the back door?
- Back door!
- Right this way.
It's locked.
You hit?
I'm good.
You.
You get out of this house!
You pull that trigger, Baxter, and you can forget about me patching you up.
You get your bag.
You're with me.
Go on.
Get the hell up, Poole!
On your feet, God damn it!
Yeah!
You're... going out there.
We ain't ourselves yet!
I see they hobbled you.
It's been a while since I was in a fight.
I panicked. Fell back.
Like to have broke my foot.
Ornery old fool.
Well, or that damn Cuban cigar got me riled up.
Charley.
You two wait here.
Hold on, there, Charley.
Hold on.
I ain't looking over my shoulder the rest of my days.
Charley.
You said we was gonna kill them all.
I aim to do just that.
I meant kill them.
Not murder them.
Splitting hairs, ain't you, Boss?
Mister, I heard what you said.
I won't come after you.
I promise.
No, I expect you won't.
I ain't gonna let you do it, Charley.
You do this, you ain't no different than Poole or Baxter or that gunhand of his that murdered Mose.
Him killing Mose is how this started.
We come for justice, not vengeance.
Them is two different things.
Not today, they ain't.
Step aside!
Listen to him, son.
You done what you had to here because they give you no choice.
Don't go making this into something bad.
This ain't the way, pard.
Mister, thank you.
Thank you.
Didn't do it for you, boy.
Just make peace with your bad deeds.
Sue!
Get in here!
Oh, my God.
Get out of the way.
Button!
- Put it down.
- Let the lady be!
We got your boy, Spearman!
You better drop them guns and come walking down the street or I shoot him.
You've got ten seconds!
We ain't giving up our guns.
He's gonna kill Button anyway.
One!
The only chance for him or us when we walk up is these guns.
Two!
Three!
Sue!
Stop!
Stop it!
Stop it right now!
Four!
Sue.
You're a disgrace,
Marshal Poole.
You always have been.
I know it.
That's just the way it is.
Five!
Six!
Have a nice rest, did you, Marshal?
You'll be having a long one yourself in a minute.
Been enough killing for you?
Be enough when you're both dead and buried.
Let the woman and boy go.
They ain't a part of this.
If you want considerations, you drop them guns on the ground.
Let her take him to the doc's.
The doc's in jail, and he ain't leaving unless your guns are in the dirt.
I'll crush any man who stands with them!
When I finish that,
I'll torch your homes and drive your wives and children out into the cold prairie.
So you women, you better take hold of your men.
If you don't, you'll be raising orphans by winter.
Mack Langly!
It doesn't matter whether you run or stay!
You and your boys are already dead!
Mack Langly is our friend!
I didn't come all the way from Ireland to see my land pissed on by free grazers.
Now, I want them guns in the dirt.
Him first.
The gunhand.
Looks like you're losing your army, Marshal.
Get down!
It went through?
Yeah.
Is he hit, Sue?
- Sue, is he hit?
- No! No!
But he's bleeding bad again!
God damn it.
Can you stop it?
I'm trying.
I'm gonna kill you, Baxter!
Well, come on, if you're coming!
Can you cover me?
Might be best to wait him out.
Probably bleed to death.
I ain't waiting.
Button needs that doctor right now.
Well, you know, that door's locked.
Well, it won't be when the scatter-gun hits it.
I'm waiting for you, Spearman!
I'm coming for you, you son of a bitch.
Okay, Charley?
Yeah.
You ready?
Yeah.
I'm dying.
And for what?
More cows?
Killed a good man.
And maybe that boy out there out yonder.
You get no sympathy for your death.
Get!
You're... nothing.
Yeah? Maybe so.
But I'll still be breathing in another minute.
Well, kill me, then.
No.
I ain't wasting a good bullet to ease your pain, you son of a bitch.
Your man's in the saloon.
Ordered everybody out.
Asked to see your sister iffen she's willing.
He'd like to speak with you,
Miss Barlow, iffen you ain't offended by entering a saloon.
Sue.
Doc.
Bring him on up.
Put him in there.
We'll make room.
Baxter got any kin?
Daughter is all he has left.
It'd be right if somebody explained things to her.
There never was any love lost between 'em.
Even so, she's his daughter.
And kin is funny about such things.
Come on.
Come on.
I didn't mean for you to have to... walk into this place in front of those people.
I don't care what anyone out there thinks, Charley.
You don't have to stand up for me.
Well, just the same,
I wanted to tell you that I'll be leaving in a day or two.
I'd like you to stay.
I think others would, too.
I can't say I haven't thought about it.
Truth is, there wouldn't be a corner here that don't have a bad memory for me.
I've been holding my love a long time, Charley.
I know you feel something for me, too.
I do.
But I ain't no more than those who come to kill us.
You seen that yourself.
Maybe you've done some bad things.
Maybe worse than bad.
But what happened here today wasn't one of 'em.
And those killings, they don't give you pause?
I'm not afraid of you, Charley.
It brought me luck.
Just like you said.
It's yours now.
You keep it.
I don't have the answers,
Charley.
But I know that people get confused in this life about what they want and what they've done and what they think they should have because of it.
Everything they think they are or did takes hold so hard that it won't let them see what they can be.
I've got a big idea about us, Charley.
And I'm not gonna wait forever.
But I am gonna wait.
And when you're far away,
I want you to think about that.
And... come back to me.
I'm in love with you, Sue.
Been that way since
I first laid eyes on you.
Just took me a while to see things clear.
I know I'm not the kind of man you expected to walk up your front walk.
If I was your brother,
I wouldn't choose me for you.
Charley...
Do you know how old I am?
Don't care how old you are.
I'm not a girl anymore.
You're the handsomest woman
I ever saw.
I've had my disappointments,
Charley.
Well, I'm not gonna be one of them.
I never thought I'd live as long as I have, Sue.
I guess living the way I have, it never really mattered.
But thinking I was never gonna see you again was maybe...
Was maybe the most awful feeling
I ever had in my life.
I know I can be a good husband to you.
And I know I ain't asked you proper.
But I'm asking you now.
Will you marry me, Sue?
Charley.
Yes.
I'll marry you.
And can I kiss you?
I'm gonna give you a thousand of these before I'm done.
Hey, Charley!
Looks like the doc changed his mind about you.
Something wrong?
No.
Everything's fine.
I forgot to tell you
I'll have word about the saloon by the time you get back.
Sounds good.
You take care, now.
Charley.
Sue.
I'll be along.
Saloon?
Told you I was wanting out of the cattle business.
There's a saloon right back there just had its owner die.
Hoping you'd be my partner.
I cant afford something like that.
Not even half.
Well let the brains of the outfith do the thinking.
Sue!
You are coming back, aren't you?
And i will be waiting for you Charles!
Keep nothing private.
Have to go back know.
I don't want to loose side of the roof tops.
I mean it Sue.
Got to go!
How this gonna work if you don't do what i say.
I told you, I'm gonna give you a thousand of these before I'm done.
I'm gonna make sure you do.
Let's go get our cows!
You ever think about dying?
Yeah. You?
Yeah. Some.
You think there's a heaven?
Yeah. Don't you?
I don't know.
Yeah, maybe.
Can you believe there's a heaven if you don't believe in hell?
I guess you can believe what you want to.
This ranch has been in my family as long as anyone can remember.
My granddaddy used to tell me this was heaven on earth.
Just like his granddaddy used to tell him.
Everything's changed now since he died.
Appreciate you lighting them candles.
It wasn't me. It was the lady.
My mother?
She was here?
She's left already?
All I ever wanted was to live out there like him...
...and work my own spread.
Can't imagine no better life.
I've come to find out Mama aims to sell it.
Says the oil company would pay three times what iùs worth.
Mama lives in San Antonio now with her new husband.
She wants to be in the live theatre.
As your granddaddy's only child...
...your mother inherits outright.
Iùs her property.
She can do whatever she wants.
I don't have any say-so?
What about my father?
They're divorced.
You could talk to her.
You're a lawyer.
Well, I have talked to her.
Iùs a sorry piece of business, but, son...
...not everybody thinks life on a cattle ranch in Texas...
...is the second-best thing to going to heaven.
She don't want to live out there, thaùs all.
If it was a paying proposition, thaùd be one thing, but it ain't.
It could be.
I could run it.
Iùs his own damn fault.
Your father signed every paper she set in front of him.
Never lifted a hand to save himself.
I begged him to get a lawyer.
Well...
I'm sorry to have no better news...
...but some things in this world can't be helped.
I believe this is probably one of them.
She went back to San Antonio.
Don't call her "she."
Mama.
I thought the world of that old man.
Yeah.
Don't go crying on me now.
I ain't.
- Well, don't.
- I ain't.
- What do you think I should do?
- I don't think there's much to do.
- Will you talk to her?
- I can't.
You could talk to her.
Last conversation I had with her...
...was in San Diego, California, in 1942.
It ain't her fault.
I ain't the same as I once was.
Like to think I am...
...but I ain't.
You are inside.
Inside you are.
Iùs hard to watch people you came from waste away before your eyes.
When the land is gone too...
...there's nothing to stand on or stand for either.
When do y'all have to be out?
Closing is the first of June.
You could wait till then.
What for?
Down in Mexico...
...they got ranches so big...
...you can't ride from one end to the other in a week.
It ain't all fenced in and sold off and played out.
Not down there.
You think they can't use two more top hands?
Real cowboys, huh?
Just like the old-time waddies.
If I don't go, will you go anyways?
I'm already gone.
- Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye.
May God go with you.
Be careful.
Is that you, bud?
I hope so.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- They suspect anything?
- No.
- Leùs go.
- Hang on. Got to pile all this stuff.
- Yonder goes the light.
- Damn.
- Late for your own funeral.
- He could be getting milk.
He could just be loading a shotgun.
Shut up. Lacey, there's been somebody following us.
- Somebody on horseback?
- Yeah.
Come on.
Some kid.
Thaùs a hell of a horse.
Ain't it, though?
You hunting us?
- I ain't hunting you.
- Why you following us?
I ain't. I'm going to Langtry.
I don't even know you.
- Where'd you get that horse?
- Iùs mine.
- How old are you?
- Sixteen.
- Lying sack of shit!
- You don't know.
I know you ain't no goddamn 16.
- Whaùd you do, run off?
- What if I did?
We could sell his horse in Mexico.
- You want to?
- I ain't digging no grave this time.
Your idea. I was the one that said just leave him for the buzzards.
Call it.
Heads.
Damn.
Let me have your rifle.
It ain't fair.
You shot the last three.
You go on, then. You can owe me.
Hold his horse.
It might not be gun-broke.
Y'all ain't never shot nobody.
You could be a good somebody to start with.
Y'all just funning.
I knowed it all along.
Who's hunting you?
Nobody.
They're hunting that horse, though, right?
You ain't riding with us.
Get us in the jailhouse.
He belongs to me.
Son, I don't give a shit who he belongs to.
But he damn sure don't belong to you.
Now, leùs go, bud.
I thought he'd put up more of a argument.
We ain't seen the last of his skinny ass.
Thaùs her, ain't it?
Thaùs the goddamn Rio Grande.
Just think. Over yonder's Old Mexico.
You reckon you want to cross now?
Yeah. You?
Yeah.
Maybe we'd better rest these horses up first.
All right.
Shit.
I got a uneasy feeling about that son of a bitch.
I do too.
He ain't as green as he looks, neither.
There won't nobody be hunting me in Mexico.
That all depends on what you done.
- Whaùs your name?
- Jimmy Blevins.
You got any grub?
No.
You got any money?
No.
You're just a deadhead.
Just tell me one thing.
What the hell would we want you with us for?
Because I'm a American.
When did you eat last?
Other day.
Your name ain't Blivit, is it?
Iùs Blevins.
You know what a blivit is?
No. What?
Ten pounds of shit in a five-pound sack.
Y'all ain't said y'all's names was.
I'm John Grady Cole.
This here's Lacey Rawlins.
We're from San Angelo.
Where you from?
Uvalde County.
Near the Sabinal River.
What made you light out for Mexico?
Same reason as you.
What reason is that?
Because they'd go bowlegged and blind finding your ass down here.
Nobody's hunting me.
I told that son of a bitch he wasn't whupping me again.
- Your daddy?
- No.
He never came back from the war.
Your stepdaddy.
I know what iùs like to get a beating.
You didn't shoot him?
I woulÔve. And he knowed it too.
Suppose we trade that horse off for one less likely get us shot.
- I ain't trading horses.
- We ain't no wet nurses.
- I can take care of myself.
- Sure.
Hell, you're a regular old desperado, ain't you?
I reckon you got your own gun and all.
Yeah, I got a gun.
What kind of a gun?
- 32-20 Colt.
- Bullshit.
Thaùs a rifle cartridge.
Leùs see it.
Where'd you get a gun like this?
At the getting place.
- You ever shot it?
- Yeah, I shot it.
- You hit anything?
- Anything you want.
Bullshit.
All right, leùs go, outlaw. Come on.
You ready, Annie Oakley?
Waiting on you.
Goddamn.
Let me see it.
- Let me see it.
- We'd better get going.
- Come on, give it to me.
- You know what my wallet looks like.
Look at this shit.
She got anything to drink?
What is that?
- Cider.
- All right.
Leùs have three of them.
How much is it?
Iùs like three cents.
Oh, let your old dad buy it.
He about dead-centred your pocketbook, didn't he?
I want you to look at my goddamn driver's license.
And my pool hall card.
You won't need them down here.
Look at this shit.
Shot Betty Ward between the eyes.
Whaùs she doing in there?
I didn't know you liked her.
What is this? Cactus juice?
I don't know.
- Got a little kick to it, though.
- I think it does.
Pretty doggone good.
Say it again. Say my name again.
Golly!
What am I doing leaving my hat on the bed? Iùs not much.
You can't have no more cider.
Shit.
I'm drunker than shit.
Can you ride or not?
Hell, yeah, I can ride.
I was riding when I fell off.
I'm a regular buckaroo.
Certified damn bronc peeler.
Just leave him lay there.
Get on and quit assing around.
Iùs fixing to come a good one.
Come on.
I can't be out in this.
- Where do you think you'll go?
- Why can't you?
On account of the lightning.
Damn if you don't look sober all of a sudden.
- Are you afraid of lightning?
- It runs in the family.
My grandpa, he was killed in West Virginia in a mine bucket.
It run all the way down the hole to get him, 180 feet.
A great-uncle on my mother's side...
...was killed off a horse. Horse's hair wasn't singed, but it killed him.
I got a cousin not four year older than me.
He was struck by lightning coming back from his barn.
Melted the fillings in his teeth and soldered his jaw shut.
He's gone completely dipshit.
I done been struck twice myself.
How come me be deaf in this one ear?
I'm born to death by fire, man.
You'd better get away from all metal.
You don't know what iùd get you.
Your boot spurs, shirt buttons...
What do you intend to do?
Outride it.
You can't outride a thunderstorm.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Iùs the only chance I got.
I knowed it from the first time that son of a bitch had a loose nut.
What the hell are you doing?!
Just sitting here.
If this rain hits hard, there'll be a river come down like a train.
You thought about that?
You've never been struck by lightning.
You don't know what iùs like.
You'll drown sitting there.
Thaùs all right. I ain't never been drowned before.
Well...
...l'll say no more.
Your horse is gone.
Yeah, I know. I done been on foot looking around this morning.
Where'd you find that boot?
On the ground.
Well, what do you aim to do?
I don't know.
Leùs get your ass up out of there.
Got a spare shirt in my saddlebag.
You put that on.
Appreciate it.
Rawlins will pitch a pure hissy when he sees you.
I don't give a shit.
There's my damn pistol.
- Shit.
- Hold on.
Keep riding. Good God almighty.
I ain't leaving until I get my stuff.
- My gun too.
- Listen at that.
Get us all shot for horse-stealing don't mean a thing.
- It ain't stealing. Iùs mine.
- Shit-for-brains!
Hush. Both of you.
Get over here and sit down.
We're going to stick here...
...till about a hour before daylight.
Now, you got to play this exactly like we say.
If that don't satisfy, you tell us right now.
Yeah. Okay.
All right.
You go on and get some sleep.
And no fire tonight.
Every dumb thing I ever done in my life...
...there was a decision I made before that got me into it.
It was never the dumb thing.
It was always some choice I'd made before. You understand?
Yeah, I think so.
Meaning what?
Meaning this is it.
This is our last chance. Won't be no other time, I guarantee it.
- Meaning just leave him?
- Yes, sir.
What if it was you?
I wouldn't leave you, or you me.
You realize the fix he's in?
I realize it. Iùs the fix he's put himself in.
I can't do it.
Well, if you can't, you can't.
I guess I knew what you'd say anyways.
Oh, no. Damn it.
That little son of a bitch.
Hold up, hold up. Leùs listen.
You little son of a bitch.
- Boys, they're coming.
- Cars or horses?
Horses. And there ain't no way y'all can keep up.
I'll take the road. They'll follow the dust, since they're hunting me.
Get in the woods.
I'll see y'all down the road.
Leùs get off this damn road.
You think they caught him?
I don't know.
I'll say one thing for him anyways.
Whaùs that?
Son of a bitch wouldn't stand still for nobody hijacking his horse.
You got your boots on?
- Yeah.
- All right.
You reckon they're friendly?
Shoot, I hope so.
Where are you going?
We're just passing through.
We're looking for work.
Oh, yeah?
We might have some work for you.
He said maybe.
Can we come with you?
Yes, of course.
Good.
Go that way.
Over there?
Did you see that little darling?
Watch it. Bring him over here.
Get in there.
How long you reckon you'd like to stay here?
About a hundred years.
Now go to sleep.
There's Don Hector Rocha y Villareal.
Owns this whole shebang.
One of the last great ranches in Mexico.
27,000 acres.
Flies his own plane to Mexico City every week.
Manuel said this ranch been in this family 170 years.
You reckon that was his daughter?
Yeah, I guess it was.
Let me go get my boots on.
Looks like there's about 12 or 13 of them.
I make it 16.
Armando said the old man's got like 400 mustangs up on that mesa.
Damn.
You think you and me can break all 16 of them in four days?
- Why four days?
- You think we could do it?
You'd be about a wore-out sumbuck,
I'll tell you that.
I'll have a look at them.
Go talk to Armando.
How you doing?
I'm all right.
If we mess this up, bud, iùs gonna be a long ride back to Texas.
Give it some slack.
Thaùs it. Thaùs it. Whoa, boy.
I'll put a saddle on you right now.
Your jackets.
You tired?
The horse is arriving, get ready.
Don't delay!
Hector de la Rocha y Villareal.
John Grady Cole.
Glad to meet you.
Alfonsa, you look like an lmpressionist painting.
Armando says you know a lot about horses.
I've been around them some.
Do you know what a criollo is?
Yes, sir. Iùs a Argentine horse.
You're from Texas?
Yes, sir.
San Angelo.
Why are you here?
I just wanted to see the country,
I reckon. Or we did.
- You and your friend.
- Yes, sir.
But you are the leader.
We don't have no leaders.
No, we're just buddies.
Of course.
I recently purchased a thoroughbred stallion of excellent blood.
- You gonna raise racehorses?
- No. Quarter horses.
I'm thinking of breeding my stallion with my mesteno mares.
Whaùs your opinion on that?
Well, I've known it done.
There's been good cow horses sired out of thoroughbreds.
Of what importance is the mare?
Same as the sire. In my opinion.
Most breeders place more confidence in the stallion.
Yes, sir, they do.
But I agree with you.
And you rode all the way here from Texas?
Yes, sir.
- You and your friend?
- Yes, sir.
Just the two of you.
Yes, sir.
Just me and him.
Well, Mr. Cole, would you like to see some horses?
Yes, sir.
- It ain't like you was going away.
- No. We'd still be working together.
Iùs a good opportunity for you.
Hell, I'd do it.
They told me to come bunk in here.
I was going to put my horse in one of these stalls.
Can I put my horse in this stall?
Well, I guess we can talk later.
Thaùs your mare.
Look at the eye on her.
Bring this one here.
She's not as big as the other one, but thaùs your mare.
Do you like this one?
She's a beauty.
Looks like some of them got their hats on, bud.
I figure you just must be ready to cry yourself to sleep every night.
She's probably used to dating guys got their own airplanes, let alone cars.
You're probably right.
I'm glad to hear you say it.
It don't change nothing though.
My name's John Grady Cole.
My name is Alejandra.
I know.
I hoped that you would come.
I come because I thought you'd be here.
I know.
My granddaddy lived his whole life on that ranch.
Seventy-four years.
Seem there could hardly be one without the other.
I guess...
...the country lasts forever, and people ain't but for a while.
And how will you live now?
Where will your home be?
Whaùs wrong?
I dreamed about you last night.
What did you dream about?
Someday I may tell you.
But not tonight.
Do I have something in my nose?
No. I have something in my nose.
Do you like him?
A hell of a horse.
I want to ride him.
What?
I want to ride him.
When?
Now.
- I want to now.
- He don't have a saddle.
I know.
I don't think the patrÛn would want me to give him to you without a saddle.
Your father.
Get down.
- Are you sure about this?
- Yes!
Hurry.
Well, what do you aim to do with your horse?
I want you to take him back to the barn.
Somebody's gonna see me.
Fixing to get me in trouble.
You are in trouble.
I am Senorita Alfonsa.
I'm John Grady Cole.
I'm happy that you have come.
Alejandra will be in Mexico City with her mother for two weeks.
Then she'll be here for the summer.
Alejandra and I disagree strongly.
In fact, I...
She's so much like me at that age that l...
I seem, at times, to be struggling with my own past self.
So you see, I cannot help but be sympathetic to Alejandra.
But I won't have her unhappy.
I won't have her spoken ill of...
...or gossiped about.
I know what that is.
It is not proper for you to be seen riding in campo together...
...without supervision.
I considered whether to speak to my niece about it, but I...
I've decided not.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to be considerate of a young girl's reputation.
I never meant not to be.
I believe you.
But you see...
...this is another country.
Here, a woman's reputation is all she has.
There's no forgiveness...
...for women.
A man may lose his honour and regain it again, but a woman cannot.
I guess I'd have to say that don't seem right.
Iùs not a matter of right.
Iùs a matter of who must say.
And in this matter, I get to say.
What is it?
You're going to wake Esteban.
Then invite me in.
What did she say to you? My aunt?
You want to sit down?
Go on.
What did she say to you?
- Didn't she tell you what she said?
- Of course she did.
What did she say?
She said she didn't want me being seen with you in the campo.
And you agreed?
- You are afraid of her.
- No.
Just like everyone else.
It ain't like that.
I hate the way she treats me.
I thought you were my friend.
You tell me what you want me to do.
I'll do anything you say.
How's it going, Esteban?
See you after a while.
I know the old man likes you...
...that don't mean he'll sit for you courting his daughter.
Yeah, I know.
Well, I don't see you holding no aces, bud.
I see you fixing to get us fired and throwed off this place.
Take it easy, bud.
Get up!
Whaùs this all about?
No talking!
Yes, but I don't understand...
You understand "shut up"?
Leùs go.
I ain't above whipping your ass, you know.
Don't you think if we're gonna get out of this...
...we might think about how to get out of it together?
Like the way we got in it?
You think it was Rocha?
You think he sold us down the river?
I tried to reason with you.
Tried many times.
I know.
Some things ain't reasonable.
Look, I'm the same man you crossed that river with.
How I was is how I am.
And all I know to do is stick.
I don't believe in signing on just till it quit suiting you.
You either stick or you quit.
I wouldn't quit you.
I don't care what you done.
Thaùs about all I got to say.
I never quit you.
All right.
Hey, y'all.
Oh, God help me.
How long you been in here?
I don't know.
A long time.
- At least a month.
- You told them to hunt us?
I wouldn't do nothing like it.
Bullshit.
They wouldn't hunt us if they got that horse back. He done something.
It was my horse. My gun too.
- What did you do?
- Nothing nobody else wouldn't.
Did you come back here?
You're damn right I did.
Oh, Jesus, oh, God.
What did you do?
What are they accusing him of?
Murder.
He killed a man?
Three.
Said he killed three men.
Thaùs a damn lie.
Don't step in the bucket.
We're dead.
We're dead men.
I knew iùd come to this from the first moment...
- Don't start. That won't help.
- Ain't but one of them died.
Tell me what happened.
Well, I got me a job on this farm.
Saved me up some money.
Then I rode back here to get my pistol.
I seen it sticking in the son of a bitch's belt, so I just grabbed it.
And shot him.
He come at me.
What choice did I have?
What choice...?
By the time I got back to the spring where my horse was...
...they caught back up with me.
And the old boy, I shot off his horse.
He throwed down on me with a shotgun.
A rurales? Did you shoot a rurales?
- Yeah.
- Dead?
Yeah.
What do you think they mean to do?
- Send me to the penitentiary.
- You ain't gonna be that lucky.
Well, I'm too young to hang.
They'll lie about your age.
There's no capital punishment here.
- You knew they'd hunt us.
- Was I supposed to send a telegram?
- What happened to your feet?
- They busted them.
They didn't give you no bandages?
No.
Oh, shit.
Tell them whatever they want to hear.
It won't matter.
What did you say?
Told them we was murderers and horse thieves. You will too.
Your friend told us everything.
Better that you do the same to avoid some trouble.
You had no right to beat up on that boy.
We know nothing about Blevins.
He asked to ride with us.
We know nothing about the horse.
It got away from him in the storm and showed up here.
Thaùs when the trouble started.
We been working for Senor Rocha going on three months down at La Purisima.
You went down there and told him lies.
Rawlins is as good a boy as ever come out of Tom Green County.
Is that the criminal, Smith?
His name is Rawlins. He ain't a criminal. I grew up with him.
The assassin Blevins, he did not have any documents.
- He lost his clothes.
- He lost his clothes?
He has no feathers.
- He what?
- He has no feathers.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
That don't interest me.
Why does he come here and steal horses?
- It was his horse.
- No, iùs not.
You have it your own ignorant way.
As far as I know, that horse is his.
He had it in Texas and I saw him bring it to Mexico across a river.
That is not the facts.
We can make the truth here.
Or we can lose it here.
But in three days, you're going to be going to Saltillo.
Then iùll be too late for the truth.
Too late.
Because you'll be in the hands of other peoples...
...and who's to say what the truth will be then?
And then you'll think about this day...
...and you'll blame yourself.
There ain't but one truth.
Truth is not what come out of somebody's mouth.
The people in this town are very quiet people.
Very quiet people all the time.
And then comes this assassin Blevins...
...and he kills everybody and steals their horses.
Why does he do this?
Was he a good, quiet boy that never did no harm?
Then he comes here and does something like that? Is that what happened?
No. No, thaùs not what happened.
Thaùs not the truth.
Truth is he was always the other kind of boy.
He was never a quiet boy.
He was always the other kind.
What happened?
Nothing.
I think we're going to Saltillo.
Whaùs in Saltillo?
The penitentiary.
I think he wants to make a deal with us.
What kind of a deal?
To keep quiet.
That kind of a deal.
Keep quiet about what?
About Blevins.
About what about Blevins?
I think they aim to kill him.
I think they aim to kill Blevins.
Boys...
...this is going to be a long trip.
The old man said it would take all day.
I asked him. He said it was going to take all day.
Whaùs here?
Unload the prisoners, boys.
- What do we do here?
- Take a leak, I reckon.
Unload the prisoners.
Put them against the wall.
Sit them down.
Leùs go.
What are they going to do?
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Let go of me.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Let go of me.
This man came to me.
I don't go to this man.
He came to me to talk with me about justice...
...and how his own brother had died at the hands of the assassin Blevins.
Then when it came time to do justice...
...he could not shoot.
He was like a woman.
A man cannot go out to do something...
...and then not do it.
No, a man does not change his mind.
Thaùs always been my way in this world.
You didn't have to kill him.
CoulÔve just walked him back to the truck.
You don't know nothing.
See, in my country, we don't have death for criminals.
Monies have to be paid...
...and arrangements have to be made.
I tell you this because...
...you'll have to make arrangements with these peoples.
We don't have no money.
In here we have a boss, a jefe.
Everybody pays him.
Everybody does what he says.
I don't have any money. We ain't fixing to make any arrangements.
Oh, excuse me, but you will.
I'm telling you this because I like you.
You cannot stay here.
You stay here, you're gonna die.
And then comes other problems.
The paperwork is lost.
People cannot be found.
Who's to say you were even here?
Some crazy people can say that God is here.
But God is not here.
Everybody knows that God is not here.
I never dreamed there was such a place as this.
There's probably every kind of place you can think of.
They're gonna kill us.
Don't let them think they ain't gonna have to.
They either kill us or let us be.
Only way to get by in a place like this is go about your business.
Don't act scared.
Where are you going?
I don't know, bud.
Got a match?
What is it?
A knife. A good one.
Whaùs it like to be dead?
It ain't like nothing at all.
Whaùs it like to be dead?
It ain't like nothing at all.
Yes, sir, you're a good healer. Fast.
You been doing any doctoring on a boy named Lacey Rawlins?
Send you some soap, some towels...
...so you can wash up.
You don't know a Lacey Rawlins?
You are fortunate boys.
Fortunate boys.
Where's Rawlins?
He wait outside for you.
Right now?
Yes, now.
Where are we going?
You're going away.
You're going to your house.
Now?
Now.
I thought you'd died.
I thought you had.
Why ain't we dead?
She paid us out.
The old senora?
The aunt.
Why?
I don't know.
Iùs got to do with that girl.
I expect it does.
You going back down there?
Yeah, I guess I am.
On account of the girl.
But what about the horses?
The girl and the horses.
What about Rocha?
He'll have to do whatever he has to do.
Don't go down there.
- I ain't asking you to go with me.
- I know.
They put Mexican blood in me in that hospital.
So?
So, what does that mean?
About what?
Well, does that mean I'm part Mexican?
How much they put in you?
They said it was over a litre.
A liter would make you a half-breed.
- It don't, does it?
- No.
No, it don't mean nothing.
Iùs just blood.
It don't know where it come from.
You heard about what happened, didn't you?
In the mess hall?
Yeah.
I never thought I'd do that.
You didn't have no choice.
He'd have done it to you.
You don't got to try to make it right.
It is what it is.
- Shit.
- What?
Nothing. Just shit.
What is it?
I keep thinking about old Blevins.
About how scared he was.
You'll feel better when you get home.
I don't think so.
I ain't Blevins.
I know you ain't.
I was wondering how much better off you are than him.
I reckon I'll see you one of these days.
You take care.
You take care too.
I think I'm owed an explanation.
I think the accounts have been settled quite in your favour.
You have been a disappointment to my nephew...
...and a considerable expense to me.
No offense, ma'am, but I've been some inconvenienced myself.
Sit down, please.
The officers were here once before, you know.
My nephew sent them away until he conducted his own investigation.
He wanted so much to go on believing in you.
- Why didn't he say something to me?
- He gave his word to the commandante.
He shoulÔve let me tell my side of it.
You had already lied to him once. Why shouldn't he assume you'd do so again?
I never lied to him.
The affair of the stolen horse was known here even before you arrived.
The thieves were Americans.
When he questioned you about this, you denied everything.
Why'd you buy me out of jail?
I think you know why.
Because of Alejandra.
Yes.
What did she give in return?
I think you know that also.
That she won't see me again.
Yes.
You didn't have the right.
You shoulÔve left me there.
- You woulÔve died.
- Then I'd have died.
We're willing that you should have a horse.
I'll trust Esteban to supervise the selection.
Do you have enough money?
Do you have enough money?
I aim to see her.
Am I supposed to be surprised?
I'll even give you my permission.
Although that doesn't seem to be a thing you have ever required.
Her telephone number.
In the end, Mr. Cole...
...we all get cured of our sentiments.
Those whom life doesn't cure...
...death will.
She will not break her word to me.
You will see.
Yes, ma'am.
We will.
I knew it would be you.
I have to see you.
I can't.
You have to. I'm coming.
No, you can't.
I won't be here.
I go to La Purisima in two days.
- I'll meet you at the train.
- No, my father will have men there.
Alejandra, I love you.
I love you.
You didn't have no right to make that promise, even if they killed me.
I ain't gonna leave until I see you.
Even if iùs the last time,
I don't care.
Even if they kill me now.
I will leave a day early.
Tomorrow morning.
I'll say that my aunt is ill.
Meet me in Zacatecas.
I will be there.
My God, you're beautiful.
- Iùs all my fault.
- No. You couldn't have saved us.
You couldn't have saved Blevins.
I told my father we were lovers.
Why?
Because she threatened me. My aunt.
She said I must stop seeing you or she'd tell him.
I couldn't stand for her to have that power.
She left me no choice.
I told him myself.
I love you so much, I thought
I could make him understand.
I was so foolish.
It was her arrogance.
I told her I would not be blackmailed.
She made me crazy.
But I broke my father's heart.
I broke his heart.
I put you in danger, and you almost died.
He had Armando lock me into my room so that I couldn't warn you.
The next morning, he flew me back to the city.
I thought I would never, never see you again.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
I destroyed everything.
I'm going to make it right.
You can't.
Well, I will make it right.
Somehow, I will.
You don't understand.
What don't I understand?
I didn't know that my father could stop loving me.
I didn't know he could.
Now I know.
What are you doing?
I saw you dead in a dream.
Just like the dream I had the night before we danced together.
It was dawn.
Men in serapes stood over you.
And you were dying.
All because of your whore.
Don't say that.
I want you to marry me and come to Texas.
When I found out you were in prison
I made a promise.
I know. For my life.
Yes.
I love you.
I'll love you till the day I die.
I believe you.
I swear to God.
I believe you.
No.
I cannot do what you ask.
I love you very much.
But I cannot.
I have no honour except my promise.
If I lose that too...
...then what am I?
Shut the door.
What do you want?
I come for my horse.
- Rawlins' and Blevins' horses too.
- I don't have your horses.
You by God know where they're at.
You make trouble for yourself.
I got trouble you never even heard of.
Are you still here, old man?
Yes, yes of course.
You're free to go.
You're free to go.
Thank you, partner.
Go with God.
You son of the unlucky...
Go with God.
Go with God, my friend.
Get down. Go inside.
Come here. Sit down.
Hey, who's there?
Raul, the Captain.
I want to see a horse.
I want to see a horse.
What horse?
American.
The American horse.
Whaùs going on?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Carlos! The gringo has taken me prisoner!
Don't shoot!
If you follow us, I'll kill them.
Stop!
Goodbye, get out of here!
If you come back,
I'll kill the Captain.
You're going to die.
Yeah, you can just keep talking.
When I die, you die.
- Why don't you let me go?
- Because you're my hostage.
Stay close, or I swear to God,
I'll shoot you. Go on.
I'll shoot you.
Have to come back to my town?
I told you. For my horse.
My head is sick.
I can't ride no more.
You'd be surprised at what you can do.
You're going to die.
You're going to die.
We'll let God decide about that.
You're not afraid of God?
I'm not afraid of God.
I got no reason to be afraid.
I even got a bone or two to pick with Him.
Where are the keys?
Where are the keys!
Goddamn you!
Die, you son of a bitch!
Give me your goddamn hand.
I'm not going to kill you.
I'm not like you.
Go on.
You're free to go.
Far as you can...
...tote that saddle.
Hey, give me the keys.
Go over to the Captain.
Don't let him get up. The keys.
Beans...
...and a rabbit.
How is your wound?
You doing okay?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Pants...
...a serape.
Go with God, my son.
- Howdy.
- Howdy. How you doing?
Could you tell me what day it is?
Iùs Thursday.
I mean the date.
Iùs Thanksgiving.
Do either of you want to buy a rifle?
No. I'm not interested.
So I come back across and was riding on the road...
...and I run into this man, and he told me I had to come see a judge.
There's a problem with the horses.
Your Honour...
...the fact of the matter is this boy ain't got a lick of proof.
Three different horses and different brands on them.
Deputy Smith, you know what the trouble with a liar is?
Trouble with a liar is, he can't remember what he said.
I know thaùs right.
I ain't a liar.
I know that, son.
I know that.
I can't believe anybody would make up a story like the one you just told.
Can I ask you a personal question?
Yes, sir.
You mind showing the court them bullet holes in your leg?
Oh, all right.
Thaùs where it come out.
Thaùs fine, son. Thank you.
- You didn't have no medical attention?
- No, sir.
Wasn't none to be had.
Deputy Smith?
Your Honour?
I want you to see that this boy gets his horses back.
Son, you're free to go.
Thank you.
The court thanks you for your testimony.
In all the years I've sat on this bench...
...I heard lots of things that give me grave doubts about the human race.
This ain't one of them.
All right.
You can go, boy.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
I don't like to bother you. But they told me this is where you live.
Thaùs all right. They were right.
Come on in.
- Thank you.
- Pleased to have you.
When I was in the penitentiary...
...I killed somebody.
I'm sorry to hear that.
He come at me with a knife.
So...
I just happened to get the best of him.
But that keeps bothering me somehow.
Something else, ain't there?
Yes, sir.
But later, I wanted to kill that other one too.
That Mexican captain.
Why do you suppose that is?
Because I sat there, and he walked the boy out to the trees and shot him.
I didn't say nothing.
I didn't say a word.
Would it have done any good?
No, sir.
That don't make it right.
And it never will.
Bothered me that you might think that I'm something special.
I ain't.
You know what you strike me as?
One of them people that has a tendency...
...to be a little tough on themselves.
There's nothing wrong with you, son.
You'll get it sorted out.
I hope so.
If I live.
You'll live, all right.
Lacey once asked me if I thought
God looks out for people.
I guess He does.
I say He's just about got to.
I don't believe we'd make it a day otherwise.
I thought you might want your old horse back.
Damn, bud.

Ma! Señora Nunez came in.
She's burning up with fever.
Go cool her head.
Recite the 23rd Psalm.
I'll be there in a bit.
New Mexico, 1885
"Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
- Morning, kids.
- "Thou art with me. Thy rod and staff... they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life."
Darling, get me some Cocea paste and my tooth plier, please.
Yes, ma'am.
No. No.
She don't worry about the pain. No.
It is her only tooth.
She worry how she look.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I need you to hold your grandmother down.
Darling, can you hold her arm?
Pin that, Dot. Hold her nose.
Hold her nose.
Careful.
I hate to ask... but can you pay me for this today?
Jumping pinches coyotes sons of bitches. 
That lightning sure did kill her.
This calf won't last the night out here.
Let's put her in the barn.
Señor Brake.
Indian.
Apache, maybe.
Some kind of Apache son of a bitch.
Good day, sir.
I said, hello.
That your man over there in the trees?
What is he planning on doing with that carbine?
We've had trouble with coyotes killing calves.
Tell him I'm not a coyote.
Is that the healer's place?
You come for doctoring?
Lady shuts her doors at sundown.
She's pretty firm about her hours.
You're welcome to spend the night, see her in the morning.
I thank you kindly.
Barn's this way, mister.
There's a spare bunk over there, Mr...
Mr. Fernandez.
Jones. The man that owned that saddle tried to kill me.
I was living with the Jicarilla at the time.
I suppose he thought I was one of them.
You're Apache, huh?
- What did you say?
- Forget it.
What did you say?
Come over here.
Now, I mean it!
There'll be no trouble here.
If that's too tough for you to understand, you can move on.
Emiliano, unpack his mule.
You will keep your hands off of my mule...
Emiliano.
- Don't slam that door.
- Yes, ma'am.
You know, there are houses in Cleveland with lamps that run on electricity.
I'd like to see Cleveland.
- Can you fetch the water, please, Dot?
- Yes, ma'am.
At the fair, there's gonna be expositions of the future.
There's gonna be a graphophone. 
You can hear your own voice back on it.
- The Dickersons are going.
- Brake can't spare you.
- Ma.
- Not tomorrow with the cows calving.
- The Fosters too.
- Got all the future you need right here.
Riding all day with this cramping and all.
Don't you ever act helpless and pitiable to win favor with a man.
Some people shouldn't give advice on how to act with men.
- And it's "pitiful" not "pitiable" in English.
- You heard what I said.
That pail's half-empty.
I didn't do it. 
It's that old Indian's dumb old mule.
- What Indian?
- Some drifter looking for doctoring.
If you're gonna eat barefoot, why not take supper with the other animals in the barn.
My boots don't fit no more.
Cut off my blood circulation.
- It's your birthday soon.
- I'll have gangrene by then.
Your mother may have to saw off your feet, then. 
Like poor old Mr. Swenson.
Mr. Jones.
Maggie, this is the visiting gentleman I mentioned.
I'll bet a warm meal sounds pretty good to you.
Magdalena.
I'm afraid we have just enough food for family.
We can't be offering our hospitality tonight.
- I'm sure we can all do with little less on our plates.
- I'm sure we can't!
I have two growing girls to feed.
Maggie?
Maggie.
Lilly, why don't you say grace.
Who is he?
Called you Magdalena.
Your hair bristles when you lay eyes on him.
He scares me, is all.
- Nobody scares you.
- Can't trust him.
Maggie, who is he?
He's my father.
- I thought your father was dead.
- He is.
To me, he is.
I want him gone, Brake.
Gone? He's your kin.
You just can't...
He ran off when I wasn't Dot's age.
Went Indian.
Turn your back, he'll eat your horses and dogs.
He's being chased or running from something,
I don't know what.
But he's bad, Brake. I swear.
I do not want him near my children.
We're Indians, Lilly.
We're Indians.
Does he do that all night?
Oh, he's just getting started.
- You come here for the healing?
- In a manner of speaking.
Thought you might be hungry.
- It's rabbit stew.
- I can't eat rabbits.
I was bitten by a rattlesnake.
All right.
When there's company, you sleep in there. 
Is that right?
That's right.
- You're not her husband?
- No, sir.
Not for lack of asking.
They your children?
No.
What happened to their father?
You don't know this?
I can't say what all happened between you two, but you ain't welcome here, sir.
But she's a good Christian.
She won't turn away any man in need.
Tomorrow, she'll give you what doctoring she can, then you're on your way.
There's places where a father would kill a young man for doing what you're doing, you know that, don't you?
If you have something to say, say it.
Are you really a Indian?
Brake said you rode with the Chiricahua.
That's right.
- So that means I'm part Indian, right?
- No.
Not at all.
You look stupid trying to work in those fancy clothes, you know.
I am leaving here as soon as I can.
- I'm moving to the city.
- But Grandpa's visiting.
Did you see him?
He's a savage.
They're gut-eaters, you know.
I was born into the wrong family,
I swear to God I was.
- I appreciate this.
- Take off your shirt.
- Magdalena...
- Don't call me that. It's not my name.
- Where's it hurt?
- Hurts when I breathe.
Mostly around here.
Yeah. Your muscles are torn just under your ribs.
You need to put a cottonwood plaster to it.
You'll live.
I never thought you'd turn out to be a healer.
I remember you had that yellow cat one time.
You cried because a badger bit its tail off.
- Your mother came running...
- Don't remember. Not in front of me.
Because I remember my mother.
My mother died scrubbing a man's floor.
And you killed her.
Didn't shoot her or stab her, but what you did...
You broke her!
And I remember my brother too.
He lasted six years.
I bet you never even knew his name.
And I remember praying hard every night that you'd come home.
On the day I put him in the ground,
I remember praying even harder you were dead.
So you don't want to reminisce with me, that I promise you.
I earned this money in large part killing mountain lions for ranchers like you.
I want you to have it.
If I were destitute and drawing my last breath...
This is good money.
Take this money for your children.
- No, you take it for your funeral.
- Magdalena.
I've done my duty as a Christian.
You get the hell off my ranch!
I'd stop now.
Maggie asked you to leave.
I think it's time you did so, sir.
Right about now.
So long.
Nice making your acquaintance.
What's done is done, I guess.
I know you would have done different.
I appreciate your regard, Brake.
I do.
Well, night, then.
Did they see you come in?
We can't make a sound.
Figure we can get them all branded in a day?
- You want Dot to stay for company?
- Brake, you said I could go.
You promised.
Mama, you promised too.
Oh, I'm fine.
He won't be coming back.
This will help the cramping.
The calves are a lot more important than hearing your own voice coming out of some machine, you know?
Well, I guess you never had anything but this. 
So why should I?
Come on, let's get going.
You sure look frilly to be working cattle.
I'll keep an eye on them.
- Just be home before dark.
- All right.
All right.
Easy now.
That's right.
Dot?
Dot?
Darling?
Get! Get!
Dot?
No!
No!
Dot!
Oh, Lord. Darling.
Mama, I'm cold.
- I'm here, darling. Are you all right?
- I'm cold. I'm cold.
- Mama, I'm cold.
- Darling, where's Lilly?
- Emiliano.
- Yeah, I know.
Darling, where's Lilly?
Emiliano and me... we was in the arroyo.
We heard shots from where Brake and Lilly was.
He told me, "Stay down",
Emiliano did.
"Don't move. Stay down."
He went to see, but he didn't come back.
I waited like he said, but he didn't come back.
Brake was screaming, Mama.
He screamed so long I wanted him to stop.
I know. I know it.
- I know it.
- Then he did.
Then someone rode away with Lilly.
I wanted him to stop!
I know it. I know it.
Darling, did you see who?
Who took your sister?
He wore a hood.
He was Indian.
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am, but I'm afraid you got the wrong fella in mind.
I've had the man you're describing in jail since last night.
Sold himself a lion's hide and got quite a drunk on.
Unacceptable drunk.
He did say he was staying out by your place, though.
There's been several raids like this on people here lately, in Arizona and New Mexico.
Some Apaches jumped the reservation at San Carlos, middle of last month sometime.
We've been getting communications about them near every day.
To Fort Bowie.
From me.
Possible your hostiles attacked local ranch.
Two dead, one girl missing.
Named...
Lilly Gilkeson.
Lilly Gilkeson.
Stop.
This takes just a moment.
The device is truly a miracle.
And now you'll hear your voice back as clear as day.
- Ladies.
- My name's Louise Dewey.
My name's Louise Dewey.
To Sheriff Purdy... of Chloride.
Believe hostiles... headed northwest... toward Colorado River.
Fourth Cavalry... will pursue... in due course.
Well, there you have it.
I'll send the undertaker out for the remains.
You're not going after them?
Not under the present circumstances, ma'am. No.
With the fair being in town and all, 
I need all the men I have right here.
If you don't follow now, their trail will get cold.
The Army is handling the situation.
They have Apache scouts.
Takes an Apache to catch an Apache.
If someone doesn't go now, my daughter may be dead.
Ma'am, I am elected to keep vigil over this town of ours.
Just one or two men, sir, that's all I'm asking.
Ma'am, I am sorry.
Seth, I need a word with you.
It was the Indians did it.
Now, ladies, I will not authorize fireworks until a water wagon is here.
Ma'am, that's the drunkard from last night.
What would you like me to do with him?
Let him go.
I don't care.
Mama?
Darling.
I want you to ride over to the Handys'...
- No. No, I won't.
- and stay there till I get back.
I won't stay behind. I'll follow you as soon as you're gone, you know I will.
- Darling...
- I'm not... You can't leave me, Ma.
I'm going with you, Mama, please, I am.
- Now, you hear me, Dot...
- I'm not staying behind.
Wherever you put me,
I'm coming after you, Ma.
You know I'm not gonna stay put.
I swear to God, I won't stay put.
Hush, hush.
Hush, now. It's all right.
Hush.
The Army's headed in the wrong direction.
Seventeen horse tracks.
Three shod, one outrider, two cavalry horses.
Six horses were tied together... carrying light loads.
Probably young women, children.
And their captives, those are being led along... like packhorses.
They're headed south.
Not north.
Probably trying to make it to the Mexican border.
The Apaches sell a lot of girls over there.
Top dollar.
Can you track them?
You can track them. But if you catch them, you'll wish you'd stayed in that house.
I don't wanna catch them.
You just keep me on their trail till I get the Army down to Fort Selden to catch them.
You wanted to give me money.
Do this instead.
Taking this child out there is foolish.
I know my daughter.
- Leave her behind, she'll just follow.
- No way to care for a girl.
What would you know about any of it?
I'll be just fine, thank you.
Come on, now.
Pretty moon, Anne.
Old Bob Hadley was supposed to stop by tonight.
God.
Mama, I'm afraid in my room.
It's just your fever giving you bad dreams, honey.
You want Mama to sing you a song?
Your man didn't keep his rifle very clean.
If he wanted to marry you, though,
I guess that's something.
He's not all bad.
- Did you ever marry?
- Dot's father was my husband.
He built the ranch with me.
The notion of it was... better than the doing, I guess.
What about the other one's father?
Didn't get much of a look at him.
Maggie?
What you're doing, you're doing for your own soul.
Because what you've done, you can't undo.
You can all move now.
Sir... do you suppose it's safe for me to be on my way now?
Mister, I don't suppose nothing.
You're theirs now.
They captured you.
Could you help me, please?
Go into the cave.
Bring picture-maker. Go!
Take them.
You're heartless.
I see you gentlemen are engaging in a little frontier recreation out here.
No, these girls are going to market.
We ain't supposed to sully the merchandise.
I can smell him from here.
I see you share a fondness for the photographic arts like myself.
Where did you find this squashed penis?
We captured him as a gift for you.
Sir, may I have the honor of posing you with your captives, please?
He wants to take your picture.
Please, please.
That's perfect. Now...
- very still.
- Help us. Help.
Please help us.
Look your best.
Lord, protect us.
Stay behind me.
- Indians.
- Yeah.
But not the way you're thinking.
Is there time enough to give these men a proper Christian burial?
Dead's dead, one way or the other.
I asked if there was time.
Yeah.
There's time.
Get in.
You must be the pride of your people.
And you of yours.
Prepare to dismount!
Dismount!
The two on the porch have expired, lieutenant.
Ask him why he murdered those men.
I didn't murder anybody.
They were dead when I got here.
What are you doing in here?
My granddaughter was stolen two days ago. 
I trailed her to this place.
What's her name?
You don't know your granddaughter's name?
Well, her sister's name is Dot.
We found two horses with a bunch of women's property in them.
Hang him.
- Other side!
- There he goes!
I didn't kill anyone!
- I said, I didn't kill anyone!
- Come out and show your hands!
- I am looking for my granddaughter!
- Then you tell me her damn name!
- I don't know her damn name!
- Lilly!
- Lilly Gilkeson.
- You know this Indian?
- He's no Indian.
- Damn well looks Indian to me.
No, he's a...
That's my father.
I've been hoping we'd find you, sir.
We need your help.
We tracked my daughter south from Chloride.
They're heading toward Mexico.
Near as we can figure they've hit six or seven homesteads so far, including this one.
Sir, army should've killed those heathens when they had a chance.
They are Army, ma'am. Deserters.
Why, I thought they were Apache.
Apache scouts.
Formerly on Uncle Sam's payroll.
Like Happy Jim here.
- We use them to hunt down other Apaches.
- These Indians are American soldiers?
Then a couple of months ago, some of them turned... shot some white officers, and jumped the reservation in San Carlos.
The 4th Cavalry started all this by hanging their chief.
Don't know what they were thinking.
What makes you think they were thinking?
This whole territory's gone topsy-turvy.
You got Indians running with whites, whites running with Indians.
Get those prisoners moving!
Come on, squaw man.
Get on the way here.
Happy Jim.
You think because you're wearing that coat, they won't put you on the prison train to Florida with chains on your legs?
I don't know of Florida.
It's a real swell shit-hole of a swamp.
You'll see.
White man, you don't look like someone who gives good advice.
Break it up!
What's going on here?
I said, break it up.
- I found it first, lieutenant.
- Lying bastard!
Looks like God intended you two to share.
Any man found looting... will have the value of their property deducted from his pay.
They're enlisted men.
- Post two men over there.
- I'm going to camp down by the river.
If I stay here long, I might misbehave.
Right over there.
Somebody might have to kill me.
Lieutenant?
I imagine you plan to ride first thing.
Would it be all right if my daughter and I rode along with you?
Naturally, I'm quite concerned.
Ma'am, capturing those renegades is the Army's highest priority.
- Yes, of course.
- Butcher a couple of those goats for supper!
- And I'm grateful.
- But that's the assignment of the 4th.
But the 4th is going in the wrong direction.
I assure you, they'll be redirected as soon as we reach Fort Stanton.
Stanton's three days away, lieutenant, my daughter will be in Mexico by then.
I grieve for your situation, I truly do.
But my assignment is to return these hostiles in my capture to Stanton, for their prompt and immediate deportation.
- You like fish?
- Go water the horses.
- I watered them back at the...
- I'm not asking.
Don't make them too raw, please.
Very well, ma'am.
Lilly, she's... not the same as Dot.
She's not strong.
She gets hurt so easy.
Sage?
- What?
- For the fish.
Look, I know I asked you to get us as far as the Army...
I asked you if you wanted some sage put on your fish.
Yeah. All right.
None for Dot.
We'll ride at first light in the morning.
If we can catch up to them, 
I might have enough money to buy her back.
If they make it to Mexico... your child is lost.
Hey, that stuff will make you sick, but I like it.
No, no, no, no. Whoa. 
That flash behind her head bother you? It's just...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
There's no magic.
It's an optical defect. A flaw.
A flaw. Flaw.
Wait, wait. Hey, wait.
Look at these.
Look at these. See?
I know where all the prettiest girls live, from Arizona to Texas.
You pick the ones you want, and I'll take you right to them. Look!
All the pretty girls, see? All of them!
I'll take you... Look!
Take your bad luck to your grave.
What was that?
What did you just do?
I'll get it done.
Who of you can skin a deer?
Hey! Who of you can skin a deer?
Me. I can.
All right. Gotta gut her.
I can't see.
What is happening to me?
Somebody tell me.
What is happening?
I can't see. I can't see. Please!
Where's clubfoot going? 
I thought we was dropping back down into Mexico.
Seven's an unlucky number for him.
He wants eight girls. We go now.
Shit!
Here.
Fill the packs with meat.
I gotta take Sally.
No, I gotta take my little girl.
No! She just needs water.
She's fine.
Shut up. She's dead now, mama.
- She's my baby.
- Shut up.
No!
No! No! No!
No, no, no, no.
No!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Trying to make a fool of me.
It's gonna be all right.
I think my feet grew two sizes today.
Try these.
- They're beautiful.
- They were my wife's.
My grandmother?
No.
Mama!
- Mama!
- Dot?
You all right?
You get bit?
Did those snakes bite you?
No.
Mama, a dead man's in there.
Don't worry about that child.
Go on now.
Mama, look at his eyes.
- What happened to him?
- He lost control of his wagon.
Maybe he had a heart seizure.
He didn't have a heart seizure.
His heart's in that hole.
What's behind her head?
- Some people would think it's a sign.
- A good sign or a bad sign?
It wasn't a very good sign for him.
Come here.
- What are you doing?
- These are for protection.
The man who did this is a brujo.
- A what?
- It's a witch.
You need to wear one too.
You can believe in your witchcraft and your impiety all you want.
I believe in what I've seen, girl.
Snakes belong on the ground, this one hangs them in the air.
A man's heart holds his spirit. 
This one digs it out of his body, bleeds it out, and throws it in the dirt.
Don't you start this.
I know a brujo strong enough to put an arrow in you from one mile away.
I know a brujo who laid his hand on a child one time, one time.
The child cramped up, fell down and spit up white bees till she died.
- You stop this, you hear me? You're scaring her.
- She needs to be scared and so do you.
Mama, please. Please.
Just on her.
We gotta get through that canyon before the storm hits.
You go on and I'll follow.
Hey, give me some of the medical stuff they stole, the laudanum.
You like that stuff.
You know, I drink enough of this stuff, 
I swear...
- you start to look good to me.
- Hey.
They give this to my grandma when she was fixing to croak.
Mama!
Mama!
I'll get her!
Get those horses and tied them to higher ground!
I've got her!
Dot, you hold on to me!
My foot's caught!
Hold your breath! Right now!
Gotta piss.
Sit up.
I can get us out of here.
- Do you hear that?
- You mustn't speak.
My baby's calling me.
No. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Your baby's passed on.
No. That's just how she sleeps.
There's nothing you can do, so please just...
There, there. My baby.
Here. Watch out while I get the horses.
Hey. 
Just going to get those berries I promised you.
Don't wander off.
Lord, forgive me.
Stop squirming.
- Goddamn you!
- Give her to me.
- Get up!
- No!
- I got her.
- No!
- Tie her legs!
- Shut up!
Shut up!
Why?
Now we're gonna be back to seven, and seven's an unlucky number.
Whore! Stop!
Thank you.
Crawl.
You're better than them, but you're not better than me.
Can she have the moccasins now?
Yeah.
Can I just..?
I'm glad you were here.
I was bitten by a rattlesnake.
What?
A good shaman gave me two amulets.
Told me not to eat rabbit meat for a year, to say my prayers every morning, take care of my family, and I might get well.
You're telling me the only reason you came back, was because you were following the say-so of some medicine man.
Is that right?
Yes. Absolutely. 
A rattlesnake can make your soul... very sick.
That's likely not what you want to hear.
But it is the truth.
We have eight girls. 
Now, we can go.
No. This one ran, let the mother kill herself.
Go on. Hit me.
You won't fetch as many pesos with my face swollen, and you know it.
This is what the rest of your life will taste like.
Keep still.
That them?
Once they clear those trees, they'll be riding in line along that river.
I'll shoot the front horse.
You shoot a horse in the middle.
We're lucky, they'll scatter.
- Thought we'd buy her back.
- The more of them we kill, the easier they'll be to reason with.
Maybe she'll get clear and save us the trouble altogether.
Dot, you keep shooting.
Try to hit a horse.
Mother of Jesus... you watched your child suffer.
Give me strength.
Stop my hands from trembling.
Let them come on.
Not yet. Not yet.
Let them come.
Let them come.
On my call, pick a horse in the middle and shoot him in the neck.
I can't see Lilly.
Dot!
Take everything.
They're Chiricahua.
Kayitah, where did you steal that horse?
Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan?
Hasn't someone killed you yet?
You still owe me three lion hides, you know.
I lived with his family for a time.
- Good. That's good, isn't it?
- Name's Kayitah.
Think the other one's his son.
Forget the hides. Give us your horses and your guns and we'll call it even.
- They want our horses and guns.
- I am not giving over my horses.
You understand?
You'll have to kill me first.
You tell him what I said.
Now look. You pissed her off.
How can you tell? 
You people look pissed off all the time.
You tell them to get on their way.
Even better, you tell them we want their guns and ammunition.
Go on. You tell him.
The men you just killed were trying to kill us too.
The witch stole my son's future.
His bride was taken a week ago.
He stole my granddaughter too.
We can help each other.
And she's a healer.
Ain't no undergarments or nothing.
Dot, bring me my bag.
Go outside, sweetheart.
You don't know what diseases these people have.
I don't usually operate on Indians.
They have green blood and a pinecone in their chest instead of a heart.
Just give me that mescal.
All right. It'll hurt.
Do you still go up north and fool around with that fat Zuni girl?
Don't lie.
No. She started to like me too much.
He told me this brujo's mother was raped by a witch.
Came out of her womb two years later with a full set of teeth.
I'm not feeling too good myself.
Don't sit too close, darling.
I'm not feeling too good.
- It's so cold.
- It's not that cold, Ma.
You knew my father?
What do you remember about him?
We called him Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan.
He was a good hunter.
Yeah. He was.
He married Laatsine, his Chiricahua wife.
Was she beautiful?
No.
She was cross-eyed.
He was living with the Navajo when she died of smallpox.
She died... I didn't realize.
Moved around a lot.
Never still, Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan.
Moving spirits don't make happy men.
Did he love her? His Chiricahua wife?
He loved all of them, for a time.
Hello.
What are you doing?
I'm dreaming of what's gonna happen tomorrow.
Can I dream on it too?
I don't know. Can you?
Can't.
Mom's talking in her sleep again.
Sometimes at home, she talks so loud we have to wake her up.
Sometimes she cries. Other times, she sounds like somebody's hurting her.
And all the next day, she looks at Lilly funny.
Me and Lilly notice, even though Mama doesn't, 
I don't think.
- What happened to her?
- I don't know and I wouldn't ask.
I think when she was young, she was... treated with cruelty.
She was alone in the world at that time.
You wish you'd been there?
I don't wish.
Mama.
- Ma, wake up, you're having a bad...
- Don't touch her.
The brujo has put a curse on her.
I will gather some ghost bush.
Go get your mother's Bible.
- Is it bees?
- Go on.
What did you leave behind at that camp?
Today. This day, what did you leave behind?
I don't... I don't know.
Help me again to heal.
Keep all evil away from here.
Mama. Don't let him, Mama.

- Let's attack them.
- We don't have a chance.
Still, we must try.
Father, I can fight too.
No.
You stay here.
Morning.
- Good morning.
- Reckon I drank from the wrong bottle.
Wrong as can be.
- Here.
- You need to keep that on.
You know, Dot was wearing hers when she almost drowned.
Yes... almost.
After we attacked them, you reckon we can still buy them back?
I don't know, money's always money.
But we don't have enough to buy them all, though. 
Two or three at the most.
You get Lilly.
And get the Indian girl... and... whoever else you can.
Sorry for the rest.
I'll see you again.
Should be back by dark.
If we're not, leave at daylight tomorrow.
That means go home. You and Dot.
You understand?
You tell me yes or I'm not going.
I understand.
Give this to my daughter.
She won't trust an Indian.
I want to buy two girls.
- I want to buy two girls.
- Yeah?
- Do I deal with you?
- No.
You deal with him, there.
You have two girls I want to buy.
You are a make believe Indian.
Is that what you are?
Yeah, that's right.
You want to become a real Indian?
Like them?
I want to give you 600 dollars for two girls.
Some here want your money.
For the evil your people have done...
I want your pain.
Look at me.
Inside you are two dogs.
One is evil, the other is good.
The mean dog fights the good dog all the time.
Which one wins?
I don't know.
Whichever one I feed the most.
No. They are killing each other.
That is what makes you sick.
I will make you a real Indian.
That is what your soul asks me for.
This will tear out your soul.
You were born white, but you will die an Indian.
Do you know this? Do you know this?
I don't understand.
Die slow.
The vultures will eat your guts while you watch.
Please. Please.
That's my mother's.
What did you do to my mother?
What did you do?
You killed him.
You killed us all.
There is nothing we can do.
There is no hope.
My friend.
Do a favor for me.
Forget your gophers and mice.
Take me to my family.
Give them repentance and better minds.
Be merciful, O God, to those who are in any trouble.
And do thou, O God of pity, administer to them according to their...
Ma? needs.
Grandpa said we was to leave in the morning.
He'll come back.
He's gonna come back.
Reward all those who have done us good.
Pardon all those who have done or wish us evil.
Give them repentance and better minds.
Be merciful, O God, to anyone who's in any trouble.
And deal with them, O God of pity, according to their needs, with kindness, just as Jesus Christ, your son, did.
I told you to go home.
How bad are you hurt?
I've seen the girl. She's still alive.
Your father never stopped fighting.
They killed him like cowards.
Are we gonna go get Lilly?
You can raise this child.
Take her home.
And you can be sure of that.
You do anything else, you're likely to lose two daughters and your own life.
I don't know how to leave her.
You can't turn away from that?
Can you?
All right...
Magdalena.
All right.
You.
You scared of dead things?
- They finally going to get buyers?
- He'll be back. We sell them today.
Hey, my friend, we're getting paid today.
The body is gone.
It's him, look!
He's come back from the dead!
Don't think like that.
Come this way with me.
It's a trick, you idiots!
Get the girl.
Get down there.
Mama.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
You cut them loose.
Get to the horses!
I thought we killed that bastard.
Get going!
Get out of here, Maggie.
Where are the women?
Give me your horses.
I will bring them back before nightfall.
And leave us here with no horses?
We don't have time to drink water.
Let's go!
- Can they catch us?
- Oh, yeah.
Help me.
Take my arm.
I got her.
We're going to the top! If your horse quits, get off and go on afoot!
Hold on to the tail. I got you.
- You knew this was here.
- I've had occasion to use it before.
We never make it to the other side before dark.
We'll have to last out the night, right here.
Put as much dry brush as you can carry in this gap!
Are you all right?
Your hair's all tangled.
Here, let me get it.
It's all right.
It's all right.
It's all right, Lill-Lill.
You'll see.
I dreamed on it.
We're gonna get away, and Grandpa's gonna come live with us, and we're all gonna be a family.
You'll see.
Right, Ma? Isn't that right?
Yeah.
You know that Indian name of yours?
- What's that mean?
- Very hard to translate that.
Try it.
It means "shit for luck".
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.
Chiricahua value family very highly.
A man doesn't live with his wife and children, he's not considered particularly... enviable.
I don't have any Indian... brothers or sisters?
None that lived.
What did you see in them... you didn't see in us?
Why didn't you stay?
There's an Apache story about a man that woke up one morning and saw a hawk on the wind.
Walked outside and never returned.
After he died, he met his wife in the spirit world. 
She asked him why he never came home.
He said, 
"Well, the hawk kept flying."
There's always the next something, Maggie.
And that will take a man away.
You tell yourself you're protecting them, they're better off without you.
Stay or go, there's nothing a man can do to protect his family from himself.
I guess I do realize now I made people's lives more difficult by the things I have done... and the things I have not done.
People I did love, mostly.
- I'm not forgiving you.
- Not asking you to.
I wore that birthing both my girls.
I thought I'd die wearing it.
I've always liked this thing.
Your mother gave it to me.
Never meant to leave it behind.
Thank you.
I better see to Lilly and them.
Look out!
Pull those horses back!
Your brujo's dead!
Leave!
Let's go home.

{2502}{2580}The story I want to tell you,|can not be found in a book.
{2593}{2682}They say the history of the West was|written from the saddle of a horse.
{2701}{2753}But it's never been told|from the heart of one.
{2781}{2813}Not until now.
{2861}{2900}I was born here.
{2905}{2975}In this place that would come|to be called the ''Old West''
{2990}{3101}But to my kind, the land was ageless.|It had no beginning and no end.
{3117}{3180}No boundary between earth and sky.
{3213}{3301}Like the wind in the Buffalo grass.|We belong here.
{3326}{3362}We will always belong here.
{3445}{3502}They say the mustang is the|spirit of the West.
{3517}{3573}Whether that West|was won or lost in the end
{3582}{3619}You have to decide for yourself.
{3630}{3707}But the story|I want to tell you is true.
{3728}{3757}I was there.
{3776}{3812}And I remember.
{3832}{3910}I remember the sun, and the sky|and the wind calling my name.
{3925}{3982}In the time when the wild|horses ran free.
{10805}{10868}And so I grew from colt to stallion
{10870}{10900}As wild and reckless
{10901}{10941}As thunder over the land.
{10948}{10985}Racing with the eagle.
{10987}{11021}Soaring with the wind.
{11022}{11104}Flying? |There were times I believed I could.
{11869}{11898}Like my father before me
{11900}{11994}I became leader of the Cimarron herd.|And with that honour
{11996}{12037}Came responsibility.
{17370}{17425}Something new came upon|the land one night.
{17441}{17496}Something that changed my life |forever...
{17518}{17587}And so my journey began.
{18973}{19024}A wiser horse might have turned|and ran.
{19053}{19109}But I wanted to know what|strange creature was here.
{20008}{20032}Look.
{20087}{20157}Man, look at that stallion, |it is beautiful.
{21014}{21046}Follow the horse! Let's go!
{23917}{23944}Look out!
{24511}{24544}Don't you get away!
{26023}{26056}I was scared.
{26057}{26103}I didn't know what was going|to happen to me.
{26127}{26148}At least my mother|and the herd were safe.
{29740}{29784}What seems to be the|problem, gentlemen?
{29789}{29825}We got this crazy one here, Sir.
{29857}{29876}Really?
{29991}{30043}The army has dealt with|wild horses before.
{30061}{30099}This one will be no different.
{30209}{30233}I remember the first time
{30235}{30293}I saw a rattler curled up in my path
{30340}{30389}-Induct this animal, Sargent.|-Yes Sir!
{30385}{30445}This one didn't look like a rattler.

{30671}{30716}Okay Murphy, he's all yours.
{30743}{30773}He's a wild one.
{30809}{30866}We'll see how wild he is,|when I am done with him.

{31364}{31386}Right.

{40793}{40837}He was called Little Creak.

{45216}{45293}You see gentlemen,|any horse can be broken.
{45381}{45407}Move along mustang.
{45500}{45581}There are those in Washington who believe|the West will never be settled.

{45796}{45902}A hostile Dakota will never |submit to providence.
{45980}{46036}And it is that manner of small thinking.

{66736}{66759}It's okay, go.
{66934}{66971}Go on, get out of here.
{67013}{67043}Go home.
{68613}{68680}I knew this was hard for her,|and she was scared.
{68705}{68809}But more than anything,|I wanted to share my homeland with her
{74439}{74484}I laid beside her that night.

During the Civil War, the only lawmen in Southern Texas-- the Texas Rangers-- disbanded to fight for the Confederacy.
Ranger Captain LeanderMcNelly was also the local preacher.
He left his family and ministry to fight alongside his men.
After the war, McNelly returned to a defeated Texas and found his wife and three sous gone-- taken by bandits.
In the ten years since the war's end bandits have overrun southern Texas.
Now, the governor is looking for McNelly.
They say he wants to recommission the Texas Rangers.

Who's the grave for?
The grave's for me.
Wait too long ground'll be froze.
Leander, come spend the winter at my ranch.
You rode down, we'd have a place for you.
Be like old times.
I don't reckon
I'll last the winter.
Governor said he sent some of his men. you wouldn't show at the door.
Said maybe you'd auswer for me.
The governor just wants to talk with you. you don't got to say yes or no or it's a cold September.
All you got to do is see him,
Leander.

It's a long way to Browusville.
I got a horse.
Name's George Durham.
Not so used to sleeping under the stars, are you?
Well... there's nothing to it, really. just, uh, dig yourself a little hip hole and then you fill a bandanna full of saw grass and stick that underneath your head.
It's the Lord's country,
Lincoln.
Yeah... Lord's country.
Land this beautiful... ain't no wonder everybody's killing over her.
She's been here a long time before us.
She'll be here a long time to come. you are a philosopher,
George Durham.
DRIVER:
Hyah!
Brownsville.
MAN:
We're going to protect you people, least you can do is contribute supplies. you want a starving army?
Who's going to keep the crops safe then? you fellas there grab all the grub you can carry.
Get your irons and fall in.
We're riding south to kill bandits!
Afternoon, Rangers.
What's your business here?
By order of the community
I've got a vigilance committee formed.
Nary a Yankee, nigger or Mexican among us. unless you have the authority of the state disband and disarm these men.
They won't have it.
We aim to protect our land.
Men who want to protect their land they can apply to hire from me.
Governor's commissioned the Rangers to do the protecting, mister.
Now, you disband these men. you from San Antone?
'Cause you sure as hell remind me of this preacher there.
It was some years ago... some preacher man.
I don't recall no time in San Antone.
No, I suppose you don't.
Men, you can keep your guns to guard your homes but that means go home.
I'll give you one minute to take a vote.
Hey, Preacher... vote's in.
Preacher... say me last rites, Preacher before he takes me.
I ain't no preacher.
Company's making camp, two nights in Brownsville.
Any of you men interested in taking on the star?
West end of town's where you'll find us. you look for me,
Leander McNelly or my associates
Sergeant
John Armstrong or Frank Bones.
DRIVER:
Hyah, hyah!
Whoa-whoa. Whoa.
?Habla ingles?
?Mexicano?
The big villas are north, yes? you asking or telling?
That is what we want.
I thought the cattles, you drive them north, too.
With many peoples.
With iron trains.
That is what we want.
These beeves don't speak ingles.
They speak, uh... espanol.
What do you want for her?
The tigre is not for sale, senor.
What about her?
She is my wife, senor.
What's she do?
What's she do?!
She acrobat, senor.
She spins and balances and juggles.
Well, if she can juggle three balls in the air without dropping one of them, you can keep your tomcat.
Perdita, andele.
Mas alto.
Mas alto, Perdita.
Catch it!
Hyah!
Name?
Lincoln Rogers Dunnison.
Where you from,
Mr. Dunnison?
From Philadelphia, sir, as a boy but I spent the last three years traveling with my father a salesman and inventor.
Where's he now?
He's dead, sir.
He was shot down by bandits.
Ain't no revenge riding,
Mr. Dunnison.
Yes, sir.
Saddle up.
When Frank here says draw, you draw.
Takes longer than a half a second means you're dead.
That Ranger badge is your target.
Sarsaparilla.
Most boys draw on sarsaparilla.
Draw, damn it.
The gun doesn't seem to be loaded, sirs.
Son, you might want to cock the hammer.
How'd he do?
Nine seconds.
Seen worse.
Gentlemen, you've been gracious to grant me your time.
I wish you the best in your endeavors.
Give my best to Philadelphia. just so there are no hard feelings either way
I didn't come here for a mouth's pay or to execute some bandits like they did my family.
I came here because you sent out for men who wanted to protect their land.
I have no land but the patch my own two feet stand on but I would want that land to be lawful, sir. you put that down in writing,
Mr. Dunnison?
Sir?
That high-minded talk. you write like that, too?
In English, French or Latin?
Well, shit, Mr. Dunnison.
I only know Spanish,
Cherokee and Comanche.
$40 a mouth in a state scrip and found. you'll get your pay from Sergeant Armstrong. you'll get your orders from me.
We'll sell you the boots, sell you a gun sell you a steed. but it'll run you $40,
Mr. Dunnison so you better last a mouth...
'cause you're in debt to me already.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Wear it proud, son.
Sergeant.
( stnttering ):
Name's Sam from
S-S-San Antone.
I never been to S-S-San Antone.
Randolph Douglas Scipio from around the Texarkana way.
My daddy staked some land out there.
Turned out to find himself a copper mine so they killed my daddy. you shouldn't be able to just shoot a man and claim his land.
Yeah.
Yeah, I aim to change that.
So, uh, Sergeant say whether he'll use you as a rifleman or a scout?
A rifleman or a scout?
Well, every white boy I met yet says Sergeant made him a rifleman.
Every colored, like me
Sergeant made a scout.
Well, every war
I ever heard of scouts get killed before the shooters
'cause they're the stupid son of a bitches sent out front.
And if I don't meet some white boy scouts soon
President Grant's going to be hearing from me.
Sure.
A strongly worded letter's always best.
They say I'm a scout? you see this star here?
I'm gonna show them
I'm a shooter.
Dunnison.
What do you think, huh?
George!
Lincoln! Lincoln!
Lincoln!
We're Rangers!
We made it!
We're not sleeping under the stars.
We got a tent.
Oh, it's nice, too. you got to see it.
It's a tent!
I got my be...
I'm on the left!
BONES:
Fisher's been splitting his men into several bands.
They've been raiding ranches all along this trail on the way to Mexico.
GnARD:
Captain? Mr. Dunnison's reporting, sir.
Send him in.
Captain.
Sergeant said you wanted to see me.
Thanks, Frank.
Take a seat, Mr. Dunnison.
Notebook and pen are yours.
Every word I say, you write it down.
Something slips by, slow me down.
Understood, sir.
October 26.
Company now fully outfitted with 30 men, orphans mostly. youngest 15.
We'll leave tomorrow and train on the trail.
Fisher split his men into smaller raiding parties.
Lord hope that we're not attacked directly.
Scant trail experience weakness with weapons...
Expect desertions along the way.
Expect... expect most of these boys will not survive.
Sir?
I'm capable of writing my reports to the government,
Mr. Dunnison. but there will come a time when I am not.
I'd rather have you in the habit.
The Lord is coming for me,
Mr. Dunnison.
Sir, then why ride?
I figure it's better
I walk to meet Him...
...than sit and wait.
Hey.
What'd the captain want?
He's dying.
Our captain is dying.
Rangers!
Our mission is to stop the outlaw John King Fisher.
Fisher and his men have been burning ranches thieving cattle and driving them into Mexico where he sells them to the Mexican army.
More than a million beeves stolen.
More than
400 men murdered.
We'll be patrolling border country to find these animals, bring them to justice.
U.S. Cavalry's got a mandate to settle Indian matters.
Leaves us to protect the Texan way.
It's our home, Rangers and we got right on our side.
Ain't no outlaw stands a fighting chance!
Back up, recruit!
This ain't no goddamn pony ride.
Who you calling recruit? you're a Browusville sign-up.
I seen you. I been a Ranger since Franklin.
That's a week and two days.
I know about life on the trail.
One more week, you'll be eligible for retirement.
Watch it, recruit.
I'll shoot that lip off at 40 paces.
Name's Berry.
Berry Smith.
Berry? Like blueberry?
Like elderberry to you.
Sergeant sent me to fill out the dab.
Dab's a usual three or four Rangers.
We eat together, scout together.
It's us three and Sandoval.
He's dab leader.
Means we care for his horse care for his weapons.
Boy rides a horse like he's riding his sister.
He knows he's doing something wrong.
Ten cents says he's saddle sore.
20 cents says he's dead by Sunday.
Ain't taking that bet.
Anybody see the way this scout killed those bandits?
Anybody see the way this scout killed those bandits?
Damn!
Sam, I'll bet you I can draw faster than you can say
"peppercorn."
Peppercorn. just say it.
Pep-pep-pep-pep-pep...
Fast!
I'm fast, I'm fast
--I'm fast!
--So fast you're six feet under.
Missed that target every time, Mr. Durham. gun's no good unless you got smarts with it.
Yes, sir, Captain.
Frank, from now on
Mr. Durham pays for his ammunition.
A penny a miss.
Yes, sir, Captain.
Peppercorn.
FISHER:
I'm telling you,
General Cortinas the Republic of Texas is there for the taking.
What you're suggesting is full-scale war.
The union Army's up north, fighting the Indians.
Hell, there ain't no law south of Austin.
We heard McNelly's been commissioned to start up the Rangers.
McNelly's got 30 men,
General, 30.
We'd have an army.
For the next shipment, senor... we will meet you.
--Shit!
--Damn, Dunnison.
Ain't there anything you're good at?
I'd love to show you, Scipio, but I don't think we'll be meeting any women along the way.
Dunnison, you rope yourself a woman
I'll drink the Rio Grande. you want something, Sam?
( stuttering ):
When you're wri-wri-writing for the Captain in his tent you see any ma-ma-maps in there?
Maps?
I seen the ma-maps he s-studies with the s-sergeant and they're pretty b-b-b...
Bad, Sam?
Mm-hmm.
My pa-pa-papa taught me how to blaze t-t-trails and k-k-keep maps.
Might be wo-wo-worthwhile having somebody to ma-ma-make maps of the t-t-territory while we ride.
Dunnison:
Captain, Mr. Walters was speaking to me about the charts and maps you're working with and he wanted to present you with what we think is a preferable scenario.
Sam.
W-W-Well...
Captain, I w-w-wanted to s-s-see...
I w-wanted to s-see if you're the kind of man who'd beg for his life like a dog or swallow the bullet like a sorry soldier.
Stay down!
Stay down, you son of a bitch.
Well...
Captain Cutthroat McNelly-- the man the whole union
Army conldn't kill.
Shot down by Sam Walters of San Antone.
Fisher knows you're riding the Rangers,
Captain.
He's put a sweet price on your sad hide.
Suck my spurs, you secretary!
I brought a bullet for you, too.
Turn around, McNelly.
And stop your shifting or I'll shoot.
Brave Sam Walters-- shot McNelly in the back.
How's that for a storybook?
Turn around, McNelly.
Right in the back,
Sam shot him.
Right in the back.
I said turn around! you riding somewheres,
Mr. Dunnison?
Riding out of Ranger Company, sir.
Company's captain was nearly killed due to my conduct.
I don't presume myself welcome to wear this anymore.
Were you set to ride off with that horse, Mr. Dunnison?
That's a Ranger's horse.
I was hoping I would not be sent away without a horse, sir. but hoping to be sent away? you were nearly killed, and I was the reason.
I hired Sam Walters on,
Mr. Dunnison.
He stood my scrutiny.
He could've taken his shot at me at any time.
He had 30 Rangers shined on, not just you.
Rangers' horse,
Mr. Dunnison. you ride out, that horse is stolen.
My men will hunt you down.
Rangers' boots, Rangers' clothes, Rangers' weapons. you walk out, makes them stolen, too.
So it seems to me,
Mr. Dunnison the only way you escape a warrant is to remain a Ranger.
Fisher keeps an outpost around this mesa.
Freshwater spring on the other side.
Water for the horses when they come from raids. but do we know how many? shouldn't we know how many?
Round that mesa they'll spot us well too soon.
Need to send a patrol.
Berry, Durham, Dunnison ride with Sandoval and me.
Taking a scout, Captain?
Get yourself shot.
Scipio, go get yourself shot.
And don't get shot second; get shot first, Scipio.
In fact, shoot yourself, Scipio.
Get it over with.
That's the Rangers' way.
Five men. Fisher's men, sir.
Armed, and they got a supply wagon.
--Sandoval.
--Yes, sir. our mission is to capture these men at all costs. but I want the cost to be on their side.
When the shooting starts, these targets will be shooting back-- not like practice, men.
Anyone surrenders, we question them then send them to
Austin for trial.
Remember... you hesitate, you're dead.
Where are you wandering off to, huh?
Cheval, huh?
What woman lost hold of you, huh?
Drop your guns! Stay down!
Texas Rangers!
Say your prayers, sons of bitches!
Ambush!
Someone throw me a cartridge!
I'm out!
Someone throw me a cartridge!
Found one.
Wha... uh...
--Get down! you said there were five men! Five!
I ain't no scout! you hear me?
I ain't no scout!
I'm a dag-blasted shooter!
Give me that!
We surrender.
We surrender.
So, ladies, where to next?
Say your names.
Anton Marsele, from New Orleans.
Jean-Pierre Marsele.
Son frere.
Marsele brothers.
Horse thievery and livestock extortion of merchants and widows kidnapping... destruction of property. you boys should've stayed in New Orleans.
Why don't you give us some more to write in here?
Attendez! Attendez! Attendez!
We rode for King Fisher.
The saddles were stole from Sutter Ranch in Austin.
With cattle, 400 head.
Ten ranch hands died at the Sutter Ranch.
We kill no one.
Fisher did.
We work for you now.
--For you.
-- Oui. you work for the Rangers as a spy?
-- Oui.
-- Oui. Oni, for the Rangers.
For the Rangers.
Ca va marcher, ca va marcher.
Ils savent pas a propos des antres.
C'etait pas marqne daus le mandat.
Mr. Dunnison?
--Sir?
--What'd they say?
They said, "This will work, this will work.
"They don't know about the others.
It wasn't in the warrants."
Sandoval.
These bandits went down shooting.
Surrender never crossed their minds.
Their rules, not mine. but I'll play by them.
We're Rangers, men.
We got right on our side.
Scipio.
Treat her fine... rifleman.
Dunnison: you said we would take those men prisoner take them to Austin, take them to trial.
We did the trial.
That was no trial.
A trial can run a long time, Mr. Dunnison.
Some can run up to a year.
A year is something
I do not have.
In the state of Texas, killers hang.
And if they're not killers, but we think they're killers and we don't even stop to check the warrants?
How long will the war go on... preacher? until the wicked are dead and the meek shall inherit the earth.
Are we the meek?
The meek will inherit the earth,
Mr. Dunnison.
Someone's got to go and get it ready for them.
There are bodies to be buried.
Bury them.
Some kind of work, ain't it?
We done killed six men dead.
We ain't even got our $40 yet.
Cattle come through here.
100, maybe 200.
Whoa, now! Get on back!
Rangers got the Marsele brothers.
What about the gun?
McNelly destroyed it.
Damn.
30 men and horses. about a hundred beeves. you know that's marshland prairie, Captain.
Might want to track them to a little better terrain.
No better terrain for 20 miles.
And better for us means better for them.
Might be better to wait.
Wait till what, they reach reinforcements?
Sandoval??
30 of them, 30 of us.
We wait... they may have 300.
We'll ride at full gallop.
They'll see us on the prairie and take defensive positions.
Shoot at the target forward of you only and you keep shooting till you taste that outlaw's blood.
No prisoners, Rangers.
Fire!
Hyah!
Get every last one!
Get the others out of hiding.
Let's go, boys!
Jesus Christ.
We don't have the manpower.
They set us up!
We're trapped!
Goddamn.
God, not me.
Oh, please God!
Oye, muchacho, por aca.
Stand back!
Stand back!
Don't move!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Get up!
Leave them alone!
Their dead alone!
No!
Sergeant!
I'm getting you out of here.
Help me! I surrender!
Help me!
I surrender!
Help me!
I surren--
Retreat, Rangers!
Retreat!
Durham:
Thank God!
We're retreating!
Come on!
We're retreating!
We're retreating!
Giddup! Let's go!
Next time you train your Rangers train them how to run!
Go with God, McNelly.
If the son of a bitch will have you.
Ride.
( whispers ):
Thank you very much.
Fisher will have ridden on by dusk.
We'll return to Palo Alto... get our men.
We'll resupply and get new recruits at the ranch of my old friend
Richard Dukes.
What'd they do with our men?
Cap...
Cut my men down.
Cut them down.
Jesus...
Captain! or favor... kill me.
Captain!
Kill me now.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Slow and easy,
?comprende?
Nice and easy, little lady. your war's over.
Slow and easy.
MAN:
Riders coming in!
Ready yourselves!
Begging your pardon,
Mrs. Dukes.
There's riders, Captain.
Whoa.
Are those the Rangers,
Daddy?
Caroline, take your sisters inside.
Come on, girls.
There's going to be a lot of dirty cowboys around.
Got 12 men to bury. you want to say some words, Leander?
WOMAN: you're welcome, sir.
Oh, thank you, ma'am.
No, no.
Thank you, ma'am.
Tom? wouldn't be so bad to be a ranch hand around here, would it?
Probably don't get shot at much.
I wouldn't even mind, as long as it was her doing the shooting.
Durham: up there earlier she was studying me like an encyclopedia.
I hate to disappoint you,
George, but she was eyeing me.
( laughing ):
The hell she was!
She was. She was studying me like a Bible.
Well, you study an encyclopedia a lot harder than you study a Bible, Lincoln.
Get all that buckshot out of your ass yet?
Ten more minutes.
Ten more minutes is about how long you got to live, unless you give up that bath to the man who could've killed you when he met you.
George, you couldn't kill a bottle of mescal
--with a pack of Mexicans.
--Give up the bath.
What the hell are you doing?
--Get the hell out of here!
--Give up the bath!
Have a seat, sonny. just stay on your side!
Oh, you had to see that.
She was eyeing me.
Come in.
Mr. Dunnison.
November 17.
The men fought bravely, but I believe it was my mistake to lead them into a battle on such arduous terrain.
With no natural defencements, they were unprepared to withstand such a pitched encounter.
I had believed that the numbers were in our favor.
I had believed that the raiders would not be as well-disciplined as they were.
It was a disastrous decision. would you agree with that,
Mr. Dunnison?
Dunnison:
It's awfully kind of you, Miss to be taking care of such wrecks like us.
Awfully kind.
Well, it must've been hard.
Were many young like you?
Rest assured, Miss, we didn't go down without a fight.
I killed two raiders myself at close range.
I may have killed a couple more in the charge.
What were their names?
Pardon? you had warrants for them,
I trust.
Well, the raiders opened fire on us, Miss.
There wasn't time to consult the warrants.
Well, it's just as well. you know a man's name, makes it harder to kill him, now, doesn't it?
They're outlaws, Miss.
We're Rangers.
When you kill a man for stealing some cattle you are saying that his life is worth as much as that steer.
Leaves you a whole state full of men thinking that way and treating other men the same.
We ride to protect the state of Texas. you ride to balance the blood on the scales. but some of you-- like your friend--
I look into his eyes, and I can see it clear.
He's no killer.
George? you looked in his eyes?
( chuckling ):
George?!
Durham:
Miss.
Ladies.
Hey. you talking to her?
I got nowhere,
George.
Gunslingers.
She likes gunslingers.
Sergeant, what's going on?
Training exercises, it looks like.
Who organized this?
Philadelphia did. about damn time.
Peppercorn.
State'll pay you $40 a mouth.
Four men to a dab.
Seven dabs to a company. you get your pay from Sergeant Armstrong. you get your orders from me.
Fire!
Senorita.
Si.
La Senora wanted you to have these.
They're yours to keep. you're safe now. you're with the Rangers.
Those devils can't hurt you anymore.
Who say they cannot hurt me no more?
John Armstrong says.
Senora is... very kind.
Who were those men?
Name to me the devils that hurt you.
We're after those men.
I heard them say they were going to Amargosa to do a raid at the Logan ranch.
Thank you.
ARMSTRONG:
Come on, recruits, let's get ready to move out!
Come on, pack it up!
Let's get ready to move out, boys.
Let's pack her up!
Saying good-bye?
We, uh... shot five bandits over at Palo Alto.
Well, I mean...
I killed.
Judy didn't. but I was riding Judy.
Hell, they was dead before they even saw me draw. Blam, blam!
George, sell it in the dime stores.
She'd... make a good ranch horse.
I think you'd make a good ranch hand.
Dunnison:
Miss Dnkes hope he hasn't tired you with all his stories: all the bad men he's killed, the hangings, the shoot-outs.
It's so hard to keep track.
Actually, we were speaking of a horse.
He killed a horse?
Miss Dukes.
McNELLY:
Amargosa's a
40-mile ride but we'll make it by nightfall.
Send a man into Shepardton.
Get a telegram to Victor Logan.
Tell him to get his family out of there.
And the Rangers are coming.
I made the lady a promise, Captain.
We're taking her to Carmargo.
Hyah.
Another hour and it's sunup.
Any sign over there?
Dust, Captain.
Dust and sky.
Night... why wouldn't they raid at night?
She wasn't dead.
I don't follow.
The rest were dead.
And she wasn't.
So why'd they leave her behind?
Hey, Captain!
Captain, wait up!
They let you live! Why?
To say what? What?!
--Stop! you're scaring her!
--Amargosa?
Le diije qne no se!
Captain, she told you what she heard them say!
What they wanted her to hear!
What they wanted her to say!
Rangers!
Men, we are riding back to Dukes.
Dunnison, Donavan, Scipio stay behind with Sergeant Armstrong.
Take Perdita as our prisoner.
Yeah, but what if they still raid?
We're not at the raid, goddamn it!
The raid can only be at the Dukes Ranch!
Hyah. Hyah!
Perdita. you didn't know. you conldn't have.
Please forgive me.
Hyah! Hyah!
Andale, mas rapido!
Ho! Ho!
Rapido, ho!
Duncan!
Scipio!
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
Yo, andale.
Yo, andale.
1Andale!
1Arriba, arriba!
1Andale!
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah!
Hyah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Kill me, teijano. you want to kill me, kill me!
--Or do you want to have me first?
--I don't want to kill you and I don't want to hurt you-- I want to know why.
They know I'm from Carmargo.
They are riding to Los Cuevas.
They say if I don't say
Amargosa, they kill mi familia.
Tonight?
They ride tonight?
I say Amargosa for mi padre, mi madre...
--Where are they?
They're riding for Mexico crossing at Los Cuevas.
Tell George to get word to the company.
We're taking to the trail.
Who taking the trail?? you and I-- Mexico.
Richard!
Richard!
Where's Richard?
Rangers!
Drive the herd!
These are Mexican beeves now!
And the man is a Mexican man.
Captain Leander McNelly.
I've been waiting for you.
The young soldier there has been talking my ear off since dawn trying to work himself a trade.
One Mexican juggler for one Texas clown. you send Captain Dukes across that river we'll send your girl. you have my word.
I could use a man like you, Captain-- a man who can shoot, a man of his word.
Man could live like a king in Mexico.
If I was your wife and boys
Mexico's where I would have hightailed it by now instead of waiting for a killer like you.
Maybe they're here now,
McNelly... living like kings in Mexico.
Captain Dukes for the girl.
He means nothing to you.
Ah, but he means something to you.
Richard!
Now we send her!
--No!
--Stand down, Mr. Dunnison.
Dunnison:
What she did was to save her family.
She's a victim, not an outlaw.
Stand down... or be shot.
This is not what Rangers do.
Captain, show them the difference between them and us.
Stand down, Dunnison.
The state of Texas commands you to leave its lands now and forever. you will be prosecuted and imprisoned should you ever return.
May God have mercy on your sonl.
PERDITA:
I did what you say!
Yeah, and you'll do what I say tonight, and you'll do what I say tomorrow.
Maybe one day we'll charge admission.
Don't know which
I want to do worse: kill the son of a bitch up there... or go teach him how to play.
McNELLY:
Take up your pen, Mr. Dunnison.
No notebook, sir?
Take up your pen.
November 19.
I, Leander McNelly, being of sound mind do hereby bequeath my land and property to the Texas Rangers to do as they see fit.
The following items excepted: my Navy Colts, field glasses and books on military strategy... to Lincoln Rogers Dunnison-- a soldier fit to lead.
My Bible I would like to be buried with.
That is all.
Sir...
In that fort will be far more than 30 men.
They'll never expect us to cross into Mexico.
They'll be well-armed and well-provisioned.
They've been riding for weeks, sir.
It's their first night back.
The women, the liquor... they'll crave sleep.
Bones, start your men at the front gates.
Baker.
Yes, sir.
Take you men high to the ridge.
Come on.
Armstrong, Durham, take your men low to the back gates.
Dunnison and I will take the front.
Now let's wake them np.
Caballeros, the tunnels!
Come on!
Let's get in the tunnels!
Move!
Rangers!
Vamonos, apurate!
Charge!
We're in, Rangers!
Oh, shit!
We're surronnded!
What the hell?? !
We're surronnded in the back!
I'm out of cartridges!
Someone throw me a cartridge!
Vamos, rapido!
Heard you were fast.
Faster than that.
This is only gonna hurt for a second.
Maybe two.
Kill him, Mr. Dunnison.
Kill him. you kill me,
I'll kill him.
Go!
Captain!
Captain, they want to surrender.
They want to surrender.
No surrender, right, Captain?
No prisoners, right?
We take back our cattle.
We take them as prisoners.
We take them to trial. but, Captain...
Those are the terms.
He wants to see you boys.
When they remember us,
Rangers... let them remember us not as men of vengeance... but... as men of law... and justice.
Can't help but think that they're watching.
Yeah...
I bet they're up there riding like the old days.
Hey, Caroline!
Rounding up cattle.
We'll see you tonight!
He'll make a good rancher.
And whatever else you've got in mind he might be all right at that, too.
He's a good man, Mr. Dunnison.
Ride safe, Mr. Dunnison.
Rangers...
Ride out!

What tufais?
What's going on?
He tried to pay me with this.
- It's my bag of gold.

I never heard that Delaney was playing.
That's why he lost.
Lack of experience.
You'd better introduce you to Mr. Dillon.
Tomorrow at dawn. Get out.
The show is over.
Let it work.
A tour here.
It's coming.

- No need.
Failure to appear not Dillon, they must leave the city.

Why not both?
Down the hall,
The bed birds.

He'll call Sue, like me.
Sue City.
The railway is the largest ... of all American history.
It's not you who selected.
- Ilfaut deserve it.
- No kidding, really?
Yes.
Sorry.
Why it is called Sue?
Because I fuck you so deep ... so, so deep ... that your cock will be found somewhere in California.

A one else.
How are you?

Harry Grimes, concession Roughwood,
November 30 this year, have been found guilty of intentionally ... racked color and dust

I know I was wrong.
I deserve punishment.
The normal sentence is 50 blows.
Mr. Dillon was transferred to 25 ... because he knows that this will not happen again.
The show is over, guys!
Go home!
Mr. Dillon!
I was told to give you this.
What is it?
This is the part of Mrs. Burn.
Hope you are?
Mr. Dillon.
Burn miss!
- Can I accompany you?
- Yes.
Mr. Dillon is your parent?
Yes, indeed.
Our rich parent.
It's good to have a parent like him.
Unless he does hunting with a whip.
In many cities, this man would have been lynched.
Mr. Dillon has probably saved his life.
Have you ever seen a lynching?
J'aifailli lynched myself, once.
- Really?
- A city waiting ... its railway.
I had to tell them that pass 25 km to the north.
The idea of ??a rope to the coup
I would change my mind.
But no.
It must be fascinating to be in the nature ... with the lynchers, grizzly bears and wild Indians.
It is.
Can I accompany you?
It's not very pleasant.
I am strong.
I do not slow you down.
- Okay.
- When?
Tomorrow morning.
The path above the city.
We will return in the evening.
It makes me happy.
Thank you, Mr. Dalglish.
See you tomorrow.

It's pork stew.
I have a bowl.
- Where are you from?
- In Dublin.
- And you?
- In Poland.
Want to drink?
Thank you.
I have not seen a woman ... long time.
I understand.
- You have found?
- There is no gold in America.
No more gold than elephants.
It provides no pleasure.
A man loses his courage.
Even if it discovers a pool, he loses.
There's more?
I do not need gold.
I need a woman.
Take that.
- On exchange.
- You do not part with.
I dragged on for six months on this forsaken land.
I started with two mules, a cart and luggage.
- I no longer owns it.
- You do not possess me.
The concession.
I give you the concession.
- Daniel.
- Shut up. Let me think.
I take the child as well.
I will be happy.
Want to sell your child?
I'm serious.
This is my breath.
You see how he clings to coal?
Yes, he has taken.
More slowly.
It warms the outside ... and when it's hot ... you pass on your face, your hands ...
Get warm all day.
Thank you.
- You want good shoes?
- It's OK.
- You're not cold?
- No.
- Tell me if your feet are freezing.
- I come from pioneer.
My father was one.
My mother also.
I was a baby when all
California was like that.
They found gold?
A little.
Not enough.
They never said as it was beautiful.
It's beautiful.
HowTo mount a train here?
Ilfautfaire jump the mountain.
That may be what will be done.
Tunneling.
Can I have more water for my mother?
- Of course.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
- Miss Burn?
- Yes?
We have a mutual friend.
A Mr. Dalglish?
Oh, yes.
My name is Lucia.
Enchanted. Mine is Hope.
- It's a pretty name.
- Thank you.
You can call me Lucy.
I came to ask you from Dillon ... if you wanted visit us.
Oh, yes. Thank you.
When?
- Here's your water.
- Thank you.
Whenever you want.
Now, if you want.
I'm not sure.
- My mother ...
- Oh, come with your mother.
- I will ask.
- I'm waiting here.
Okay.
Dillon is below.
I must visit him.
- You too.
- Dillon?
It is below.
- She knows we're here?
- Mr. Dalglish told him.
- Can I go?
- Yes.
Cap up.
- I have no time. She waits.
- It will wait.
Come here.
Do not talk too much there.
Okay? Answer when it speaks to you.
About Dillon.
Say nothing of yourself.
Do not worry.
I know quoifaire.
Goodbye.
- Where are you, Hope?
- In Boston.
I would go to Boston.
Tonight, Mr. Dalglish will fall madly in love with you.
I do not think.
- Why would he do?
- Because you will be splendid.
Let moifaire.
We captives.
I tried to do like San Francisco.
Exactly.
- Let's start.
- Okay.
What do you think of the form?
I've never worn like it. I do not know.
Here is the skirt that goes with it.
She is so beautiful.
- You can change the lace.
- It will be too big?
We can fix that.
Come on, guys. Move boxes and boards!
Thank you.
We want to get before nightfall. Go!
Go on. Keep it up!
Ladies ...
Ladies and gentlemen ... we have a guest tonight.
A distinguished pianist you just heard ... and a famous actress throughout the Americas.
Hope Burn miss.
There is a gorge ...
- What a beautiful song.
- Thank you.
What was she talking about?
It's a song about the homeland of my ancestors.
- Portugal.
- You know what?
She has a mole on the buttock.
The neighbors liked the charming girl.
Calm down!
All of you!
Continue.
Then one day a letter arrived ... with its passage already paid ... for land flowing
Missouri and Mississippi.
She made her luggage and everything was ready ... and a day at the door ... the widow, the brokenhearted, separated from her Noreen Bawn.
I'm going to change.
The widow waited many years.
But one evening through the door, a slender woman entered.
It was expensive clothes.
She said: "Mother, you know me?
"I only caught a cold."
But two scarlet spots his cheeks ... told their sad story.
There is a grave
Old Shooting Connail ... where the wild flowers stir gently.
An old woman sobbing kneeling at the grave.
She said:
"Noreen, you hear me?
"I am alone since you left.
"The curse of emigration ...
"Put you there, my Noreen Bawn."
Daniel, stop!
Come!
So, dear youth and tender girls ... think before you leave.
Your humble
Irish houses ... you do not see that there really.
What gold and pleasure without his health and strength?
If you are thinking of emigrating, remember Noreen Bawn.
It's been years ...
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
- It was lovely.
- Thank you.
Sing, Dalglish.
- Sing! Sing!
- Oh, no!
- Sing!
- No!
Sing! Sing!
I know this ballad.
I recited often to my father.
He was still crying at the end.
How was it?
My father?
You are not parents?
Mom said you are related by marriage.
Oh, Shenandoah
Because I miss you
It's too high.
Again. Again.
- Do it again.
- Right now?
Do you have children?
Children?
Oh, Shenandoah
Because I miss you
In the distance, river flood
Oh, Shenandoah
As I hear you
Away
I am far
I crossed the great Missouri
No.
Stop it.
You are special.
Really?
Very special.
No, you say that ... and then you go with your big nitroglycerin box ... and you never come back.
If I come back.
What are you doing in the hallway?
You have men in there.
The job before the cigarette.
Bellanger. The time has passed.
I want money.
- Annie?
- Yes.
No gifts. Go!
- On the table.
- I know.
- Now.
- Where have you gone?
- It goes well ...
- It takes me another 30 dollars.
Mary, it is not there?
Bring your ass over here.
You do wait.
Going to do your job.
Dillon asked from you.
What did you say?
You were a researcher gold and should be wary.
You are very perceptive.
I have to go again tomorrow.
I must consider the next valley.
You come back?
Yes.
- What are you looking for?
- My turn.
It is there.
It was a good night.
Yes? How?
$ 900 and 4 ounces.
It's good.
One of them pays Annie for each minute of the day.
- I liked your song.
- Thank you.
Ilfaudrait watch your man.
- As he looked at the small ...
- I beg you.
Well, it's just a child.
You were a when he found you.
It Luif marry an engineer.
I know very well what I do.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Back to work.
I do not think that you will return.
Of course there is.
I leave luggage here.
And me?
You'll come back looking your luggage and you will let me.
I'll be back for you too.
You think more in your luggage to me.
Go to sleep now.
It's going in the room
Mrs. Burn.
At the top of the stairs, right?
It's almost frozen.
It's so pretty.
- It seems not stupid?
- It suits you very well.
Thank you, Mom.
Where do I ask this, Madame?
Oh, that.
Mr. Dillon sent me you up, ma'am.
I am not a package.
No. I wait for you outside.
Miss.
Mom.
Look at that.
That's it. I will help you down.
How are you?
- You wait there.
- OK, Dan.
They say you're sick.
I am dying.
Burn died.
It did not leave anything.
I do not want that Hope suffers.
I hope you either.
Coffee?
I want $ 200 a year.
That's it.
If it's too, we can negotiate.
But I want a written promise.
I no longer drink, Elena.
I want you to know.
I need money.
I need money for Hope.
Does she know?
It's cold here here.
Sweetley you deposit.
Mr. DeWolf.
Mr. Dillon.
Remain seated.
- Hello, Mr. Dillon.
- Open the door.
Oh, Dillon ... my love.
What is it?
A gift.
And that?
The titles of the show.
It is yours.
Why?
We have to finish this.
What are you talking?
It is a comfortable settlement.
You will not ...
I am not a whore!
I do not want.
Tell me why.
- The titles of the tobacco ...
- Stop with that!
- Why?
- It's impossible.
You think I do not know.
It is this girl.
You want to fuck her!
Sort of ... pig!
As soon as one has passed the mountain, I will leave.
- You will see.
- You always say that.
She has one child.
Annie?
She left him in Sacramento.
We'll get him.
It will not be a life with a kid.
I will find a piece of land ... and I'm going to build a house.
Bellanger, you are so full of shit.
You did not sit since 1862.
I sat down.
Where?
In a brothel in San Francisco.
It is too narrow, boss.
- We will never build here.
- I've seen worse.
Come on, guys.
Bring the nitro.
Cross far.
Go right to the edge.
It peutfaire skip the rock.
Where?
There.
It's good.
Lord God!
Thomas!
"Surely goodness and mercy ...
"Be with me all my life ...
"And I will always in the house of the Lord.
"Amen."
Amen.
You can not pass.
You know that.
The train will stop not to Kingdom Come?
So what?
And Annie, then?
There 's plenty of Annies.
But it is not Annie you think.
Be careful where you put it.
Hey, John?
T.J., you ready?
Come on, guys. Walk straight.
Ready?
Fire!
Straighten up and there!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Continues to descend, T.J.!

Mrs. and Miss Burn,
Mr. Dillon asked the pleasure of your company.
- When?
- Now.
Why?
Dillon wants tell you in person.
Come on, straighten it!
Ms. Burn ...
I must speak.
Why all this?
I want us to get married.
- We are already married.
- No one knows.
It would settle everything.
You should have all the money you want.
I have no other family.
Hope inherit after death.
And your little lady?
It has nothing to do with it.
- You did not marry?
- I was already married.
It would be a family again.
I served as his father.
On one condition.
I do not want her to know.
It was not me who would tell him.
We agree?
Okay.
How can you marry him?
I do not understand.
They were never married.
It does not explain why marry you.
I knew before.
Before Dad?
Before Dad.
Hey, guys!
Engineers are back!
Come on, hurry up.
I hurry.
Hi, Dalglish.
We are waiting for you, you know.
Where is everyone?
At the wedding.
Why not you?
It is the marriage of Mr.
Dillon and Mrs. Burn.
Forward, guys!
I want you to be happy.
I am.
- Are you well?
- Yes.
How are you?
Take care of it.
- Bellanger, just dance.
- I arrive.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Excuse me.
Hello, miss Burn.
Good morning.
- How are you?
- Want to dance?
With pleasure.
How did it go?
All right.
It starts quickly.
Kingdom Come needs a railroad.
Everyone needs it.
The nation needs it.
Hope everything will be in one day.
Think about it.
I do not want, Mr. Dillon.
It is up to you, whether you like it or not.
Now ... you dance with me?
- Sorry.
- How are you?
Yes.
Now I want a beautiful wedding photo.
Stand up in front of the camera.
- I sit here?
- Yes, please.
Maybe the bride should sit?
The bride ...
Yes.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
- Really?
- Of course.
You do not amuse me?
I have to leave tomorrow.
Already?
Yes, we must examine the other side.
But I shall return.
When?
Soon.
Does Dillon will have what he wants?
I do not know.
Everything would change.
For the better.
There will be a school, church.
Even the sidewalks?
Ilfaudra rename it.
Dillonville, probably.
Dillonopolis or Dilladelfia.
There are so many possibilities.
Hope is a nice name for a city.
You build the road iron to the Atlantic?
It is already there.
We will meet in the middle.
It's not that far, then.
- Come, we are in the saloon.
- No, I'm too tired.
- We got engaged.
- Really?
You are engaged?
- Yes, we celebrate.
- Come, both of them.
I promised my mother to help. But, thank you.
Come, Bellanger.
I want to tell Sue.
You must come.
- Okay.
- Congratulations.
You're sure not to come?
I would like but I can not.
Just a drink.
I really go help my mother.
I understand.
Okay, okay, it's good.
In honor of the engagement
Mr. Bellanger ... and a certain lady of the parish,
Railway Company
Central Pacific ... pays the tour!
And some amount of tobacco.
- I'll go see Sue.
- Go ahead, darling.
Hi, bitch.
Do not be sad, Sue.
You're gonna make me cry.
You look lost, Lochinvar.
- You do not want a girl?
- Not tonight.
You bring me back home?
Impossible. I have a big day, tomorrow.
You're so polite.
I like it.
It hurts?
Our equipment is at the warehouse.
- Send us an invoice.
- It will be free.
We will pay what seems right.
If you do not build, do not come back.
- Thank you.
- I bring you something?
No, thank you.
Look at the piano.
Dillon offered to you?
The man, now identified and isolated the power ... which is originally of life and had galvanized.
This force is electricity.
Look.
The frog ... is dead.
But if we introduce a small electric shock ... in the frog, and ...
Of course, it's too late ... forces to revive the ...
This poor frog a sustainable manner.
Excuse me.
But the sound absorption electricity ... for a disease can ... revitalizing forces life of an individual ... and strengthen the will to live.
Take them, yes.
Do not be afraid.
This equipment generates a small electric shock.
Did you notice?
It's narrow.
Was constructed in worse conditions.
It's expensive.
$ 50,000 per km, perhaps 40,000.
And this city, Kingdom Come?
What will happen to him?
They can move,
Sir.
We will give you trouble?
I guess yes.
- Do what you must do.
- Yes, sir.
Do not try to get one day of work without token.
All right, guys.
And that's it.
Water, please.
Let's remove him his nightshirt.
Raises his arms.
Thank you, Mr. Dillon.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Can you give me some herbs like last time?
Do not lose the head, Bellanger.
We do not want the fight.
Can you give me a little more of it?
If you walk a little, it will pass.
The engineering team is going to pack.
I'm coming.
The current needs time to circulate.
Dan?
You are leaving us, Dalglish ... or the railway will go through my corral?
No, it does not.
Where is it?
It will aufond Valley.
Aufond Valley?
It's far from my city.
Yes, but the land there belongs to no one.
- The railway ...
- You got me wrong.
Why are you back?
We must recover the material of the company.
Mr. Sweetley ... these men are weapons in our city.
We have spent the limits of Kingdom Come.
I decide the limits of my town.
Go to the home.
Do not move, Mr. Dillon!
There is no other injuries.
Sorry for M. Sweetley.
We pack and leave as soon as possible.
You have until dawn.
Take him to the sheriff.
Take off your hat.
Lower arms.
At work.
Come on, faster.
Let's go.
What happened?
Sweetley died.
Dalglish was killed.
Come here.
Come.
Sometimes you turn back to someone ... and when you look again, your life is gone.
Do not stay here.
Do not stay for me.
No one rejoices, Lucy.
Hey!
Francisco, where Bellanger?
Gentlemen! Come!
Come on, girls. Will.
It is on the house tonight.
Do not sit as a band of virgins.
It did not. Will.
You pay, you pay!
Do not go, Bellanger.
Please, do not go.
I'll miss you.
Come with us.
You can build a city.
What do you mean?
Why not?
Are you recording land, you organized money. You can.
- You would do very well.
- Yes, I could.
Really?
She is dying.
If you go, you never see her again.
What's going on?
- Where is he?
- Who?
Where Dalglish?
Answer when I get off the woman.
At Lucia!

- Go, go!
I told you to go away!

Why? Wait!
What's going on?

You would not stay to build a city?
It is a railway
I want to build.
You would stay if someone you asked.
- Who?
- Hope.
You have a name for your city?
I want to name it after my father.
I've always dreamed to return there.
He pronounced it so well.
Here
I belong now.
And you, Dalglish?
You would not belong to one place?
Yes
When I finished the railway.

You will work this afternoon ...
Weapons are prohibited in my city.
I came for a priest.
- Why do you need?
- Elena died.
Where are you?
I'm going.
I'll get Dalglish.
She told me not to abandon those you love, no matter what they do.
Farewell.
I would like to show you something.
You come with me?
Wait for me here, please.
I will be here.
And there.
Who is it?
You know who it is.
It's you.
The baby is you.
The woman is your mother.
I do not understand.
I have sold.
I sold your mother.
I have sold
Burn in against gold ... here in this hut.
Welcome, Mr. Dalglish.
- It's nice to see you.
- Bellanger Here!
Here it is.
Where is the priest?
- He is not here.
- Why?
- He went to Kingdom Come.
- Why?
Dillon died.
- He went to bury him.
- It will come back?
I hope so.
Come see the church.
It is not over yet.
Friends ... we are gathered to see the beginning of an era ... and the beginning a new city.
In many years, when you tell the story ... men and women
North America ... who conquered this territory blank with steel strings, you can say that you played your role.
And on behalf ... the railway
Central Pacific,
I wish you happiness and prosperity ... in your new city ...
Lisbon.
Here the priest.
Miss Burn it.
I come back.
Let me help you.
Thank you.
Miss Burn, I sorry for your loss.
She was sick for a long time.
I have done wrong.
When one is left not in one place it behaves differently in other circumstances.
It is unfortunate that circumstances have been.
I would like to attend the wedding.
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
You are etfemme husband.
Embrace it, Annie!
Annie, are you working tonight?
Aufeu!
Alan! Alan, saddle the horses!
Kingdom Come is burning!
- Horses!
- I gotta go.
- I bring the horses.
- John! Robert!
It's too hot!
Be careful, guys.
Come back, come back!
We lost!
Come on, guys!
- Have you found?
- No.
We start again at dawn.
What is it?
Father, wake up,
I beg you.
Please, wake up.
You can help me return it?
Bring the horses.
Help me to return.
Stop the horse. Stop!
Please.
Daniel?
They were like kings.
- Who?
- Pioneers.
Men like Dillon.
They came here when there was nothing they built these cities and have reigned as kings. gold!
Let's go get it! At the bank!
- Quick!
- It's ours now!
Come on, little brother.
Checkout time.
Yeah.
Everyone's well behind us, Senator.
When we cross the finishing line, we'd best look like champions.
Howdy.
Nice morning, don't you think?
You went over it.
You went off the wagon trail.
Cross-country race, ain't it?
Well, I didn't ride 1, 100 miles to finish second place.
Why did you, then?
This race is mine, cowboy.
Hyah!
Ready when you are, brother.
Let 'er buck.
Yee-haw!
Based on the Life of Frank T Hopkins
Whiskey.
That's right.
I don't like your style, Hopkins.
Hey!
You made it.
Mustangs don't belong in races with thoroughbreds.
If you ask me, they belong in fertilizer.
Mister...
You can say anything you want about me.
I'm gonna have to ask you not to talk about my horse that way.
Call it.
Tails.
Mr. Hopkins...
Private Abernathy.
With the 7 th.
Major Whitside, 2nd Battalion,
7 th Cavalry Encampment, at Wounded Knee Creek, sir.
Carry on.
Mr. Hopkins...
Right now, huh?
Wounded Knee Creek
December 29, 1890
Dispatch rider!
"Major Whitside, 7 th cavalry, commanding battalion in the field.
General Miles directs me to say that a solution to the Sioux uprising must be found at once.
Disarm the Indians.
Take every precaution to prevent their escape.
If they choose to fight, subdue them. "
Dispatch, sir.
They've been doing it all night.
There's gonna be an uprising.
No, soldier.
It's a ghost dance.
That's all.
Praying to their ancestors for help.
Boy.
Where are they taking us?
They called you Blue Child.
I knew your mother.
Get back behind the tent line.
Come on, now.
You don't need that.
Come on.
You know what army this is,
Big Foot?
This is the 7 th.
Yellow Hair's men.
Do you remember Pahaska?
Yeah, you probably ate his liver.
Hey, you.
Come here.
Give me the gun.
Black Coyote is deaf.
He cannot hear your orders. Please...
Let go of it!
What are you doing, Bronco?
Go on, there!
What are you looking at?
27 Congressional medals were awarded at a place called Wounded Knee.
This was the proud 7th who fought at the Little
Bighorn Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show Eight Months Later and saw their great general killed in battle.
The Battle of Wounded Knee would not be that way.
On that day, outnumbered by warriors, but undaunted in spirit, the brave 7 th held their ground.
Hopkins!
Get up.
Hidalgo's up next.
Hey, Phoebe Anne.
Get your own gun.
Making sure you don't have live shot in there.
Damn gun's loaded, and so are you.
- I'm getting out of Cleveland.
- Good. 'Cause we're in Boston.
Come here. Remember?
You're the good guy.
Who has come out to parlay with Buffalo Bill?
Could it be a real and living war chief of the red race?
Chief Eagle Horn.
Mothers, hold your children close.
This is not an act.
You are beholding the last of the wild hostiles, the red pirates of the prairies.
He who scalped many a pioneer on the bloody warpath that led to the winning of the West.
Now, this is the man whose power took the life of the great General Custer on the day that
Colonel Cody was too late.
And that, gentlemen, is why they call me Texas Jack.
Far Rider, I must speak to Long Hair.
Please speak United States for me.
Chief says his people are vanishing faster than he can earn silver with you.
- Can't this wait?
- Curb your tongue, Nate!
Let the chief speak.
Chief Eagle Horn says that our - his nation's hoop is broken and scattered.
The buffalo herds have been destroyed.
Elk and deer are gone.
And now the government is rounding up our wild horses, and they plan to shoot them, too, before the first snows.
They put a price on the native horses too great for a poor Indian to meet.
Chief says that perhaps his people have lost their lands, but not their spirit.
And he asks you for your help.
Tell my dear friend Eagle Horn that the mustang breed has known its day and served its purpose.
If my chief wishes a fine horse,
I will give to him a thoroughbred steed of his chosen color.
Yes. He'll do whatever he can.
Behold the famed
Cheyenne-to-Deadwood stage line.
What? What?
Heavens, folks!
It's an ambush.
What think you of the show, Aziz?
Bravely, the pioneer meets the savages...
Jack, what are you doing?
Hold on to it.
- Get your foot up there, Frank.
- This is the real West... and not for the faint of heart.
And now, folks, you remember them, rough-riding Frank Hopkins and his horse, Hidalgo!
Galveston, Texas, to Rutland, Vermont, is over 1,800 miles.
But Frank Hopkins and his painted wonder made the ride in 30 days.
Can cross the country in 30 days, but he can't find his horse backstage.
The wounded-soldier trick!
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for the wounded-soldier trick.
You're lucky this gun's got blanks.
Let go of me, you rabbit-eared...
And the horse
- drags the wounded soldier home.
- Let go of me!
Sheikh Al Riyadh is keeper of the Muniqi stallion.
His excellency's royal stables preserve the purest equine bloodline in the world.
And he wishes to invest in the Cody enterprise?
The Sheikh of Sheikhs,
His Greatness, is beyond investment.
His pride is in his family horses.
You see, Mr. Cody, the sheikh's own stallion, Al-Hattal, is the greatest living endurance-race champion of all time.
The sheikh saw your show in Paris.
His honor was deeply insulted by your claim to exhibit the world's greatest endurance horse and rider.
Hidalgo is a legend, my friends.
He has never lost a long-distance race.
In America, perhaps.
On deserts that women from my country could cross on foot.
Frank, you just missed some compliments about your horse.
Five minutes, Billy.
Gentlemen, I present rough-riding Frank Hopkins.
- Mr. Hopkins, a pleasure.
- Mr. Cody, His Excellency...
- Sit down before you fall down.
- ... you remove the title that you have bestowed on this American horse.
What's going on here, Bill?
Perhaps you have never heard of the great horse race of the Bedouin.
It has been held annually for more than 1,000 years.
A 3,000-mile race.
Across the Arabian Desert.
Along the Persian Gulf and Iraq.
And across the sands of Syria to Damascus.
It is known as the "Ocean of Fire. "
Our office will accept your entry at $ 1,000 in Spanish silver.
The winner's purse makes the victor very honored.
Very...
How do we say?
Very rich, Mr. Cody.
These boys are serious, Frank.
His greatness invites you and your horse to enter in the challenge if you will not remove the title that you have bestowed on this impure animal.
Impure?
He is pure mustang, friend.
What shall I tell
His Excellency?
You can go tell him to pound sand for all I care.
Tequila.
To be more exact, my Arabian friend.
Gentlemen, the third act is starting.
I suggest you take your seats.
A very wise choice you have made, Mr. Hopkins.
I don't think that was a compliment, Frank.
Long Hair has promised me rock candy in Pittsburgh.
Our good red and blue days are over.
Perhaps all of us will die in this show of the great Cody.
You have a chance to go save yourself, Far Rider.
Hidalgo is not the horse he used to be, Chief.
There's nothing wrong with that horse.
Is it better to perish here in this Wild West, as Cody tells it?
I saw what happened at Wounded Knee Creek.
I carried the orders.
I call you Far Rider, not because of your great races and your fine pony, but because you are one who rides far from himself, and wishes not to look home.
Until you do, you are neither white man nor Indian.
You are lost.
You think we got one more in us?
Nah, me neither.
Hell, I don't even know who Frank Hopkins is no more, brother.
A hundred of us put in our 10 coin.
Chief Eagle Horn put in 20.
Don't waste our money, Hopkins.
There goes Hopkins.
The house of Sheikh Riyadh will be greatly honored.
Bertolt, accommodate Mr. Hopkins and his horse.
Halt!
Are you all right, sir?
Ice is a precious commodity at sea, my friend.
My gin might go warm for the sake of your misfortune.
Much obliged.
But I'd take a warm gin over ice anytime, mister.
Major, actually.
Major Davenport.
Yes.
Oh. I believe you already know my wife, Lady Anne.
She tells me you put on quite a Wild West display down there in steerage.
You handled yourself with aplomb.
Well done.
Now, tell me, Mr. Hopkins...
Is it true that you're en route to Aden to enter your horse in the famous race?
Well, I can't think of any other reason to cross the big water, ma'am.
Splendid.
He's the real item, isn't he?
Have you ever killed any red Indians?
Just one.
A long time ago.
Do you know who you'll be racing against, Mr. Hopkins?
Yeah. Pretty near a hundred
Arabians is the word.
It's not just 100 Arabians.
It's 100 of the finest and purest horses ever bred on the sands of the Nedj.
There's Al-Hattal, the sheikh's champion.
Al Amir of Syria is entering
Kusma, the blue mare.
And then there's Camria.
The red racer who descends from the great Al-Jebla.
The best.
Who owns that one?
Queen of Sheba?
No, Mr. Hopkins.
I do.
Lady Davenport has lived among the Bedouin.
She's fluent in Arabic, Kurdistani.
And what's that African dialect?
- Tuareg.
- Yes, right.
Tell me, Mr. Hopkins, what breed is your stud?
Hidalgo's a mustang, ma'am.
Oh! Mustang?
From the Spanish mesteno, meaning untamed.
That's right.
Horse of the red Indian.
Small, hearty.
Mixed blood.
Of Spanish origin.
Mixed.
Well, I think I'll turn in.
Thanks for the gin.
And the ice.
Nice meeting you, sir.
Ma'am.
Good night, Mr. Hopkins.
I find him rather ingenuous and charming.
Don't you, Annie?
Sorry, darling?
Godspeed to you all.
Win one for the crown, Annie!
The major prefers to stay at port and guard the ice chamber.
Have you never seen a slave market, Mr. Frank?
Al-Hattal.
Equine perfection.
He sure looks like a handful.
The Prince is a fine young man of pedigree, educated in the mission school.
I have chosen him to ride Al-Hattal.
Why can you not accept...?
Father...
I pray only for your happiness.
Be careful, then, Father.
Because I am happiest on a horse, riding where females are forbidden.
There is a tempest in my tent.
But it has come in the form of my cherished daughter to upset my failing pancreas.
The Aden caravan has arrived.
The good Lady Davenport...?
Yes. And an American on a horse of most unusual colour.
The cowboy.
Let in the light.
Well, what do you make of it so far?
Too late to turn back now.
Very wise to tie your horse, Mr. Hopkins.
If he were to cover an Arab mare, it would be viewed as a most inviolable blemish.
The foal would need to be destroyed before touching the ground.
As would the offending sire.
You hear that?
Keep your pride tucked.
The Rub Al-Khali.
The Empty Quarter.
It is but the first march of the great race.
Alas, most of the riders do not even get halfway.
Last year, 40 men perished, roasted alive before reaching Iraq.
The fortunate few cross Allah's Frying Pot, then must pray they do not bear witness to the jinni of the West.
Thank you, sir.
That's mighty interesting.
Ah!
Where the old ones speak of the sand devil who guards the secrets of the passage to the sea.
Those who reach the gulf waters travel west across Syria where the sands shift.
East becomes west.
West becomes south.
What looks like sand to you soon becomes the poison pits.
Men and horses fall through the air and are boiled thus.
Get out of here, mister.
Leave me be.
This is not possible!
You see, I was
Sheikh bin Riyadh's goat herder.
I was charged with the crime of stealing milk.
As punishment,
I have been assigned to the American and his horse.
You're working for me?
It was this or be removed of my left hand.
The future will tell if I have chosen poorly.
To cross Syria to Damascus, one must face hundreds of miles of salt where no food can be found.
Men go mad!
I can see that.
I pray to Allah, the All-Compassionate, that he will give you the merciful wisdom to go home.
You know horses?
Goats.
That'll help.
In the name of Allah,
I welcome you into my tent as my guest.
If his excellence were to touch an infidel, he would lose his ability to foretell the future.
Oh. Sorry.
Most foreigners find our coffee to be too potent.
Too...
Back home we toss a horseshoe in the pot.
Stands up straight, coffee's ready.
Shall we play at cards?
No, I ain't too much of a gambler, sir.
To the contrary.
You are gambling with your very life in this great race.
I had five sons once.
Three were killed in the raids.
One perished in this very race six years ago.
The other was swallowed by the quicksand of the Hammad.
I'm now a man with no sons.
Just...
...one lowly daughter.
Please.
Ignore her presence.
I am greatly pleased that you have accepted my challenge.
But I must warn you.
Never before has a foreigner partaken in the great race.
Some here are angry.
I'm not here to insult anybody, sir.
I'm just here to race.
You may smoke if you wish.
Oh, well, don't mind if I do.
The winner's purse in the Ocean of Fire exceeds $100,000 in American currency, Mr. Hopkins.
But that matters very little to me.
What matters to my house is honor.
Our culture revolves around our sacred horses, Mr. Hopkins.
It is written in the Koran.
"For they were born of the south winds, and sculpted from essence by Allah. "
On cold nights, my wives sleep in the stable tents so that Al-Hattal is comfortable and appeased.
Jaffa.
Show Mr. Hopkins to his tent.
He needs his rest.
All right.
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Hopkins.
Please.
I will amend the winner's purse with another $10,000 if you will put that Colt pistol in the pot.
That is an authentic Colt, is it not?
As they say, God didn't make all men equal.
Mr. Colt did.
Colt did not make all men equal, Mr. Hopkins.
You will find this out.
Will you wager the magnificent weapon?
For $10,000?
I'll gamble on that.
Very good, sir.
Sleep well.
You too.
And blessed be thee.
You must never eat more than one day's ration.
Do you hear me?
Cowboy!
I will eat it myself.
Hey! Quit messing with my things.
Is this the symbol of your nation?
Good as any.
Put that away.
You.
Fetch water.
For the horse.
Okay?
Go on.
Hey!
Get back here!
Come sit down.
That's a very noble deed,
Mr. Rough-Riding Hopkins.
Frank will do, ma'am.
Mary, could we have some more tea for Mr. Hopkins, please?
You're right at home here, ain't you?
Well, I spent time amongst the Bedoui with my father since I was 13 years of age.
Looking for good horses?
Looking for the breed apart.
My father spent 26 years trying to ambassador his way into the Muniqi blood.
Just like his father.
The Viceroy of Egypt,
Napoleon lll.
All of them pandered... when all they needed to do was up the ante.
Bad poker players, the lot of them.
If my mare, Camria, wins this race,
I'll procure breeding rights to Al-Hattal.
If I lose...
...I pay 40% of the purse to the sheikh.
And you, cowboy?
What are you in it for?
Just the purse, ma'am.
"Anne" will do.
Yes, ma'am.
Thanks for the tea.
Frank.
How good are you and your little express pony?
Really?
I reckon we'll both find out, ma'am.
3,000 miles from Sunday.
Hey, cowboy!
Every rider's camp must bear the flag of his house or nation.
Yusef has made our flag.
Behold it.
We are pitiful.
Would you get over here, Yusef?
I need some more water.
What did he say?
He said he has no place else to go.
You and me both, partner.
Tell him to get some more water.
Hey.
You too.
Why do you buy this boy, anyway?
Somebody's gotta do your work, goat herder.
Howdy.
Last chance, cowboy.
My name is Sakr.
Desert law compels me to speak truthfully.
I find the entry of a Western infidel sacrilege.
But I trust in Allah that he'll roast 10 of us like sheep on a spit before the sun sets today.
You shall be among the first.
Well, good luck to you, too.
The prince says maybe we should give you a head start.
Nawali say,
"Ride each day to sunset.
Start again each dawn.
Those who survive to reach the halfway camp in the Rub Al-Khali shall be rewarded with a full day's rest.
A tent camp will reach halfway point before you, traveling by camel road. "
Nawali say,
"Strength to your horses, and may God have mercy on your souls. "
Goodbye, cowboy.
Fly high, my friend.
Ease up.
Let them go.
Never beat them in the quarter-mile.
Whoa, son.
Ease up, brother.
What are you doing here?
Go back to work now.
What did I tell you, little brother?
It's all for show.
Infidel!
Do not take him!
It is against the laws of the race.
Best hotel in town, I reckon.
Hey, cowboy!
Nearly 100 miles in one day.
Most impressive!
This is your last chance to turn back.
Hear me?
You do not belong out here!
Turn back at dawn.
Or prepare for a death beyond your greatest fear!
Tomorrow I shall not even look over my shoulder!
A water hole never looked so good.
What water hole would that be, sir?
The cistern's dry.
You must discontinue here.
I suggest you take the east road back to Aden.
That's not even a transit tax.
Six soldiers in the middle of the Arabian desert guarding a dry well.
That's unusual.
I said, "The well is dry. "
Okay, brother.
We ain't gonna make another
10 miles without water.
On the whistle.
Are you bloody stupid?!
Go, brother! Go!
Easy, boys.
Long way to Damascus.
What in hellfire?
Let's go, brother.
Hyah!
Better up your price at the next water hole, Prince.
You are carried by the West Wind itself, Bin Al Reeh.
How many have fallen?
The report claims
39 have fallen out, and 11 were lost in the sandstorm.
Wash him with cold water.
I don't believe it.
You survived the sandstorm.
Allah must have a more severe judgment awaiting you.
Thanks, partner.
Daidai, we have one full day's rest before the long march to Iraq.
Al-Hattal will break away from the pack.
The mustang is still in, so we must maintain the pace.
Do you hear me?
Look at me!
Your Excellency.
- Peace be with you.
- And also be with you.
Bless you, Sheikh of Sheikhs.
Sit, Katib. Revive thy spirit.
Allah willing,
I never miss the great race, Uncle.
If I owned more flocks,
I would bet them all.
I have come to beseech you one last time.
Forgive me, and allow me to share in the ownership of our forefathers' horses.
You have not the discipline to be keeper of such royalty as your grandfather's horses.
Least of all Al-Hattal - he is my son.
Go rob pilgrims.
That is your calling.
Even the blessed Prophet was a raider in his time.
This is blasphemy.
How is the coffee?
Most excellent. I am revived.
If one tossed a horseshoe into the pot, do you think it would stand erect?
At your age, Uncle, perhaps it is the only thing that might.
Boldly spoken for a man with no wives.
How is your health, Uncle?
I have the blood of a warrior grandfather.
Please, Mr. Frank.
Listen to me.
There will be no grazing for many days.
That's all right.
I packed some barley.
Take these.
What's that?
Dates.
Trust me.
Take with you this skin.
It is filled with the butter of camel.
Mix it with the water for both you and your horse.
It will keep you alive across the Hammad.
And fear not the locusts.
They are a gift from above.
Not a plague, as you might believe.
Why are you trying to help me?
If Prince Bin Al Reeh wins the race on Al-Hattal,
I become his fifth wife.
The youngest of his harem.
No more than a slave in his house.
I do not know if you are as good as it is said.
But I have faith in the painted stallion.
It is said that you captured him in the wild.
Badlands.
Long time ago.
How did you tame him?
I didn't.
Why do you wear that?
Verily, you do not know our world.
This is a cowboy's spur.
Yeah.
My father reads many books from the outside world.
But his true enjoyment of literature, it is of Wild Bill and Calamity Jane.
You're boshing me.
In this Wild West, there are nomads, also.
The red people.
Like the Bedou, they are a horse culture.
Have you seen their vanishing kind?
I am their kind.
My father was a cavalry scout.
He fell in love with a chief's daughter.
Married her.
They called me Frank T.
My grandmother named me
Hokshelato.
It means "blue child. "
I would know you only as a white man.
Maybe I got good at hiding my face, too.
Why?
You don't know our world.
Look out!
Foolish is a foreigner.
Allah has decided that I should not sleep well these nights.
You have disgraced this house.
I am sickened.
- It is not how it appears.
- He forced you into his quarters.
No, I went by my own volition.
I wished only to speak with him.
He did not touch your daughter, but tried to protect her from danger.
I am responsible.
Have you ever considered just poisoning me, Jazira?
Why torture me with slow precision?
Why force me to marry a man who has never looked at me?
If he looks at you,
I have to cut off his head.
You are not yet his property.
The women of the western tribes no longer wear the veil.
Pray you were of a western tribe.
I would not be in this position.
And in the middle of the great race.
Shame upon you.
Shame upon you, Father.
For allowing me to ride horses when no one sees.
For taking me on gazelle hunts when the men make pilgrimage.
You are all I have.
You are my treasure.
But when the eyes of the people are on the great sheikh, I am lowly.
Let him go.
How dare you give orders to a man in my tent.
Remove a certain woman to the tent of office.
No. It is not right.
Wait a minute.
She...
Sir!
It is written, Mr. Hopkins.
If any of our chaste women commit lewdness with evidence against them, so shall they be taken out and stoned.
And it is then by law that the father must drown his own daughter.
- It wasn't her fault.
- Silence, I said.
- Ahmed.
- All right.
However, we are still far from the next cistern.
And water is precious.
So my decision is swift.
For her trespass, my daughter will be flogged.
Seven stripes at a time hence.
And you.
An impure unbeliever in the tent of a man who can trace his very blood back to Adam.
You will be removed of your infidel self.
Removed of my what?
Like a stallion not worthy of breeding.
Come here, skinner.
We didn't do nothing, sir!
I feel compassion for you.
But I cannot let your fear move me.
Speak honestly as a man.
Did you violate my daughter's honor?
No, sir.
I did not!
Can one believe a nonbeliever?
Only fools or gamblers walk behind a strange mare, Sheikh!
You can believe that!
Is that a passage from the Bible?
No, it's something Wild Bill said to me one night.
Wild Bill?
Out in Deadwood!
You refer to the man known as Hickok?
The master of the double six-gun?
Only one Wild Bill, sir.
Hickok was a true prince of pistoleers, was he not?
He's pretty good with a twist draw.
What did my daughter say about your horse?
Well, she's a lady with an eye for horseflesh, sir.
If she was my son, she would be in this race.
Alas, she is not.
She's a woman who has entered the sleeping quarters of an infidel.
Come, skinner.
You heard of the OK Corral?
Ah.
You were not there.
Tell me about this Wyatt Earp.
And the Doctor Holliday.
Raiders!
Free him.
Come on.
Hurry up!
Hey!
Get back here!
Tribal war games are their national sport, Mary.
It's none of our affair.
Hey, partner!
How about a hand?
Thank you kindly.
Go, Prince.
Al-Hattal. He is gone.
Jazira.
Hy!
I will free you.
You will run, like the prince.
Damn coward.
No wonder you don't want to be his fifth wife.
Hey!
Hey, deputy!
Hey!
Jazira...
They've taken her.
They've taken her!
If I turn over Al-Hattal,
Katib will return my child.
And if you don't?
He's a bastard son of a jackal who would have his Gypsies commit crimes upon her.
I cannot surrender what is most sacred to my family.
You could never understand that, so do not even try.
The Al Khamsa manuscripts.
My family's breeding book is gone.
It is gone!
The Al Khamsa book contains the breeding secrets of the Muniqi strain going back to Saba.
Let's bring your deputy in here.
I'll ask you once more,
Aziz, and only once.
Where did they take my daughter?
I know nothing.
I only took the book to protect it from the raiders.
It is they who stole it from me.
Stole it?
Or paid you, my trusted brother?
It matters only to He.
Please, end my humiliation.
What are you doing?
That's the easy way out.
He ain't getting it.
Please.
Western justice, partner.
That's called a Mexican tattoo, Deputy.
And that lasts a lot longer than a sword.
For a man of such high rank, you're kind of short, Aziz.
We can fix that.
No!
I know where they have taken her until they receive the stallion.
I know you're not a gambling man.
But bring my daughter back by nightfall and you're forgiven.
Attempt to deceive me and run, and you will not get beyond the port of Jordan with your head.
Run.
Faster, traitor.
His Excellency is most reckless.
Sending a slave to do a man's job.
Know this, Aziz.
If any harm has befallen the child,
I shall remove your head myself.
You know that my father will never surrender Al-Hattal.
I will tell you something about your father.
He is a failure at being a ruler.
He allows emotions to govern him.
I do not.
And he has become Sheikh of Sheikhs.
Whilst you, no more than a brigand.
I am the greatest horseman of the tribe.
I could defeat any rider in the great race, if I was allowed to sit the back of Al-Hattal.
Why am I not?
Because the sacred is not for sale, as are you.
If Al-Hattal is not turned out onto the sands of the Hamad by midnight,
I send your head to my uncle, wrapped in Baghdad silk.
I am warned.
You are promised.
Know that if we all die, your soul will go straight to the devil.
And your impure horse, too.
That's far enough, Aziz.
Kill her!
Jazira, run!
Jazira!
Jazira! Jazira!
Jaffa!
- Give him his head!
- I know what to do!
Let's keep moving, miss.
He pledged his life for me when I was born worthless.
I'm sorry.
We got to make that tent camp by sundown.
Please.
I wish you to look at me.
Why do I feel that you truly see me when others do not?
Well, my horse likes you.
Even a blind man could see that you're beautiful.
We must ride.
We will stay off the camel roads.
What does this mean?
Shunka Wakan.
Big dog.
There's no word in Sioux for horse.
When the Indians saw the first one the Spanish brought over, they didn't know what the hell it was.
When they saw how it could run, carry a man through battle, become his friend for life, well, they figured it had to be a sacred animal.
Indeed.
Did your mother teach you this wisdom?
I am sorry.
When this race is over,
I will pray five times a day.
Being an infidel, as you are, you cannot be expected to comprehend.
There are those who are chosen to be winners and those chosen to be losers.
Allah chooses thus, and it is written.
You are summoned to the tent of the lady.
Right now.
You know, Yusef,
I once had a three-legged colt.
Born that way.
Turned out to be one of the best roping horses I ever had.
Your mare's running a good race, ma'am.
She is rather lovely, isn't she?
Good legs on her.
Can you envision her offspring from an Al-Hattal cross?
Aziz was not a very admirable man.
But he was very adept in researching bloodlines.
You have blood from the red Indian race.
You hid it effectively all your life.
I'm not sure what you're getting at, ma'am.
There's no way for me to win rights to the Muniqi bloodline other than to win this race.
You, on the other hand, you have another way to win.
Only one way to win.
Your little mustang has proven hardy.
But the chances of him crossing Iraq and Syria before Al-Hattal and my mare are slim at best.
Your horse is weakening,
Mr. Hopkins, and you know it.
You've taken him so very far from anything he's ever known.
All for the sake of money.
Are you willing to kill him for money?
The winner's purse is $100,000.
Pull out now, and I'll compensate you 30% in silver for turning in a serious effort.
I've never taken money for quitting a race.
Well, then, Frank.
Just where are we, then?
Here.
Alone.
In the last corner of Arabia.
Yeah.
When you're in a desert, the sight of green grass and fresh water can be mighty tempting.
Sometimes you're just seeing things.
Indeed, Mr. Hopkins.
Good night, ma'am.
Frank.
What of my offer?
I'll sleep on it.
And all alone.
Shame.
He does not like the milk of the camel.
But it will keep his liver from failure.
Appreciate it.
You have visited the tent of the Christian lady.
I don't like the look of them front hooves.
That quarter crack is getting worse.
Another 400 miles can put him lame.
You must not give up.
It might be just time to live with what we got.
You will prove them right.
That blood is more important than will.
You will continue your life hiding who God made you.
Like me.
Jazira.
You done me proud, partner.
Frank Hopkins.
I am compelled to express gratitude.
Hidalgo!
Good luck, Mr. Hopkins.
Thank you, ma'am.
If I don't see you in Damascus,
I hope you find the stock you've been looking for.
Oh, I will.
You should have wagered on it.
The cowboy forgot his drink.
Do not react.
Remain calm.
And only I speak.
Atimi, no!
Call yourself a great Bedou raider for killing a camel boy.
For not being able to hold on to a little harem girl.
You will still pay me my riyals.
But I will exact it from you.
And perhaps much more,
Lady English.
You will receive nothing unless my horse reaches that finishing stone first.
They're six days across the Hammad.
You can intercept them by using the camel road.
Force the American into the Amal Samheem.
Capture Al-Hattal and keep him secure.
But my horse wins this race.
He made you look quite the fool, didn't he?
The cowboy.
He will beg me to cut his throat when...
Do not harm him, Katib.
Kill his horse and let him walk the desert.
There's much for him to think over.
Hy!
Whatever feed was out ahead, it ain't there no more.
"A gift from above.
Not a plague. "
Once you get past the legs, it ain't too bad.
Here you go.
It goes down pretty smooth, don't it?
Come on. Eat up.
We're back in business.
Let's see who's behind.
We are.
Jinni, no. Go away.
Do not assist me.
Just kill me, please.
Use your weapon.
No.
It is Allah's will.
No.
Tell you what.
You can do whatever you want after I get you out of there.
No!
Jinni.
Jinni.
Jinni.
How you doin', partner?
Why you turn back for me?
Ain't no prize money worth a man's life, the way I see it.
It is written that God leads astray whom he wishes and guides whom he wishes.
It was God's will that I die in this race.
Just as it is his will who shall win.
What about your will?
What about your horse's will?
Seems to me that's what will get you across a finish line.
Only then is it written.
Jinni has returned to carry me home.
Please.
My sword.
Hidalgo!
Get Al-Hattal.
Faster. He is escaping.
Stop.
You heard the Christian woman.
We are not to kill him.
The rope!
Quickly!
Hurry!
Katib!
Look. The trap.
Stop. Release the hunters.
Come on.
Get up.
Look out!
Jinni! Jinni!
You and your horse have made enough trouble for me.
Nobody hurts my horse.
Whoa.
Settle down.
Trust me now.
Whoa.
Easy, son.
Don't do it, partner.
Don't you die on me now.
We're almost home.
We're almost home.
We had 'em, brother.
We had those boys.
You're all right.
My old man.
Remember that 500-mile in Missouri?
We had three days in the lead.
Sitting on that ranch looking at nothing but green.
That's it, partner.
If there's a heaven on Earth, actually, we found it.
Well, I reckon if there's a heaven on Earth, there's gonna be a hell, too.
We just couldn't cross her.
Help me.
Blue child.
Can you see it, cowboy?
It is the ocean.
It is only Al-Hattal now, cowboy.
You were defeated before this race began.
You will not defeat me.
I am born of a great tribe.
People of the horse.
So am I.
Okay.
Al-Hattal! Al-Hattal!
Camria, praise your stamina.
Cowboy! Cowboy!
Push her.
Let 'er buck!
Ah!
Cowboy! Cowboy!
Good race, partner.
It is a magnificent horse.
Likewise, Prince.
It looks better on you.
For many miles,
I did not understand why Allah would wish this on me.
Now I understand his will.
Be a guest in my house for as long as you desire.
Stay.
I've been too far from home for too long, sir.
I lost the race, Frank Hopkins.
But you won a friend.
It's a gift.
What about your ability to tell the future?
If I had the ability to foretell the future, perhaps I would have bet on a painted horse.
Blessings be upon thee.
You too, partner.
Is it true, then, as in the Western stories?
The cowboy rides away into the setting of the sun?
But not the same cowboy.
We won't forget you.
Goodbye.
Blue child.
Assemble on the rim.
30 paces to a stand.
Make every shot count.
What's this bloke doing?
Bringing them in one at a time?
Lieutenant McNulty?
Who are you?
Hopkins.
Frank Hopkins.
Hopkins?
You bring a dispatch?
Yes, sir.
Paid in full?
Hold on!
Pull back to the left!
- How, Kola.
- How, Kola.
Is it true that the chief named Eagle Horn has returned to the reservation?
He has taken the journey.
But he knew you won, Far Rider, in the faraway sand.
Good.
Will you help me with something?
Whoa.
Easy.
Easy, brother.
Let 'er buck.
If you repeat this....
I will deny it. Like I have been... and I always will. To my grave.
Do you understand?
Hey, champ! How's it going?
Come on, let's go.
Shake a leg. We're running late.
I'm not going.
- What do you mean you're not going?
- Ljust don't want to go. Okay?
Kyle?
Kyle, look at me.
This is opening night.
Your sister's counting on you.
Yeah, well she'll get over it
- You're being very inconsiderate
- Why? 'Cause I wanna stay at home.
Yes, because you wanna stay at home.
That's what I want. Okay.
I wanna stay at home!
There's a clean rugby shirt on the dryer, Kyle. With your khakis... Kyle?
Kyle?
- Don't tell me.
- He's not coming.
- What is it now.
- What is it always?
Harry says not to push him.
We're not gonna push him.
And does Harry have any thoughts on what we're supposed to tell Shelly?
Tell me about what?
You're a real shit, you know that?
Look, ljust don't feel like being around people tonight. Okay?
You say that a lot lately.
It's not like you won't be doing it again.
Tomorrow night? You'll come then?
- Just break a leg tonight. Okay?
- Yeah, I will.
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
The show must go on, Miss Streisand.
Come on. Your limo's waiting.
- See you.
- Good luck.
I'll save you a seat if you change your mind.
Yep.
Any chance of that?
No.
I love you, partner...
I'll see you later.
Yes!!! Yeeesss!
Yes!!! Yeeesss!
Take it easy. Watch your step.
Be careful, baby.
Mom? Where's Kyle?
Kyle?
Kyle, where are you?
Kyle! Kyle! No!
Kyle!!! Kyle!!!
Kyle??
Kyle?
No!
No!
Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
Mom!
Today's guest speaker is a former shining star of this University's...
...psychology department. Teacher.
Practitioner. Author.
And these words only begin to describe his contribution to the field.
It took some arm-twisting getting him here...
...but I know you'll make him feel welcome.
K.U.'s own prodigal son
Dr. Michael Hunter.
...now imagine that you're a child again.
And you've been brought into this room to learn about chalk.
And suppose I tell you everything there is to know about chalk...
...but while doing so I also beat you.
I beat you with this pointer.
Now, some of you in the room might enjoy that.
Now, you're no longer a child, but you still carry with you these unconscious...
...conditioned fear responses.
You've buried the memory of those beatings deep in your sub-conscious.
You've altered the truth into... into an acceptable lie...
...which allows you to uh function in society.
I need a volunteer.
This young lady's fine. Thank you.
Now as a therapist, you wish your subject could simply tell you...
...the root of his or her pain, but then that person wouldn't need a therapist.
So... we simply ask a question and the subject responds, but often what...
...is not said... is far more important than what is said.
So we're gonna try a simple word association.
- You okay?
- Okay.
- Tree.
- Strong.
- Love.
- Good.
- Mom.
- Sing.
- Dad.
- Suit.
- Date.
- Tall.
Well, that rules me out.
Uh... that's very good.
- Uh, what's your name?
- Gina.
Gina. That was very nice.
Are you an undergraduate?
I'm gonna be a therapist like you.
Oh! My sympathies.
How do your parents feel about that?
My motherthinks I'm crazy.
And how about your dad?
He's not at all happy with that. Right?
There's not much that does make him happy, when he's not at work?
When he's at home?
With you?
You're okay?
In trading words with Gina,
I observed the muscles in her face.
The position of her eyes.
The rhythm of her breathing.
These are all non -verbal cues to the sub-conscious... to the unsaid.
And uh... friction between a father and a daughter is... all too common.
Sir... my thesis paper?
It's such a quick read. No really.
It takes no time. No time at all.
Please, Dr. Hunter?
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Dr. Hunter, you're gonna be late.
So... if you'll excuse us everyone.
Thank you very much.
Thank you for coming.
- Sorry I got to Barbara... Lonigan.
- Very good.
- That was very good.
- Thank you.
You're all grown up.
Well I'm a caseworker now.
Child Services.
I'm working towards my doctorate.
As I'd expect.
It's quite a workload.
Twenty-seven cases.
Nothing too challenging.
Except there uh -there is this one kid and I wanted to know...
...if I could possibly speak to you about it.
Barbara... I don't see patients anymore
No... I'm aware of that.
I... I can tell you how sorry I was to hear about your son
It's okay.
I don't mean to impose but he really is an unusual case.
Four years ago, he came home and found his mother dead.
She'd been beaten to death by his father.
The father got life and Tommy ended up in the residential program...
...at Holly Hills.
In six weeks, he turns eighteen making him eligible for release.
- You don't think he's ready?
- I don't. No.
Post-traumatic stress?
Every caseworker says the same thing.
He seems completely unaffected
He's a nice, nice kid. There's no abnormal behaviour patterns.
- No reactive symptoms.
- Deep repression.
Yeah, I know there's something in there.
- Well, if you could give him an hour...
- Look, please... Barbara...
It's not the time. It's the commitment.
You clearly have it. And I don't.
Not anymore.
But if he's concealing reactive emotions.
I know that you would be the one that could see them.
Please understand. I write books.
I give an occasional lecture.
That's what I do now... I'm sorry.
Would you at least uh take a summary of Tommy's file?
If you get a free minute? All my contact numbers are in there.
I'd appreciate it.
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you. Take care.
I'm not in. Leave a message.
Hey, dad! It's Shelly. Are you there?
- Shelly?
- I missed you last week
Yeah, I know.
But listen, my car just broke down, dad
Your car? You're okay?
Huh? Oh, I'm fine. It's no big deal.
Troy's got a friend who's gonna tow it for me.
- Oh, Troy! Who's Troy?
- He's a friend of Laura's.
- Who's Laura?
- Shelly, you fuckir killed it.
It is completely. Calm down.
I'm on the phone with my dad.
Shelly? Where are you?
I'm coming to get you.
No! Dad, I'm fine. Ljust - ljust need to borrow the car for school tomorrow.
- Can I?
- Yes. Where are you?
- I'm coming to get you.
- Dad, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Shelly, listen to me!
- Alright, bye.
So you pretty much nailed your mid terms. That must feel good.
- Yeah. Pretty good.
- Thinking about your SATs?
I don't know. I - ljust don't know if college is right for me.
Why are we taping this again?
Ljust do it once a month.
To... record your progress.
- Makes me feel like a lab rat.
- That's not its intention, Tommy.
Mm. It does. C'mon, it's embarrassing.
Just turn it off. Please?
Thanks, dad.
I'm very grateful forthis, Dr. Hunter.
I was sure I lost you the other day.
You did.
But listen, two things:
One, it's Michael.
- Okay.
- And two.
- No promises. Just half an hour.
- It's all I ask.
We encourage the boys to take part in meal prep once a week...
...which Tommy does quite well.
Hey! That smells really good
Well, use enough garlic, everything does.
I told you about Dr. Hunter, my old professor former professor.
Excuse me.
- Hi. I'm Tommy
- Michael.
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.
I wanted to know if it's alright with you if I left you alone for while to talk?
- Yeah, sure. I'm not going anywhere.
- Okay.
Bye.
For another five and a half weeks anyway.
Mm. So I'm told... You're glad you're leaving?
Wouldrt you be?
Mm, yes, I would.
So uh... what are you then?
My final exam?
Meaning?
Well, they've thrown every other expert my way.
I figure you must be batting clean up
Uh... no, hardly.
So what's on the menu?
Uh it's a... it's kind of a stew. Some leftover meat loaf, chicken, veggies
- Do you want to taste it?
- Sure. Smells good.
It's kinda hot. There you go.
So are you thinking about this as a career?
Uhha, I dunno. It's much more stressful than people think.
Bet I'm not the first cook you've treated.
You'd be right.
But then again I'm not treating you.
We're just talking.
No one's ever just talking.
So what do you think? Is there something wrong with me?
Now ljust met you.
Do you think there's something wrong with you?
- There's one I never heard before.
- That's why I'm here.
I could go on all day.
Do you think that I think there's something wrong with you?
I think there's something wrong with everybody.
Well that's a good thing or else
I'll have to get a realjob.
And I can't cook.
It's very good.
Good.
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.
Best of luck.
- Mind if I turn the music up a little bit?
- Leave it alone, dad.
Let's talk.
I thought you were done seeing patients.
He's not a patient. He's just a kid.
Just a kid in a home for "wayward" boys, dad. Who'd he kill?
- Who'd he kill?!
- Yeah.
He didn't kill anybody...
In fact, he's got a lot more on the ball than some of those kids you know...
- Like that Troy person for instance.
- You don't even know Troy, dad.
Hence the problem.
- Has your mom met him?
- No.
Mom's a little preoccupied.
When are you gonna shave?
Why are we drifting apart?
C'mon, dad.
We're not drifting anywhere.
It's not like it used to be.
Where you've been? Look in the mirror. Nothing's like it used to be.
- So... That was...
- It was.
How sweet.
And I will see you...
- Who's this guy again?
- Brad. New partner at the firm.
So. Okay.
Pinead.
Total.
Yeah, I gotta go. Alright.
Thanks forthe car, dad.
Hey... We're not gonna kiss?
Hi, hon. How was school?
Kyle! No!!! God! No! Kyle! No!! Kyle!
Hey, dad.
I'm so sorry.
Look at you.
Ah, you're alive.
It's so beautiful in your life.
No, dad. I'm not.
You'll need a more complete profile.
So these are Tommy's session notes.
These are the police reports on the parents. Court transcripts...
You're assuming
I want to see him again.
Well, you're here today.
Today yes, but not necessarily long term.
Well, it's entirely up to you.
Just take the box. Just so you have it.
And it's good to see your face again.
That uh professorial thing was just wasrt you.
Thanks.
Goodness.
- All cleaned up.
- Yes.
- For me?
- Not quite. But close.
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.
I'd like to talk to you about your parents.
I'd rather not.
Okay. What about school?
I read yourtranscripts.
Your grades were marginal and now you're pulling straight as.
What happened?
That's it... You're okay not talking about my parents?
If you don't want to talk about 'em, we don't talk about 'em.
So tell me how did you get so smart all of a sudden?
- I dunno. I mean, I used to cut a lot.
- And go where?
Hang around. The track usually.
I'd tie up stray cats.
Watch the train roll overthem.
I'm kidding.
I knew that.
No, I guess. Ljust got more serious when I came here. You know?
I started planning for my future.
Whatever I do end up doing...
I need something normal.
- Normal? What's normal?
- I dunno.
- Ljust want to be free.
- And what does that mean to you?
Well...
Hearthat?
It sounds like that...
And it'll mean never having to answer any more questions.
I gotta go to science. See you later.
- Hi.
- What're you doing here?
That's a nice way to say hello.
You want to catch a movie, grab a burger?
I can't, dad. It's Friday night. Oh, right.
- I gotta go.
- Love you.
So what do you think?
- Looks okay... I'll call you.
- Okay.
Bye.
Big rave at the Railyard tonight,
Tommy.
Are you interested?
Alright, man.
Okay. Let's go.
Paul! Hey!
Paul! Hey, Paul! Oh, shit!
You're not Paul.
No. I'm sorry, I'm not.
Fuck. And he's the one holding.
You're not holding and GHB, are ya'?
Shrooms? Nitrous?
No sorry. I'm... I'm fresh out.
If I werert rolling on Ex already,
I'd be pretty pissed...
Plus I uh... I lost my belly ring.
Do you wanna help me look for it?
- So what's your name?
- I'm Tommy.
I'm Chloe.
So you really never done Ecstasy?
No. I'm... I'm not into drugs.
Oh man, it's like - it's like waves going through you. All warm and fuzzy.
And with sex, it's even better.
Are you blushing?
Cool. It makes you want to touch too.
Everyone. Everything.
It alljust feels so good.
- Is your ring back here somewhere?
- Why... it kinda fell down here.
Oh, we...
We should get back to the rave. Right?
What do you mean?
Hey... think, I'm gonna ljust wanna go back.
Wait! Wait! Am I being too vague here?
I don't want to. Okay?
You don't want me!
I mean, it's - it's not you. I...
You know how many guys in there would jump at this? Hey...
Come on...
- Check out all the hotties!
- What?!
- A lot of hotties!
- Alright. Go for it. I'm gonna find Troy.
Hey! Troy!
Troy!
Fuck you!
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Your Dr. Hunter's daughter, right?
- And you his new patient?
Am I? For some reason he won't call me that.
Yeah, he's weird. See ya'.
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Hey! Can you give me a ride home?
- We just got here. You find Troy?
- Please, I can't stay here, you guys.
- Shill out, Shel. We just got here.
- Hey, can you give me a ride home?
- I don't have a car. But I'll walk ya'.
- Uh, it's really, really far.
- I don't care.
Shelly! Shel!
I'm sorry. I'm the one fucked up, Shel.
I'm a little drunk.
I thought that girl was you. Please.
I swear on my fucking mother!
- Hey man, you shouldn't do that!
- Who the hell are you?
He's taking Shelly home.
- Oh you think so?
- Absolutely.
- Bullshit, homes.
- Stop it, Troy! You're drunk.
- Fuck him! I'll kill this freak!
- Stop it!
- I'll kill this freak!
- Stop it!
- You watch your back, pal.
- I will. Come on.
So Friday night?
No lucky lady... out there?
No? Who am I! Why not?
- Okay. Enough said.
- Well...
So have you yourself been in therapy at all since your son died?
No.
I can't imagine what you've been through.
Yeah, well... It's okay.
- So why do you do that?
- Do what?
I've mentioned your son twice and you said "It's okay."...
...like you're comforting me or... or shutting me up.
You don't miss a trick, do you?
What are you afraid I'll say?
I'm afraid you'll say... that my son is in a better place.
Or... at least I have my daughter left.
People actually say that to you?
Not since I learned to say "It's okay."
My dad would go postal if he knew that I was with you...
He's always going on and on about professional boundaries.
So you trust me?
Well, I dunno.
- My dad likes you.
- He does?
- So that... school that you're in...
- It's a home. You can say it.
Well don't you have a curfew or something?
Yeah... but they trust me.
I'll be gone, free in a month and a half anyway. Out on my own.
- Ah, so you have to be nice to me.
- Why?
'Cause if you're not, my dad won't let you out.
Don't say that. Okay?
I was just kidding. My dad couldn't keep you in there even if he wanted.
Yeah, he could! He could keep me there! In fact, that's why he's there.
- And I'm not staying, Shelly.
- Yeah, okay.
I'm not.
Uh... it was a stupid joke.
Don't worry. My dad really likes you.
It's o... it's okay. I'm sorry too.
C'mon.
She does your daughter live with you?
No. She lives with her mother.
But uh... she's what's kept me from going back to Philly.
Daddies and daughters, huh?
- Mm. She hates us both.
- Oh... I'm sure she doesn't hate you.
Well, she's angry. I know that.
Ever since what happened to Kyle.
Her mom and I have been so caught up with one anotherthat...
...she sort of got lost in the middle.
- You and your wife blamed each other.
- No. She blamed me. And so did I.
But you don't anymore. I hope.
Michael? You know better.
Suicide is a self-motivated act.
You taught us that.
- Nobody else can... make you do it.
- I'd like to stay focused on Tommy.
- Okay?
- Okay.
What's wrong?
It's my old house.
Six realtors in two years.
Why hasn't it sold?
Can I see it?
Why?
You don't want to?
- Sure. Why not?
- Cool.
- How did you do that?
- My brother rigged it a long time ago.
He was always locking himself out.
This was the dinning room.
There was a... big table there.
And this was the living room.
There was a couch right there and a... coffee table.
There was a big mirror right here.
And there's the bathroom down there.
What's up here?
- That's my brother old room.
- Yeah? Older or younger?
Uh neither. He's dead.
He killed himself in the garage.
How?
Carbon monoxide... In the family van.
They say it's like falling asleep.
Yep. A fistful of my mom's valium saw to that.
What was he like?
Uh... oh God...
All these marks.
My brother always had this handball.
He was always throwing it around.
Drive my mom nuts.
How about your dad?
Oh, he loved it.
They always played together.
Even my parents blame themselves.
Do you?
Pff. No, I wouldn't give them the satisfaction.
I always thought it was my fault.
I could've stopped 'im...
I knew ah...
He was hurting. We all knew it.
My dad knew it. He tried to send him to therapy. But it didn't work.
It just got worse. If you could've heard how I talked to him.
God I was sitting right there next to him.
And all I cared about it was my self... and my stupid show.
Ljust miss him so much.
I'm sorry. I don't really want to talk about it.
We should go.
So what did your father do for a living?
He was a salesman... restaurant supplies.
Are you okay to talk about 'im?
Not really, but... I figured there's no harm in being cooperative.
Oh I appreciate that.
What're you looking for?
Oh, it's in here somewhere.
I know it. Ah. There it is.
I used to play all the time.
What'd' you say?
Show me your best game.
It's pretty good.
How about overthere?
Very nice.
Keep it moving.
That's you getting that one.
Oh!!!
What're you talking about?
Three to one? You didn't score.
- Of course, I scored.
- No, you didn't. I'm gonna serve.
What was that?
C'mon, Kyle.
Oh! Oh! What was that?
I didn't see that.
I should've had it. I think it's the shoes.
Yeah, that's right.
Blame the shoes, dad.
C'mon. Let's go. Are you tired?
What? C'mon. Let's go!
C'mon. Throw the ball.
C'mon.
One more.
Good game. Very nice. Very nice.
Lucky.
Do you ever dream about your parents?
Do I ever dream about my parents, huh? There's a new one.
Dreams have meaning.
It's your subconscious trying to resolve the unresolved issues.
No. I don't dream. Not about them.
Okay. What do you dream about?
- Do you?
- Do I what?
Dream about your son?
- How do you know about him?
- I don't.
Ljust know he's dead... I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Tell me about your parents...
What about their marriage?
- I think you know about that.
- Well, I know how it ended.
But there must have been some good times.
The moments of affection between them... Love.
- I know it's hard to talk about this.
- You don't know anything. Okay?
Enlighten me then.
How did it feel in that day when you came home?
How do you think it felt?
Put it in words.
I really don't want to...
I'm fine. Okay?
- I don't wanna play anymore.
- We're not playing.
And if you really want to be free in a month, really free, inside...
- We better deal with this.
- You'd keep me here like I'm crazy?
That's not what I said.
I'm just concerned that when you go out there in the world.
I don't want that past screwing up your future.
When I'm out in the real world, the past won't matter anymore. Okay?
I hope that's true. So prove it to me...
Prove it to me that you've made peace with your past... with what happened.
Talk to me.
Don't look down. Look at me.
Let it out. Put a sound to it.
Talk to me. Why can't you talk to me?
Please?
Okay.
But just not now.
Okay.
Not right now.
- Why?
- Just...
Next time.
Okay. Next time.
Okay.
Just back off!
He nearly cried? Are you serious?
What was it about? His mother?
Father? Tell me what did it.
I barely scratched the surface.
Well it's never been scratched before.
You know, it wouldn't hurt you to celebrate the small victories, Michael.
- Can you keep him here?
- Well, this is a boys school.
We would have to transfer him to our adult facility. Why?
Do you think we should keep him?
Can you? I mean do you have the authority to keep him here?
Ah, technically.
I mean we can't chain him down.
But if he asks for his files, er... reference letters, than yeah.
The state considers me his guardian.
So I would have to sign his official release.
Did he ever mention to you about my son?
I would never betray that confidence, Michael.
How about this?
He said he used to play all the time.
What are you getting at?
And my son... he used to play all the time.
So you're saying he reminds you of your son?
Michael?
Michael?
- Shelly? Get in.
- I'm not talking to you.
Don't play these games.
It's not a game.
I'm over you. We move on.
- You're over me?
- Yeep.
Don't walk away when I'm talking to you.
- Okay. We're not done.
- Will you knock it off?
We're gonna go for a ride.
I need to talk to you, Shelly.
- I'm not going anywhere!
- I need to talk to you, Shelly.
I don't want to...
She said no.
Fuck! Let go of it! Aw! Just.
Okay! Just let go of it!
Fuck! Fuck!
Mom!
Mom!
- Nice house.
- Yeah, I guess...
- You want something to drink?
- Yeah... Sure.
You don't think he's gonna... like report me?
- Who? Troy?
- Yeah.
No. He wouldn't talk to the cops or anything.
He's got a suspended license.
Got a DUI.
The cops are the last people he wants to talk to.
Oklahoma Police have discovered the body of 20-year-old, Chloe Fryman...
Oh, my God! I know that girl!
She went to my school.
...in an empty freight car, which was then traced back here to the local...
...Lawrence Railyard. A spokesperson forthe police indicated they suspect...
...foul play although as yet have no leads in the case.
This is Melissa Gleason reporting live from the Lawrence Railways.
- Back to you, Larry.
- Thank you, Melissa.
Oh, my God! That's so scary.
Are you okay?
Ljust...
Yeah, I know. That's awful.
The Railyard? She must have been at the Rave last week.
We were right there.
Yeah, we were.
You want some more? It's good, huh?
Oh shoo!
- God! You scared me!
- Sorry. I didn't mean to.
- No. It's okay. It was an accident.
- I should go.
No! Wait!
Tommy? What is it?
Nothing. Ljust... ljust can't blow my chances of getting out of Holly Hills right now.
'Cause of Troy?
Come on, I'll vouch for you.
You were protecting me.
And thank you.
You're welcome.
Don't worry whether you might have broken curfew, gentlemen.
If you were out after hourthat night, you'll face no discipline.
Just a few questions.
Three Fridays ago... Lawrence
Railyard... the old chemical plant...
One of those big "Rave" parties.
The place to be apparently...
I'll be leaving a number you can call...
Strictly confidential.
And you just might be helping us catch a murderer. Thank you for yourtime.
Please understand, Mr. Caffey. I'm not here to open up any old wounds or...
Or condemn you in any way.
- How is he?
- He's doing well...
I brought you a picture.
Yeah, when they told me you were coming...
...I half-wondered if he'd be here with you.
No he's not here. But he is eligible to be out in three weeks.
- In the kitchen.
- He's a very good cook.
Yes, Diana's influence.
I'm hoping you might let me some insight...
Into something that
I might not already now.
Such as?
- Well, he's very bright.
- He's too bright for his own good.
Did you discipline him?
When he needed it.
And your wife? Would she?
Pff. Please. All hugs and kisses, that woman. Not to me, of course.
Yes, I read your court transcripts.
Your defence. The other man.
Crime of passion.
Yeah. Let me ask you. How would you feel? I came home early.
Had a shitty day at work.
Not one lead, Di.
Not one stinkir lead all week...
Hey...
You're home early.
Jo!
I was napping. You startled me.
I went to the window and there he was.
Half-naked son of a bitch running through the yard behind the house...
And that's when I lost it.
No!
What have you done!
Jesus.
Now, if that's not temporary insanity, what the hell is? Pff.
Not that it matters now anyway.
What about Tommy when he came home?
Tommy was at school.
He didn't see anything.
Just the result.
Yeah...
I guess that's the worst part.
As they were leading me away, there he was.
That's the last time I ever saw him.
'Til now.
Hey look um... are we finished here?
Is there something else you want to share with me?
Tell him not to come... when he gets out.
Tell him I don't want to see him anymore.
Tell him to stay away.
You tell him that, okay?
You had no right going there.
That guy's got nothing to do with me.
He's your father and he cares about you.
He doesn't care. What's he saying now? That he's innocent?
No, he's owning up to what he did.
I'd need to ask you a question.
Did you see your father kill your mother?
- What the hell kind of question is that?
- A simple question. Just answer.
- Did he say I did?
- No, he said you were at school.
I was in school.
Because you always told me you cut class?
Did you cut class that day?
No. But... even if I had I would've been at the railroad tracks.
So either way I wasrt there.
Okay...
You're not gonna like this next question.
Stop.
I know what you're gonna say.
There was no other man.
You're pointing a knife at me, Tommy.
Tommy... Don't point a knife at me.
My mom would never do that... No way.
- You seem very sure.
- I am sure.
Did you know that the autopsy report showed evidence...
...of recent sexual activity?
Why are you doing this?
What're you doing?
That's my mom you're talking about for God's sakes!
I mean what d'you want, huh?
What d'you want?
What I want from you?
We need to talk about this, Tommy.
You agreed to talk about it.
We're gonna talk about it.
Okay, I know this is painful and I'm sorry. But we need to talk about this.
So tell me: How did it feel that day?
How did it feel on that day? My dad came home and they got in a fight.
Okay, he killed her.
And now he's saying that she was some kind of slut, just so that he can get off.
- How does that make you feel?
- How does that make you feel?
- How does that make you feel?
- Like that?!!!
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah. You're happy about this?
I'm sick of it!
Bullshit!!!
I'm getting out of here!
Let it out! Let it out!
No! Let it go!
- No! Let go of me!
- Let it out! Let it out! Let it out!
It's okay. It's okay, Kyle.
I got you, Kyle.
Kyle? KYLE! Let go of me!
- I'm not your son.
- I'm sorry.
Tommy. Tommy, that's not what I meant.
No, don't. I'm not your son. Okay?
I know that.
I blew it.
It wasrt my fault.
Go on.
Go on.
Go on. Say it. Say: It wasrt your fault.
Come on. They all do... Come on.
It wasrt my fault!!!
What happened to my mother had nothing at all to do with me!!!!
Say it!
Okay, Tom.
And there was no other man.
There was no other man.
Right.
- I think we're done here.
- Right. Yeah, we're done.
Sorry.
Shit...
Anothertwo weeks and I'm history...
But I got to go out by their rules, you know? Like a regular person.
But you're not... like a regular person.
You're like... nobody I've ever met. You...
You talk to me... and you listen to me...
You don't pressure me...
You don't ask me questions.
- What?
- About me...
You're the only person I know who's not always poking around at my past.
Well, if there's anything you wanted me to know, you would tell me, right?
Don't.
- What?
- I'm sorry.
I gotta go.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh... I couldn't find your number.
- Did I get here at a bad time?
- Not at all. Come in.
- Are you sure it's okay?
- Absolutely.
- Ah, it's very nice.
- Thank you.
Sit. Can I get you anything?
A drink or something?
No. No. I think I'm um... pushing the legal limit as it is.
Well... I don't who to worry about more these days, Michael. You or Tommy?
Oh, please, tell me you saw me coming.
Nah. I was just flipping through for clues perhaps. 'Cause uh...
For being such a master of the human condition, you're not very...
...forthcoming about your own.
I don't actually walk my talk, do I?
I wrote this uh... not long after Kyle...
And yet he's not in it at all.
You don't mention him once.
To me, he's on every page.
You asked me uh... the other day if Tommy reminds me... of Kyle...
Yeah, he does, doesn't he?
At times, he is Kyle.
That's not uncommon, Michael.
You know that?
I know it's strange but this is just something else...
There's something in his tone...
In his gestures.
I... I held him and I felt Kyle...
And his eyes...
Those, those are... those are his eyes.
I'm losing it.
No, you're not, Michael...
You just miss your son.
Okay. It's late. You're tired.
- Oh, please.
- Up you go. No.
- Oh, come on, Barbara.
- You stay here and relax.
No, I'm okay. Really. No, no, I'm okay.
No. I know you're okay, but you stay here.
No. What're you doing?
I feel ridiculous.
- No. You don't feel ridiculous.
- Come on. Please?
Just relax. Alright? Sleep here tonight.
It's fine. You're tired. Get some sleep.
Thank you.
Tommy, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- It's just that I like you so much.
- Shelly, don't.
- I love you, Tommy. I love you.
- Shelly, no. Shelly!
Ljust want to be with you.
No!
I said: No!!!
I want to tell you something,
Mr. Caffey.
Is Tommy okay?
It's not about him. Well, it is, but indirectly about him.
It's really more about me. About us.
What about us?
Nobody knows about this.
Not my ex-wife. Not my daughter.
What're you talking about?
We have something in common,
Mr. Caffey...
In fact, we're not very different at all. You see...
I had a son of my own.
He was a happy kid. Loyal and respectful. When he reached puberty...
...he kinda took a form of depression.
And my wife, she wanted him to start medication but me...
I insisted that he go into therapy with my...
With my college buddy named Harry Quinlan.
My friend. Someone... that I trusted...
A few months went by and Kyle seemed a little better.
And good old Harry, he told us to... to be patient.
To keep the faith.
And I kept the faith until my son,
Kyle, took his own life.
A couple of days afterthe funeral,
I found Kyle's farewell letterto me...
...explaining the shame that he felt about his "special friendship"...
...with Harry Quinlan. And how much that was too much to bear for him.
And how he couldn't keep the secret anymore.
And how he couldn't stand feeling...
Dirty...
Harry Quinlan was molesting my son.
The fucking animal was molesting my son.
And my sixteen-year-old boy could not find any other way to rid himself...
Of the pain.
I went to a gun shop, but there was a waiting period.
So I went straight to Harry Quinlars house, because I wanted him dead.
Harry!!! Harry!!! Harry!!!
Get out of there, fuck!
Open the door, Harry!!!!
Open the door right now, you piece of shit!!!
Harry, open the door!!
Harry, you fuck!!
Open the door, Harry!!!
Way to go, Harry!!
Harry, look at me!!!
Look at me!!
Harry!! Harry!!!
That was my boy!!
Harry!! My little boy!!!
You fucking animal!!!
What're you gonna do with that, Harry??
Open the door, you piece of shit!!!
Go! Go ahead!
Shoot me! Shoot me!
He was my little boy, Harry!!
It was my little boy, you fucking animal!!! Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do it!
You know what separates us,
Mr. Caffey?
Not sanity. Not rational thought.
Just luck. Just dumb fucking luck.
Ljust wanted you to know that.
It was Tommy.
What?
It was Tommy.
If you repeat this, I will deny it.
Like I have been and I always will.
To my grave.
Do you understand?
I came home that... that day and uh there was some... weird stuff going on.
That's it. You'll talk to him.
Well if you're not pressing charges, Mr.
Pasternak. You won't talk to the police.
Because I'm talking to you.
Well then, let's get Tommy down here.
Get his side of it, shall we?
So he can break my other arm? No.
He's crazy. I don't want to see him.
Fine. I will talk to him.
Now you go home.
I'll call you. I got your number.
Thank you.
Raymond, please, Raymond.
Watch where you're going, Ray-mond.
I want you to go find Tommy and ask him to come down here, please?
- Okay.
- Alright.
Hey, Caffey?
You know that guy?
How you're doing, son?
I'm Detective Hannah and this is my partner.
He's just talked to Barbara about you...
He sounded pretty pissed.
What happened to your hand?
Why are the cops here again?
Yeah well, they probably want to fingerprint us now.
They need a suspect bad enough, they come straight to Holly Hills.
Anyway, Barbara wanted to see you and she did not look happy.
- He's not in the kitchen.
- I'm telling you, Michael.
He's not on campus.
Alright. Even if he thought he was in trouble, he would not run away.
We can't let him go. He has to stay here indefinitely. Continued therapy.
How can he manage to hide that all these years?
- And to seem so calm and unaffected?
- He's not hiding it.
It's repressed so deeply, it never even happened as far as he's concerned.
Now who's this kid with a busted hand?
He's Troy Pasternak.
He said that he and Tommy got into it over some girl.
- Troy?
- Yeah, why?
Who's the girl?
He didn't say. Just uh that Tommy has stolen her from him.
I'll call you later.
- You don't lock this?
- Michael? What're you doing?
- Where is she?
- Shelly?
Yeah. Shelly. Your daughter.
Where is she?
- Michael?
- Is she in her room?
Michael!!
- You know where he is?
- Who?
You know who.
Tommy Caffey. My patient!!!
- You said he wasrt your patient.
- Don't be a smart-ass with me.
I didn't think you'd care!
So you chose not to tell me about him!
'Cause I knew you would react like this.
Then you shouldn't have done it to begin with!
You know nothing about him!
You don't know him, Shelly!
- I know him betterthan you do.
- What is that supposed to mean?
No. Not like that! God! You see now how everybody thinks!
He's my friend, dad. We talk.
- You talk.
- Yeah.
Did you talk to him about us?
About our family?
Did you talk to him about Kyle??
And about how Kyle died?
Did you talk to him about
Kyle playing handball?
- Maybe. I don't know. I went by the...
- There is no maybe. Yes or no??
I don't know. We went by the old house one time and I might've said something
Our house!!
You took him to our house!!!
Inside our house!!!
- Michael, get out.
- Do you know about his kid?
- What kid?
- What kid?
- What kid?
- Stop yelling.
Where is he now?
Because he not at the home.
- Michael.
- I don't know.
- Shelly.
- I don't know.
You do not see him again.
You understand me?
- Dad, you can't tell me...
- You do not see him!!!
I'm your father. I tell you what I want.
- I'm calling Brad.
- Stay home! Keep her here!
He... You can't tell me what to do, dad!
It's not fair.
Tommy cares about me. He cares more than any of you ever have!
Just go, Michael. Go!
Just keep her here.
Anything?
No. I've been all overtown.
Every place I could think he'd be.
His clothes are still here.
He's gonna come back, Michael.
I know it.
And uh Holly Hills will call as soon as he shows up.
Um, if it'll make you feel any better... I'll come, okay?
I let him manipulate me, Barbara.
Using my own daughter. And my son.
You were his last hurdle, Michael.
I'm sure he was thinking that any favourable comparison between he...
...and Kyle would work in his favour.
Here's a car. I'll call you back.
Michael...
- You on night watch, doc?
- Just waiting for someone.
Good.
D'you know what room I might find... uh Thomas Caffey in?
He's the one I'm waiting for.
We think he might have run away.
He's the only boy I didn't get a chance to talk to today.
- You'll call me when he gets in?
- Sure.
- Thanks. Take care.
- Likewise.
- Tommy?!
- Don't be mad. Okay?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. Come on in.
Okay. Hey, it's Michael.
Are you there?
- No, no, no. Don't answer it. Please?
- Barbara?
- Ljust want to talk.
- Okay.
Barbara?
Okay. Call me back
as soon as you can.
- Is he mad at me?
- Why would he be mad at you?
Because of you and Shelly.
- He knows about that?
- Yes. Where have you been, Tommy?
Shit!
Okay, first of all, Shelly's a really nice girl. Okay? And...
And I didn't crush that kid's hand.
You got to believe me on that.
- Well, that's no reason to disappear.
- I know.
- I got scared.
- Scared of what?
I'm leaving Holly house, Barbara.
I can't wait anymore.
This is something we can discuss in the morning, Tommy, at Holly Hills.
No more discussions...
No more talks... I'm leaving tonight.
Okay, Tommy. Well... when I'll call Dr. Hunter...
No, no.
You don't need to do that, okay?
How long have I known you?
I've done everything that you asked me to. Everything.
Now, ljust want what's coming to me.
I mean, what's one and a half weeks?
Just sign my papers and release me.
Tommy, you've been making some real breakthroughs...
- Yeah and that's a good thing.
- Yes, it's a very good thing.
And Dr. Hunter just we believe that you would benefit...
No! No!
No, I'm not staying here!
You're not keeping me here!
You might benefit from some more counselling, Tommy. That's all.
- Is this because of Shelly?
- No, it's not because of Shelly.
- Because it's punishment.
- It's not punishment.
Dr. Hunter... went to see your father again today.
And we know the truth, Tommy.
About your mother.
Tommy?
Tommy, don't...
Tommy?
Tommy, please, you just you just...
- You just have to trust me. Okay?
- It's a lie!!!
- A lie!
- No!
No, please!
Shut up!
No!
No!
Barbara?
Barbara?
Operator, I'm trying to make a call at 324-8962. I can't get through.
Barbara?
- What d'you mean off the hook?
- It must be off the hook, sir.
What're you doing here?
You shouldn't be in here, son.
You shouldn't be in here.
You shouldn't be in here!
Who let this kid in here!?
How'd this kid get in here?
Barbara?
Barbara?
Is she okay?
Call the police!! Call the police now!!!
Call an ambulance!!!
Call an ambulance!!!!
Okay. Okay. I got you.
Tommy... Come around back.
- Hey, where have you been?
- Where's your mom?
She's upstairs with Brad.
My dad knows about us.
I know.
Look I'm leaving tonight, okay?
Why?
- It's not the way that I wanted it.
- I'm going with you.
Hold on, hold on.
She wants to say something.
What, Baby? What? What?
I shouldn't have said, shouldn't have said...
You... you shouldn't have said what?
Mother...
About the mother? It's okay.
Shelly... Shelly...
Shelly?
- Michael, calm down, calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down!!!
This kid is dangerous.
Now listen to me.
What are you talking about?
Dangerous?
You get Shelly out of the house.
I'm on my way.
Shelly?
Shelly, where are you??
- Wait. Isn't this Troy's car?
- We made a deal. Get in.
Shelly!
Shelly! No!
You now listen to me! Shelly!
Shelly!
Michael! Michael!
He's... that was them! He's got her.
He's got her, Michael.
Call the police! GO!
I don't understand. Why would
Troy let you borrow his car?
No more questions, okay?
Just... just don't talk.
- I'm thinkir.
- Sorry.
I'm just scared, Tommy.
Yeah, me too.
Shit! That's my dad.
He's not gonna keep me here.
Shit!
Shelly!
C'mon!
Shelly!
- Freeze!
- Shelly!
- C'mon!
- I'm said freeze!

Put your gun down! Put it down!
Don't point the gun at me!
Tommy, put the gun down!
Tell him to put it down!
Put the gun down! Put the gun down!
Put that gun down. Tommy... Tommy...
Tommy...
Tommy, let me help you.
You don't want to help me.
You just want to keep me here!
Tommy, don't hurt her, please?
- Hurt her?
- Dad, he's not gonna hurt me.
I'd never hurt her. Never!
Tommy, you know you can't keep that promise.
- You shut up!
- You know that.
- Shut up!
- Tommy!
- Shelly hates you!
- I know that.
I know that she hates me.
And I don't blame her forthat.
It's not her fault. It's my fault.
I know I let you down, baby.
I know when your brother died...
I know I wasrt there for you. It's like you were starting a whole new life...
...and I wasrt even there for you.
But I have to make that up to you.
I need to make that up to you.
Please, give me that chance?
Tommy...
Please... Tommy, give me that chance.
The same chance that I want to give you.
Please? Just let her go.
And me and you can work this thing out.
This is my baby.
You... you... You know, without you I got nothing left.
I'm sorry, Tommy. I have to go.
Dad... Dad...
Over here. Stay back. It's okay.
I got 'im. Don't shoot! Just don't shoot.
He's got nowhere to go, doc.
Don't shoot!
Tommy... Tommy...
- You got no where to go, Tom.
- What do you want from me?
- I want to help you.
- Why can't you just let me go???
Because I want to help you.
I can't let you go and you know why.
Let me help you.
Talk to me.
What did my fathertell you?
- He told me about your mother.
- You shut up about her! She loved me.
- She loved you very much.
- Yeah.
He... he wasrt supposed to be there.
Not one lead, Di.
Not one stinkir lead all week...
Closet. Get to the closet.
Get in the closet.
He was so angry.
Who was he angry at?
At me!!
He was angry at me!!
You!!!
You!!!
My mommy loved me!
She didn't love him!
And hehe hit and he hit her!
Ljust wanted him to stop.
What have you done??
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop hitting my mother!
You stop it!
Stop!
You were a little boy, Tommy.
You couldn't stop either one.
Yes, I could. I could've stopped him.
- It wasrt your fault.
- You're wrong.
- It wasrt your fault.
- You're wrong.
- It was not your fault.
- He killed her because of me.
- It was not your fault.
- Yes, it was my fault!!!
It was not!!!
I can help you now, Tom.
I can help you now.
Please let me help you.

Dad!
How we're doing today?
Perfect...
How's Shelly?
She's doing fine.
How's Barbara?
She's fine.
Let's just concentrate on you today, okay?
Why? You're gonna rehabilitate me?
You're gonna make me free, doc?
- There's all kinds of freedom.
- Not the kind that I want.
But there's a kind that everybody needs.
The kind that's inside.
Inside here.
I'm not your son.
Now I know that.
Now let's see your best game.
Good point.
Oh, lucky shot.
Nice.
- You serve?
- Okay...
Mike, keep up! Watch it! Oh!
You've been practicing, huh?
Ah... Nice...
The princess nodded, and the frog said,
"That which you have promised, you must perform."
Very good. Keep reading.
"So the princess leaned in and kissed the frog,"
"but as she did, he became a handsome prince,"
"and they rode off to his kingdom,"
"where they lived happily ever after."
Happily ever after.
There's no such thing as "happily ever after."
Not for a real princess.
The prince my father wants me to marry will always be a frog.
My offer still stands.
I will help you get to America.
- America?
- That's very kind.
But we're running out of time.
I know of a ship bound for America, but we must leave tonight.
- Leave tonight?
- We must hurry, Princess.
Hurry, Princess.
Mung Goo Hi.
Zhou Hei.
Chow Lu.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's it.
Okay. Great. Great. Okay.
Come here. Look at this.
Spent a lot of time on this.
Now, pay attention,
'cause I don't want any mistakes.
Now, I've calculated the speed of the train and the speed of our horses.
We meet at this vector.
The only variable is the wind.
Technically, if you travel over here on the horses...
Is this the train?
All right. We're just gonna wing it, like we always do.
Ride down, jump on the train, hoorah the money, head back to the cathouse, all right?
Let's go. Come on. Move out. Go!
You okay? Nervous? It's all right to be nervous when you're new.
You'll be okay. I'll keep an eye on you.
All you gotta do is follow my lead.
All right, look alive, outlaws!
"So the princess leaned in and kissed the frog,"
"but as she did, he became a handsome prince,"
"and they rode off to his kingdom,"
"where they lived happily ever after."
Reach for the sky, ladies and gentlemen!
Touch that gun and I'll blow your goddamn head off!
What are you doin'?
I sorta like to be the only guy that talks, Wallace.
- All right. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. That's okay. Good.
Don't worry. Come on, come on.
Big 'Un, let's go.
Why is the new guy talking?
Where did you get this guy?
You know I'm the only one who talks.
Okay, everybody keep calm.
You think you're gonna shoot me? Is that right?
What you got right in here?
Yeah, you got this gun?
You think you're gonna do something with that gun?
Come on, lady bird.
You got anything besides yarn?
- You got it out for me!
- Hey!
No.
Come here. Come here.
We don't steal from women.
Get over here. Take that side.
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.
I'm so sorry about that. I apologize.
First time you've seen an outlaw?
Scared? Kind of excited, too?
All mixed up? Yeah.
Last train we robbed, we were naked, it was so hot out.
That was somethin'.
Yeah, it's got my initials right there.
What are you lookin' at?
Wait! Stop! Where did you get this guy?
- Texas.
- Texas? Are you insane?
Just shoot me now, 'cause I don't understand what we're doing here.
Sir, sir, sir, sir. Come here, come here, come here. Sit down.
- Excuse me.
- Sir, sit down.
What happened?
- Wallace, what are you doing?
- I'm just wingin' it.
No! That's not how we wing it!
No more winging it!
Stop! Come on, Big 'Un.
You've lost your "winging it" privileges.
Damn.
Damn!
Who killed my uncle? Who did this?
Give me the dynamite.
Give me the dynamite.
No, no, no, no. You stay here.
You don't get to come.
- Keep an eye on wing nut.
- Hey, Blue, looky here!
Okay.
Who killed my uncle?
What in the hell is this, the Orient Express?
- Get him!
- Come here!
What? Hey!
The safe's getting ready to blow!
Get ready to reap the fruits of our labor.
Move it! Let's go!
Roy, you just blew the shit out of our fruits.
Oh, shit.
We got a Chinaman to catch.
Stop! Stop!
Stop! Stop! Turn around!
Turn around!
What the...
- Who are you?
- Hey, Roy!
- Don't you worry about a thing!
- I got you covered!
No! No!
Roll, baby, roll!
Reach for the sky,
O'Bannon! It's my gang now!
I don't understand.
You said your friend had a large estate.
He does.
- What exactly does he do?
- Well, you could say he's a philanthropist.
He helps Chinese immigrants get back on their feet.
Welcome to America, Princess.
Lo Fong.
Forgive me if I do not bow.
Calvin, this man is a trai...
Traitor.
Why? Because he ran away from the Forbidden City?
Your reward is on the table,
Mr. Andrews.
Well, now you're gonna have to double it, or I'm gonna kill her.
One thing about the Chinese,
Mr. Andrews...
We do not renegotiate.
Whatever you think
I'm going to do for you, you're wrong.
It was just like a nightmare.
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.
My gang left me in the desert.
I felt like all the other cowboys hated my guts.
Everyone was... I just missed you.
I missed all of you.
We missed you, too, Roy.
I think it's medication time.
Come here, devil woman.
That's naughty.
Careful. Careful with that.
Careful.
Holy crap!
The vultures are eating my head!
Help! Help! My gang buried me!
They left me for dead!
Thank heavens.
I thought you were a mirage.
- Oh, come on. Water.
- You.
- You killed my uncle!
- Bull!
That was Wallace all the way.
- He was one of your bandits.
- He wasn't part of my gang.
He was a new guy.
He's crazy as a road lizard.
- You deserve to die.
- Hold on a second.
You know what no one's saying here?
I had a chance to kill you on that train, and I chose not to.
'Cause I'm not a barbarian.
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Carson City.
I'm closer to diggin' myself to China than you are to gettin' to Carson City.
- Hey!
- Which way?
Hey, that's better.
Dig me out and I'll show you.
Which way?
You see the mountains over there?
Carson City is on the other side.
All right, dig me out.
I kept my end of the bargain.
Dig me out.
Dig.
Hey! Hey!
- Come on!
- Don't talk. Just dig.
Hey!
Where is Carson City?
- How.
- How.
- How.
- How.
- How. How. How. How.
- How.
I thought you might be hungry.
You were wrong.
You would find me a much better host if we could come to some sort of an arrangement.
An arrangement?
Like the one you have with the slaves working on this rail road?
These people are free to leave.
What do you want with me?
Once I have the emperor's gold, my work will be complete.
Princess.
I think it is time for you to be among your people.
They don't look like any lnjuns
I ever seen, Jedediah.
That's because they're not lnjuns, woman!
They're Jews!
You, stay.
Fellas, get a load of this.
How.
Is this Carson City?
No, this ain't Carson City, Chief.
You're gonna have to get your firewater somewhere else.
All right, Roy, ante up.
And stay out!
You bounce back fast, kimosabe.
What are you doin' here? I thought you were going to Carson City.
You! You gave me bad directions!
No, I gave you wrong directions.
You want your toothpicks back?
You got a lot of nerve, comin' in here with that...
Give it back to me!
Ain't that somethin'?
Take your hand off me.
Hey, I just want to go to Carson City!
You're goin' for a ride!
No!
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
No! No!
Sorry! I'm sorry!
You!
- Who in the hell started this?
- The Chinaman.
Let me out! Give me the book back!
I have to go to Carson City to rescue the princess!
You've got the wrong person!
I don't belong here!
Hey!
Keep goin' with the Chinese.
That's workin'.
They're about to let you out.
Give me the book back!
For cryin' out loud, just give him the book back, please.
If it'll give us some peace and quiet...
- Open it up!
- Forget about it.
They're not givin' you the book back.
- Drop the book.
- I wasted enough time with you.
What? You've wasted enough time with me?
- What about me?
- Give me the book!
- Listen for a second. Stop!
- Give me the book! Hey!
Listen! Stop!
You're not in the East, okay?
You're not in China. This is the West.
The sun doesn't rise here, it sets here, and you're closer to getting us hung than you are getting that book back, okay?
Now, just... I like that.
That's what I'm talking about.
You're wound so tight.
You're the most irritable guy I've ever been around. Just relax for a second.
Take ten minutes, and then you can go back to screaming, I promise.
I'll join you.
Okay, just relax for a second.
Come on, sit down.
Come on.
Just relax.
Is that relaxed?
You look sort of rigid there.
You know what?
We got off on the wrong foot.
Let's try to start again.
Man, you sure can fight.
I've never seen anything like that.
It was...
I'm trying to give you a compliment.
You're not still mad about me pointin' you in the wrong direction, are you?
Come on. You gotta be able to laugh at stuff like that.
Like me in the desert.
I don't hold any grudges.
I laugh about it.
I'm not angry at you. You just left me there with chopsticks to die.
Roy, all by his lonesome. Just me and the buzzards pic: Kin' at my head.
You're a very silent man, aren't you?
You weren't expecting to see old Roy in that bar, were you?
Be honest. Were you?
Did you really use those chopsticks?
You better believe it.
Now you laugh. That's funny.
I gotta remember that one.
So, who are you?
I'm Imperial Guard to the Emperor of China.
China.
- What's with the book?
- The book belongs to Princess Pei Pei.
- Who?
- Princess Pei Pei.
She was kidnapped from the Forbidden City.
Forbidden City?
I like that, the Forbidden City.
A princess kidnapped.
It's so mysterious. Oh, go ahead.
The emperor sent us to get her back.
Us? You mean your friends from the train?
They are also Imperial Guards.
They have four days to bring the gold to Carson City.
- What gold?
- The gold for the princess.
The gold... Was the gold on the train?
Yes.
How much gold?
One hundred thousand pieces.
Sir? Sir?
Could you hand us that book, please?
Sir, there's been a mistake. He has...
Sir... Yeah.
We're gonna get that book, and we're gonna get you out of here.
- You help me escape?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Why? I'm gonna tell you why.
Because there are some things in this world that are just wrong, and stealing a princess is one of them.
Yeah. That's wrong.
I'll tell you another thing.
I feel guilty about leading you up that mountain.
What was I thinking?
How much time did we waste there?
That was stupid.
It wasn't funny. All right?
Now, sit tight and let me figure this out.
All right, come on, Roy.
Maybe... Maybe I pretend to be sick, then attack the guards when they come in.
Okay, you mean the sick prisoner routine?
Yeah. Does that still work in China?
'Cause here it's sorta been done to death.
- I have another idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.
Here's how you help me.
You stay on your side of the room, let me figure it out over here.
Okay, you play over there.
Think. Think.
What do we got here? Oh, yeah.
Okay.
We got wood.
We got a wall made out of wood.
That's good. Oh, we got pillows.
We got pillows, sheets.
We got the sheets and the mattress.
Okay, let's put it all together.
Let's think. Add it up, add it up.
What do we got? What do we got?
What are you doing? Stop! Stop!
What are you doing?
- Hold this for me.
- No, no. That's your shirt. You hold it.
I like your energy, but I'm not with you.
When the shirt gets wet, it doesn't break.
I don't know what that means.
And then...
Okay. And then what...
Then with the wet shirt, you...
You bend the bars. That's the payoff.
Don't waste my time with stuff like that, okay?
A 2,000-year-old civilization, that's all you can come up with?
Shame on you. Shame on you.
Come on. Stop, please.
It's embarrassing.
- See? I told you so.
- No, you said, "Wet shirt don't break," not "Piss shirt bend bar."
- Twist it.
- Help.
Okay, there. Get it. There you go.
Just one more. Yeah.
You're as strong as an ox!
Go! You can do it!
There, you got it! We're gettin' it!
- Hold it for me. I'll get through.
- Okay.
No, no, no. You hold it and I'll go through.
No! Not your hand! Stop.
- Hold it.
- Adios, sucker.
- What?
- I'm just kidding. Come on. Go.
I wouldn't leave my old pal there.
Go. Really squeeze.
No, no, no, no. Grab this, grab that.
Work your magic right here.
- Too dry.
- What? Juice it up. Juice it up. Go.
I can't! No more!
Damn it.
Come on out, little Roy.
Work your magic.
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.
- Stop! Don't look at me.
- Relax!
- Relax. It'll come.
- Thanks.
- That helps. Yeah. Good.
- Is that called relax?
Sheriff! Oh, thank God you're here.
Get the guns!
- Get my book!
- I got it!
Who's the pretty lady?
- That's my wife.
- How long you been in this country?
- Four days.
- Nice work.
Hello.
Come on. Let's adios, partner.
Well, best of luck to you.
Guess this is what your people call sayonara.
Looks like Fido's giving you some problems there.
You want me to give you a hand?
- No, I can do it.
- Sure, you can.
How is a greenhorn like you gonna make it to Carson City and rescue this princess?
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I can't take it anymore. Watch me do it.
Get it like this and you put it up high.
See? It'll drift back when you're riding.
- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?
Take you to Carson City, help you rescue Princess "Pee Pee."
Pei Pei. You do not care about the princess.
You don't know me very well, do you?
Tell you one thing,
I'd hate to think of an innocent member of Chinese nobility suffering.
Tell you that.
You people believe in karma over there, right?
Well, I've been thinking.
There must be a reason why we keep running into each other.
I've ridden with some terrible men, just people I couldn't trust.
But when I look at you, there's something different about you, and I can see it.
I can see it in your eyes.
It's what the Indians call Chippichawa.
- What's that?
- Chippichawa is nobility.
And you have it in spades.
You've got yourself a partner.
This has nothing to do with gold, okay?
Shake on it.
Why you spitting in your hand?
Well, it's customary, to seal the deal.
Come on. Let's go.
This is gonna be a long journey.
You boys take care now, you hear? Shalom.
- Shalom.
- Oh. Let's go.
Yee-haw! God damn!
Looks like y'all had a twister touch down in here.
Roy O'Bannon and his partner come through town.
Roy O'Bannon?
Roy O'Bannon ain't got no partner, friend. Roy O'Bannon is dead.
He ain't dead.
He busted out of jail last night with the Shanghai Kid.
Shanghai Kid?
Roy got a new gang goin'?
That son of a bitch.
That two-timin' son of a bitch!
He double-crossed us with that Chinaman from the damn train!
Just like that.
See, at kind of a rakish angle.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- How do I look?
I think you look great.
I think you look like a real cowboy.
Very dapper, red bandana.
Roy O'Bannon.
- My name is Chon Wang.
- John Wayne?
Chon Wang.
- That's a terrible cowboy name.
- Why?
No, come on, that's not gonna work.
That's horrible.
- That's so bad. And so's the ponytail.
- No!
It doesn't look that bad, actually.
Never touch my queue.
That killed!
- We have to go to Carson City.
- Okay.
Now, before we go to Carson City,
I want to teach you some stuff.
Come on.
You just follow me.
- What's that?
- Sensitivity. Increased reflexes.
Now, these are guns. These can be your best friend or worst enemy.
That's a spin in my left hand.
That's a spin in my right hand.
That's two spins. Now, here,
I'm gonna let you hang onto this.
See? Be careful.
Always be ready. Always be ready.
Now, try to exhale for long-range shots, inhale for short-range.
All right, now cover up your ears,
'cause this could be loud.
Cover up your ears.
I am like a wild horse.
You can't tame me.
You put the oats in the pen, though, and I'll come in for a nibble every clay.
But if you ever shut that gate,
I'll jump the fence.
You'll never see me again.
Thing about your husband, and this is nothing against him, because I really like him, he comes from a very male-dominated society.
Because I wanna be a cowboy, baby.
With the top down and the sunshine shinin'.
Cowboy, baby.
West coast chillin' with the Boon's wine
Gonna be a cowboy, baby.
Ridin' at night
'cause I sleep all day.
Cowboy, baby.
I can smell a pig from a mile away.
Let me put it this way, my horse is definitely not my best friend.
That's why they call me a cowboy, baby.
With the top down and the sunshine shinin'.
Cowboy, baby.
Now, people start looking at you funny, all you gotta say is, "Howdy, partner."
Howdy, partner?
Faster than that or people will think you're slow in the head.
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.
- Just follow my lead. Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.
- Just park it right there.
It's not working.
Some people aren't as tolerant as I am.
Not very friendly today.
John, what are you...
- John...
- Hurt.
Okay. We gotta work on that.
Here you go, John. Straighten up here.
- Roy, it hurts so bad.
- I know, John, but I'm not gonna walk with you if you walk like that.
I'll be okay.
- Hey, Roy. It's you.
- Holy shit!
I'm a wanted man. Look at this!
Five hundred bucks!
- That's a lot of money.
- Let me see.
- Nice picture.
- Careful, careful.
Look at this.
Do you know what this means?
- This will drive the girls crazy.
- Really?
Yes, really. Come on, let's get a couple more of these.
- It's not bad.
- I'm wanted, too!
- What?
- This.
Oh, come on. That's not right.
I know. I'm not from Shanghai.
No! $1,000 for a sidekick?
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Be careful.
Justice system's all screwed up.
Man can't even ride a horse, and that's a really cool nickname,
Shanghai Kid.
It's like, got a snap to it that...
Trouble. John, come here.
Get over here.
Tie 'em up over here, fellas.
Get in here.
What's going on?
Howdy, partner.
Oh, my God, it's a posse.
They can't be looking for us.
- What's "posse"?
- I think they're passing us by.
It looked like Marshal Nathan
Van Cleef, the psychotic killer.
Roy O'Bannon!
This is Marshal Nathan Van Cleef.
We know you're hidin' in there.
Oh, God, it is him. It is him.
Why don't you throw down your six-shooters and come out with your hands up.
And that goes for the scum you're ridin' with, too.
- He won.
- Roy, Roy, it's okay.
No, it's not okay!
Stop! You don't know this guy!
Let me talk to them.
Remember, we have to save the princess.
What are you doin'? Stop!
- Go easy, fellas.
- Why are they shooting at me?
What happened to "Mr. Shanghai Kid"?
"Oh, I'm a wanted man"?
- Why?
- 'Cause you're an outlaw.
- I am not an outlaw!
- Stop! You're a bad guy!
Look at that poster.
What does that say?
Drives girls crazy.
Drives girls crazy?
Drives the posse crazy.
Makes them want to hang you, string you up, because you're a bad guy.
- You got 20 seconds...
- God! Give us a minute!
Go around back, gentlemen.
Make sure he isn't trying to pull the saddle over our eyes.
Remember, I want the Chinaman alive.
I'm not a bad guy.
You're a bad guy.
You're with me, you're a bad guy.
Hey, you put me in this situation!
- I'm the good guy, you're the bad guy!
- No! We're both bad guys!
No, only you're the bad guy!
You go out there and tell them!
No! I'm not going out there!
You go out there!
No, you have to go!
- Did I just do that?
- Not bad.
I don't know karate, but I know "crazy," and I will use it.
What the hell is going on in there?
You Okay?
You just threw me through a window.
You got that gold?
What? Gold? What gold?
Wrong answer.
Wait. I'm... I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed!
No gun. Hold on, no gun. I don't...
I'm unarmed!
You can't shoot an unarmed man.
- Don't worry. I help you.
- No, John. No, no.
John! John...
Fight with honor. You will win.
Are you frickin' insane?
Is that what they teach you in Imperial Guard School?
- What...
- Pick 'em up.
Well.
If it ain't the Shanghai Kid.
How about we make the Kid dance?
Oh, come on!
You can do better than that.
You robbed the wrong train, son.
- Look, Marshal, I think that if...
- Just shut up and put on your guns.
This is serious, you know?
We don't come back from this.
That's the general idea.
What the hell you doin'?
Stop procrastinating.
Come on. Hurry up, son.
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you cheapen it. All right?
This is a duel. It's a sacred thing.
It's beautiful.
It's what separates us from the animals.
Yeah.
I do not envy you. You ready?
Why don't you turn and face me like a man?
Why don't you do it your way and I'll do it my way? How about that?
Oh, come on, Roy.
You can do it.
No, you can't. He's gonna kill you.
- One.
- He's gonna blow you away.
Come on, Roy. Don't think like that.
Two.
Oh, yeah. Be positive.
Be the bullet. Be the lead bullet.
- I'm about to die.
- Three.
Roy!
Duel's off!
Roy!
You blew it, John!
Never interrupt a man in the middle of a duel.
I had him. That's what kills me.
I had him! I had him!
Now you know how it feels to haul you around in that sedan chair.
I will never bow to you.
Take a good look at these faces.
If you attempt to escape,
I will kill one worker every hour until you are found.
Starting with this one.
Do not let him see you suffer.
I know who you are.
Please, tell no one.
You call this a special hideout?
Yes, it is, John.
It's also a good place to gather intelligence,
'cause no one passes through Carson City without these people hearing about it.
Would you ask them about the princess?
Yes, sir, I will.
And I don't care how ugly it gets.
I'm not gonna rest until I've pumped everybody in there for information, okay?
- Hi, Roy.
- Hello, ladies.
Roy.
Make way for a couple of desperados.
Nice to see you again, Mr. O'Bannon.
- Greetings. Hello.
- Roy.
Oh, yeah, we're gonna get some information here. Trust me.
This is not a proper hiding place.
Oh, come on, John.
Let's relax for a little bit.
- Here, have a drink.
- No. I wanna find the princess.
So do I, but we can't exactly go door to door in Carson City looking for her.
- Don't forget, we're wanted men.
- Only because of you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything's my fault.
So, what's the princess like?
John, what's the princess like?
Is she pretty?
- Is she a pain in the neck?
- You are not fit to talk about her.
John, you better remember where you are.
This is the West.
It's not the East. Remember?
And the sun may rise where I come from...
Blah, blah, blah. I know.
Good. You remember.
- Is she single?
- What?
Is she single? Is she married?
Is she available?
Only to a member of the Imperial family.
Are you a member of the Imperial family? I don't think so.
Was that a joke, John? That was a joke.
John, that was your first joke.
We gotta have a toast. Your first joke.
- Yes.
- No.
Yes. Come on. Drink.
- Just one.
- Okay.
But don't talk about the princess anymore.
Word of honor.
Be fun to play a drinking game.
You know any
Chinese drinking games?
No.
Every country has a drinking game.
You must know one.
Just one?
- Uno mas?
- Uno... What?
- One more. Uno mas.
- Okay.
No! I lost? One more.
Oh, no! Oh, yeah!
I'm so lost, John.
90% of the time, I don't even know what I'm doin' out here in the West.
Terrible outlaw.
- No, you're a good outlaw.
- Stop, please. I'm a screw-up.
- No, I am screw-up. Look at my scar.
- No.
One for arriving late at a guard duty.
One for dropping fighting stick.
You good. I saw you.
The only thing I'm good at is talking.
- It's true.
- John.
Take your hand off me, John.
One more game?
No. No more drinking. That's it.
- Uno mas?
- No mas, John. No mas.
Roy?
Roy?
- Are you coming?
- Fifi?
Uno mas?
So, who's your funny-looking friend?
I don't know.
He's this crazy Imperial Guard I met.
He's... He's really funny.
The guy's hysterical.
We were just playing... Did you see us?
We were just playing that game.
John's going...
And I was going... You can't really understand what he's saying, but...
Roy? Roy? I never figured you for riding with a Chinaman.
Well, I'm not exactly riding with him, Fifi.
He's not my friend, you know.
I mean, he's a Chinaman.
Well, that's good.
I mean... And you really...
Were you guys talking about who he was?
Let's talk about something else.
Don't you look delicious?
- What's going on?
- Well.
- You!
- If it isn't the Shanghai Kid.
Here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Uno mas?
John, come on. We gotta get going.
- The marshal's downstairs.
- No, no, Marshal's in there.
Oh, man, John. What'd you do to him?
- Come on. Let's get going.
- No!
I don't wanna ride with you.
Come on, John.
Damn, you're a mean drunk.
- Hi, horsey!
- All right.
- All right, it's time for a "yee-haw."
- Yee-what?
Roy O'Bannon special.
We jump off, land on the back of the horse, yell "yee-haw" and ride off, all right?
Watch me and do exactly as I do it.
Yee-haw!
Yee-haw!
Okay, hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Where's the head?
- John!
John, get up!
Tie 'em up.
What happened to my horse?
Is he dead?
No, but we are, John.
- Hi, horsey. You sleeping?
- Get up.
Mighty impressive hardware you're packin'.
Why don't you get your eyes off my package, you twisted son of a bitch.
- I hope that's him leaving.
- Your turn.
Thank you, Mr. Van Cleef.
Well, well. What have we here?
Mr. O'Bannon, I presume.
Can I get a drink of water?
I got cotton mouth.
Don't mention it.
And this must be the famous Shanghai Kid.
- Chon Wang?
- Lo Fong?
You remember your old comrade-in-arms?
I remember a traitor.
I'm sensing some bad blood here.
- Where is the gold?
- Where's Princess Pei Pei?
Stop.
Come on. We're men.
We're not pinatas.
Okay? And we're really hungover.
We're not trying to be tough guys.
You wanna talk about the gold, let's talk about the gold.
So, you have my gold?
- Your gold?
- Yes, we have the gold.
- Then where is it?
- The gold's in a safe place.
Is he telling the truth?
No.
Nice, John. Way to go.
Way to think on your feet.
He cannot lie.
He is bound by Imperial decree.
Imperial decree.
When are you gonna learn you're not in China anymore?
He will never learn.
He can only follow orders.
At least I still have my honor.
Slaves have no honor.
- No! No!
- Hey!
Now you can never go back to China.
You blew it. You blew it, man.
You do not want to cut his hair off, trust me.
Nothing personal, boys.
My loyalty is to the emperor.
Yeah, John, I heard all about the emperor.
Must be a hell of a man.
He's only 12.
Are you kidding me? You're sitting here with a noose around your neck, ready to die for someone whose balls haven't even dropped?
By virtue of the authority vested in me through the territory of Nevada,
I do hereby order these men to hang by their necks until their feet quit kicking.
You're goin' to hell, boys, and your horses are taking you there.
Tighten 'em up.
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hey! Watch it, you little punk.
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
John, what are you doing?
What the hell is goin' on here?
Stop those horses!
Stop them!
Pull it! Pull it!
I'm back.
I'm back in the saddle again.
Help me!
I'm back.
I'm back in the saddle again.
Well, don't just stand there!
Go after them!
Will you listen to this creek, John?
I've never noticed what a beautiful melody a creek makes.
I've never taken the damn time.
Look at these mountains and these trees.
Hell, look at these green trees.
Come here.
I don't even know the names...
We're gonna learn the names of these green trees. Come here.
I want you to look at these.
Can we not...
John, what are you doing?
Are you still worried about your hair?
John, listen to me. You're very vain.
By the time you're 70, your queue, your ponytail, will be as good as new.
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.
Can we not take two seconds, John?
We just cheated death.
Come on. Let's look at these mountains for a second.
Okay, let me get my stuff.
- God, you're unbelievable.
- I'm going alone.
What are you...
John, what are you talking about?
- I heard you.
- You heard me. Okay.
At Goldie's.
You said I wasn't your friend.
John...
Hold on a second, John.
I was talking to a girl.
It was... That's taken out of context.
- That's not...
- Roy.
You were right.
How could I ever be your friend?
I'm just a Chinaman.
Hold on, John. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to...
Sayonara, Roy.
Wait here.
Please.
You have come a long way.
I hope the princess you seek is worthy of such devotion.
It is my duty to bring her home.
I even brought her favorite book.
That's very kind of you.
But what if you found the princess and she did not wish to go back to the Forbidden City?
Why would she want to stay here?
Maybe she can do more for the people here than she could back in China.
Princess Pei Pei.
Please, don't draw attention.
Please. Stand up!
Princess, you have to come with me.
I cannot. Fong cannot find me missing.
Princess, I cannot leave you here.
Please, stand up!
Don't bow! Get up!
Get up!
You must go.
If I leave,
Fong will begin to kill the others.
It is my duty to bring you home.
I command you to go.
Go!
Go!
Reach for the sky, baldy!
That's right. It's Roy.
Am I interrupting?
I followed you. So what?
What am I supposed to do, let you wander off? You're a greenhorn.
You'll get killed out here.
Come on! We gotta adios out of here, partner! Come on!
You gotta stick with me.
Don't forget, we got a princess to save.
Give my regards to the emperor, Princess.
- Chon Wang?
- Chon Wang?
Chon Wang?
That's right,
Johnny Wayne is here.
Hey, it's me.
Why did you cut his hair?
I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen.
Go on, drop the gun.
Now, slide it over.
Is that her?
She's pretty.
Grab her.
Come on. We'll take it from here, guys.
John, what... John, get up.
What are you...
I thought we were past this.
Come on, John.
Do you see? He will always be a slave.
This is the West, not the East.
And the sun may rise where we come from, but here is where it sets.
You want me to translate?
The princess stays.
The princess stays.
I grab the gold, you marry the princess.
We both hang Fong, call it a day.
Mission accomplished.
Well, well.
Nice to see we're all churchgoers.
Son of a bitch! With my own guns!
Sweet, ain't it?
How about that? It's a Mexican standoff.
Only we ain't got no Mexicans.
No!
Princess Pei Pei!
- I hit you?
- No.
But you're gettin' really close.
You've almost killed me, like, 17 times already.
Eighteen, 19, 20!
You're on fire today!
How do you survive out here?
What's that supposed to mean?
These aren't my...
These guns are really weird.
Oh, man.
Stay low!
Maybe we should let bygones be bygones.
You got off some good shots.
I got off some good ones.
Let's call it a tie.
What's the matter, O'Bannon?
Out of bullets?
No, I got one left.
Tell you what I'll do.
I'll take out all my bullets but one.
And that way, we'll be even. How's that?
Okay. That sounds fair.
You'd do that for me?
Oh, yeah.
You bet I would.
We come out on three.
Okay, but... But let me count.
Fight with honor. Okay.
Fight with... Okay. One!
Two! Two and a half!
Two and seven-eighths!
Three!
How the hell did that happen?
It's a miracle.
I am invincible.
Roy!
Invincible!
- Now it's time for you to die.
- Adios, partner.
Roy!
He took the gold.
Is that all you care about, is the gold?
Shame on you.
There's more to life than money.
I hope you learn that one day.
What happened?
What? Nothing, nothing.
I just killed him. How'd you do?
How?
What do you mean, how?
I shot him with my gun.
Come on. Tell me the truth.
It was unbelievable. You missed a miracle. I had one bullet left.
He had, like, a million left.
He lied to me and told me that he only had one, too.
But... But when... But when he...
- She's staying?
- Yes.
- Can I stand?
- Yes.
Reach for the sky, O'Bannon!
That's my line. He stole my gang, he's stealing my lines.
- That's unbelievable.
- Roy! Roy!
Get back!
Stop, stop. It's Wallace.
Hey, Roy, we know you been moonlightin' on us with that old yellow fella from the train!
You guys, you stay here.
This isn't your battle.
No, we stick together. We are partners.
That's beautiful.
You go out the back door.
- No.
- Don't worry, Princess.
I promise you, I will see you again.
That which you have promised, you must perform.
- Get out of the way!
- Why?
- Come on!
- Why? What are you...
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- No, John, stop, stop.
They can't touch me.
Something happened back there.
It was a miracle.
There's no way...
Hey, smart-ass! Do you hear me?
Time's up, O'Bannon!
It's the end of the line!
We can take these guys.
Yep, we can take them.
Are you comin' out or ain't you?
Gun.
You really are the Shanghai Kid.
Nice riding with you, partner.
We go out on three. I count.
No, I count.
We'll both count.
One, two, three!
- Indians! Look out!
- No! My family! My family!
- Friends. Brothers!
- Roy!
I gotta tell ya, we always figured you for a dumbshit, but we was thinkin' maybe you wanna come back and rejoin the gang.
- So, what do you say?
- Yeah, what do you say?
I think I'm just gonna wing it.
All right.
- And you are goin' to jail.
- That works, too.
How, kimosabe!
How, kimosabe!
It's nice to be standing here next to you.
I don't think I've ever gotten a chance to thank you for...
For saving us so many times.
I wish you could understand what...
I feel like there's this gap between us.
It's like, I'm a cowboy, you're an Indian.
You say "Wampum," I say "money."
At a certain point, I just think...
Shut up, Roy. You talk too much.
Did... Did... She just...
There she is, right on time, carrying a big, fat payroll.
I don't know if I'll ever get used to this one.
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.
I can guarantee you, we won't get half as many girls being lawmen.
I know we're spoken for, but...
You never know what's gonna happen in a relationship.
I gotta get rid of my outlaw name.
That's not gonna work anymore.
Really? What would you call yourself?
I don't know. I mean, my real name's Wyatt Earp, but...
Earp? That's a terrible name for a cowboy.
- Why?
- Bad.
- Really?
- Bad!
And John Wayne's a great cowboy name?
Roy, look.
There they are.
Yep. Look at those amateurs.
That's my move!
Come on, Roy. Let's go say "howdy."
Let's go!
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!
Scene up.
That which you have promised, you must perform.
Hello.
He was part of your "rushimiant..."
What? Regiment.
He's one of your bandits.
He's one of your... He's one of your...
He was part of your regiment of "dentists."
Bandits. Dentists?
Shit!
He didn't teeth brush this morning.
- Lose this thing, too, I'm gonna cut off...
- No!
I can't do stunts, man.
Because I'm gonna be a cowboy, baby.
What's this princess like?
I got air bubbles coming out of my thing.
Uno mas, please.
Uno mas...
Thanks, Fido.
One, two, three!
Shit!
Thank you so much, Princess.
You're so good.
Princess! Oh, I love you so much.
I'm talking to you!
Turn around!
Ask me if I give a shit.
I might walk a little funny but my walk is me.
I might stutter when I talk but I say what I see.
I don't agree with every other little thing that's proven.
I do a lot of things that I shouldn't be doin'.
I ruin everything you might've had in mind.
I'm a consistent, belligerent solidified mind.
Rhinestone freak Suburban style.
I ain't got no money and I got no car.
I might make par if it don't take much.
I gotta ride very far
'cause I ride on luck.
I stay pretty stuck in a rut like I should.
And I do it for the love
of everything's that's still good.
I don't know why I come here.
But I know I'll never leave.
It's the only place I wanna be.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't know why I come here.
But I know I'll never leave.
It's the only place I wanna be.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm a long way gone but I ain't short-lived.
I got knee-deep pockets that leak like a sieve.
I give one tenth throughout the course of the night.
And if I don't go home then I did things right.
I'd like to settle down but I ain't that guy
'Cause everything I ever did
I always did on the fly.
I stay stuck in the rut like I should.
You know, I do it for the love of everything that's still good.
I don't know why I come here.
But I know I'll never leave.
It's the only place I wanna be.
Yeah, yeah, yeah
- Fire!
- Stand back!
In the woods, boys, in the woods!
- Fire!
- Let's go! Ride!
Fall back!
You okay?
Come on, Bob!
This way!
Hey, you all right?
Gatling! They got a Gatling.
Goddamn it, Cole! This stopped being fun about two years ago.
Move that wagon!
- Down!
- Fire!
Cole, Bob, you okay?
Takes more than a cannon to kill the Youngers.
- The cannon's doing a good job, Cole!
- Some Indian tracker you are, Tom.
You pay me to find Bluecoats.
There they are.
- Get me James.
- Jesse?
No, not Jesse. The one that can shoot.
- Frank!
- Frank!
Hold your ground!
Frank, up front!
Jesse, watch your back.
Watch your heads, boys.
- Cannon or Gatling?
- Fire!
- Cannon!
- Cannon.
- Where you been?
- What's up?
Nothing really.
When I put my head up, they shoot at me.
- So, we got a plan?
- My plan of pissing myself is working.
I can hit those boys.
We need a distraction.
A distraction?
Why the hell didn't you just say so?
- He's smiling.
- That's never a good thing.
Get that rider!
- We're coming, Jesse!
- Head out!
Take the hill! Charge!
Pull back!
Come on!
Go on, get. Get!
Go on! Go on!
- Distracting enough?
- They hardly noticed.
- I could have done more?
- Uh-huh!
- Such as?
- You could have worn a woman's bonnet.
- That would've made an impression.
- I figure.
By the time you figure out stuff,
I'm already finished doing it.
You're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
Goddamn, boy!
Wait till we get to Missouri.
Tell them gals about how
Jesse James charged the Union Army.
- He keeps that up, he'll outrank you.
- I'll still be better-looking, right?
Let's meet on that south road.
See if we can get those Yankees
Jesse here scared off.
- Ride with me, cousin.
- I could use the walk.
All right. We'll have horses waiting for you at the road.
All right, Rangers, let's ride!
I would sound stupid saying something like that.
Where you going?
- There's Yankees back there.
- War's over.
General Lee surrendered yesterday at Appomattox.
- Yesterday.
- Somebody better tell the Yankees!
- What do you reckon, cousin?
- Home. Cole, we go home.
We ride like hell and God help any fool who comes between me and my farm.
That's the best plan I heard all war.
Well, boys, let's ride!
- Hello, Liberty, Missouri!
- Let's go home, back to our farms.
Planting corn, harvesting corn, eating corn.
Corn gonna shoot me?
- Then I love it.
- Let's go!
We got problems.
Got a garrison in town.
We're in occupied territory.
- Hands off your hip.
- Are you scared?
Pick your fights. You taught me that.
- Jesus, mercy.
- That's Charlie Higgins.
- I'm cutting him down.
- Not now, Cole.
- What's wrong with you?
- Lf we have to kill them...
...I don't wanna warn them.
I wanna make sure Jim and the girls are okay.
Stop by and tell our ma we're fine.
We'll see Doc Mimms.
Excuse me, sir, we're here for the doctor.
- Jesse. Frank.
- Zerelda?
- Little Zee Mimms?
- You were little Jesse James.
Yeah, but you got big!
I mean, Zee, you aged!
I mean, in a good way, you got big and older.
- Frank, say something.
- No, you're doing just fine.
- Frank. Jesse.
- Daddy.
- Where's Web?
- He rode right into them, screaming.
- Web did that?
- He jumped his horse over our heads.
Killed 12 before they knew what hit them.
- Took out a Gatling gun and a cannon.
- Saved all our lives, doc.
None of the Liberty boys would've come home if not for Web. God's truth.
- Web died fighting?
- Web died a hero.
But still died.
Doc, if there's anything we can do, we want to help.
Think about yourselves.
Don't end up like Charlie Higgins.
They found out he was a
Quantrill Raider.
They arrested him, tried him by military tribunal and hanged him.
- But there's general amnesty.
- Not if you rode in a partisan band.
You're in more danger because you've got a farm.
Railroad men come in offering to buy land. Nobody sells.
So the army starts hanging men who own farms for treason.
All we've thought about is home.
I'll kill anyone who tries to get me off my farm.
If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, it's fine by me.
Let's think about this.
- Lf we have a good story, we're okay.
- What story are they gonna believe?
You were in General Hood's
Texas Army...
...until Sharpsburg, then were assigned to Jeb Stuart's cavalry...
...until you surrendered in Tennessee.
- That just might work.
- Yeah, that might just work.
Now go on and see your ma.
She'll be glad to see her sons alive.
And for her sake, stay that way.
Thanks for everything.
Especially the story you told.
- Look, Zee...
- I'm going to go cry now.
- Zerelda became a hell of a woman.
- Oh, yeah.
- "Big and older."
- Shut up, Frank.
You're a charmer.
- I'll shoot you.
- Next time, try "fat and haggard."
My boys! My boys!
My boys! My boys are alive! Oh, God!
- Praise God, you're alive!
- Not if you don't ease up a bit, Ma.
- Did you kill Yankees?
- A few.
- Say your prayers?
- Yes.
Good. Come inside and wash your hands for dinner.
- Ma, you look so good.
- No, you look great!
Look at Jimmy Younger, all grown up.
- How you doing?
- All right.
- Your ma made us eat.
- That was two hours ago.
I don't see clean plates.
- Thanks for accepting Tom.
- He's Christian and killed Yankees.
- Jesus told me that made him okay.
- She's still talking to Jesus.
- What worries me is, he's talking back.
- I heard that.
- Come on, Frank.
- You play me that.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
She got two, don't she?
- I think one's glass.
- Which one?
- The right or the left?
- The brown one.
Don't make me tell the town about the fella you screwed in Atlanta.
Talking to me?
- That dance-hall girl at Bunny's?
- Yes.
Sadie was a beautiful woman.
Not a man!
- She had a nice mustache.
- More than that.
- She was European.
- All right.
I'll admit Sadie's a woman, if you stop about my Zee.
- "My Zee"?
- Your Zee?
From women 's eyes
This doctrine I derive
They sparkle still
The right Promethean fire
They are the books, the arts
The academes
That show, contain and nourish
All the world
I don't know what you said, but it sounded nice.
That's Shakespeare.
Now, he's European.
Write that down, so I can say it to Zee?
- I'll send you a telegram.
- Thanks, brother.
- Thanks for the help, Cole.
- You did plenty over at our place.
- You miss it, don't you?
- What, the war?
Hell, no.
I miss things about it, but...
- It was exciting.
- Yeah.
It was a lot of killing.
Why miss that?
Because we were good at it.
Shoot, we were great at it.
Tell anybody this and I'll kill you.
You know I'm the toughest man in town.
But you are one terrifying son of a bitch with guns.
Boys.
Howdy, folks, how are you?
- Howdy?
- Easterners.
Fine, thank you, sir.
I'm Rollin H. Parker, emissary to Thaddeus Rains...
...president of Rock
Northern Railroad.
This is Allan Pinkerton...
...founder of the Secret Service and under contract to Mr. Rains.
As you no doubt heard, our railroad's moving west.
Well, east would put you underwater.
Moving west to open the frontier to folks.
Your acreage is located on the proposed right of way.
I am here to get your signature on this land-sale contract.
And I'm authorized to pay you two dollars an acre.
Two dollars?
The price was set by the Department of the Interior of the U.S. Government.
- This land ain't for sale.
- I understand how you feel.
You've made a lovely home here, but it isn't up to me or you.
You familiar with the right of eminent domain?
Yeah, I am. What about it?
This land's about to be condemned.
You see, I'm doing you folks a favor.
Two dollars an acre is a one-time-only deal.
After today, the price drops.
If I were you, I'd sign the contract and we'll be on our way.
Good day, Mr. Parker.
You can tell Mr. Thaddeus Rains to put this where the sun don't shine.
Shakespeare.
I don't think you understand.
You don't have a choice.
Ma'am, I think that you should search your heart here...
...and try to do the right thing.
Let me ask the Lord.
The Lord says to bury them out back.
Nobody will find them.
- Somebody's in a vengeful mood.
- Let them go.
- We'll bury them next time.
- Oh, all right.
Now, ma'am...
You folks are making a serious mistake here.
Nicely played.
Tell them what you told me.
I checked the court documents for the rail bed. They don't need our land.
They're using as much land as they can.
Floor recognizes Clell Miller.
They say if we don't sell, we'll end up with nothing.
- Only if we don't stick together.
- Loni Packwood.
I say this is the last straw.
I came back from the war.
My farm was burned down.
My cows was dead. And now my wife's run off with my cousin Jeb.
That son of a bitch. He took my dog!
Loni. About the railroad.
He took my dog!
- They got Cole!
- He came to our house.
Figured you'd all want to hear this.
They came and made the same offer they made you folks.
My brother Jim tried to chase them off.
A detective hit him in the head and knocked him out.
- Cole lost his temper.
- Oh, no.
- Just a little.
- How many did he kill, Bob?
Two.
Because they worked for the Department of the Interior...
The Army can hang him.
Tomorrow.
- What do we do?
- Nothing!
You folks will do nothing.
Go home now.
You too, doc.
So you can swear that you know nothing about what's gonna happen.
- Boys...
- Doc, go home.
They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Go home.
Meeting's adjourned.
Go home, everybody.
Go home.
- I'm staying.
- Me too.
Loni, Clell.
- Couldn't lose him.
- Jim, I said stay home!
It's my fault. I want in.
It was a matter of time before they hung someone.
- And you're too young.
- Too young?
- I'm as old as you were, going to war.
- And Web too. No.
- You're wasting time.
- Zee, go home.
I was there for the hangings.
You need to know how they do it.
What order they do things in.
If you mess up rescuing Cole because you won't listen to a woman...
...then damn you all.
All right.
Eight of us against a Union regiment...
...and Pinkerton detectives on
Main Street in broad daylight.
- He's smiling.
- Is that bad?
Very.
Pinkerton, relax. The Army has everything well in hand.
Nothing like a hanging to motivate people to relocate.
It's not my job to relax.
I've got men at every entrance so no one rides in shooting.
I've got a sharpshooter up on that rooftop over there...
...just in case.
Be it known that Coleman Younger be found guilty of treasonable acts...
...against military law and the Articles of War...
...to be hanged by the neck until dead.
May God have mercy on his soul.
Brilliant.
Go on, hang him! Pull it!
Sir, are you all right?
Somebody get a doctor!
The bullet left clean, but he's lost blood.
He's gonna be fine, right, Daddy?
Praying wouldn't hurt.
Who's that? Stay here with him.
We're checking all houses for a fugitive.
Powell, out back. McCall, first floor.
- I'm going up.
- Who are you?
- Oh, sorry, ma'am.
- Well, I should hope so!
Go! Go.
Jesse, are you awake?
Jesse, is that your hand?
They're gone. What are you...?
- I made them think I was alone.
- Let's hope he pulls through.
I think he's feeling better already.
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir.
- It's a pleasure to have you.
- I'm pleased to be here.
- Really?
- No, Parker, no!
I'm really not pleased to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt...
...to discover why you can't evict a few simple farmers...
...from their pathetic mudholes...
...so I can build the greatest railroad ever.
- I understand your distress, sir.
- What's going on?
Two weeks ago, we arranged to have the Army hang a local farmer.
- That's good.
- Unfortunately not, sir.
A group of local thugs managed to rescue him...
...inspiring resistance. And Mr.
Allan Pinkerton was seriously injured.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he should return.
A further impediment is that the garrison's moving on...
...so we don't have that stick to threaten them with.
You see that as the loss of a tool.
I see a power vacuum to fill.
As we have the most power...
...we may move with impunity.
I see, sir.
I'll get four patrols together for action tonight.
They'll see what happens...
...when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
Yes, sir.
- You shouldn't be up.
- It's been two weeks. I'm sick of it.
- You're sick of my company?
- Of course not!
- Teasing you is unfair.
- What you do to me is unfair.
- Well, I shouldn't tease a hero.
- What?
Everybody in the county knows you rescued Cole.
We're all so proud of you.
And not one farm's been sold since.
Well, that's good, but I wasn't the only person...
...risking my neck that day.
You're saying I should spend time with Cole Younger?
With Cole Younger?
No, I never said that.
- You gonna stop loafing and get home?
- What do you think, Frank?
Until Ma has you home so she can fuss over you, she'll make me miserable.
- What do you say, sir?
- You're pretty much healed.
- Thank you, doc.
- Of course.
Bye, Jesse.
Bye, Zee.
- You're looking more spry.
- Shut up, Frank.
Doc, I was wondering if later this evening I could come by?
You're always welcome.
Yeah, I know, doc. But I was thinking maybe I could take Zee out?
Someplace near, with other folk.
Near, you know. Here, but out.
It's fine by me, Jesse.
Don't worry, sir.
I'll make sure they're chaperoned.
That hadn't even occurred to me.
I am deeply in your debt.
You're very welcome, sir.
The Army's leaving, so Cole can stop hiding and get back to his farm.
We're meeting at the Younger place.
Leave them alone.
- Cole.
- Clell.
- How are you?
- Hey, John.
Thanks for coming.
- How are you?
- Hey, Cole.
Hey, who's seen how Loni
Packwood is dressed?
Tom, come here, huh?
- Thank you.
- James!
You behave yourselves.
Look. Liberty's favorite son, come here!
- I won't forget what you did.
- Yeah.
I'm pleased you came.
- Why, thank you.
- I'm very pleased you came with Jesse.
There's a gaggle of girls hoping to dance with Jesse...
...who'll have to settle with my many charms.
- Bob, you have no shame.
- Not yet. But I'm hoping.
- Let's dance.
- Okay.
I used to come to this rock as a kid.
Imagine what life would be like when I got older.
- You didn't want a farm?
- I thought of being a river pirate.
A river pirate?
- Hand over your jewels, missy.
- Thank God you grew out of that.
- You did grow out of that, didn't you?
- Mostly, yeah.
I mean, it would be all right for a bachelor.
Are you planning on being a bachelor your whole life, Jesse James?
Not if I find the right girl.
What's this "right girl" like?
What's she like? She's smart.
She's funny.
She's bossy.
She always makes me think.
She's at least two steps ahead of me.
Where will you find such a girl?
From this doctrine...
From women 's eyes these doctrine...
This doctrine, I derive
They sparkle still like...
...tiny sparkling rocks
"Sparkling rocks"?
Yeah, little ones.
Is this one of Frank's
Shakespeare poems?
Yes, it is.
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
I planned on kissing you for a very long time.
Bastards!
Come back here and face me!
- Cole, what'd they do?
- Let's get back.
We need some water.
Get some buckets.
- Get buckets!
- Water!
It's the Pinkertons.
It's the railroad.
Then Ma. Ma!
Come on!
Thank God.
Ma!
Ma! Ma!
We know.
We'll get you to Doc Mimms.
You boys take care of each other.
Ma, Doc Mimms...
Well, look at that.
The good Lord's a bit shorter than I reckoned.
Ma?
I think we can move on, rebuild.
Make a decent life someplace else.
- I don't care.
- I didn't think you would.
Our place, Clell Miller's, Sammy
Johnston, the Creeders', Will Hite.
- Sheriff said it's drunk Kansas boys.
- I say we kill some railroad men.
No. This isn't a feud, this is war.
- They've got more men than us.
- What do we do?
We do what we did in the war.
We harass their supply lines.
- We kill their men, they won't care.
- Lf we take money and supplies...
- Exactly.
- That's a good plan, Jesse.
I'll get more men, and Tom will ride with us.
- Where do we hit?
- I know a gal at the bank.
See if I can get a list of where the railroad keeps money.
- I'm so sorry, Jesse.
- Me and Frank gotta leave for a while.
But you and I, we've started something.
I don't know what'll happen if you go.
- Neither do I.
- Just let the law...
Laws don't touch men like
Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Whose justice, yours or God's?
When will you stop?
When I send them to their graves.
I have bad news.
The railroad payroll has been stolen.
What do you mean?
The railroad's money is in that safe.
That safe?
Excuse me, sir, the bank's closed today.
- What?
- It's a bank holiday.
There ain't no dad-burned bank holiday. Get out of my way!
- This is outrageous. Who are you?
- The James gang.
- The James gang?
- Yeah.
How about the James-Younger gang?
The James-Younger gang.
I'll whop you real good if you don't get out of my way.
Stop!
Excuse me, sir. It's a bank holiday.
It ain't no bank holiday.
What are you saying?
- What are you doing?
- Go on.
Sir, the safe.
- Ma'am, turn around. Cover your eyes.
- Why?
I'm gonna shoot him and I don't think you wanna see it.
Hey, the safe. Now.
It ain't no holiday.
- It's a bank holiday.
- You're right, sir.
- Then why can't I go in there?
- On account of that we're robbing it.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?
It's secret.
- Fine, I'll just wait over here.
- I'd appreciate that.
Go on.
- What the...?
- What is it?
Old Man Tucker is sitting there quiet outside the bank.
So?
When have you ever known Old Man
Tucker not to be yelling?
- How'd it go in there?
- Fine. How'd it go out here?
We should talk.
You can be smart or stupid about this.
Only one way ends with you breathing.
Just because we're robbing a bank, there's no reason not to be civil.
- Where the hell were you?
- I had you covered.
- I got 5000.
- I got 3000.
$8000! That's $1000 apiece!
Our luck is finally changing.
These are the farm property rights the bank held for the railroad.
Pass them over here before something happens to them.
Whoops.
Settle down.
Not all this money's ours.
No, it was the bank's.
That's why we went to all the trouble of stealing it.
We ought to give some money to our hurting neighbors in Liberty.
They didn't risk their necks.
Creating some goodwill will make it easier to dodge the law.
Frank's being smart about this.
Him reading books don't make him smart.
- Yeah, it does.
- No, it don't. Stay out of this.
- I think Jesse's got a good idea.
- Jim.
Who put you in charge? I did a mighty fine job during the war.
And I remember cutting a noose off you.
That's why you both lead the gang.
Two of you went into that bank.
Two heads are better than one.
All Jesse's doing is making a suggestion.
We're waiting to hear what you think, Cole...
...as the other leader of the gang.
That's fine.
- What?
- It's a smart thing to do.
- Cole...
- Hey!
We decide something, that's it.
We're in this for the long haul.
This plan of me and Jesse's, it's smart. Gives us places to hide.
Then no farmer will shoot us in our sleep.
We gotta think...
What's that word, Frank?
- Strategically.
- Yeah, thank you.
- Strategically, because this is a war.
- This ain't no war.
What's that?
Nobody paid me no $1000 to fight in a war.
- Tom, are you cheating again?
- I'm broke again.
- Next up, Thaxton Switch.
- That ain't a bank.
It's a construction depot so it'll have ammo, explosives.
We can take those and do a bigger job.
- It's guarded by Pinkerton detectives.
- I do so want to kill me some of them.
Boys...
...we're famous.
- What's this?
"Fidelity Bank was robbed on Tuesday by 20 armed men."
Twenty? You mean another gang robbed the same bank the same day as us?
"The outlaws, calling themselves the James-Younger gang...
...shot their way out, wounding the sheriff and three townsfolk.
- The loss is estimated to be $50,000."
- $50,000? More like 50,000 pesos.
"It's believed to be the first daylight robbery in American history."
- I'll drink to that.
- We made history?
- We should be proud.
- The rest is horseshit.
Next time we're gonna have to set the record straight ourselves.
Line them up.
- Barkeep.
- Whiskey.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton guards...
...raided the payroll office and blew the track.
- How much did they get from the safe?
- $35,000 in currency...
...plus the added delay of miles of destroyed track.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway.
- They didn't actually blow the track.
- Who did?
We did. I mean, our men did.
Our workers planted the dynamite, but they were under duress.
Pinkerton, what is going on here?
You managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
- They had to be dealt with.
- By burning down their homes?
You wouldn't have done that?
I would have done that. But I'd make sure I killed them all first.
- I want them arrested and hanged.
- Do you think a jury in these parts...
...would convict one of their own?
I doubt it.
- We're beginning an interesting game.
- This is no game.
I'm afraid our adversaries don't agree.
"Rock Island Pacific Railroad Depot was robbed near St. Louis, Missouri.
The James-Younger gang was outnumbered by Pinkerton detectives...
...but they were no match for the guns of the West."
Fine piece of writing.
"The gang destroyed the Thaxton Switch site...
...meaning that for months, farmers can sleep without fearing...
...the railroad is coming to steal their land."
Who wrote this? I'll see them hanged.
That's the best part.
"The foregoing article was sent to this newspaper...
...reputedly written by the outlaw Jesse James himself."
- Hey! Look at that.
- What is it?
"Better...
...slow down.
Dynamite ahead.
Too late.
You're dead."
Yes, sir, that was a fine piece of driving.
Damn.
Thanks, Mr. Williams.
You have to look carefully at these Yankee $2 bills.
- Could you change this for me? Thanks.
- Certainly, sir.
- I'm sorry, this bill is counterfeit.
- I don't think so.
I'll need all your money so I can compare.
Scientific method.
I hear it's all the rage.
Yes, you can compare all of them, Mr...
James.
- Jesse James?
- Yes, sir, it's a terrible sketch.
- That's all I have.
- Thank you. Been a pleasure.
Take care now, you hear?
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.
Pinkerton, why can't you catch these outlaws?
It's early in the game, sir.
Jesse James and I are learning each other's moves...
...feeling out each other.
I'm losing millions while you play chess with these farmers.
Hardly farmers.
Each of these men has four years of fighting experience.
They're disciplined and have a charismatic leader.
If I were to design the perfect outlaw band...
...this is the gang I'd create.
So, what can you tell me?
It's going to be a long winter.
Take this road! Come on!
- Come on, boys! Come on!
- Let's go!
Come on, boys!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- I never thought they would give up.
- They were admirably persistent.
Longest chase we've had.
- Jesse, we gotta have a word.
- Sure.
The newspapers call us the James-Younger gang.
Yes.
Why not "Younger-James gang"?
We got three Youngers and two James.
I like the James-Younger gang.
I'll beat the piss out of you.
Stay out!
Jimmy's got a point.
The Younger-James gang is confusing.
- How's that, Bob?
- Say we burst into a bank and yell...
..."We're the Younger-James gang!"
People will think,
"Younger-James gang?
Is there an older James gang?
How come we never heard of them?"
They'll think about that instead of raising their arms.
- Can't argue.
- Do we even have the same mama?
Is anybody hearing me?
I got a little idea.
If I kill you, then Jim,
I'm gonna have no argument.
Pinkerton, it's been eight months.
I see holdups and I see robberies.
I don't see men on nooses.
The James gang's encounters have been with local law.
They're no match for the gang.
- What about your detectives?
- Listen, you! Shut up.
I have to hunt this man.
I have to get inside this man's mind.
I have to anticipate him.
And that takes time.
Time, time, time.
Oh, I can't believe this.
Would you believe there are towns...
...where the James gang walks openly, as heroes?
- Now, how can that be?
- Because they are charitable.
Give money to churches, to farmers.
They gave Maddox sharecroppers enough money to build a school.
- That's my money!
- We should burn that school down.
That's the way to win them back to our side.
Pinkerton, hundreds of men have died to build this railroad.
But they did their jobs.
Now, this Jesse James, that's your job.
Do your job.
Then you let me do my job...
...as I see fit, without interference.
- What can you tell me?
- It's going to be a long spring.
If people would hand it over and not shoot, there'd be less killing.
- What's that?
- It's my lucky rabbit's foot.
- Took it off that dead fella.
- That one's not working.
What?
Can I have your autograph?
Take this to the West.
Grogan, you take this.
Take these towns.
- You remind me of...
- I can't write this.
Your blue-green eyes remind me...
...of the land and the sky.
- That's it.
You might want to change that to
"I thought of you."
Look, just write the whole thing yourself.
I think we know how this is gonna go.
One false move and I'll blow your head off!
- Bob?
- You heard me, Jesse!
You know how crazy I get! Crazy!
- Bob.
- We got a problem, little brother?
Frankly, yeah.
- I'm feeling a little left out.
- It's the wanted posters, right?
Yeah. Obviously, someone's not standing out in people's minds.
Gents, we're in the middle of something.
- Bob's upset.
- The posters?
- Yeah.
- Don't say "yeah" in that tone.
- This is important!
- Okay.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control.
Yeah, Bob here will kill a man for sneezing.
- He's our best shot.
- Better than you, Jesse?
Bob Younger taught me how to shoot.
Now...
...how about we get back to the robbery?
- Of course.
- That means now, mister!
Now.
- That's it, no more bets.
- One more time. Come on, talk to me!
Talk to me, one more time!
Pretty please!
- Damn, Loni, you're lucky.
- Luckiest man in the West...
...now that I'm riding with Jesse James!
- You okay, Jesse?
- Drinking whiskey? You're too young.
Not too young to shoot a man, not too young to drink whiskey.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Tonight? I was just getting ready to go turn on that Younger charm.
Not exactly.
- Been with a girl ever?
- Yeah, I've been with a girl!
I didn't want to get one of them paid ladies. You know what I mean?
I think so.
You and Frank, Cole, even Bob...
...you get girls because you're handsome and famous.
They look at me like
I'm your baby brother.
- But don't tell nobody.
- No, I swear. Not a word.
- You okay?
- Tell you what...
...I can't drink good neither.
- I'm gonna go outside and throw up.
- You do that. Hurry.
- Hey, Loni.
- Oh, yeah.
Let's go, sugar-britches.
Just call me Lucky Loni Packwood.
- The new rail route is complete, sir.
- Parker?
- Yes, sir?
- What's that?
That, sir?
Jenkins will explain that.
- Sir.
- Jenkins.
Yes, well, we have done a financial study...
...of the construction costs...
- Jenkins!
It's cheaper to go around
Jesse James, sir.
Even with the detours and the extra track...
...it's just cheaper.
So you're telling me that
Jesse James has won?
Oh, no.
No, no, no. See, every three months the James gang...
...circles back to
Liberty, Missouri...
...and they pull a job beforehand.
- So?
There's only four banks within that radius they've not robbed.
- Could you put men at all four?
- Don't have to.
I have a better tool at my disposal for narrowing it down to one.
- What's that?
- An intense hatred of you.
Jesse.
Things a fella's gotta do to get some respect.
- You deserve it, Bob. It's about time.
- Thank you.
Listen, Jesse, we got a problem.
It's Cole.
- He's been full of vinegar lately.
- He's planning a job.
- He's what?
- I don't wanna start trouble.
- Tell me.
- Cole, are you sure?
- It'll be the biggest score yet.
- What will be?
Hyperion Bank, two days' ride.
- Got $100,000 in railroad money.
- That's all there? Don't sound right.
- Lf you read it first, you'd be fine.
- What are you saying?
I've robbed as many banks as you.
I know this bank. It's an easy job.
- You're forgetting who's in charge!
- Jesse.
You're in charge? Huh?
We ain't partners no more, Jesse?
You tell Cole Younger when and where to ride?
- He didn't mean that.
- Siding against me?
Being with me is being against you?
We don't wanna do that.
None of us idiots wanna go against
Jesse James, the greatest outlaw ever!
Paper says without you, we wouldn't find a goat's ass with a stick!
- You've been full of yourself lately.
- You think so?
You all do?
Frank?
- One of us gets an idea...
- A bad idea!
- I got us through the war.
- And nearly got hanged.
- That's it!
- Cole!
Boys, we don't want this!
- I'm a better soldier!
- I'm a better outlaw.
You both hate the railroad!
Do it, and Rains never comes west again!
- What?
- It's his money!
He's paying out of his own fortune!
You wanna hurt him?
- Put your guns down!
- I still don't like it!
- Let me run the show, General Lee!
- Jesse.
Jesse!
You want it?
All right.
We hit this bank.
You'll be smiling once you got that money in your pocket.
Cole Younger's gonna make everyone rich!
Hands in the air!
We're robbing this bank.
Do what you're told, nobody dies.
Hands up!
Oh, no.
Down!
- Which one should I shoot first?
- None.
Jesse, you all right?
Head for the end of the street!
- Look!
- Damn.
Son of a bitch!
Move, go on!
- Dozen out back.
- They gonna rush us?
They're insurance, in case we run.
Get inside! Get inside! Get in!
Any ideas, little brother?
Oh, Lord.
Oh, Lord.
Oh, shit! Let's get!
Fire!
Damn!
Go, boys! Come on!
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on, boys!
Come on!
Jimmy!
Easy. Easy.
Rest here.
Get some bandages and whiskey.
- Too young for whiskey.
- We'll make an exception.
Hey, little brother.
I'm sorry.
All right, Jim? I'm sorry.
It was the best time of my life.
I was famous, you know?
Yeah.
- He was just a kid.
- He was old enough.
A boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West.
How could he say no to that?
Railroad burned him out too.
You couldn't stop him.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
A war against the railroad.
What the hell was I thinking?
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
- I'm out.
- You're out?
Blood gets spilled, you're just gonna quit?
Who's next, Cole?
You? Me? Bob?
- Can't go back, Jesse.
- I ain't telling you what to do.
Keep riding with Cole, that's fine by me.
Frank?
Get the hell out of here, then.
Don't come back when you find you can't farm with a six-gun!
Jesse.
What are you thinking?
There are lawmen all over.
I had to see you.
I'm getting married.
I don't understand.
The most wonderful woman in the world.
I can't stop thinking about her.
Zee, I've quit my outlaw ways.
Come live in my home, and in my heart.
Be my wife.
Is that a yes?
I never would've imagined us here.
That's why I picked it.
We can start a new life here.
Will you be happy in Florida, without the excitement?
I've got you.
You keep me busy.
We can go to the hotel, check in...
...then do something I've wanted to do for a long time.
Wait a minute. Certain things wait until after the wedding.
Driver, change of plans.
Take us to the nearest church.
"Jesse Woodson James."
Jesse James.
The Jesse James?
I could lie, but I want this marriage to be legal.
I'm starting a new life so I'm depending on your...
- Discretion?
- Discretion.
- Sir, I'm a man of the cloth...
- Well, thank you.
...who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Of course.
Now let's have a drink.
- In the church?
- Communion!
Have a good day.
Hands in the air!
This is a robbery! Move!
The safe, now!
Of course!
- Sir?
- What?
Where's Jesse James?
This here is the Younger gang!
Understand?
But the Youngers ride with Jesse James.
You wanna die?
Did ride. No more.
You understand?
- The safe, now! All right?
- All right.
Jesse James never went around yelling.
This is the best score yet!
Taking too long.
People used to snap to.
Well, that was because of J...
The gang's reputation.
If people think Jesse's riding, we won't get respect.
We're outlaws.
Not exactly the most respectable job.
Bob, leave me alone.
All right? Go on.
What?
"The life of the James gang wasn't all killing.
These young bucks had a taste for the ladies...
...especially the handsome, charismatic Jesse James."
Beg your pardon?
"Blazing Guns of the West.
True Stories of Jesse James."
- Only a dime in the hotel.
- Let me see.
I'm not finished.
"When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling...
...Ladies flocked to him like flies to a candied apple."
As I said, hmm.
Now, sweetie...
...you don't believe them silly dime novels, do you?
Swimming.
Swimming is good.
Don't turn around.
What?
If you don't see it, then it's not real.
Jesse James!
You're under arrest!
They arrested Jesse!
- What have you done?
- What's that, Bob?
What have you done, Cole?
- I ain't done nothing, Bob.
- Swear.
Swear on Jimmy's grave.
Bob, you know Cole would never do such a thing.
He and Jesse are best friends.
Cousins. Blood brothers.
Bob.
I'm sorry, Cole.
- We're moving you tomorrow.
- But I like the presidential suite.
You'll get a similar room, but the hotel's in Washington, D.C.
You won't get a fair trial here, with a jury of James sympathizers.
- So I get a jury bought off by Rains?
- That's it.
- Did you order our houses burned down?
- Not that day.
I'm guilty of many things...
...but that was Mr. Thaddeus Rains and Parker.
- This was you, by the way.
- You almost ended my career.
Pity.
We're gonna hang you, you know.
Yeah, I figured.
Was it worth it?
- I should've killed Rains.
- That's what I'd have done.
Well, I'm not hanged yet.
You cocky little bastard!
Oh, you'll miss me.
No. I'll hang you.
But I may miss you a little bit.
Come on, you!
So this is he.
I remember you.
You're Parker. I remember you too.
- You killed my ma.
- How did you know?
Not such a menace now, is he?
Well, I could always take off his irons.
You cost me millions and months of delays in construction.
I wish I could hang you every morning for a century.
How do you like that?
My father had it made when he started this railroad.
I'll give it to my son, and he'll give it to his son.
The right sort of men will always run this country. Not your sort.
You'll always suffer.
And you haven't changed anything.
I made you think twice about burning homes down.
- We'll speak in Washington.
- You're on the same train?
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna have to pay you a visit.
- Big words.
- It's a promise.
Get him on board.
Open up!
- Hook him up.
- Come with me, boy.
Take him back.
Now, your guns.
I don't like it.
We can handle him.
In the last 10 seconds, he could've grabbed your gun at least three times!
If he lays a finger on one of your guns...
...you are all, and I mean all, dead men!
He's chained up.
I'll put that on your tombstone.
Your guns!
Give me two good cards.
Everybody, ante up.
Hey, stupid!
Yeah, you!
Glad to see you know your name, you dumb shit!
- What are you saying, boy?
- I recognize you.
How?
You left by the front door as I came in the back.
You shut up now, boy!
Yeah. Your wife said you did that to her too.
Will this shut you up?
I can do this without the gun.
It just makes things easier.
What the hell is that?
Vengeance!
Outside! Get up on the roof!
You stay put, gentlemen.
- Nice shot.
- Thank you.
Now go get my husband!
- There's only four of them!
- Move, you fools! Move!
Come quickly! This way.
Do it!
That was for my ma.
This is for everybody else.
No, they'll set the Army on you!
You and your wife.
That is a nice watch you got there.
Hand it over.
If I can get you today...
...then you damn sure know
I can kill you anytime I want.
Sleep on that for the next 20 years.
Give it to me!
Hands up, now!
Tennessee.
The railroad has no business there.
Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Thank you.
I'd just as soon kill you...
...but chasing you takes up too much of my time.
Fair enough.
Jesse James?
Come on, let's ride!
- Get arrested again, I'll kill you.
- Yes, ma'am.
- I blew up a train.
- You're a hell of a woman.
- Don't swear!
- Yes, ma'am.
- I missed you, cousin.
- I missed you too.
You know...
...when you got caught, they thought
I had something to do with it.
- Never crossed my mind.
- Good.
Things changed when you quit the gang.
- Now I say, "Let's ride."
- He ain't bad at it.
- It's tough.
- Where'd you get the riders?
We didn't. Zerelda did.
She makes a hell of an outlaw.
So, what's the plan, Jesse?
- We're gonna buy a farm.
- Farm?
- Down in Tennessee.
- All right.
Want to ride with the Younger gang for a while?
Bye, boys.
Tom.
- Tennessee, huh?
- Yeah, I think so.
- Meet you there in a couple weeks.
- I'll see you soon.
- Thanks for that distraction.
- Hell, they hardly noticed us.
- Mrs. James?
- Shall we?
Shall we, indeed. Frank. Rangers.
- Tennessee?
- I'll explain on the way.
All right, boys.
Let's ride!
- When were you gonna tell me?
- I did.
Because I asked.
- Damn, am I ever gonna win with you?
- Don't change the subject.
