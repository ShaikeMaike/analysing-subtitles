Men are haunted by the vastness of eternity.
And so we ask ourselves...
... will our actions echo across the centuries?
Will strangers hear our names long after we're gone...
...and wonder who we were...
...how bravely we fought...
...how fiercely we loved?
Good day for the crows.
Remove your army from my land.
I like your land.
I think we'll stay. I like your soldiers too.
They won't fight for you.
That's what the Messenians said.
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.
Now they all fight for me.
You can't have the whole world,
Agamemnon.
It's too big, even for you.
I don't want to watch another massacre.
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.
And if my man wins?
We'll leave Thessaly for good.
Boagrius!
Achilles!
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.
Careful who you insult, old king.
My king, Achilles is not with the army.
-Where is he?
-I sent a boy to look for him.
I was having a good dream.
Very good dream.
King Agamemnon sent me.
He needs to--
I'll speak to your king in the morning.
But my lord, it is morning.
They're waiting for you.
Are the stories about you true?
They say your mother is an immortal goddess.
They say you can't be killed.
I wouldn't be bothering with the shield then, would I?
The Thessalonian you're fighting. . .
. . .he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.
That's why no one will remember your name.
Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow, when you're better rested.
I should have you whipped for your impudence!
Perhaps you should fight him.
Achilles.
Achilles.
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.
You can end this war with a swing of your sword.
Let them go home to their wives.
Imagine a king who fights his own battles. Wouldn't that be a sight.
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.
Is there no one else?
Is there no one else?
Who are you, soldier?
Achilles. Son of Peleus.
Achilles?
I'll remember the name.
The ruler of Thessaly carries this scepter.
Give it to your king.
He's not my king.
Brothers in arms!
-Friendship!
-Friendship!
Princes of Troy, on our last night together. . .
. . .Queen Helen and I salute you.
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.
We fought many battles,
Sparta and Troy. And fought well!
But I have always respected your father.
Priam is a good king, a good man.
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.
Hector, Paris, young princes, come. Stand.
Drink with me.
Let us drink to peace.
To peace between Troy and Sparta.
May the gods keep the wolves in the hills and the women in our beds.
-For the gods.
-For the gods.
You shouldn't be here.
That's what you said last night.
Last night was a mistake.
And the night before?
I've made many mistakes this week.
Do you want me to go?
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.
They're beautiful.
But I can't wear them.
Menelaus would kill us both.
Don't be afraid of him.
I'm not afraid of dying.
I'm afraid of tomorrow.
I'm afraid of watching you sail away and knowing you'll never come back.
Before you came to Sparta,
I was a ghost.
I walked, and I ate, and I swam in the sea. . .
. . .but I was just a ghost.
You don't have to fear tomorrow.
Come with me.
Don't play with me. Don't play.
If you come, we'll never be safe.
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.
But I'll love you.
Till the day they burn my body. . .
. . .I will love you.
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.
Sometimes the gods bless you in the morning and curse you in the afternoon.
Drop sail!
Do you love me, brother?
Would you protect me against any enemy?
The last time you spoke to me like this. . .
. . .you were 10 years old, and you'd just stolen Father's horse.
What have you done now?
I must show you something.
Where is she?
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!
My king!
She left.
With the Trojans.
The fisherman here saw her board their ship.
The Trojans?
With the young prince, Paris. She. . . .
Get my ship ready.
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.
High on the sail!
-Wait, wait.
-You fool!
-Listen to me.
-Do you know what you've done?
Do you know how many years our father worked for peace?
I love her.
It's all a game to you, isn't it?
You roam from town to town, bedding merchants' wives and temple maids.
You think you know something about love.
What about your father's love?
You spat on him when you brought her on this ship!
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?
I won't let you start a war for her.
May I speak?
What you're saying is true. I've wronged you. I've wronged our father.
If you want to take Helen back to Sparta, so be it.
But I go with her.
To Sparta? They'll kill you.
Then I'll die fighting.
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you, doesn't it? To die fighting.
-Little brother, have you ever killed a man?
-No.
-Ever seen a man die in combat?
-No.
I've killed men, and I've heard them dying. And I've watched them dying.
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.
And you know nothing about love!
All the same, I go with her.
I won't ask you to fight my war.
You already have.
To Troy!
About ship! Set sail!
-I want her back.
-Well, of course you do.
She's a beautiful woman.
I want her back so I can kill her with my own two hands.
I won't rest till I've burned Troy to the ground.
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.
I should have listened to you.
Peace is for the women. . .
. . .and the weak.
Empires are forged by war.
All my life, I've stood by your side, fought your enemies.
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?
Never. You're a man of honor.
Will you go to war with me, brother?
I always thought my brother's wife was a foolish woman. . .
. . .but she's proved to be very useful.
The Trojans have never been conquered.
Some say they can't be conquered.
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable behind his high walls.
He thinks the sun god will protect him.
But the gods protect only. . .
. . .the strong!
If Troy falls. . .
. . .I control the Aegean.
Hector commands the finest army in the east.
I'll attack them with the greatest force the world has ever seen.
I want all the kings of Greece and their armies.
Send emissaries in the morning.
One last thing.
We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.
Achilles.
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.
We don't need to control him, we need to unleash him.
That man was born to end lives.
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.
Before me, Greece was nothing.
I brought all the
Greek kingdoms together.
I created a nation out of fire worshipers and snake eaters!
I build the future, Nestor. Me!
Achilles is the past.
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.
How many battles have we won off the edge of his sword?
This will be the greatest war the world has ever seen.
We need the greatest warrior.
There's only one man he'll listen to.
Never hesitate.
Nervous?
Petrified.
You told me never to change sword hands.
Yes. When you know how to use it, you won't be taking my orders.
Your reputation for hospitality is fast becoming legend.
Patroclus, my cousin.
Odysseus, king of lthaca.
Patroclus. I knew your parents well.
I miss them.
Now you have this one watching over you, eh?
Learning from Achilles himself.
Kings would kill for the honor.
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?
We need to talk.
I will not fight for him.
I'm not asking you to fight for him.
I'm asking you to fight for the Greeks.
Are the Greeks tired of fighting each other?
-For now.
-The Trojans never harmed me.
They insulted Greece.
They insulted a man who couldn't hold on to his wife. Is that my business?
Your business is war, my friend.
Is it? The man has no honor.
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.
And let the gods decide which man to glorify.
-For the Greeks!
-Forget Agamemnon.
Fight for me.
My wife will feel much better if she knows you're by my side.
I'll feel much better.
We're sending the largest fleet that ever sailed.
A thousand ships.
Prince Hector.
Is he as good a warrior as they say?
The best of all the Trojans.
Some say he's better than all the Greeks too.
Even if your cousin doesn't come. . .
. . .I hope you'll join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.
Play your tricks on me, but not my cousin.
You have your swords. I have my tricks.
We play with the toys the gods give us.
We sail for Troy in three days.
This war will never be forgotten.
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.
I knew they would come for you.
Long before you were born. . .
. . .I knew they would come.
They want you to fight in Troy.
I'm making you another seashell necklace.
Like the ones I made you when you were a boy.
Do you remember?
Mother. . .
. . .tonight, I decide.
If you stay in LÃ¡risa. . .
. . .you will find peace.
You will find a wonderful woman.
You will have sons and daughters, and they will have children.
And they will love you.
When you are gone, they will remember you.
But when your children are dead and their children after them. . .
. . .your name will be lost.
If you go to Troy. . .
. . .glory will be yours.
They will write stories about your victories for thousands of years.
The world will remember your name.
But if you go to Troy. . .
. . .you will never come home.
For your glory walks hand in hand with your doom.
And I shall never see you again.
-My son.
-Father.
Paris.
Father.
-This is Helen.
-Helen?
Helen of Sparta?
Helen of Troy.
I've heard rumors of your beauty.
For once. . .
. . .the gossips were right.
Welcome.
Come, you must be tired.
Look.
He's grown.
He is strong.
-Briseis!
-Paris!
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows with each new moon.
Briseis.
A servant of Apollo now.
The young men of Troy were devastated when Briseis chose the virgin robes.
Father. . .
. . .I know this is the last thing we need.
It is the will of the gods.
Everything is in their hands.
-But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
-lf I'd let him fight Menelaus for her. . .
. . .you'd be burning a son's body, not welcoming a daughter.
We could send peace envoys to Menelaus.
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.
What would you have me do?
Put her on a ship and send her home.
Women have always loved Paris, and he has loved them back.
But this is different.
Something has changed in him.
If we send her home to Menelaus, he will follow her.
This is my country, and these are my countrymen.
I don't want to see them suffer so my brother can have his prize.
It's not just the Spartans coming after her.
By now, Menelaus has gone to Agamemnon.
And Agamemnon has wanted to destroy us for years.
Enemies have been attacking us for centuries. Our walls still stand.
Father, we can't win this war.
Apollo watches over us.
Even Agamemnon is no match for the gods.
And how many battalions does the sun god command?
Do not mock the gods.
They're coming for me.
The wind is bringing them closer.
What if we left?
Tonight. Right now.
What if we went down to the stables, took two horses and left?
Ride east, keep riding.
-And go where?
-Away from here.
I could hunt deer, rabbit. I could feed us.
But this is your home.
You left your home for me.
Sparta was never my home.
My parents sent my there when I was 16 to marry Menelaus.
But it was never my home.
We'll live off the land.
No more palaces for us. No more servants. We don't need any of that.
And your family?
We'd be protecting my family. If we're not here, what's the need for war?
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.
You don't know Menelaus.
You don't know his brother.
They'll burn every house in Troy to find us.
They'll never believe we've left.
And even if they do, they'll burn it for spite.
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.
I'll walk right up to him and tell him you're mine.
You're very young, my love.
Look at that.
Take up your positions!
My lord?
Should we wait for the others?
-They brought us here for war.
-Yes, but Agamemnon's orders--
You fight for me, Eudorus, or Agamemnon?
For you, my lord.
Then fight for me. And let the servants of Agamemnon fight for him.
Black sail.
It's Achilles.
What's the fool doing?
He's going to take the beach of Troy with 50 men?
Make way there! Make way!
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?
-Waiting at the city gates.
-Good. I'll be right there.
Lysander, how long before the army is ready?
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them--
-How long?
-Noon.
Make it sooner.
Patroclus!
Put down your spear.
-I'm fighting the Trojans.
-Not today.
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.
Look at these men.
They are the fiercest soldiers in all of Greece. Each of them has bled for me.
-Guard the ship.
-But this is a war.
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans if I'm concerned for you. Guard the ship.
Trojans!
All my life, I've lived by a code.
And the code is simple:
Honor the gods, love your woman. . .
. . .and defend your country.
Troy is mother to us all.
Fight for her!
Myrmidons. . .
. . .my brothers of the sword.
I'd rather fight beside you than any army of thousands.
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!
Do you know what's there, waiting, beyond that beach? lmmortality! Take it! It's yours!
Fight positions!
Archers!
Forward!
The man wants to die.
On my command!
Break off! Break off!
Look at him.
Look.
Row, you lazy whores, row!
Greeks are dying! Row!
Those men down there need help. Now!
Tecton, with me.
Flank! To the flank!
Achilles! Achilles!
Back to the city! Back to the city!
The sun god is a patron of Troy, our enemy.
Take whatever treasure you can find.
With your permission, my lord.
-Speak.
-Apollo sees everything.
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.
Warn the men.
Wait.
You are very brave or very stupid to come after me alone.
You must be Hector.
Do you know who I am?
These priests weren't armed.
Fight me!
Why kill you now, prince of Troy. . .
. . .with no one here to see you fall?
Why did you come here?
They'll be talking about this war for 1000 years.
In 1000 years, the dust from our bones will be gone.
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.
Go home, prince. Drink some wine, make love to your wife.
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.
You speak of war as if it's a game.
How many wives wait at Troy's gates for husbands they'll never see again?
Your brother can comfort them.
I hear he's good at charming other men's wives.
My lord, you let him go?
It's too early in the day for killing princes.
Achilles! Achilles!
-Achilles.
-Ajax.
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.
As am I.
If you sailed slower, the war would be over.
I'll miss the start as long as I'm here at the end.
I've got something to show you.
The men found her hiding in the temple.
They thought she'd. . .
. . .amuse you.
What's your name?
Did you not hear me?
You killed Apollo's priests.
I've killed men in five countries, never a priest.
Well, then your men did.
The sun god will have his vengeance.
What's he waiting for?
The right time to strike.
His priests are dead, and his acolyte's a captive.
-I think your god is afraid of me.
-Afraid?
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.
-Where is he?
-You're nothing but a killer!
You wouldn't know anything about the gods.
I know more about the gods than your priests.
I've seen them.
You're royalty, aren't you?
Spent years talking down to men.
You must be royalty.
What's your name?
Even the servants of Apollo have names.
Briseis.
Are you afraid, Briseis?
Should I be?
My lord.
Agamemnon requests your presence.
The kings are gathering to celebrate the victory.
You fought well today.
My lord.
What do you want here in Troy?
You didn't come for the Spartan queen.
I want what all men want.
I just want it more.
You don't need to fear me, girl.
You're the only Trojan who can say that.
You have won a great victory, my king of kings.
No one thought the Trojan beach could be captured so easily.
A beautiful gift, Triopas.
You will be among the first to walk in the streets of Troy tomorrow.
My father, Neleus, had this urn made to commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.
I present it to you. . .
. . .in honor of an even more memorable victory.
Thank you, old friend.
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper in the gardens of Troy.
Leave us.
War is young men dying and old men talking. You know this.
Ignore the politics.
Apparently, you won some great victory.
Perhaps you didn't notice. The Trojan beach belonged to Priam in the morning.
It belongs to Agamemnon in the afternoon.
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.
No.
You came here because you want your name to last through the ages.
A great victory was won today.
But that victory is not yours.
Kings did not kneel to Achilles.
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.
Perhaps the kings were too far behind to see. Soldiers won the battle.
History remembers kings!
Not soldiers.
Tomorrow, we'll batter down the gates of Troy.
I'll build monuments on every island of Greece.
I'll carve " Agamemnon" in the stone.
Be careful, king of kings.
First, you need the victory.
Your men sacked the temple of Apollo, yes?
You want gold? Take it.
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.
I already have.
Aphareus!
Haemon!
The spoils of war.
No argument wit you, but if you don't release her, you'll never see home again.
-Decide.
-Guards!
Stop!
Too many men have died today.
If killing is your only talent, that's your curse.
I don't want anyone dying for me.
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl.
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.
And then. . .
-. . .who knows?
-You sack of wine!
Before my time is done, I will look down on your corpse and smile.
If they want a war, we will give them a war.
I would match the best of Troy against the best of Greece any day.
The best of Greece outnumber the best of Troy two to one.
Glaucus.
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?
Our walls have never been breached.
We have the finest archers in the world.
And we have Hector.
Yes, we can win.
I spoke to two farmers today.
They saw an eagle flying with a serpent clutched in its talons.
This is a sign from Apollo.
We will win a great victory tomorrow.
Bird signs.
You want to plan a strategy based on bird signs.
Hector, show respect.
The high priest is a servant of the gods.
And I am a servant of Troy.
I've always honored the gods, Father.
But today I fought a Greek who desecrated the statue of Apollo.
Apollo didn't strike the man down.
The gods won't fight this war for us.
There won't be a war.
This is not a conflict of nations.
It is a dispute between two men.
I don't want to see another Trojan die because of me.
Paris.
Tomorrow morning, I will challenge
Menelaus for the right to Helen.
The winner will take her home.
The loser will burn before nightfall.
Father. . .
. . .I'm sorry for the pain
I've caused you.
Do you love her?
You are a great king because you love your country so much.
Every blade of grass.
Every grain of sand.
Every rock in the river.
You love all of Troy.
That is the way I love Helen.
I've fought many wars in my time.
Some were fought for land, some for power, some for glory.
I suppose fighting for love makes more sense than all the rest.
But I won't be the one fighting.
The sword of Troy.
My father carried this sword, and his father before him. . .
. . .all the way back to the founding of Troy.
The history of our people was written with this sword.
Carry it with you tomorrow.
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.
So long as a Trojan carries it. . .
. . .our people have a future.
The man who killed Tecton outside Apollo's temple. . .
. . .I've never seen a spear thrown like that.
An impossible throw.
Don't go tomorrow.
-Please don't go.
-Paris fights tomorrow, not me.
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross the sea to watch your brother fight.
You know this.
You'd make a fine general, my love.
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.
I want to see the girls chasing after him.
I can't lose you.
I won't survive.
I must see Paris.
Wait.
Wait!
Helen, what are you doing?
-Let me go.
-No.
I saw them burn.
I saw them burning on the pyres.
That's my fault.
It is. You know it is.
All those widows.
I still hear them screaming.
Their husbands died because I'm here.
I'm going down to the ships.
No, you're not.
-I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.
-It's too late for that.
Do you think Agamemnon cares about his brother's marriage?
This is about power. Not love.
Paris is going to fight in the morning.
-Yes.
-Menelaus will kill him.
I won't let that happen.
-It's his decision.
-No.
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.
You're a princess of Troy now. . .
. . .and my brother needs you tonight.
My lord.
My lord, the army is marching.
-Let them march. We stay.
-But the men are ready.
We stay till Agamemnon groans to have Achilles back.
As you wish.
Are you ready to fight?
Are you ready to kill? To take life?
I am.
At night, I see their faces, all the men I've killed.
They're standing there on the far bank of the River Styx.
They're waiting for me.
They say, " Welcome, brother. "
We men are wretched things.
I taught you how to fight, but I never taught you why to fight.
I fight for you.
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?
Soldiers, they fight for kings they've never even met.
They do what they're told, die when they're told to.
Soldiers obey.
Don't waste your life following some fool's orders.
Go.
Are you sure you want to do this?
I started this war.
Helen. . .
. . .sit with me.
Prepare to halt!
Prepare to halt!
Halt!
Move.
I see you're not hiding behind your high walls. Valiant of you.
Ill-advised, but valiant.
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.
We've come too far, Prince Hector.
Prince? What prince?
What son of a king would accept a man's hospitality. . .
. . .eat his food, drink his wine, then steal his wife in the middle of the night?
The sun was shining when your wife left you.
She's up there, watching, isn't she? Good.
I want her to watch you die.
Not yet, brother.
Look around you, Hector.
I brought all the warriors of Greece to your shores.
You can still save Troy, young prince.
I have two wishes.
If you grant them, no more of your people need die.
First, you must give Helen back to my brother.
Second, Troy must submit to my command. . .
. . .to fight for me whenever I call.
You want me to look upon your army and tremble?
Well, I see them.
I see 50,000 men brought here to fight for one man's greed.
Careful, boy.
My mercy has limits.
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.
And I tell you now, no son of Troy will ever submit to a foreign ruler.
Then every son of Troy shall die.
There is another way.
I love Helen. I won't give her up and neither will you.
So let us fight our own battle.
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.
A brave offer, but not enough.
Let me kill this little peacock.
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.
I came for my honor.
His every breath insults me.
Let me kill him. When he's lying in the dust, signal to attack.
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.
So be it.
I accept your challenge. And tonight,
I'll drink to your bones.
-My lord.
-Back to the line!
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.
Brother. . .
. . .if I fall, tell Helen-- Tell her--
I will.
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he--
You think of your sword and his sword and nothing else.
Get up.
Come on.
See the crows?
They never tasted prince before.
Is this what you left me for?!
Fight!
Fight me!
You coward!
Fight me!
We have a pact! Fight!
Fight him, son. Fight him.
-Fight me!
-The Trojans have violated the agreement!
Prepare for battle!
This is not honor!
This is not worthy of royalty!
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.
The fight is over.
The fight is not over.
Stand back, Prince Hector.
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.
He is my brother.
Paris!
Go!
Get inside, Paris!
Archers!
-Our men are too close to the walls.
-Pull back, you fool!
For Troy!
-Now!
-Loose!
Get them in line!
Get the men back into lines!
Front line, push!
Forward.
Forward!
Forward!
Apollonians! Now!
Prince Hector!
We need to retreat!
My army's never lost a battle yet!
You won't have an army if you don't fall back!
Back to the ships!
-Back to the ships!
-Retreat!
-Back!
-Retreat!
Go back!
Back. Back to the ships!
Fall back!
-Men, fall back!
-Halt!
Halt!
But we have them on the run!
We're in range of their archers.
Have our men gather our fallen.
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.
Would they have done the same for us?
Go! Back!
Fall back into line!
You think I'm a coward.
I am a coward.
I knew he would kill me.
You were watching.
My father.
My brother.
All of Troy. Shame didn't matter.
I gave up my pride. . .
. . .my honor. . .
. . .just to live.
For love.
You challenged a great warrior.
That took courage.
I betrayed you.
Menelaus was a brave man.
He lived for fighting.
And every day I was with him, I wanted to walk into the sea and drown.
I don't want a hero, my love.
I want a man I can grow old with.
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!
They think I'll sail home at first light.
Maybe we should.
Flee? Like a whipped dog?
The men believe we came here for Menelaus' wife.
Won't be needing her anymore.
My brother's blood still wets the sand, and you insult him!
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.
The Trojans can beat us so easily.
How long before the Hittites invade?
If we stay, we stay here for the right reasons.
To protect Greece, not your pride.
Your private battle with Achilles is destroying us.
Achilles is one man.
Hector is one man.
Look what he did to us today.
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.
He's right.
The men's morale is weak.
Even if I could make peace with Achilles, the man won't listen to me!
He's as likely to spear me as to speak to me!
I'll talk to him.
He'll want the girl back.
He can have that damn girl.
I haven't touched her.
Where is she?
I gave her to the men.
They need some amusement after today.
Come on, give the bitch to me!
Who's first?
Trojan whore!
What's this? A virgin's robe?
-You won't be needing that much longer!
-Hold her.
Better to be a Spartan slave than a Trojan--
Achilles!
Are you hurt?
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.
To fight back when people attack me?
Dog has that kind of courage.
Eat.
I've known men like you my whole life.
No, you haven't.
You think you're so different from 1000 others?
Soldiers understand nothing but war.
Peace confuses them.
-And you hate these soldiers.
-I pity them.
Trojan soldiers died trying to protect you.
Perhaps they deserve more than your pity.
Why did you choose this life?
-What life?
-To be a great warrior.
I chose nothing. I was born, and this is what I am.
And you? Why did you choose to love a god?
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.
Do you enjoy provoking me?
You've dedicated your life to the gods.
Zeus, god of thunder. Athena, goddess of wisdom. You serve them.
-Yes, of course.
-And Ares, god of war?
Who blankets his bed with the skin of men he's killed?
All the gods are to be feared and respected.
I'll tell you a secret. . .
. . .something they don't teach you in your temple.
The gods envy us.
They envy us because we're mortal.
Because any moment might be our last.
Everything's more beautiful because we're doomed.
You will never be lovelier than you are now.
We will never be here again.
I thought you were a dumb brute.
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.
Do it.
Nothing is easier.
Aren't you afraid?
Everyone dies. Today or 50 years from now. What does it matter?
Do it.
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.
Many.
My lord, there's--
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.
Gather the stores.
Agamemnon is a proud man.
But he knows when he's made a mistake.
The man sends you to make his apologies?
What are you doing enthralled to that pig of a king?
The world seems simple to you, my friend. . .
. . .but when you're a king, very few choices are simple.
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy like Agamemnon.
Are we supposed to fear him?
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem. Fear is useful.
We need you back.
Greece needs you.
Greece got along fine before I was born.
Greece will be Greece long after I'm dead.
I'm not talking about the land.
The men need you.
Stay, Achilles.
You were born for this war.
Things are less simple today.
Women have a way of complicating things.
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.
But in this war, you're a servant.
Sometimes you have to serve in order to lead.
I hope you understand that one day.
We're going home?
We sail in the morning.
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.
If it's fighting you still long for, there will always be another war.
These are our countrymen.
You betray all of Greece just to see Agamemnon fall.
Someone has to lose.
The gods favor our cause.
Now is the time to destroy the Greek army.
Their morale is battered.
Hit them now. Hit them hard.
And they will run.
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.
There must be dissension among the Greeks.
But if we attack their ships, we will unify them.
If they decide to attack us, let them.
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.
Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us.
We should not return the favor.
You're confident about the meaning of these omens?
The desecration of his temple angers Apollo.
The gods have cursed the Greeks.
Prepare the army.
We attack at daybreak.
Am I still your captive?
You're my guest.
In Troy, guests can leave whenever they want.
You should leave then.
Would you leave this all behind?
Would you leave Troy?
Hold those barricades!
Archers to the rear.
Achilles.
Achilles.
Now!
Forward!
Enough for one day.
Yes.
Back to the ships!
Back to the ships!
It was his cousin.
To Troy!
-Back to the city!
-Back to the city!
To Troy!
We were going to sail home today.
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.
Achilles.
You violated my command.
No, my lord. There was a mistake.
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.
You led them into combat.
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.
Where's Patroclus?
Patroclus!
We thought he was you, my lord.
He wore your armor, your shield, your greaves, your helmet.
He even moved like you.
Where is he?
-Where?
-He's dead, my lord.
Hector cut his throat.
Don't!
Where are you taking me?
Do you remember how to get here?
Yes.
The next time you come here, follow the tunnel.
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.
When you get to the end, you'll be by the river.
Follow the river until you get to Mount Ida.
Why are you telling me this?
-lf I die. . .
-No.
. . .I don't know how long the city will stand.
If the Greeks get inside the walls, it's over.
They'll kill all the men, throw the babies from the city walls.
-Please.
-The women, they'll take as slaves.
-That, for you, will be worse than dying.
-Why are you saying such things?
Because I want you to be ready.
I want you to get our boy, and I want you to bring him here.
You save as many people as you can, but you get here. And you run.
I killed a boy today.
And he was young.
He was much too young.
That boy has just saved this war for us.
-Eudorus.
-My lord.
I need my armor.
No.
Don't go!
Rope!
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.
Please.
No.
Hector!
Hector!
Hector!
Hector!
Father. . .
. . .forgive me for any offenses.
I've served you as best as I could.
Hector!
May the gods be with you.
Hector.
No father ever had a better son.
Hector!
Apollo guard you, my prince.
You're the best man I know.
You're a prince of Troy.
I know you'll make me proud.
Hector!
Remember what I told you.
You don't have to go. You don't.
You remember what I told you.
Hector!
Hector!
I've seen this moment in my dreams.
I'll make a pact with you.
With the gods as our witnesses. . .
. . .let us pledge that the winner will allow the loser all the proper funeral rituals.
There are no pacts between lions and men.
Now you know who you're fighting.
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.
And I wish it had been you. But I gave the dead boy the honor he deserved.
You gave him the honor of your sword.
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.
You'll wander the underworld, blind, deaf, and dumb, and all the dead will know:
This is Hector, the fool who thought he killed Achilles.
Get up, prince of Troy.
Get up. I won't let a stone take my glory.
You lost your cousin.
Now you've taken mine.
When does it end?
It never ends.
Who are you?
I have endured what no one on earth has endured before.
I kissed the hands of the man who killed my son.
Priam?
How did you get in here?
I know my own country better than the Greeks, I think.
You're a brave man.
I could have your head on a spit in the blink of an eye.
Do you really think death frightens me now?
I watched my eldest son die. . .
. . .watched you drag his body behind your chariot.
Give him back to me.
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.
Give him to me.
He killed my cousin.
He thought it was you.
How many cousins have you killed?
How many sons and fathers and brothers and husbands?
How many, brave Achilles?
I knew your father.
He died before his time.
But he was lucky not to live long enough to see his son fall.
You have taken everything from me.
My eldest son. . .
. . .heir to my throne. . .
. . .defender of my kingdom.
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.
But give me this small mercy.
I loved my boy from the moment he opened his eyes. . .
. . .till the moment you closed them.
Let me wash his body.
Let me say the prayers.
Let me place two coins on his eyes for the boatman.
If I let you walk out of here. . .
. . .if I let you take him. . .
. . .it doesn't change anything.
You're still my enemy in the morning.
You're still my enemy tonight.
But even enemies can show respect.
I admire your courage.
Meet me outside in a moment.
We'll meet again soon, my brother.
Your son was the best I've fought.
In my country, the funeral games last for 12 days.
It is the same in my country.
Then the prince will have that honor.
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.
Briseis?
I thought you were dead.
You are free.
If I hurt you. . .
. . .it's not what I wanted.
Go.
No one will stop you.
You have my word.
Come, my girl.
You're a far better king than the one leading this army.
Achilles makes a secret pact, and I have to honor it? What treason is this?
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.
Peace!
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.
This is the time to attack!
Even with Hector gone, we have no way to breach their walls.
I will smash their walls to the ground. . .
. . .if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.
Hear me, Zeus!
I will smash their walls to the ground.
That's good.
For my son back home.
Well, Odysseus.
You found a way to make the sheep invite the wolves to dinner.
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.
You've been a loyal friend all your life.
I hope I never disappoint you again.
It's I who have been the disappointment.
Rouse the men.
You're taking them home.
Aren't you coming with us?
I have my own battle to fight.
Let me march beside you.
No. I don't want our men to be a part of this.
It's a beautiful night.
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.
Fighting for you has been my life's honor, my lord.
Open the gates!
Here.
Plague.
Don't go too close, my king.
This is the will of the gods.
They desecrated the temple of Apollo. . .
. . .and Apollo desecrated their flesh.
They thought they could come here and sack our city in a day.
Now look at them, fleeing across the Aegean.
What is this?
An offering to Poseidon. The Greeks are praying for a safe return home.
This is a gift. We should take it to the temple of Poseidon.
-I think we should burn it.
-Burn it?
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.
Father, burn it.
Look at them.
You'd think their prince had never died.
You are the prince now.
Make your brother proud.
Briseis. Where is she?
-Where?
-I don't know.
Please. I have a son.
Then get him out of Troy.
Briseis!
Paris! Andromache!
Helen. We must go.
-Where?
-I'll show you. Now. Hurry.
Paris.
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.
Briseis!
Paris!
Let it burn!
Let Troy burn!
Burn it! Burn it all!
Burn Troy!
Burn Troy!
It's a long way. Quick.
-Come.
-I stay.
-No.
-My father will never abandon the city.
I can't leave him.
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.
-What's your name?
-Aeneas.
-Do you know how to use a sword?
-Yes.
The sword of Troy.
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan, our people have a future.
Protect them, Aeneas.
Find them a new home.
-I will.
-Hurry.
Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.
I'll find her.
Go.
-I'll stay with you.
-Go.
Please don't leave me.
How could you love me if I ran now?
We will be together again, in this world or the next. We will be together.
Go.
To the gate!
Soldiers of Troy. . .
. . .you men are warriors!
To lead you has been my honor!
My prince!
The boatman waits for us.
I say we make him wait a little longer!
Paris!
Paris!
Have you no honor?
Have you no honor?
Too late for prayer, priestess.
I almost lost this war because of your little romance.
You'll be my slave in Mycenae.
A Trojan priestess scrubbing my floors.
And at night. . . .
Get up!
Hold her.
Come with me.
No!
Paris!
No!
Stop! Please!
Paris! Don't!
It's all right.
It's all right.
You gave me peace. . .
. . .in a lifetime of war.
Briseis, come.
Go.
You must.
No.
Troy is falling.
Go.
We must go. I know a way out.
It's all right.
Go.
Briseis, come.
Go.
Find peace. . .
. . .my brother.
If they ever tell my story, let them say...
...I walked with giants.
Men rise and fall like the winter wheat...
...but these names will never die.
Let them say I lived in the time of Hector...
... tamer of horses.
Let them say...
...I lived in the time of Achilles.

[ENGLISH]
Welcome, Colonel Lee.
Welcome to my home.
Make yourself comfortable there, colonel.
Allow me to get to the point, sir.
I have been authorized by
President Lincoln himself...
...with the full blessing of the War Department...
...to offer you full command of the Army with the rank of major general.
This Army being raised to quell this rebellion and to preserve the Union.
I assume this Army is to be used to invade those areas...
...to eliminate the rebellion by force.
Yes, sir, the Federal government has been challenged by these rebels...
...who have been most effective in changing the sentiments of state legislatures...
... challenging our Constitution and challenging our central government.
The attack on Fort Sumter cannot be ignored.
General, my home is right there across the Potomac.
Why, you can see Arlington House from your front door.
My family is spread all over this part of Virginia.
If you invade the South, your enemy territory will be right across that river.
Well, sir, there is no great outcry for secession in Virginia.
It's not a foregone conclusion that
Virginia or Tennessee or Arkansas...
... or Kentucky will join the rebellion.
My friend, may I humbly submit that you're mistaken about Virginia.
As you know, the legislature is convening in Richmond this very day...
...to discuss the very issue of secession.
Now, perhaps you know their mind better than they themselves.
And I regret to say the president's hasty calling up of 75, 000 volunteers...
...to subdue the rebellion in the cotton states...
... has done nothing to ameliorate the crisis. It has only deepened it.
I trust you're not being too hasty yourself, colonel.
This is a great opportunity for you to serve your country.
My country, Mr. Blair?
I never thought I'd see the day the president of the United States...
...would raise an army to invade his own country.
No, Mr. Blair, I cannot lead it.
I will not lead it. No.
I'm sorry to hear you say that, sir.
I fear you're making a most dreadful mistake.
Sir, please convey my deep sense of honor and gratitude to the president...
... but I must decline his offer.
Please tell him.
Please be clear. I have never taken my duties lightly...
... but I have no greater duty than to my home, to Virginia.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, if you are going to succeed at this institution ...
...you have one common goal:
To learn your lessons.
If you are placing your energies elsewhere...
...you will not succeed either with me or in your careers as military officers.
I had hoped you'd see that with a proper grasp of the artillery principles...
... I've laid before you today, you would learn to apply...
...these principles with great effectiveness in your field experiences.
But since you seem unable to grasp these principles...
... I'm forced to conclude I must repeat this lesson tomorrow, word for word.
Word for word.
Major, listen to them.
The leaders of our intellectual future...
... screaming for the destruction of our nation!
Sir, President Lincoln is raising the troops.
I will not stay in a place where my students dishonor their country's flag.
Major, I'm leaving for Pennsylvania tomorrow.
War is the sum of all evils.
But if I know myself, all I am and all I have...
... is at the service of my home, my country.
Your country, Thomas?
Your country, my country. It's all one.
All one, Thomas. All one.
So that in the midst of the searching of souls and the gnashing of teeth ...
...the delegates of this convention ...
... harried by the actions of a belligerent usurper and the radicals of his party...
... have stumbled into secession.
Now God knows, I and many in this room have resisted it.
But how could there be union with a section of the country...
...that wants to impose its will through coercion?
Now that Virginia confronts the armed might of the United States...
...we Virginians have determined that not one spot of her sacred soil ...
... be polluted by the foot of an invader.
Now, in the memory of that great
Virginian, George Washington ...
...who was first in the hearts of his countrymen and calling also...
... upon the memory of his own gallant father, General Light-Horse Harry Lee...
...this convention now calls upon
Robert Edward Lee to take command ...
... of the armed forces of the Citizen Army of Virginia.
Mr. President, gentlemen of the convention ...
... I'm profoundly impressed by the solemnity of the occasion ...
...for which I must say
I was not prepared.
I accept the position assigned me by your partiality.
I would have much preferred had your choice fallen on an abler man.
But trusting to Almighty God, an approving conscience...
... and the aid of my fellow citizens...
... I devote myself to the service of my native state...
... in whose behalf alone will I ever again draw my sword.
We must not fear the final result of this war, but many a loved one will fall ...
... and many a heart throb with anguish ...
... before we can breathe the exhilarating atmosphere of freedom ...
... and feel the sweet assurance of safety and peace once more.
There's nothing in this life more dear to me than my children ...
... except perhaps the memory of your wonderful father.
When you go to Richmond, and wherever this war takes you ...
...you must not fear for us.
We will be with you wherever you go.
Surely goodness and mercy have followed me all the days of my life.
Now be on your way, and God be with you.
Y'all be coming on back, you hear?
We'll be back, Martha.
I won't forget to write you, sister.
I know there are a thousand brothers leaving a thousand homes...
... and I know we're not the only ones, Mother.
But I've never felt sadder in my life.
Good morning, major.
This just arrived for you.
Cadet Norris, return to the institute.
My compliments to Colonel Smith.
I will be at his office within the half-hour.
Sir.
"You are ordered to report with the corps of cadets to camp instruction ...
...to begin training and organization of the Provisional Army...
...for the defense of the
Commonwealth of Virginia."
My esposita.
Come, before I leave, we must sit...
... read together, the verse.
Here.
Yes, here. Corinthians--
Second Corinthians, chapter five.
I have been thinking about this verse.
"For we know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved ...
...we have a building of God.
A house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."
O, Almighty God ...
... grant that if it be thy will ...
...thou wilt still avert the threatening danger and bring us peace.
Keep her whom I love in thy protected care.
And bring us all at last to the joy of thy eternal kingdom.
"The Lord is my life. My salvation.
Whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength in my life.
Of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes...
...came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
Though unhost should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear.
The wall should rise up against me.
In this will I be comforted ."
Secession is inexcusable. Southerners and Northerners can still work together.
Slavery will eventually die of natural causes.
But the breakup of the Union will inaugurate wars...
... of a hundred generations in America...
... only to repeat the bloody history of Europe.
As a Christian man, my first allegiance is to God.
Then to my state, the state of Virginia.
Every state has a primal claim to the fealty of her citizens...
... and they justly control their allegiance.
If Virginia adheres to the United States, I adhere.
Her determination must control mine.
This is my understanding of patriotism.
And though I love the Union,
I love Virginia more.
Private Jenkins, because of the high regard with which I hold your father...
...you are free to do as you please. You may return to his new home in Pennsylvania.
It is your decision.
But, if you decide to stay with us...
...you may never again leave. If you do, you'll be treated as a deserter.
Colonel Jackson, sir. Father.
I am a soldier in the 4th Virginia.
And in the 4th Virginia I will stay.
And if needs be, die.
- Then I will take my leave.
- No, sir.
It is I who will leave the two of you to have some time together on your own.
You may have this room for as long as you require it.
Thank you.
Farewell, colonel.
May we meet again in happier times.
And if not in this troubled world may we meet in ...
In heaven.
Order!
- Parade, rest!
- Parade.
Men of the valley.
Citizen soldiers.
I am here at the order of General Robert
E. Lee, commanding all Virginia forces.
On April 1 5 of this year of our Lord, 1 86 1 ...
... Simon Cameron, the secretary of war of the United States...
... sent a telegram to our governor to raise three regiments of infantry...
...to be sent to assist in suppressing the Southern Confederacy.
Governor Letcher's answer is well known to you, but perhaps not his words.
His wire to Washington stated:
"You have chosen to inaugurate civil war.
Having done so, we will meet you in a spirit as determined ...
... as the Lincoln administration has exhibited toward the South ."
Two days later the Virginia legislature were voting for secession.
Just as we would not send any of our soldiers to march in other states...
... and tyrannize other people...
... so will we never allow the armies of others to march into our states...
... and tyrannize our people.
Like many of you, indeed most of you,
I've always been a Union man.
It is not with joy or with a light heart that many have welcomed secession.
Had our neighbors to the North practiced a less bellicose form of persuasion ...
...this day might not have come.
But that day has been thrust upon us...
... like it was thrust upon our ancestors.
The Lincoln administration required us to raise three regiments.
Tell them we have done so.
Dismissed.
Attention, company!
- Good morning, sir.
- Reverend Pendleton.
- How goes it with the artillery today?
- You're just in time for a christening.
The men have decided to name the howitzers: Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.
I'm sure your men will spread the gospel wherever they encounter the enemy.
Has my son proven a worthy adjutant?
I'm certain Captain Pendleton will prove himself deserving of the family name.
Thrust! Develop! Die!
Captain White.
How fare the scholars of Washington College?
Are they making their transition from books to bullets?
A few more days of drill, and my boys will surpass the cadets of VMI.
Drill, Professor White, drill and drill.
Remember Alexander in Anatolia.
Caesar in Gaul. Napoleon in Iberia.
We march by day, and read Xenophon by night.
- We will be your Greek phalanx.
- Then you must begin with the bayonet.
The bayonet must be for a Virginian what the sarissa was for a Macedonian.
If the Yankees dare set foot in Virginia, we must show them the bayonet.
Train with the bayonet and we shall keep our freedom.
Yes, sir.
Blue, gray, green, even red uniforms.
How are we to know who the enemy is?
You dang fool, you just shoot at the man that's shooting at you!
I thought we was gonna be trained.
I could have done this walking on my own back in Staunton.
I never seen you walk in your life when you didn't have to. Nor me, neither.
What man in his senses would cross his street...
...when he could just be sitting on his front porch?
I done more walking this week than in my life and my daddy's life put together.
Who'll give us fresh shoes when these are but tatters and old bits of laces?
You'll excuse me, gentlemen.
Lieutenant Colonel Stuart reporting for duty.
Colonel Stuart.
- That's an impeccable hat, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Colonel Stuart. You use tobacco?
- No, sir. Not in any form.
Neither do I. I find I like it too much.
Sit down.
I understand from your record that you are West Point, class of '54.
Served since in the cavalry,
Ft. Clark, Texas.
Operations against Apache,
Comanche. You are a native Virginian.
Fought with Longstreet and Ewell, sir.
Nasty business. Merciless climate.
Glad to be home, sir.
The Apache were defending their homes, as we will be defending ours.
If we fight as well as the Apache,
I pity the Yankee invader.
Colonel Stuart, if I had my way we would show no quarter to the enemy.
No more than the redskins showed your troopers. The black flag, sir.
If the North triumphs, it is not alone the destruction of our property.
It is the prelude to anarchy, infidelity...
...the loss of free and responsible government.
It is the triumph of commerce.
The banks, factories.
We should meet the invader on the verge of just defense...
... and raise the black flag. No quarter to the violators of our homes and firesides.
Our political leadership is too timid to face the reality of this coming war.
They should look to the Bible.
It is full of such wars.
Only the black flag will bring the North to its senses and rapidly end the war.
Well, colonel.
One way or the other, the South will give them a warm reception.
You'll be in charge of the cavalry in the Harper's Ferry district.
Your experience and your zeal will be invaluable.
Thank you, sir.
And, colonel ...
... know that I will tell my men always to gallop toward the enemy...
... but trot away.
"Trot."
The ratification vote for secession is in.
Reporting from all the counties of
Virginia, the vote is 4-to- 1 in favor.
And I'm proud to report that the vote in the Shenandoah Valley...
... is 3 1 30 in favor, 1 0 against!
In my own Rockbridge County, only one person voted against leaving the Union.
It must have been the village idiot!
Soldiers! Commanding
General Johnston's orders:
"General Beauregard is being attacked at Manassas Junction ...
... by overwhelming forces."
We have been ordered to cross the Blue Ridge to his assistance.
Every moment now is precious...
... and the general hopes his soldiers will step out and keep closed ranks.
Well, this march is a forced march to save our country.
You must get some rest, sir.
I'll rest easier when Pendleton and the artillery make it up this mountain.
They'll make better time tomorrow, sir.
It'll all be downhill.
You'll trust me to wait for the guns, sir?
Dr. McGuire.
You're an excellent practitioner, and I believe I will take your prescription.
No fires, no tents.
Just like I always dreamed it'd be.
You suppose the Virginia legislature was gonna buy you your own personal tent?
That's fine for now.
You'll be humming a different tune when it's raining, you're all covered in frost...
... or you need me to dig you out of a snowdrift.
So damn dark the bats run into each other.
Old Hickory's just getting us fit for the fighting.
Old Hickory, Old Jack, Old Blue Light.
How many names you got for the old man, anyway?
Them VMI boys come up with the choice one.
They calls him "Tom Fool" when he's looking the other way.
I'll be a fool if I listened to you all livelong night.
Old Tom Fool. That name ought to stick to him like a tick on a mule.
That's it! Step lively! Two at a time!
As quick as you can.
No dilly, no dally.
One foot forward, then the other.
Nothing pretty, nothing fancy.
Into the train. Do it lovely, do it ugly, all the same to me.
- Colonel Jackson.
- Colonel Trimble.
- I understand you're a train man.
- Baltimore and Ohio.
Spent most of my life building lines, and the past six months tearing them up.
No use in leaving them in fine fettle with a meddling Yankee.
If you'll excuse me, sir.
Got to move these men where they'll do the most damage to the enemy.
Now that's the finest dressed man in the whole Confederate Army.
In you go! Up and over!
Through the brush and in the clover.
Crowd on in. Move it over.
Dear Lord:
This is your day.
And you have admonished us to keep it holy.
If it is your will that we fight this day...
...then your will be done.
I ask your protection over Anna...
...your faithful servant, my loving wife.
I ask you to shine your face down upon her,
Lord, on her 30th birthday...
... and fill her heart with the conviction of how much she is loved and missed ...
... by her husband.
Dear Lord:
You have called me to this place, in this hour, far from my home and my loved ones...
... but I know it is your will that leads me here.
If it is your will that we fight today,
I am ready, Lord. Thy will be done.
It is your sword I will wield into battle.
Your banner I will raise against those who would desecrate our land.
And if it is my time to be with you, Lord ...
...then I come to you with all the joy in my heart.
Amen.
That's General Bee's brigade!
Inform General Bee the
1st Virginians are on the field.
Ask him, can he hold long enough for me to deploy my men?
Yes, sir! I'll ask him!
They may not hold, gentlemen.
We must assume they cannot.
- Mr. Smith.
- Sir?
Instruct Imboden and Stanard to position their batteries in the center of the crest.
I want the 4th and the 27th regiments stationed as support.
I want the 5th Regiment posted to their right, the 2nd and 33rd to the left. Understood?
Counter battery fire!
Eight hundred yards!
- Shell! Five-second fuse!
- Fire!
Counter battery fire. 800 yards.
Shell, five inch. Five-second fuse.
Fire!
General! Our line on Matthew's Hill has broken. They are beating us back.
Then we must give them the bayonet!
1 st Brigade, move up to a position just below the crest of the hill. And stay low!
Rally, men! Rally!
Look!
There is Jackson, standing like a stone wall.
Let us determine to die here today and we will conquer.
Rally behind the Virginians!
Fix bayonets.
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix!
Fill in there--!
Instruct the men to lay down!
Hug the ground!
- Lie down, men!
- Privates! First rank, lie down!
Second rank, kneel!
They are coming, boys.
Wait till they get close before you shoot.
Hold your lines!
Halt!
Hold your fire!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Fire! Reload!
- Rise up!
- Quickly, boys!
Rise up!
Quickly, men! Quickly!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Reload! Reload, men!
Come on, boys!
Quick and we can whip them!
- Easy, men. We have no orders to advance!
- Get back in the ranks!
Steady, men. Steady!
Damn it.
Charge!
It's Cummings' boys.
- What are they doing?
- Easy, Mr. Pendleton. Easy.
Good to have your dander up, but discipline wins the day.
About-face! About-face, men!
Aim! Fire!
For God's sakes, forward!
General, sir, the day is going against us.
If you think so, sir, you had better not say anything about it.
Rise up, rise up!
Rise up, Virginia!
Stand up, you men! Stand up, you free men!
We're gonna charge them.
We're gonna drive them to Washington!
Stand up, Virginia!
1 st Brigade...
... reserve your fire...
...till they come within 50 yards...
...then fire!
And give them the bayonet!
And when you charge...
...yell like Furies!
- Ready! Aim!
- Aim!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Charge bayonets!
Charge!
Press on! Press on!
I surrender! I surrender!
General?
How is it you can keep so serene...
... and stay so utterly insensible...
...with a storm of shells and bullets raining about your head?
Captain Smith ...
... my religious belief teaches me to feel as safe in battle as in bed.
God has fixed the time for my death,
I do not concern myself with that...
... but to be always ready, whenever it may overtake me.
That is the way all men should live.
Then all men would be equally brave.
Preliminary reports for the brigade, sir.
1 1 1 dead.
Three hundred seventy-three wounded or missing.
And if I may ask, sir, how's your hand?
Just a spent bullet. No more than a scratch really, Mr. Pendleton.
I'm more than pleased with the part performed by the brigade during the action.
Through the blessing of God ...
...they met the thus far victorious enemy and turned the fortunes of the day.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Tomorrow's a new day.
- Evening, general.
- Evening, sir.
Oh, Mr. Pendleton?
Thank you for the report.
I will never forget these men.
We must never forget them.
The universe itself is subject to rules, to law.
The super-abounding life lavished on this world of ours...
... is proof...
...that the play of infinite freedom ...
... is here to help work out the will of infinite law.
The nature of the universe demonstrates...
...that freedom can only exist...
... as part of law.
Pardon me, Professor Chamberlain ...
... but how does the study of philosophy intersect with real life?
If freedom can only exist as a part of law...
... how can we continue to tolerate slavery protected by law?
Lawrence, I know.
How?
I've noticed the way you've been looking into the children's room each night.
Blue.
Why blue uniforms? It should be red.
- Like the English, the color of blood.
- Are you angry with me?
Lawrence, my darling Lawrence.
Do you remember when you were thinking of being a missionary?
And you wrote me saying that you wished your little wife...
...was willing for you to take whatever course you thought best...
... and was ready to help you in it with all her heart?
"Little wife."
How could I ever have called you that?
Your spirit is vaster than oceans.
Then you wrote back.
And I have never forgotten what you said.
You said, "Well, dear, she is willing ...
... and she feels that you know better about the matter than she does."
But now...
... I never think I know better than you.
I couldn't bear for you to feel that you must forever remain at a stand ...
...just because you're married.
I always want to help you on in your excelsior striving.
But I had a dream about you, Lawrence.
Last night.
While you were away, offering your services to the governor.
I saw you in my dream.
There were boys in blue marching past.
Some of the boys that we know.
And there you were...
... riding ahead of them on a great, white horse.
Fanny, my love, I felt I had to go.
I offered the governor my services, wherever he wanted to place me.
I thought he'd probably order me to an officer.
Speeches, administration.
Lawrence...
... I know you.
When you do a thing, you do it Ã  l'outrance.
- So? He gave you a commission, didn't he?
- They need serving officers.
Five new regiments are being formed now.
Maine has already sent 1 5.
How could I refuse?
Poor Lawrence, damn you, you'll be good at it too.
You'll be good at soldiering just like you're good at everything else. So go.
Go do your duty to your country's flag ...
... go on and get your medals for bravery, go and get yourself killed.
That poem of Lovelace.
That beautiful, horrible, damnable, lovely, sad poem.
I think that you recited it in my dream.
Lovelace. "Off to the English Civil War"?
I would not dare presume to quote it now.
Tell me not, sweet, I am unkind
That from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind
To warlike arms I fly.
True, a new mistress now I serve
The first foe in the field
And with a sterner faith embrace
The sword, a horse, a shield.
Yet this inconstancy is such
As thou too shalt adore.
I could not love thee, dear, so much
Loved I not honor more.
You will be wounded.
You will be changed by the horrors of it.
But you will come home.
I believe that, my love.
You will come home.
Come in.
You must be Mr. Lewis.
There's some that calls me Uncle Jim.
Some calls me Big Jim.
Some folks just calls me Jim.
I don't suppose you've heard any of the names I get called?
I heard Stonewall once.
That name properly belongs to the
1 st Virginia Brigade, not to me.
- They were the ones who earned it.
- Some folks says otherwise.
Folks say men can't fight without nobody up front to lead them on.
- I'm told you're a first-rate cook.
- Yes, sir.
They wasn't lying, told you that.
Whatever you likes to eat, I can cook it.
Pan-fry, griddle, boil, bake. Roasted.
And I understand you're from Lexington.
You come highly recommended to me, Jim.
Lexington is my home, general.
Same as yours.
If I could do my share in defending my home...
... I'd be doing the same as you.
I heard it was Napoleon hisself said:
"An army can't march but on its stomach ."
Well ...
If you love your country...
...fear the Lord ...
... and have no trouble getting up at
4: 00 in the morning, the job is yours.
Yous got yourself a deal, general.
Sir.
My darling esposita.
Welcome to Winchester.
Thomas.
- Come in out of the cold.
- Why, thank you.
I have been thinking, Thomas...
...that it may have been a blessing the Battle of Manassas was fought on my birthday.
Why is that?
In our old age, you will never forget it.
I will forget my own before I ever forget yours.
Oh, Anna.
Anna.
What is it, Tom?
What?
Everything in this life seems so fragile.
So temporary.
When we are separated, I fear...
... I will never see you again.
I fear we may never have a child.
I fear I may lose you if we dare to have a child.
I know I should trust in the Lord ...
... but then I see the face of my dear mama...
... of my first wife, dead and cold.
With our dead daughter.
Dead before she could draw her first breath in this world.
And I am afraid.
And I am afraid to feel happiness.
Afraid to hope for it again.
I am afraid of God's judgment.
We serve a loving God, Thomas.
We are in each other's arms.
We are together, and we are happy together.
And is our love not proof of his?
We must not fear, Thomas.
We will survive this war.
And we will have a child.
So help us, God.
This is a hell of a regiment.
Men of the 20th Maine Regiment of Volunteers...
...this is your commanding officer,
Colonel Adelbert Ames.
Quiet! Quiet!
You do not cheer an officer.
You salute him.
20th Maine, I commend you for the enthusiasm ...
...that has made you volunteer for service in Lincoln's Army.
I can see that many of you are strong and fit.
We Maine men know that life in the woods of Maine...
...toughens the muscles and stretches the sinews.
I've no doubt many of you have become good shots by hunting deer.
But tough muscles and skillful shooting are not enough to make a soldier.
That requires discipline.
Major Gilmore tells me you are in the habit of holding discussions with your officers.
That will cease from now.
An officer's orders are to be obeyed instantly and without question.
This regiment must learn to move as one man.
Otherwise we will all be killed.
Sergeant Tom Chamberlain reporting for duty, sir.
Tom, what on earth--?
What are you doing?
I signed up, Lawrence, I'm in this regiment.
I'm coming with you.
Did Father approve?
How will he run the farm?
Once he heard you were colonel, he couldn't say no.
Besides, you know him, he'll be all right. They both will.
I'm giving them one less thing to cuss at.
Mama said so many prayers for the both of us, we got nothing to worry about.
Well, I guess I have one more responsibility.
I have to look after you.
Me?
Lawrence, Mama told me to watch after you.
Line of battle consists of two lines of men, one behind the other...
... so that while one line fires, the other reloads.
Behind them is a line of file closers.
Lieutenants and sergeants.
But two lines make a regiment unwieldy on the move...
... so we need to switch to column of fours.
We need to be able to change from column of fours to line of battle...
... and back again quickly. lt is not difficult to move from line of battle into column of fours. lt is harder to move from column of fours into line of battle...
...and if we're called to make that move, it will be when we're under fire.
You understand how important it is that these moves are learned so thoroughly...
...that the men can perform them in their sleep.
Company...
... halt!
Company, front!
Order arms!
Well done, colonel. That's a beginning.
But that move must be practiced and practiced and practiced.
Another month and we'll be ready.
But we leave for Washington tomorrow.
Shoulder arms!
Company, forward march!
Morning to you, sir.
Colonel Ames sent me to get you.
- Said you might be needing a drop of this.
- Thank you ...
Kilrain, sir. Sergeant Kilrain.
Glad to be of service.
You know, colonel ...
...the boys...
We've been watching you, sir, that we have.
You've learned fast.
Becoming a pleasure to serve under you.
Yes, well ...
Are you a veteran, sergeant?
Aye, sir. I suppose you could say that.
Did me duty in the regular Army for a while.
Did the great long walk with General Scott, down south of the Rio Grande.
Some men you fought with are on the other side. Almost all of their generals.
Oh, it gets worse than generals, colonel.
Some of the lads that I left Ireland with are on the other side as well. Imagine that.
We left together to escape a tyranny...
... and end up shooting at one another in the land of the free.
I, too, have friends on the other side, sergeant.
And enemies.
Yes, sir.
No shortage of enemies, that's for sure.
Forward!
Rest!
Throughout the broad extent of the country...
...through which you have marched ...
... by your respect for the rights and property of others...
...you have always shown you are soldiers, not only to defend ...
... but able and willing both to defend and protect.
You've already won ...
... a brilliant reputation throughout the Army of the whole Confederacy.
And I trust in the future by your deeds in the field ...
... and by the assistance of the same kind providence who has favored our cause...
...you will win more victories and add luster to the reputation you now enjoy.
You already gained a proud position ...
... in the future history of this...
... our second war of independence.
I shall look with anxiety to your future movements...
... and I trust whenever I shall hear of the 1 st Brigade...
... on the field of battle...
... it will be of still nobler deeds achieved and higher reputation won.
In the Army of the Shenandoah, you were the 1 st Brigade.
In the Army of the Potomac, you were the 1 st Brigade.
In the 2nd Corps of this Army, you are the 1 st Brigade.
You are the 1 st Brigade in the affections of your general.
And I hope by your future deeds and bearing you will be handed down to posterity...
... as the 1 st Brigade...
... in this, our second war of independence.
Godspeed!
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!
Jackson! Jackson! Jackson!
Gentlemen.
Excuse us, General Burnside...
... General Hancock has information you may find useful.
Yes, General Hancock, a pleasure.
Sumner, come.
We have visitors.
Sir, General Hancock reports the river can be forded the short way upstream.
There'll be no difficulty crossing. With your permission, we can move right away.
General Hancock, I appreciate your efforts at reconnaissance...
... but this possibility has been considered and rejected.
The pontoons will be here any time.
We'll cross with not only the men but also the wagons and supplies.
It would be foolhardy to send the men without the wagons, the big guns--
Excuse me, am I correct in my observation ...
...that there's little force opposing us across the river?
Yes, you're absolutely correct.
For once we seem to have caught
Lee by surprise.
Then, sir, if I may suggest, isn't it possible Lee is moving this way?
Certainly he's aware of our intentions. If we could occupy the town with infantry...
... it would make our job much easier when the bridges do arrive.
Yes, but that's risky. Those men could be cut off. In this weather?
It snows one day, melts the next.
The river could rise unexpectedly.
It will be best, I assure you, if we wait until the entire Army can cross together.
General Burnside, if we don't cross the river soon ...
... General Lee will make every effort to stop us.
He will not let us move toward Richmond unopposed.
Where are General Jackson's forces now?
Shouldn't we attempt to occupy
Fredericksburg ...
... and possibly the Heights beyond now, while we have it for the taking?
Please allow me, sir, to at least send
General Hancock's division across the river.
Surely they can carry enough supplies with them ...
... and the artillery from this side can protect them against any advance by Lee.
Gentlemen, we will cross this river when the bridges arrive and not before.
I do not have the luxury of deviating from the larger plan.
The president approved my strategy, and I shall stick to it.
Once this Army is across the river, we will advance on Richmond in force.
We must not allow him ...
...the luxury of attacking us as divided and separated units as he's done in the past.
And I will not make the same mistake as my predecessors.
So no, General Hancock.
You will stay on this side until the pontoons are in place...
... and the entire Army crosses together.
An irresistible, impregnable force.
Did you know George Washington spent his boyhood not far from here?
And across that river, he's supposed to have thrown that silver dollar...
... and cut down that cherry tree.
That may be so, Mr. Taylor, but it has an even greater significance for me.
It's where I met my wife.
That's something these Yankees do not understand, will never understand.
You see these rivers and valleys and streams...
... and fields, even towns?
They're just markings on a map to those people in the war office in Washington.
But to us, my goodness, they're birthplaces and burial grounds.
They're battlefields where our ancestors fought...
... places where you and I learned to walk, to talk and to pray.
Places where we made friendships and, oh, yes, fell in love.
And they're the incarnation of all our memories, Mr. Taylor...
... and all that we are.
All that we are.
- What place is this?
- Chancellor's Crossing.
We're another two hours or so from Fredericksburg.
We'll rest here for a short time.
Yes, sir. I'll see what the good folks can provide.
The general be fixing to eat something warm?
No, no, Jim.
We gotta ride on straight through to General Lee.
Don't want to get all warmed up just to feel the cold all over again.
You never seem to mind the cold much.
I minds it. I just don't shows it.
Now, Little Sorrel, I know this corn look poorly...
... but it sure beats no corn at all.
You heard from your family lately?
Ain't heared much for some time.
Yankee mail used to move quicker than Secesh mail.
Lord, from where you sit you can see the great distance...
...that separates our Southern men from their wives and children.
We pray that you watch over our families.
Lord, I ask you to watch over
Jim Lewis' family...
... over his friends, his loved ones, wherever they may be.
Lord, I know you sees into the hearts of all men ...
...just like you sees into the heart of old Jim Lewis.
And, Lord, I know there's no lying or deceitfulness...
... can hide from you.
You find the truth ...
... in the bottom of the deepest pit of darkness.
There be no hiding from your truth and your ever-watchful eye.
Amen.
How is it, Lord?
Can you explain something to this old Virginia man?
How is it a good Christian man ...
... like some folks I know...
... can tolerate their black brothers in bondage?
How is it, Lord, they don't just...
... break them chains?
How is it, Lord?
My heart is open and aching.
And I wants to know.
Lord, speak to us.
Speak to your children.
Speak to Jim Lewis and Thomas Jackson, your humble and obedient servants.
Speak to all of us.
Our hearts are open.
Lord, you show us the way, we will follow.
Amen.
- Jim?
- Yeah.
What is the status of your family?
About half is free, half slave.
That's counting all the cousins and such.
You must know that there are some officers in this Army...
...who are of the opinion that...
...we should be enlisting Negroes as a condition for freedom.
General Lee is among them.
That's what they says around the camp.
Your people will be free, one way or another.
The question is, if the Southern government will have...
...the good sense to do it first and soon.
And in so doing seal a bond of enduring friendship between us.
That's what they says, general.
God's plan is a great mystery.
It will be revealed to us.
That's all the fodder you get tonight.
We's going to a country where there's nothing more for an animal to eat...
...than there is what's in the palm of my hand.
General Lee, fine day, sir.
We got batteries all along that hill, covering our front to the river.
Strong anchor on the north.
Tomorrow, guns will be positioned in those trees to the south.
We'll be able to cover the entire open ground, all of it.
General, they gonna come at us here?
Colonel Alexander...
... Federal troops amassed across that river are watching us prepare for them.
If I were General Burnside,
I wouldn't attack here.
I'd move back upstream, come across from above us.
Burnside is not a man with the luxury of flexibility.
He's being pushed from behind by loud voices in Washington ...
... by newspapers who demand quick action.
But we're here, and so he will attack us here.
We got batteries pointing from all angles.
They cross that canal, that'll slow them down.
We shall hit them from all sides.
No, sir, a chicken couldn't live on that field.
General Hood, I've often wondered how it is that...
... Texas men, the most independent-minded in this Army of irascibles...
... have agreed to serve under a Kentuckian.
I have often wondered the same.
General Gregg, have you settled your differences with General Jackson?
No, General Hill, I have not.
Have you?
No, sir.
Tell me, general ...
... do you expect to live until the end of this war?
I do not know...
... but I'm inclined to think I will.
I expect I will be wounded.
And you, general?
I do not expect to live to see the end of this war.
Nor can I say that without victory
I would desire to do so.
- Get up.
- Get up.
Sir?
Yes, Mr. Pendleton, you may enter.
Forgive me, general.
There's a letter for you.
Courier was running a little slow today, but I thought you'd want to see it.
Yes, thank you.
Good night, sir.
My own dear father:
As my mother's letter has been cut short by my arrival...
... I think it but justice that I should continue it.
I know that you are rejoiced to hear of my coming.
And I hope that God has sent me to radiate your pathway through life.
I am a very tiny little thing.
I weigh only eight and a half pounds...
...and Aunt Harriet says I am the express image of my darling papa.
My mother is very comfortable this morning.
Your loving daughter.
Thank you, Lord.
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
They've occupied all the buildings along the riverfront.
We will be lining up those pontoon bridges through a hail of lead.
Once across, the Rebs are sure to make us pay for every block.
Beyond the town is the canal which cuts across this open field ...
... a field we'll have to cross to reach their entrenchments on Marye's Heights...
... another difficult obstacle in the face of artillery fire.
Down to our left we could burst through ...
...turn Jackson's lines, push him back, trap Longstreet on top of the hill ...
... surround him.
It's possible.
Turn Jackson's lines?
No, general, we'll meet them head on.
And it will be a bloody mess.
We'll march up to that hill there...
... and we'll eat their artillery fire all the way across this field.
We'll be able to look at ourselves and say:
"We're good soldiers.
We did what we were told ."
If we're not successful, we can say it was a good plan, but there were contingencies.
You can go back to your hometown ...
... and tell the families of your men they died doing their duty.
The Rebs have fortified the high ground up the river.
And anyway, there are strong currents and obstacles to a crossing there.
Below Fredericksburg the river is too wide.
And our earliest forces are clear down to Port Royal.
Fredericksburg is now the only place we can cross.
If Burnside doesn't cross here, he might as well resign.
That wily gray fox has outmaneuvered our command again.
And there's going to be hell to pay.
Hurry up! Let's go!
Pick your targets, boys!
Commence firing!
Them Yankees is coming, sure as Jesus.
They got two pontoons across that river.
We got to get you and them children out of here.
Stop fussing with me. Get your family ready. We'll leave together.
Miss Jane, us done talked this over, and we decided to stay here...
... and look after the house.
No use saying no more.
Martha, I won't leave you to the mercy of those blue devils.
Miss Jane, you know they ain't gonna be bothering us colored folks.
If we go with you, there won't be any food left in the pantry when we come back.
And we need to eat, same as you.
- Pastor Lacy, we must run to our lines.
- There's no time.
The streets are raining iron.
To the basement.
Anybody hurt?
Sam?
Easy.
Sam!
Can you get up? Easy! Easy!
Mother? Are you here?
Oh, praise be! It's young John!
- We're down here in the cellar!
- The door is blocked!
I'll go around to the side!
Children, y'all stay right here.
Mama'll be back.
Come out! There's an ambulance out front.
The enemy is crossing the river. Hurry!
- No! Martha, I won't leave without you.
- I done told you, I'm staying.
Off with you then.
Come on, Martha.
Stay in the basement!
Get the bayonets!
May God be with them.
May he strengthen their hearts and their arms for the coming struggle.
Give them the victory.
Can I be of service to you fine Northern gentlemen?
Is this your master's place?
This is my place.
Children!
Sorry to have to bother you, ma'am.
Come on, let's go.
Go back inside. Hurry up.
Put a stop to this at once!
Where are the officers?
Drop that, soldier. Now!
Get a message to Couch, to Hancock.
This will not be tolerated!
This is an army, not a rabble!
General Longstreet, show us where your troops are positioned.
Yes, sir. We're anchored on the north by Anderson's division ...
... up on the bend in the river and Ransom's division ...
... along and below the ridge of Marye's Heights...
...with Cobb's brigade dug in down on the road behind that stone wall.
Now, to their right, is General McLaws...
... and further down in the woods and to the right, Pickett and Hood.
General Hood is my right flank.
He's connected in those heavy trees over there with General Jackson's left.
Up here on the Heights, we have the Washington artillery...
... Colonel Alexander's batteries and support.
It's a strong line, general.
Very well.
General Jackson, would you please extend the line for us?
General A. P. Hill is on the left, adjoining General Hood.
Position is supported by General Taliaferro and General Early.
Now to the right flank and behind is D. H. Hill.
We've built a road behind our lines running the entire length.
We can move troops as is necessary.
If the enemy penetrates our lines at any point...
...the reserves, Taliaferro and Early, can move rapidly to a new position.
If the enemy attempts to cut our center...
... or if General Pickett is pressed, we can change positions, sir.
Good, very good.
General Stuart, are you in a strong position for protecting ...
... General Jackson's flank?
Oh, yes, sir.
We're covering the enemy from the river, as far out as our own lines.
If the Yankees move down river or threaten to turn General Jackson's line...
...we can block their advance until the line is moved.
Very well. Gentlemen, these deployments are sound.
The rest is in God's hands.
- Amen.
- Amen.
In the Roman civil war...
... Julius Caesar knew he had to march on Rome itself...
...which no legion was permitted to do.
Marcus Lucanus left us a chronicle of what happened.
How swiftly Caesar had surmounted the icy Alps...
...and in his mind conceived immense upheavals, coming war.
When he reached the little Rubicon, clearly through the murky night...
...appeared a mighty image of his country in distress...
... grief in her face...
... her white hair streaming from her tower-crowned head.
With tresses torn and shoulders bare, she stood before him and sighing, said:
"Where further do you march? Where do you take my standards, warriors?
If lawfully you come, if as citizens, this far only is allowed."
Trembling struck his limbs.
And weakness checked his progress, holding his feet at the river's edge.
At last he speaks.
Oh, thunderer...
... surveying great Rome's walls from the Tarpeian rock.
Oh, Phrygian, house gods of Iulus...
... clan and mysteries of Quirinus who was carried off to heaven.
Oh, Jupiter of Latium, seated in lofty Alba and hearths of Vesta.
Oh, Rome, equal to the highest deity, favor my plans.
Not with impious weapons do I pursue you.
Here am I, Caesar...
...conqueror of land and sea, your own soldier everywhere...
...now too if I am permitted.
The man who makes me your enemy, it is he will be the guilty one.
He broke the barriers of war and through the swollen river...
...swiftly took his standards.
When Caesar crossed the flood and reached the opposite bank...
...from Hesperia's forbidden fields, he took his stand and said:
"Here, I abandoned peace and desecrated law.
Fortune, it is you I follow.
Farewell to treaties.
From now on, war is our judge."
Hail Caesar.
We who are about to die salute you.
General Zook!
Move your brigade forward!
Left wing, forward march!
Steady, boys, steady.
You'll soon be forward.
Is that to be
General Meagher's position?
He's enjoying the privilege of an officer.
Protecting the rear.
He's got a lame knee, for pity's sake.
Fair enough.
Someone's got to keep Burnside company.
Quiet in the ranks!
Shoulder arms!
Colonel.
20th Maine to the front.
Battalion! Shoulder arms!
Shoulder arms!
Left face!
High-file right...
... march!
Come on, boys! Show them the cold steel!
Irish brigade, move out!
Irish brigade, at the double-quick...
...forward march!
Front and center!
Double column, boys! Form up!
Forward!
Keep moving!
That's the Irish.
What are those boys doing fighting in blue?
Don't they know we're fighting for our independence?
Did they learn nothing at the hands of the English?
They're Reb Irishmen. They're our brothers.
They've been misled to their fates.
Do your duty!
Steady, men! Steady!
Men, do your duty!
Battalion, halt!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Load them up, boys, load them up!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Load! Load! Load!
Ready!
Aim!
Fire!
Fall back! Fall back, men!
Now move! Move!
Go to hell! Go to hell and damnation!
Move, boys!
Lie down here!
Lie down and load!
Load!
Load and fire!
Quickly!
Blaze away, lads!
Do it, boys!
Fire, boys.
Keep firing, men! Keep firing!
Fall back!
Fall back, lads!
Every man for himself!
Fall back, men!
- Caldwell's brigade, forward! Now!
- Yes, sir!
At the double-quick! March!
- General Armistead.
- Afternoon, General Pickett.
- See that last charge by Meagher's brigade?
- Those fellas deserved a better fate.
Their bravery is worthy of a better cause.
My heart stood still as I watched it.
I would not have believed that mortal men ...
... could march into the face of such destruction.
General Longstreet...
...those people committing more fresh divisions at your lines...
...their mounting numbers may overwhelm our defense.
Sir, if they put every man they have on the field to approach me...
... give me plenty of ammunition,
I'll kill them all before they reach my line.
Nevertheless, we must be prudent, general.
We must never ignore the unknown or the unpredictable.
Yes, sir. I'll take the necessary measures.
Orders!
Send orders to Ransom's Tar Heels to advance his division ...
... and to Kershaw to bring up his brigade to support Cobb at the wall.
Yes, sir!
Forward, men!
Load! Five-second fuse!
She burst! The barrel burst!
- Stretcher!
- General Lee, you all right, sir?
- Sergeant! Call for the surgeon! Quickly!
- Here I go. Help me up, boys.
It's not yet our time, gentlemen.
Not yet our time.
Brigade, halt! Form by battalion!
Pass them forward.
Just load and pass them forward!
20th Maine...
... halt! lt is not difficult to move from line of battle into column of fours. lt is much harder to move from column of fours into line of battle...
...and if we're called to make that move, it will be when we are under fire.
You understand how important it is that these moves are learned so thoroughly...
...that the men can perform them in their sleep.
Seems a terrible long distance up that hill.
It'll be shortened by those in the front.
Begging your pardon, sir.
The only thing that'll be shortened by those in front is their lives.
God help us now.
- Colonel, take care of the right wing.
- Yes, sir. I'll watch them, sir.
Hail Caesar.
We who are about to die salute you.
20th Maine!
- Forward!
- Forward!
- March!
- March!
By the right of companies, to the front! March!
Right of companies to the front! March!
Form a line, boys! Form a line!
Form up a line! Form up a line!
Come on, boys!
Dress to the colors!
Come on, boys.
Dress to the colors!
Keep your line, men. Keep your line.
Close that gap!
At the double-quick, men!
Double-quick, boys! Come on, boys!
Keep it tight, boys! Keep it tight!
Turn right, boys! Right!
Turn to the right!
Keep it tight, men! Keep it tight, men!
Come on, boys!
At the double-quick, boys! Come on, boys!
Forward, men. Keep moving!
Battalion, halt!
- Battalion, halt!
- Battalion, halt!
Watch your line!
Dress to the colors!
Ready! Fire!
- Reload, boys! Reload quickly!
- Ready! Aim! Fire!
Keep firing! Keep firing!
Battalion, fight by fire!
Thattaway, boys, fire away!
Pour it into them!
Close the gap, boys!
Pour it into them!
Fill this hole now!
Steady now! Pour it into them!
Dress that line down there!
- Sir?
- What is it?!
Request permission to return to the rear, sir.
Permission granted. Permission granted.
No, no, Patrick, me boy.
Just reload and shoot.
Pour it into them, boys!
Fill that line in!
Fill this hole now!
Dress to the right!
Fire!
Pour it into them, boys!
Pour it into them!
Fire!
- Fall back, men!
- Fall back! Fall back!
Fall back, boys!
- What did you do that for?
- You'll thank me in the morning.
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother, help me...
It's all right, Casey, I got you. Don't worry about a thing. I'll get you home.
Quickly, men. Reload quickly!
It is well that war is so terrible...
...for we should grow too fond of it.
Yes, sir?
We're requisitioning your house for use as a hospital.
Come on inside out the cold.
You there.
You wounded?
Truly sorry, old fella--
Damn.
- General Hancock, sir.
- Surgeon.
This man is Major Sidney Willard of the 35th Massachusetts.
This way, sir.
Prepare to lift. Lift.
He's been shot twice in the chest, general.
There's nothing I can do.
- Is there whiskey in this house?
- Yes, sir.
Drink this, sir.
"Think not to thyself...
...that thou shall escape in the king's house more than all the Jews.
For if it thou keepest thy peace at this time...
... deliverance shall arise with the Jews from another place.
And who knows whether thou art come to the kingdom ...
...for such a time as this."
That's from the book of Esther.
Esther knew she had to do more than save herself.
Esther had to save her people too.
I love them people you done chased from this house.
I's known them most all my life.
The Beales is good people.
Mr. General?
I was born a slave.
And I wants to die free.
Lord knows I wants to die free, and I wants my children to be free.
Heaven help me.
May God bless you all.
Damn it, Tom, you scared me half to death.
You?! Lawrence, I thought you was with the beyond.
Mother?
I was able to secure the aid of a good spyglass...
... and could ascertain beyond all doubt that our house is still standing.
Oh, I pray to God for Martha and her dear ones.
But, Mother...
... it is a pitiful sight on the fields below Marye's Heights.
I should feel rancor in my heart for those invaders...
... but all I feel for them is sorrow.
Dear Lucy...
...when you were but a child in petticoats...
... I believe the year was 1 847...
...there was a great famine in Ireland.
Those fields below the Heights were covered ...
...with the finest crop of corn ever raised in this section.
The greater part of it was sent as a donation to the starving Irish.
I cannot help thinking ...
... but that it helped to feed the poor victims of the Irish brigade...
...who fell on this very field today.
General Gregg.
General Jackson.
I wish to apologize...
...for the differences we had.
The doctor tells me you have not long to live.
I ask you to dismiss this matter from your mind ...
... and turn your thoughts to God ...
... and the world to which you go.
General ...
...you know that I'm not a believer.
Well, then I will believe for the both of us.
How horrible is war.
Horrible, yes...
... but we have been invaded.
Lord, what can we do?
Kill them, sir.
Kill every last man of them.
Gentlemen.
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a cup of Rio just now.
20th Maine! Return fire!
- Return fire!
- Return fire!
Patrick.
I hope you don't mind.
I know you're in heaven, but you got work yet to do down here...
... in this poor pitiless world.
Colonel Chamberlain.
Your orders are to withdraw.
Withdraw to the city.
Colonel.
We are ordered to form a picket line and cover the Army's retreat across the river.
Colonel Chamberlain, did you hear me?
Yes, sir. We are to retreat, sir.
Captain Spear.
- Form the regiment. We're moving out.
- Yes, sir.
Yankees.
Everywhere.
Where y'all been? Can't find my own house.
Gone! Gone!
What y'all done with my house?
Where is it? Can y'all tell me that?
Well, can you? Can you?
"Men of the Army...
... although you were not successful in the recent battle...
...the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an accident.
No soldiers in the annals of war fought more bravely.
Condoling with the mourners for the dead ...
... and sympathizing with the severely wounded ...
... I congratulate the Army that the numbers of casualties...
- ... have been comparatively so small ."
- Compared to what?
The Scots at Culloden?
The English at Bunker Hill?
The French at Waterloo?
"--the thanks of the nation ."
Signed: Abraham Lincoln.
Battalion!
Dismissed!
At this Christmas season, when the good fairies are in the air...
...we can hardly wonder at the sudden miracle...
...that has shown us the Fredericksburg affair in its true light...
... and given us occasion for national joy instead of national sorrow.
General Jackson?
Do you know what these decorations signify?
I was wondering if someone would tell me.
- This is Santa's sled.
- I see.
And this is stuff made of candy.
This is a gingerbread snowflake.
And this is a paper chain of angels.
Did you make this angel?
It's lovely.
- How old are you, Jane?
- I'm 5 years old.
- How old are you?
- I'm 38.
My father is 38. He's a soldier like you.
I haven't seen him for more than a year.
I've not met your father, but I'm told he's a very good man, very brave man.
I'm sure he misses you as much as I miss my daughter.
When did you last see your daughter?
I've never seen her.
She was born just days ago.
I want to see her more than anything in this world.
I want to see her as much as your father wants to see you.
You see that star at the top of the tree?
The star of Bethlehem.
The star that showed the wise men where they could find the baby Jesus.
Mother says that star will show Daddy how to find his way back home.
Well, your mother's very wise, very good person.
Your daddy will come home.
All the daddies will come home.
Oh, my.
Gentlemen, let us lift our glasses to our Southern women ...
...without whose bravery and fortitude...
...without whose love, without whose endurance and sacrifice...
... not a man among us can stay the course...
... or defend the cause.
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.
Hear, hear.
Now it's time for a carol.
Everybody must sing.
- Carols are my favorite.
- I can't sing.
Of course you can sing, Mr. Jackson.
You can breathe, can't you?
Just let your breath flow gently over your vocal chords and nature does the rest.
I'm afraid General Jackson's voice is more suited to the battlefield than the parlor.
You may take my word on it, Mrs. Corbin.
If it's singing you want, my adjutant Mr. Pendleton's your man.
We've worked our way through the hymnal ...
... and he always takes up where I leave off.
Well then, Mr. Pendleton ...
... since the general has appointed you
Kapellmeister...
...what shall we sing?
"Silent Night."
Dearest Fanny:
The bugle has just sounded,
3rd Brigade extinguish lights.
It makes me happy to think of you and my dear little ones at home...
...all nestled together.
I know that it is all well and bright with her whose sweet face shines in my heart.
Come and let me kiss your dear lips, precious wife.
Let our hearts worship together God's love, and wisdom, and mercy.
Yes, all is well, well with us, darling...
...well if we can only meet at last, as I pray God we may.
Hey, Billy Yank.
- That's a mighty nice song.
- I'm pleased you find it so agreeable.
I'd like it even more if I had some coffee to wash it down.
- Want some baccy?
- Sure, Johnny.
Have you got a lame horse?
What do you be wanting to trade for a lame horse?
Would you take General Burnside?
No. I guess I'll keep the horsehide.
Come on, get your baccy.
Mr. Smith, are you aware that the Bible gives models of official battle reports?
- No, sir.
- Nevertheless, there are such.
Consider the narrative of Joshua's battles with the Amalekites.
It has clearness and modesty, brevity.
And it traces the victory to the right source, the blessing of God.
Has it helped you with your reports, sir?
Anybody home?
Afternoon, General Jackson.
What's this?
- New recruits.
- My mama helped me make these.
That's fine.
- Left, right. Left, right.
- Child, that hat is a bit too large for you.
However...
...there.
I believe that suits a young girl better than an old soldier.
Mama's baking some biscuits.
You know, I was thinking of walking over to the big house for a nice hot cup of tea.
And I would very much like the company of one beautiful little lady.
Yes, General Jackson, a hot cup of chamomile.
Mr. Smith, you may continue writing the reports.
Consult first and second Samuel ...
... and first and second Kings.
They will be of help to you.
Shall we go?
Do you prefer butter biscuits or sugar cookies?
Oh, my. I know your mother's biscuits are first-rate.
We owe you Texas boys a debt of gratitude for putting on these shows.
Colonel Patton, any man who can't handle a guitar or a fiddle...
... ain't fit to carry a musket.
Attention, battalions.
Halt.
- Sergeant, keep these men here for now.
- Yes, sir.
Sir.
The men have rounded up three deserters.
Establish the courts-martial.
Have them arraigned.
See they're given a fair hearing.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Well, I thought that you should know, sir.
They all belong to the Stonewall brigade.
Do your duty, soldier.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Pendleton, if they are innocent, these men will go free.
But if they are found guilty of desertion ...
...the courts-martial condemns them to death. It must be so.
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.
I'm not done yet.
Sandie.
If the Republicans lose their little war, they are voted out in the next election ...
... and they return to their homes in New York or Massachusetts or Illinois...
...fat with their war profits.
If we lose, we lose our country.
We lose our independence.
We lose it all.
Our soldiers are brave.
They have endured hardships none of them could ever have imagined.
Desertion is not a solitary crime.
It's a crime against the tens of thousands of veterans...
...who are huddled together in the harsh cold of this winter.
Against all those who have sacrificed.
Against all those who have fallen.
Against all the women and the children we have left alone to fend for themselves.
I regard the crime of desertion as a sin against the Army of the Lord.
Duty is ours.
The consequences are God's.
I am a soldier in the 4th Virginia.
And in the 4th Virginia I will stay.
And if needs be, die.
The courts-martial of the Army of Northern Virginia...
... has found you guilty of desertion and sentences you to death ...
... by firing squad.
Lieutenant, do your duty.
Detail, ready!
Aim.
Fire!
Recover, arm!
Morning, Lawrence.
- Any mail?
- No.
But I did manage to get my hands on a New York Tribune.
- What are they saying about us now?
- Well, not much about us.
I mean, that is, this Army here in Stoneman's Switch.
Sure are kicking up a fuss about Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.
Says here that enlistments are down and desertions are up.
- Any grumbling among the men?
- Well, not in our regiment.
A few wonder out loud why they should be risking their lives for the darkies.
Well, Tom, you know my position.
I signed up to preserve the Union.
The president did the right thing.
What's the use of uniting the country by force and leaving slavery in place?
It sure riled up those Johnny Rebs.
They'll think Lincoln incited the slaves to rise against them.
Why shouldn't they?
Freeing the slaves wasn't a war aim when this began, but war changes things.
- It sorts things out.
- Well, I don't know, Lawrence.
Not everybody feels the way we do about the darkies.
Especially when it comes to fighting and dying.
Tom.
Do me a favor.
Don't call me Lawrence and don't call Negroes "darkies."
That's a patronizing expression from which we must free ourselves.
Come outside. I want to--
I want to show you something.
All these thousands of men.
Many of them not much more than boys.
Each one of them some mother's son.
Some sister's brother.
Some daughter's father.
Each one of them a whole person, loved and cherished in some home far away.
Many of them will never return.
An army is power.
Its entire purpose is to coerce others.
Now, this kind of power cannot be used carelessly or recklessly.
This kind of power can do great harm.
We have seen more suffering than any man should ever see...
... and if there is going to be an end to it, it must be an end that justifies the cost.
Now, somewhere out there is the Confederate Army.
They claim they are fighting for their independence, for their freedom.
Now, I cannot question their integrity.
I believe they are wrong, but I cannot question it.
But I do question a system that defends its own freedom while it denies it to others.
To an entire race of men.
I will admit it, Tom, war is a scourge.
But so is slavery.
It is the systematic coercion of one group of men over another.
It has been around since the book of Genesis.
It exists in every corner of the world.
But that's no excuse for us to tolerate it here...
...when we find it right before our very eyes, in our own country.
As God is my witness, there is no one
I hold in my heart dearer than you.
But if your life or mine is part of the price to end this curse and free the Negro...
...then let God's will be done.
Oh, my, general, we do appreciate the gift.
Where do you get all these lemons?
It's a kind providence that provides kindly.
Miss Corbin, the Yankees have not succeeded in cutting our rail lines...
...to the South.
Here is to the sultry, balmy South.
And, Miss Corbin, here's to your engagement.
May Sandie Pendleton prove to be as fine a husband as he is a soldier.
Hear, hear.
That's good, it's not too sweet.
May I have some more?
Sure.
Mrs. Corbin.
Thank you for your many kindnesses.
Our cause and our country are in your debt.
I only regret, general, that we could not do more.
You'll come visit us again when this cruel war is over?
I should like to say goodbye to your daughter. I shall miss her very much.
Certainly, general.
She's not feeling very well today.
All of the children have come down with the fever. Please, come in.
Well, now.
What's this?
How can I play with my friend if she insists on staying in bed?
Jane.
Will you place this angel on your tree next Christmas?
Mrs. Corbin, I must return to my men.
My physician, Doctor McGuire, will attend to her.
- I will send him directly.
- Bless you, general.
Fresh meat. What a change.
Yeah. A live steer around these parts is as rare as a peacock in a poultry pen.
It was scarlet fever.
The children are all right. They'll be fine.
Except--
I'm so sorry, sir.
The little girl, Jane.
She did not survive. She died, sir.
What is it?
He's never cried before.
Not for all the blood and all the death, not for his young students from VMI ...
... not for his friends...
... not for anyone.
Not so, Sandie.
I think he is crying for them all.
She's too pretty to look like me.
Nonsense, Thomas.
She is very like you.
She rises early and she loves to be held in my arms.
I have never seen you look so well, Thomas.
You are handsomer than ever.
General Jackson, sir? General Jackson, sir?
An officer come to see you, sir.
An officer from General Lee, sir.
I'll be right there.
General, from what we've observed, Hooker has moved five corps, maybe 70, 000 men.
They're digging in around
Chancellor's mansion.
Sedgwick has another 40, 000 spread out along the Stafford Heights...
... on the north bank of the Rappahannock in front of General Early at Fredericksburg.
Now, there's possibly 30, 000 more back along the river north of here...
...that we've not yet located.
We're not in a position of strength here.
We owe a great deal to the unexplainable, the mystery of General Hooker...
...who's allowed us to maneuver freely...
... between two parts of an army that's more than twice our strength.
We do not yet understand his plan.
He may still plan a move toward Gordonsville...
... move around below us, cut us off from Richmond.
And there's still Sedgwick on the river.
Now Sedgwick shows no signs of moving, but that could change.
They're anchored against the river and their lines continue down below Chancellorsville...
...then curves along here.
We've observed their lines curving out in these open clearings...
...then extending on out to the west.
Then what, general?
Do you know where their right flank is?
- No. Not yet.
- We must know. We must know.
If he marches in that direction, he could threaten our flank...
... or be going toward Gordonsville before we can react.
General Lee, sir.
- May I approach?
- Sure.
Out here, in the west, along this turnpike, here...
...their right flank's in the air.
It's the one place they're not digging in.
They're not expecting any pressure there.
- Who's on their flank?
- 1 1 th Corps. Oliver Howard.
Were there any roads farther down below the turnpike?
Yes, sir. Indeed there are, good roads.
That's Catherine's Furnace here and there's a road here.
- There's a road over this way.
- Then, we must hit them there.
Then attack the flank.
They will have nowhere to go.
They'll have to go back across the river or we will destroy them.
We're too close to their lines.
They'll observe our movements.
There must be another road farther down.
Now, is there someone we know?
Someone we can trust who knows the area?
Captain Pendleton.
Find Reverend Lacy for me.
I'm here, sir.
This is my chaplain, the Reverend Tucker Lacy.
He has family in this area.
General Lee.
Reverend, it would be very helpful if you could find us a safe route...
- ... around the enemy.
- Well, sir, there, I know a family.
The Wellfords. I suggest a visit to them.
We may find ourselves a guide.
Please go at once, Mr. Lacy. Find someone who might show us how we might proceed.
Yes, sir.
Then it has been decided, general.
This mission will be yours.
I would not have it any other way.
Boys, my days are numbered.
My time has come.
You can laugh, but my time has come.
I got a 20-dollar gold piece I carried through the war and a silver watch ...
... my daddy sent to me through the lines.
Take them off of me when I'm dead.
Give them to my captain to give to my daddy when he gets back home.
Here's my clothes and my blanket.
Anybody who wishes can have them.
My rations I do not wish at all. My gun and cartridge box I expect to die with.
- Mr. Smith.
- Sir.
Your instructions to the ranks: There is to be no noise, I want no talking.
Stragglers will be bayoneted, let the men know.
No muskets are to be loaded until we deploy for battle. Secrecy, Mr. Smith.
Everything depends upon the element of surprise.
Sir, I'll convey the orders. No stragglers.
- Reverend.
- May we bow our heads.
Dear Lord, heavenly Father, you who know all things.
We face again a mighty foe, a vast host.
An enemy more than twice our number.
But you have taught us to fear not, to trust in you.
When the Philistines came before them, the people of Israel feared Goliath.
Their Army was in terror.
No one had the courage to stand against the mighty warrior.
Then you brought forth David, a mere boy.
And Saul armed David with his armor...
...and he put a helmet of brass upon his head.
Also he armed him with a coat of mail.
And David girded his sword upon his armor and he assayed to go.
General Rodes, deploy your men on either side of the turnpike, brigade front.
How soon will
General Colston's men be up?
We're right behind, general.
General Lee...
... I hope as soon as practicable to attack...
... I trust that an ever kind providence will bless us with great success.
Take this to General Lee.
Well, General Rodes...
... it appears the Virginia Military
Institute will be heard from today.
Deploy your brigade.
There is another road. It's a road that runs well below the Federal lines.
The Wellford boy explained it to me.
He knows the route.
He will march with us to where this road rejoins the turnpike...
...then we turn to the east and attack their right flank.
It is a greater distance, perhaps 1 2 or
1 3 miles, but the boys can do it.
They have never let us down.
We've divided the Army before.
We must retain the advantage of surprise, we must outflank the flankers.
We must beat them at their own game.
Take your entire corps,
General Jackson, and destroy the enemy.
God be with you.
Two hours of daylight left.
Are you ready, General Rodes?
You may move forward.
- Fall back!
- They're coming! Get your muskets!
- Shoulder to shoulder! Let's go, let's go!
- Fall back!
Aim fire!
Pull back and save yourself!
Form a line! Aim!
Fire!
Fall back!
Fire! Fall back!
Into the trees, men! Fall back!
Press on!
Form a line! Form a line!
Form a line!
- Run! Run!
- Charge!
Press on!
Hold up right here! Aim! Fire!
Push on!
Hell, that's hot. I knew you'd be all right, you dang fool.
Oh, God.
Regroup!
- Stop running!
- Move into line!
Stay together!
My God! Give them the bayonet!
- Stop running!
- Stop running!
Stop running, soldier!
Stop running! Rally with me, men!
- Rally with me!
- Stop! Rally around the general!
Give me a line to the left!
Form a line to the left!
We have stopped, sir. Can't see.
The lines are tangled.
We're mixed in with Rodes' men.
It's confusion, sir.
We need Hill to come up.
Hill's men can move on by us.
Tell General Colston he must re-form his men.
Now I will strongly urge General Hill to push forward hard.
We must not stop. Let General Colston know they will run if we press them.
Yes, sir.
General Hill, you must keep the men moving. We must keep the pressure up.
We have broken their flank. We can crush them now if we can cut them off.
We must not give them time to get organized.
General, take your division forward.
Press on north, move toward the river, toward the United States ford.
- We must not let them escape.
- It's late in the day, general.
- We don't know the ground.
- Boswell!
You will ride with General Hill. You will find a way through the woods to the northeast.
You will find the rear of the enemy's position.
Yes, sir.
We will cut them off, general!
They're digging in. Must be Federal.
Sound carries at night, they could be a ways off.
General, sir, we are beyond our lines.
This is no place for you, sir.
You're right.
It cannot go the way I'd hoped.
It will have to be tomorrow.
Gentlemen, let us return to the road.
Stop firing! You're firing at your own men!
Hold it!
Hold your fire!
These are your own men here!
It's a lie! Pour into them, boys!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
General Hill, they're our men!
What have they done?
Who is this?
Oh, God, general! Are you hurt badly?
I'm afraid I am, in my shoulder.
And here.
- Get a litter. We need a litter. Move!
- Yes, sir.
- We must leave here, general.
- Here, take this. It'll help, sir.
I will try to keep this from the knowledge of the troops.
Thank you, general.
The Yankees have set up a battery not a hundred yards. We must get away!
Ready? Lift! Careful now.
Move out. Ready, lift.
Fire!
General. Lie quiet, or you will most certainly be killed.
Let's go. Lift!
Move! Ready? Lift!
Doctor, good to see you.
I am hurt badly.
I fear I am dying.
Sir, I want you to drink this.
It's whiskey and morphine.
Your right hand is minor.
The ball lodged under the skin.
It's these other wounds.
I need to examine your arm.
And I'll administer chloroform to make it painless.
If I should find that the condition warrants amputation ...
... may I proceed at once?
I have complete faith in you, Dr. McGuire.
Just do to me whatever you think necessary.
Breathe deeply, general.
What an infinite blessing.
Blessing.
Doesn't seem right that General Jackson isn't here to see this.
No, major. It does not seem right at all.
But it is the will of God.
He's lost his left arm. I've lost my right.
General?
How you feeling, sir?
Do not concern yourself about me.
But tell me, how are we faring?
General, the enemy's gone across the river.
We secured the high ground around Chancellorsville.
General Stuart did well by you, sir.
And the Stonewall brigade...
... right in the middle of it, sir.
"Remember Jackson, " they shouted.
I heard that all day.
They were fighting for Stonewall.
Well, isn't that just like them.
They are a noble set of men.
That name, Stonewall, belongs to the brigade, not to me.
I have the ball.
Dr. McGuire allowed me to keep the musket ball he took from your hand.
It was a round, smooth bore.
It had to be one of ours.
I heard. They thought I was asleep.
It could not be helped.
There's no blame in war.
We must all forgive.
I had to remove your husband's left arm, patch his right hand.
He's healing well, I'm very pleased.
But there is a new problem.
I do believe he is developing pneumonia.
- May I see him, doctor?
- Well, certainly, certainly. He's weak.
I've given him some medicine to help him sleep.
He's in some pain and the medication makes him drift away. He's in and out.
General, I have a treat for you.
Something you may have been missing.
Another medicine?
Very well, doctor.
No, it's not mine, actually.
But it may do you some good.
Oh, so sweet. Too much sugar.
Always the problem with my esposita's lemonade.
I'm so glad to see you looking so bright.
No, no. You must be cheerful.
Let's not have a long face.
You know I like cheerfulness and brightness in a sickroom.
Esposita.
My esposita.
I know you would gladly give your life for me...
... but I am perfectly resigned.
Do not be sad.
I hope I may yet recover.
Pray for me.
But in your prayers, never forget to use the petition, "Thy will be done."
I'm so glad you're here.
Your lemonade is delicious.
- It's not too sweet.
- Too much sugar.
I never told you that.
Is that my sweet darling angel?
My Julia.
Is it certain, doctor?
Does he know?
I have not told him.
Then I will.
He must know.
He must be prepared.
My darling ...
...today is Sunday.
Do you know that the doctor says you must very soon be in heaven?
Do you not feel willing to acquiesce in
God's allotment if he wills you to go today?
I prefer it.
Well ...
... by the time this day closes...
...you will be with the blessed
Savior in his glory.
I will be an infinite gainer to be translated.
General Lee.
What is the news, Reverend?
General Lee, I must report that his case appears hopeless.
His wounds are healing, but he's dying of pneumonia.
Surely General Jackson must recover.
God will not take him from us, not now that we need him so very much.
Will you see him, sir?
No, sir, I won't. No, sir.
When you return, I trust you'll find him better.
And when the occasion offers, tell him that I prayed for him last night...
... as I never prayed,
I believe, for myself.
Please tell him.
Sir.
Push up that column.
Move up that column.
Pendleton, take charge of that line.
Where's Smith?
Tell him. Push up that column.
Move the batteries to the center of the crest. There's no time to waste.
General Stuart, no quarter to the violators of our homes and hearths.
General Lee, we must take the war to the enemy.
You are the 1 st Brigade.
Advance, my brave boys.
Press on.
Let us cross over the river...
George.
So glad you like it.
Rothman?
Who's this Rothman?
Max Rothman.
Isn't his father in shoes?
- Think so.
- Shoes or frocks.
Shoes, frocks, or stocks.
The Duke of Westminster used to own a spaniel called "Jew"... except when his Rothchild banker came over.
Then they called him "Joe".
Oo-ooh, champagne.
Max.
Why are you wasting this divine tipple on these swine?
Insecurity, I suppose.
Insecurity is the mother of an overdraft.
- Oo-ooh.
- George Grosz.
I hear the sound of new money.
I'm for sale.
I might pay for this evening yet.
Come.
Take care of Grosz for me.
George.
George!
A moment.
- Mr. Epp.
- Oh.
Mrs. Epp, I think Max would like a quick word with you.
George, do you want a drink?.
Hello, hello.
- So nice to see you.
- Hello.
I have a Monet downstairs.
- Monet? Why?
- Yes.
I thought this might be a tad too modern for you.
Are you questioning my modernity?
- God, no, no.
- I hate those waterlilies, it always reminds me of a gardening catalogue.
Maybe you'd like to see it?
Are you sure?
- I'll go down and get it.
- I'll take the Ernst.
And who is this funny fellow who looks like a butcher?.
- Grosz, George Grosz.
- I'll take two of him.
Excellent.
Didn't know you had a Monet.
I don't.
How are you?
Don't spiel me.
Where's your wife?
Waiting for her entrance,
I suppose.
- And where's that leave me?
- Talented, with options.
I'm tired of options.
You're too young to be tired of options.
I'd really love to see you again.
Tell me, Max, where's the future in it?
The future?
No...
I've seen the future.
Believe me, it came straight at us.
There's no future in the future.
So you might as well...
Nina, mon amour.
Nice to see you.
Hello, darling.
- How'd it go?
- Hm-mm.
I fell out at every turn, but they seemed to like it.
- That's what matters.
- It's going well?
Who knows?
Do you know what you look like?
Like your wife, I hope.
No. Like a woman defying gravity.
That's what we do, us ladies.
I left my cigarettes at the theater.
Poppy.
The champagne.
Poppy.
There's one more case on the sidewalk.
- And these are on loan.
- I'll pay you back with interest.
- The 16th?
- Yeah, the list. And you?
9th.
Hussars.
Nah, cavalry.
- Where do you want it?
- Thank you.
Inside the door.
Thank you, Corporal.
Is this your building?
Is this some sort of club?
- I sell art.
- In here?
- Uh-huh. Is that a portfolio?
- Yeah.
Fork it over, let's take a look.
What's your market then?
- Mostly modern stuff.
- Oh, modern.
Like uh... next time I have diarrhea
I'll take a shit on a canvas and bring it round to you, huh?
You could do worse.
I certainly wouldn't reject it out of hand,
I'm open to everything.
Would you like a cigarette?
They give you cancer of the lung.
Are you a doctor?.
Hello, darling.
Liselore von Peltz, this is Corporal...
Hitler.
Adolf Hitler.
Hello.
Thank you for coming.
- Is she your wife?
- My wife's inside.
- You're a funny one.
- Come in.
- Have a glass of champagne.
- I don't drink.
- That's original.
- Yes, well...
- best be on my way.
- Thanks again for the hand.
The 16th?
We were together at Ypres.
Yes, we were.
Perhaps only a few kilometers apart.
I did some modern stuff in the trenches.
That I would very much like to see.
You know where to find me.
Max Rothman.
Das Eisern Werk.
How do you like your fish,
Daddy?
Mm-mm, lovely.
Ja, that was delicious.
Are you finished?
You hardly touched it.
I don't know how you stay so thin.
- She has a parasite.
- I don't, thank God.
Yes, yes, but tell her about that girl in the company.
Oh, Esther swallowed a tapeworm.
On purpose.
- A Jewish girl did this?
- Isn't that fabulous?
- Why?
- To lose weight, Mammy.
I don't think this is dinnertable conversation.
Yes, but thank God it's lunch and we're all grown up.
As a medical man, don't you find that fascinating?
Here is a girl who has a certain... a certain aesthetic standard which she... adheres herself to...
I don't think this is an appropriate conversation.
I know, I know, it certainly isn't.
But wouldn't the condition be chronic if it took, Nin?
Did it?
All right.
Let's talk about... the weather, literally.
Have you been outside today?
Isn't it gorgeous?
I think it's what the English call an Indian summer.
But it's November.
I don't think Max is saying that it isn't, Dad.
Isn't that what they call the last days of October, November...
- Indian summer?.
- No, no, that's autumn.
What they call fall.
I'm going for a stroll.
He hasn't been able to sit still since he came back.
Balls!
He was already a neuropath before the war.
Do you know what Ferdi told me yesterday?
Doctors are mostly judged by their hands.
Fucking bourgeois prick.
Our commander lost half the battalion because he had
- a "von" before his name.
- You're saying the Russians are right?
I'm saying we shouldn't be so quick to judge them,
- maybe they're onto something.
- They're onto something all right.
- They never should have killed the tsar.
- Really?
Why?
Because the tsar was such a good guy?
What about those kids, did they deserve a bullet?
- And that little boy?
- To make stew, you gotta chop meat.
And what kind of stew is that, soldier?.
Speak up.
Hello, hello.
No, no, no, don't get up.
A little taste for everyone.
Nothing's wrong with that.
Nothing at all.
But let's take a closer look at these stew chefs.
Marx...
Jew.
Lenin... mongrel Jew.
Trotsky...
Jew from "A" to "z".
Yeah, so?
Did you ever know a Jew to do anything for anybody else, except raise your rent?
What do you think, Corporal?
I don't believe in anti-Semitism.
Not in emotive anti-Semitism anyway.
What the hell does that mean?
It means I don't believe that anti-Semitism should be based on emotions... which just leads to pogrom and anarchy... but rather on the facts.
I'm not sure I quite understand your point, Corporal.
My point is, Captain, that the Semitic question is far too important to be left to the individual.
It ought to be in the domain of the government, like public health or sewage.
I think you look handsome.
What's the price on this?
I'm not gonna bite.
Seven marks for the suit.
Two marks for the shirt.
And the tie... we'll call it an even 10.
- Why put a gallery in an ironworks?
- You know what they used to make here?
Locomotives.
And now they're recovering the iron and steel and selling it as scrap.
Beating swords into ploughshares?
That wouldn't be a bad lead.
No, no, that's too soft, that's too pacifistic.
- Not subversive enough.
- Subversive?
Yes, subversive.
I mean, Jesus God, what a giant piece of kitsch theater this last war was.
It was all fought on rail and yet the Kaiser went on horse surrounded by the princes with the regiments and the banners snapping in the breeze like it was Agincourt.
But it wasn't Agincourt, was it?
But you're an ex-cavalry man.
So I know exactly of which I speak.
And from now on we must make art with the same unsentimentality, the same principles that we would the manufacture of bayonets.
Bayonets?
Yes, or maybe wash bins would work.
- No, we'll stick with bayonets.
- Bayonets is a lot sharper.
- Yes it is. Yes.
Mind if we take a look around?
Be my guest.
Ah, Corporal Hitler.
"Hit-ler".
Not living in the barracks anymore?
It's not like there's a lot of cheap housing around for vets, is there?
No, I suppose there isn't.
- Can I offer you some coffee?
- No, I never touch it.
No caffeine, no alcohol, no nicotine, no meat.
- You're an ascetic.
- Not at all, I'm a man of the people.
I see you brought your goods.
Don't expect anything abstract.
I'm a great believer in Schopenhauer's dictum that art should proclaim,
"Yes by God, this is how it really is".
But life can be quite abstract at times, wouldn't you agree?
How do you mean?
Sometimes "life," as you say, won't be captured by the forms and lines of traditional representation,
- especially not these days.
- I disagree completely.
Art should only ever reflect the eternal values and the natural laws, especially these days.
But aren't these eternal values and natural laws in flux these days?
Aren't they meant to be shrinking and expanding?
What are you, some kind of intellectual wet fart?
The eternal values are: harmonious proportions; nobility and dignity; and the continuation of the cultural evolution, where each generation stands upon the shoulders of the next and improves the work of the last.
But this is... no, 100 steps backwards.
This is the undoing of the previous generations.
This is filth!
This is blood poisoning.
Are you a friend of Marinetti's?
Is that what this is about?
Yes? Some sort of mad reverse futurist?
- Futurists?
- Yes, Italians.
They experienced the war
"pictorially".
Like you, I'm hoping.
Some of the Italians fought well.
He served, right?
Grosz? Yes he did,
Grenadier Guards, I think.
- Bolshie, huh?
- No, not really.
- Just pissed off.
- Oh, yeah.
What's he pissed off about?
He thinks people should have the right to strike.
And you, Rothman?
- Are you pissed off?.
- About the right to strike?
No, about your arm.
You were gonna be a painter, right?
You're a funny one.
- Well?
- I think it's good, but I think you could go even deeper.
Deeper?.
- What do you mean, deeper?.
- I mean it's good, but I sense you're just scratching at the surface.
When I look at this work
I see a pretty solid technique, but what I am missing is an authentic voice.
One gets the feeling that you're holding something back and for the work to really leap forward, to take the next step.
I keep going back to this notion of an authentic voice.
What I mean to say is,
I was there, and you were there, and
I know what it looked like, but what did it feel like?
That's what we want to know, isn't it?
Does any of what
I'm saying resonate?
I suppose what I'm trying to say is you have to go as deep as you possibly can.
Then you have to gather yourself and say, "Okay, I just broke the surface deeper still".
You know, Rothman... when I came back from this war,
I came back to nothing.
Really nothing.
No homeland, no home, no parents, no family, no fiancee, no profession, no job, no food, no closet full of... old hockey sticks and tennis rackets.
Not even an address.
All I have in this world is the conviction that I am a great artist and a master builder.
And you just stole from that.
From the one thing that's mine... a rich boy like you.
So, if art as an object is dead, why is everything so expensive?
Otherwise nobody would buy it.
Soldier #1:
You Bolshie bastard.
Fucking communist.
Soldier #2:
Fucking comrade communist.
Soldier #1: Bastard.
Soldier #2: Bolshie.
Soldier #1:
Bolshevik.
Soldier #2:
Get up.
Soldier #1:
Come on, you stupid pig.
Looks like Corporal Hitler had a difficult time in the city.
Soldier #1:
Communist bastard.
Keeping warm, Corporal?
Friend of yours?
It's a study for a work called
"The Cultural Consumptive".
I know the type.
Just clever enough to be unhappy.
You're an interesting man.
Artists aren't known for their nerve.
You were awarded the Iron Cross, first class, weren't you?
Would you like to learn how to speak in public?
We're offering a course to certain people.
- What kind of course?
- A course in a new kind of science.
It is called propaganda.
- The course consists of...
- Yes, I know about propaganda.
Well it also consists of philosophy, history, economics.
I'm going to be frank with you, Corporal, we're in trouble.
Germany's balanced on a razor's edge.
Will she fall to the left or to the right?
I think that depends largely on the army, sir.
You strike me as an unusually perceptive man, Corporal.
May we count on you?
Of course, the army will pay for your expenses.
Hm-mm?
Lads, may I present for your edification
Herr von Lieberfelt and his troupe?
Sorry,
Major von Lieberfelt.
Men, good evening.
I'm here to present you with a challenge.
Have you ever noticed that the Jews only fuck each other?.
Why?
Because they guard the purity of their blood.
So, if we guard the purity of our blood the way they guard the purity of their blood, we see the world as it really is.
Our divine ancestors, the Aryans, came to Earth from outer space.
Forged in a matrix of ice and war,
Ar became the first divine artist warrior.
But then... the Aryan was lead into temptation by soft swarthy people from bountiful lands.
Shh-hh.
Shh-hh.
And Ar's blood is polluted.
And Ar grows weak.
And Ar becomes the slave of the Jews.
Grail Knights!
Yes, because you are
Grail Knights.
If we guard the purity of our blood, we have it in our power to again straddle the Earth like supermen.
Mr. Rothman:
I eat a little grilled fish, no meat... no red meat... lots of fruit, lots of green vegetables, cheese.
Nina's father:.
How are you sleeping?
- Six hours a night.
- That's not enough.
That's too much.
I sleep too much.
No stimulants.
I'm off coffee.
Everything has to be bio now.
Steamed vegetables.
- He has a new doctor.
- Why doesn't he come see me?
You don't charge enough.
I've lost 15 Ibs.
I'm in and out of the tailor all the time.
I don't charge enough?!
What does she mean?!
Hullo, it's Hamlet.
Hello, all. Doctor, Anna.
Mother, may I say you look very well?
You owe me two cases... no, three cases...
I'll put them in the car before you leave.
Do you know the difference between a Jewish mother and a Rottweiler?.
Yes.
- Poppy, you've lost weight.
- You noticed?
Eventually the Rottweiler lets go.
We have coffee, we have cake, we have sherry, we have indigestion just looking at it.
He doesn't eat.
- He has my delicate system.
- He should come and see me.
- Hello.
- Hey, sis.
Excellent, you brought the brood.
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hey, Max.
- Hello there.
- Hello. Poppa.
? Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you?
? Happy Birthday, dear Paulie?
? Happy Birthday to you.?
All: Yeah!
- Plates, please...
- Plates, please.
Would you like some cake?
Thank you for your plate.
Such a lovely boy.
As I was saying, Max, it's a bubble, a chimera.
Everybody and his mother wants to be a speculator these days, and nobody knows what they're doing.
Never been in it in my life, you know that.
Not productive.
All anybody wants to talk about today is the market.
Such a bore.
How's your sentimental life?
Torrid. Yours?
Arid, but sunny.
And how is your sentimental life?
That's not a penis, is it?
I think she might be dreaming of one.
You have much more fun in your day than we had in mine.
Men!
I have terrible news.
Our government, if you can call this group of Jews, homosexuals, and draft dodgers a government, has accepted a peace in Versailles, a piece so unjust, it will surely lead to another war, thank God.
Thank God, because an army at peace is like a whore at mass... no bloody good to anyone.
So men, I want you on the street today, and here's the message:
"Stabbed in the back".
By who, sir?.
- Who said that?
- Me.
Doesn't matter.
Doesn't matter.
What matters is that Germany is absolved from having lost the war and prepared to wage the next one.
Fellow loses a game, he doesn't want to play anymore.
You tell him he lost because someone else cheated, then you have to hold him back from picking up the cards again.
Just remember, the army is the only vital element of our society.
War is vitality.
War is the hygiene of the world.
Yes?
- Versailles, no, no, no.
- The treaty is unfair.
Versailles, no, no, no.
Germany for the Germans.
- What are they saying?
- Versailles.
Give us back our land!
They're saying Versailles.
"Here are the terms of the treaty of Versailles.
Germany is to cede
Alsace-Lorraine to France..."
What?
"... Upper Silesia and West
Prussia to Poland".
- Poland?
- "The army will be reduced to 100,000 men.
France will occupy the Rhineland for the next 15 years and Germany will assume a war debt of 20 million gold marks
There aren't 20 million marks in this entire country.
"Furthermore,
Germany is to sign a so-called war guilt clause in which she assumes sole responsibility for the war
I'm ashamed to be German today.
- Hey.
- Hey.
There's a meeting down the street.
I didn't serve,
I just played the market.
I lost my arm in the crash.
Come on, brother.
...Alsace-Lorraine to France.
This is disgusting!
We are being stabbed in the back!
Just 'cause you take it in the ass.
- Stabbed in the back!
- This guy is full of shit.
He works for the army.
He's a provocateur.
And look at his muscle.
- Bastards, fucking bastards.
- Let him be, boys, let him be.
A provoc...
A provac...?
That's a French word, isn't it?
No wonder I can't get my tongue around it.
You ever notice with chaps like this that their French is really good?
So's their Russian... better than their German, actually.
I'll tell you who I am, because I've got nothing to hide.
I'm a little man, four years in the trenches.
Don't speak French.
Don't know the Latin.
Never made it past corporal.
Guess that's because I didn't have a "von" before my name.
You might say
I'm the unknown soldier just like you.
- What do you think?.
- I think he's a nothing, sir.
He's got a big mouth.
- Gassed, almost went blind...
- You're right, he's a nothing.
Perhaps that's his secret.
Perhaps it's the age of the nothing.
Lots of lads got it worse.
Now I'm back looking for a job.
Can't find one, though.
- Paid 10 marks for a suit.
- You paid too much.
That's what I said to the Jew who sold it to me.
I can see where this is going.
- Make no mistake,
- Nothing new, nothing new.
Germany's greatest enemy lives within.
Herr Rothman.
Herr Rothman, I'm...
I'm honored.
I happened to be in the neighborhood, so...
I'm sorry I left so... abruptly the other day.
You know what they say in Spain, don't you?
No, I don't.
It's easy to fight the bull from the barrera.
Bullfighting is completely immoral.
- It's vile and disgusting.
- No, no.
It means it's easier to be a critic than an artist.
What did you think of my speech?
Let's just say if you were to put the same amount of energy into your art as you do your speaking, you may have something going.
I best be on my way.
Hitler, come on, I'll buy you a glass of lemonade.
Come on.
Where'd you get the sunglasses?
Progg and Fromm.
Try 'em.
Chic.
Very chic, Rothman.
- Can I get another coffee? Strong.
- Waiter:. Yes, sir, I'll get it.
So you're an anti-Semite?
- - On the contrary, I admire the Jews.
- Really?
Yes, they're very intelligent people.
There are intelligent ones and not so intelligent ones...
They're all intelligent because they guard the purity of their blood.
- What?
- The purity of the blood.
Because the secret of the Jews lies in their pure Jewish blood.
That's why they're the mightiest counterpart to the Aryan race.
- What's the secret?
- Is your father Jewish?
- Yes, he is.
- Mother?.
Why not ask whether she's a German?
Mensch!
Of course your mom's Jewish.
You're an awfully hard man to like, Hitler, but I'm gonna try, because if I've learned anything over the past four years, it's that we all shit the same, scream the same, and die the same.
There's no need for vulgarity,
Rothman.
I know where you've been and God knows we've all been turned into assholes there.
Listen to me well, you may not think you're an anti-Semite,
- but in fact you are.
- I'm not.
But in this, as in all things, there's a reason.
Your own hero
Nietzsche said anti-Semitism is the ideology of those who feel cheated.
How do you know
Nietzsche's my hero?
- You've obviously skimmed his ideas.
- I don't feel cheated.
Excellent.
Then stop acting like it.
Are you gonna smoke another cigarette?
- You just put one out.
- Exactly.
Now where is my instinct, my secret instinct for self-preservation,
I ask you?
I've heard these theories all my life.
Blood science, eugenics, it's rubbish.
It's complete nonsense, it's kitsch.
Put it out of your mind.
It's not modern, it's not scientific.
It will hold you back as an artist.
Speaking of which, how's your work coming along?
And why are you making those appalling speeches for the army?
I'm just keeping my hand in it.
- Keeping your hand in what?
- The army is paying my expenses.
So you don't actually believe that rubbish.
Don't tell me you're happy with the "peace
- Hello, Max.
- Hello, Esther.
How are you, sweetheart?
I think the "peace" is a travesty.
But I don't think I can be bothered to pick up the German banner from the mud with my left arm.
I gave at the office, you know.
Yes... yes, yes, you did.
I'm thinking about writing a book on politics, you know?.
You're a man of many talents.
Where do you find time to paint?
Mensch, use your head.
I'm still in the army.
I'm folding laundry.
I'm cleaning out the shithouses.
Painting costs money.
I don't have a pot to piss in.
Here's what
I'd like to do.
I'd like to take some of your work off consignment.
Here's an advance against your future sales.
Spend it any way you like.
Find yourself a nice girl.
Get drunk.
Get out of politics.
Rothman, you... you've saved my life.
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I've yet to find my authentic voice.
Maybe I should get more modern.
If I'm to be completely honest with myself,
I've always admired some of the ideas behind Cubism.
Seems to me you have a great affinity for ideas.
Is that some clever way of saying I have poor technique?
Try not to be one of those people who finds a slight in any compliment.
I imagine it would just be altogether too bourgeois to turn on the heat.
On top of me.
Below me.
Inside of me.
I am always by your side.
I have to go.
Half man, half doll.
Every woman's dream.
Bills, bills, bills, Fraulein.
- Bills are so violent.
- Sorry, sorry...
I couldn't stop him.
There you are, Rothman.
Slept in late, did you?
What are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
You told me I had a show.
A show?.
A show?.!
I told you I would take some of your work on consignment.
They way I understand that term is
I keep some of your work informally,
"in trust" as it were and if I can move it,
I move it.
How are you going to "move it" if it's not up?
Am I in your studio looking over your shoulder?
No.
So don't teach your grandmother how to suck eggs.
So you're not actually going to show the work.
No. And I will tell you why.
"New Works" by Arp,
Ernst, and Grosz at Das Eisern Werk,
November 15th to December 15th.
So after December 15th.
Can we take it one step at a time?
Listen, Rothman,
I've lost four years.
Yes, we all lost four years, some of us a little more.
Do you want a show?.
I'd kill for you if you gave me a show.
Don't kill for me, please.
Just do what you do.
Be anxious, be nervous.
Tell me you're the unknown soldier come back to haunt us, with your brush, with your brush. Can you do that?
'Cause that's what you got to do.
You've gotta take this pent up stuff you're quivering with and you've gotta hurl it onto the canvas.
It doesn't have to be good and beautiful, it just has to be true.
And even if it's a lie, make it an interesting lie and I'll put it up,
I swear.
You do think I'm talented, don't you?
I think there's something rustling behind your curtain.
Good bye.
There are times...
I have these terrible doubts.
Paint them.
Paint your doubts, really!
Well? Well?
One morning, I wish you'd just say,
"Good morning. How did you pass the night?
The lovely Mrs. Rothman?
Your children in good health, I trust?"
You're such a bourgeois.
Any news?
Yes, I'm meeting an American dentist. A big collector.
Mensch!
That's good, isn't it?
If I see you anywhere near that building,
I will personally set fire to your entire life's work.
Speaking of which, when am I going to see something new?.
- Soon, soon.
- I need new things.
I'm very motivated by newness.
Newness really does it for me.
There's Dr. and Mrs. Levi.
Hello!
Ah, Levi, huh? You'll make the sale for sure, huh?
What can one say about Paul Klee that hasn't been said
100 times before?
And on the other end of the spectrum, there's a young artist
I've discovered recently named Hitler.
Less aggressively modern perhaps, but a real example... of what I call
"Krieg Kunst
- War art?
- Precisely, Doctor, precisely.
Not as mannered or tutored as Max Ernst, but a very authentic voice of the trenches.
The voice of the everyman.
The voice of the unknown soldier.
And as a gesture of solidarity with Soviet constructivism,
I would only ask five marks for these pieces.
Hard to go wrong for five marks.
What do you think, darling?
They bought the Ernst!
Oh my God.
I'm gonna die in some doorway like a dog in the street.
A complete unknown!
Nonsense.
I'm... I'm 30.
I'm 30!
Could you put that out, please?
No, fuck you!
I'm in my own place.
You want the truth?
I'll tell you the truth.
You're a bit lazy.
A chap like Ernst, up at the crack of dawn, working.
This Ernst, what's he look like?
- He's rather good looking.
- Rather like me, huh?
Mm-huh.
Eyes?
- Light.
- Hello.
Yes, but could you paint that?
Of course I could.
The man has no technique.
Technique is not what makes the painting interesting.
What makes it compelling is what Max Ernst reveals.
You could almost say he admits, confesses, about himself.
Could you do that?
Could you be so voluptuous with yourself?.
Hm-mm?
I think so.
The train is leaving the station.
One question remains:
- Why aren't you on board?
- I don't know.
I'm in your hands.
Hand.
I've been going to seances.
Really?
That sounds progressive.
Yes, it is. It's most instructive to learn how the old German Gods were usurped by the young
God of Israel, the God of guilt, the projection of slaves.
- Sounds like lunch at my house.
- Always the joker, huh?
Why are we here?
What has this got to do with modern art?
Nothing, I just like it here.
I thought you were gonna teach me about modern art.
It's inhuman what they're doing to these birds.
- It's inhuman.
- Why don't you set them free?
That'd be a great art project.
We'd have Chinese nightingales in the park for years to come.
They'd sing in the snow.
And people would come for miles around and they would be known as Hitler's Nightingales.
Are you on the spike?
Is that what's wrong with you?
Bloody hell!
Damn it!
- Hullo, midgets.
- What are you doing, Dad?
Dad said a bad word.
You are a very clever girl,
Ada, love of my life.
You're right.
That's exactly what Dad has been thinking about, "words
Good words... and bad words.
Because words are magic.
Sometimes I think the world is strung together by words.
Victory!
Poppy?
Yes, young man?
In the world upside down, what would we be doing now?.
In the world upside down, we'd be having breakfast.
And what would we have for breakfast?
In the world upside down?
Let's see.
For breakfast we'd have grilled sole, green beans, new potatoes, plum pudding for dessert, yum!
And in the world upside down right now I would say,
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you, Paulie.
I'd loathe you beyond reason, wouldn't I?
Now go to sleep.
And tomorrow we'll fly around the sun together.
- He would be.
- Hello, darling.
Hi, sweetheart.
George Grosz, Adolf Hitler.
My wife Nina.
- You...
- Hello.
- Grosz: Nice guy.
- Oh, he's a futurist.
- Grosz: Really, what's his name?
- Hitler.
- Never heard of him.
- You will. Are you ready?
Nina: Oh, Hitler.
Are you a painter?.
Yes, I'm an artist.
You are a friend of my husband's?
Of sorts.
In August 1914,
I volunteered for the army and was accepted to my father's old regiment, the Light Hussars.
I used to think we rode into the war on horseback, but now I realize that in fact we rode into the war on words.
Yes, my friend, words.
If the high command had used nails to hammer our feet to the mud,
I think we would've found a pair of pliers, passed them down the line and made a break for it, but the words, the words kept us rooted to the ground.
Now these are magical words, used in mass hypnosis.
And if you would like millions of young men to give up their lives for your cause, you must first learn these words.
Repeat after me.
The enemy is "the foe" or "the host
"The enemy is the foe or the host
Danger is "peril
"Danger is peril
To be brave is to be "gallant
"To be brave is to be gallant
The dead... oh, yes, the dead, they're not "dead
They are "the fallen
One's chest is one's "breast
To move quickly is to be "swift
A soldier is...
A warrior.
"A warrior
War is "strife
Actions are "deeds
To die is to "perish
To sleep is to "slumber
The sky are the "heavens
Blood, "elan vital
And arms and legs...
...are "noble limbs
Hey, soldier.
Thank you.
It's disgusting!
It's revolting!
That was a miscalculation of rare magnitude, wouldn't you say?
You're the dealer. They want you to sell their paintings and make 'em rich, not scare the fuckin' shit out of 'em.
Darling, that wasn't Paulie's cowboy hat, was it?
What a masquerade he puts on.
Hussar this, father's regiment that.
As German as you or I, butter wouldn't melt in his mouth.
Finagling himself, throwing his money around.
Finding himself a German whore and of course all the while staying married in the faith.
Always working on the inside from the outside.
Why, the patient looks perfectly healthy.
But then you look at the turd, but really look at it, and then you see the worms crawling around.
There weren't any of the men there, were there?
No, no. Only artists and the usual degenerates.
- I'm sure they adored it.
- They hated it.
They hated it!
They stood there like stiffs.
It went over their head.
This Rothman... this... this Rothman...
Rothman made the whole war look small and pointless, ridiculous, absurd.
Don't despair, Junge.
You've got your own talent, you have to let it out.
Let it out.
...is essentially feminine, it takes...
- Hello.
- a strong masculine type.
Rothman.
What did you think?.
The other night?
My disaster?.
Did it remind you of Ypres?
- Or was it just rubbish?
- Yes, what did you think?.
It didn't remind me of Ypres.
No?
What did it remind you of, if anything?
It reminded me perhaps... perhaps, of a particularly disgusting and depraved dream of Ypres.
As opposed to the happy, glorious one.
Exactly.
Exactly!
Which your piece implies is ipso facto impossible.
Listen to them, farting higher than their asshole.
What was that you said, Erich?
- I said...
- Yes, I know what you said.
My question was rhe-tor-i-cal.
It's a difficult word, isn't it, Erich?
Shall I ask you to spell it?
Well, this was fun but duty calls and I must mind the store.
Can't give up the day job.
We forgive you for a lot, don't we?
Forgive and forget, turn the other way where others wouldn't.
Nicht, Erich?
Nicht?
My God, what philistines you all are!
Rothman.
How's my career going?
Slow. The whole market's slow right now.
Who are those gentlemen?
- Guttersnipes.
- Don't seem very good company.
I'm flirting with politics again.
It's a party that promotes the interests of the veteran, but sometimes you have to build a base from the base.
Do you?
I'll just have to take your word for that.
Listen, do you want to meet some girls?
- Girls?
- Yes, Hitler, girls.
Those brilliant creatures who make you feel artistic without doing a stitch of work.
Come on.
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.
So there were parts of it you liked?
I know you're more of a patriot than I am.
Where'd you come up with the idea of the toys?
My son.
You should have children.
They give you good ideas.
Ever consider the future,
Hitler?.
The future? I think all my work's based on the future.
Yes, and what do you see?
Do you see fame, money, beautiful lovers?
- I see myself teaching.
- Hm-mm.
And you, Rothman?
How do you see the future?
Look inside my pocket.
"Would you die for the mother-in-law land?"
You're a menace, Rothman.
I got another one for you.
"War is the instrument with which the happy..." no, no, reverse that.
"War is the instrument by which the unhappy turn the happy
- into themselves
- Mensch.
Don't you know genius and happiness go together about as well as cheese and chalk?.
Cheese and chalk.
Paint that.
No, I disagree.
You know that all great cultures die from the same cause, blood poisoning.
Don't you know that all great... truly great art comes from the struggle... the titanic, the epic, the eternal struggle.
Are you saying all art should be political?
No, no, no, dear girl,
I'm simply speaking of the pure blood mixture.
Everything depends on blood mixture and the resultant drops in racial levels.
Hitler's very concerned with blood.
We think, we hope it's a metaphor.
He's a futurist. Doesn't he sort of remind you of Marinetti?
No, no.
- He does a bit.
- What are you doing with this man?
- He's the most horrible creature.
- He doesn't have any friends.
Of course he doesn't have any friends, he doesn't listen.
- And this thing about blood.
- He had a bad war.
No, darling, you had a bad war.
I'm sure he had a fine war.
What do you feel guilty about, Max?.
I don't feel guilty.
I think guilt is a second-rate emotion.
On the other hand, when I came back from the war,
I came back to my family, and my bank account, my parents and the best care.
And he came back to nothing, but really nothing.
- Clearly you do feel guilty.
- No, but I acknowledge the fact that I don't know what it's like to come back to nothing.
Darling, you're wrong.
You've come back to nothing and every day I see you turn that into something so beautiful.
I told him the other day that his insane fucking ideas were holding him back as an artist and he tries, he really does, sometimes.
Until tonight, of course, but that's because he feels insecure being around you two lovely ladies.
Just remember,
Florence Nightingale died of syphilis.
And that means what?
Don't get too close to your charity cases.
You've got chocolate all over your mouth.
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.
I just want to know what he has in that briefcase, it's the second time he went to the loo.
He just left.
Fucking bitches.
Forget about it, Rothman.
May I?
The artist at home.
What an artist you are.
What a vision, so clear... such focus.
I almost feel guilty asking you this, because I don't want to take you away from your work, but for a while we've been taking an interest in a small political party.
It has 500 or 600 members.
It's called the National
Socialist Workers Party.
Don't let the name fool you, they are as socialist as you and me.
We had a speaker scheduled for them, but the fellow's come down with a cold.
So we were wondering if you'd be persuaded to say a few words.
But of course,
I understand if the muses are...
David, what do you think of the future?
I think it's expensive.
Max.
- How are you?
- Fine. You look fine.
Thank you.
Is that a fur bath?
Yes. Yes, it is.
Yes it is.
Gert is in good health,
I trust?
Yeah, she's fine, she's fine.
So am I... in the soup, as they say?
No, no, no, the soup's good.
You're in the shit.
Oh, that's nice.
Max, this is serious.
I know you're just careless, but the tax people could easily take a different position.
Hm-mm.
What do you suggest?
I suggest we write them a check right away and we plead forgetfulness and artistic license.
I can't, I'm skint.
I just gave George an advance.
You promised you were gonna run this as a business.
Could you borrow from your father?.
No, I don't want to bother him.
Arrange for another loan against Das Eisen Werk.
It's not so simple.
The boys at the bank are gonna want to know what it's for.
Ask your dad.
It's so much simpler, it's just a loan.
- Hello, Fraulein.
- Hello.
Good bye, Max.
Good bye, David.
What is it that your brother calls the art business?
Baked air.
Baked air.
That is so...
- great.
- Sorry I'm late, Herr Rothman.
You know that horrible little tramp who's always making you feel guilty?
Herr Hitler.
He's making a speech near us, where we live and I really think you should hear what he has to say.
It's disgusting!
We are being stabbed in the back!
We won this war!.
Our boys fought like lions!
Like lions!
So why in the name of Providence are we giving away
70,000 square miles of land and abandoning six million of our fellow Germans?!
Because we have been stabbed in the back!
By the profiteers and the maggots and the parasites.
And make no mistake,
Germany's greatest enemy lives within.
Deutschlanders...!
Deutschlanders...!
Deutschlanders...!
Deutschlanders...!
Deutschlanders...!
Deutschlanders...!
Ah, Rothman.
There you are.
Well, what do you think?.
What can one say?
This is... the new art.
I realized something that all you hoity-toity types missed drinking your coffee, smoking your cigarettes with your mistresses.
The way to reinvent art is not to make it political... far too small a step.
No, Rothman, you could say you and I were ploughing the same furrows for a while, but then I made the bigger leap.
Politics is the new art.
Yes, Rothman, my whole life has been a detour to this moment.
Everything I've struggled to learn about art, about design, color, composition, theater, opera, architecture...
I'm gonna stuff it all into this and make it live again.
I've always thought you to be an intuitive futurist.
You're so disappointing.
Am I only acceptable to you if you can classify me?
Isn't that emblematic of the world we both despise?
What's happened to you?
You're suddenly so conventional.
Go deeper, you said.
Well, I went deep.
I went deeper than any artist has ever gone before!
Where is the work, my dear?.
Where is the evidence of this journey into the abyss?
I am the new avant garde!
I am the new artist practicing the new art!
And politics is the new art!
Hello.
Hello.
You look pensive.
No, no, no...
I was just thinking...
Where are you going?
I have to return some drawings.
And I'm being dragged to shul again tonight.
He just wants to get away from your mother.
Sometimes I think we're all marching backwards.
How do I rate?
As a partner?.
Promising.
Especially when you learn to apply yourself.
While on the subject, I hear it takes more than one girl to tell you that you're still handsome.
But at a certain point... it starts to get in the way... of...
Progress?
Exactly.
You know, progress really does it for me.
I'll see you tonight.
Well, I'm... sorry it didn't work out.
Yes. Well, look, Rothman, you're a...
- a...
- A what, Hitler?.
You're a... a well-born sort of person.
By Caesarean, actually.
A nice sort of person.
There's a lot of people in this country who don't like... well-born sorts.
We'll just have to live with that, won't we?
What's this?
- Some designs.
- Hm-mm.
My God.
That's certainly an alternative to boring old modernism.
This is some old new future world, isn't it?
Yes.
This will be the symbol for the whole movement, it's a Sanskrit symbol for energy, for the sun, but I've reversed it.
Yeah this... that I've seen before.
Yes, but against a white background?
My God, you really worked this out, didn't you?
Down to the uniforms
- and...
- Yes, I see.
- And what kind of roads.
- Roads?
Even in the more thickly populated areas these large super roads will create a sense of open space and of flying.
Hitler, this is meant work.
You finally found your voice.
The future... as a return to the past.
You wouldn't show it, would you?
Yes.
I will.
Because this work... well... this work belongs in a gallery.
You're not pulling my leg, are you? Because...
I do have a career in politics, you know.
Well, Hitler, what would you rather do?
Change the way people see or how they pay their taxes?
Meet me at Metropole,
Bring everything, the whole shmear.
He's created this whole new world and he has all these flags and drawings with these Teutonic references.
That doesn't sound very futuristic.
No, but you can't say it's not a coherent vision, down to detailed notes on his foreign policy.
He's created these epic roadways where the traveler will experience the feeling of flight.
He's resurrected all the German gods and it's all complete kitsch from "A" to "z
It's very interesting, it's future kitsch.
- God, he sounds mad.
- Oh, he's barking and what he's pushing makes the Kaiser seem like a Sunday painter.
- I saw him speak.
- That sounds a bit of a worry.
No, he's dreadful. He just stands there shouting slogans and posing and the whole thing's like a giant art project.
Of course the minute I said
I'd show him...
- Politics went out the window.
- Exactly.
It's gonna be a big show, a big, big, show.
- I'm gonna bring in some English artists...
- You can't afford it.
...French ones. There's this character called Duchamp, he's very interesting.
He does things with urinals and wine racks... says in the future, everything is art.
Ah, the meshugener show.
Poppy!
The future is subversive.
And I don't want to see any stiffs up front.
Yesterday there was nothing but stiffs. I never got going.
I don't have any control over who's in front.
Mensch, are you daft?
This is about control.
That's the thing about art... you don't just slap on the paint, even if it looks that way.
I need more enthusiasm up front.
I need the energy, it's like a loop.
They give it to me,
I give it to them, they give it to me.
Could you put that out, please?
It bothers my voice.
And this is the last time.
- No more.
- What are you talking about?
- I'm through.
- You're through?
Find somebody else.
Rothman's gonna give me a show.
Rothman?
Rothman?
Max Rothman?
Are you mad?
You think Herr Rothman will lift a finger for you?
You have one of the most authentic Germanic voices
I've ever heard.
And you're 30 years old.
It's now or never.
What are you waiting for?.
They are your canvas.
That's your paint.
What are you waiting for?.
Let it out.
Let it out!
Today... today...
I will address something central to my thinking!
Today, I will address the Jewish question!
Not long ago
I was strolling when I suddenly encountered an apparition in a black caftan and black hair locks!
My first question was,
"Is this a Jew?
And then the more I stared, the more my first question assumed a new form,
"Is this a German?!"
No.
Is there any form of filth, particularly in cultural life without a Jew involved in it?!
Because when you cut into an abscess, what do you find?!
Like maggots in a rotting body, a kike!
With the appearance of the first settlement, the Jew is suddenly at hand!
The stranger is given a friendly reception!
He soon becomes an active part of the economic life of the settlement!
He begins to lend money!
Now the Jew is a steady resident!
Commerce and finance have become his complete monopoly!
He begins a second phase where he begins to emphasize his Judaism less and his Germanism more!
Yes, he becomes, if you can believe it,
Germanic!
Culturally he contaminates art and literature!
Theater!.
Religion ridiculed!
Ethics and morality pissed on!
German girls turned into whores!
Whores!
The Jew casts off his final cloak and becomes the blood Jew!
The tyrant becomes the vampire of nations!
The vampire of the people of Deutschland!
Blood Jew!
Blood Jew!
- Blood Jew!
- Blood Jew!
- The blood Jew!
- Blood Jew!
- Blood Jew!
- Blood Jew!
Blood Jew!
Blood Jew!
Blood Jew! Blood Jew!
Blood Jew! Blood Jew!
- You coming for supper?.
- Mm-mm.
No. I have to meet someone at the Metropole at 9:30.
- Can I drop you?
- No, I'd like to walk.
I should get more exercise.
- I'm seeing a hypnotist Monday.
- That's good.
- Are you sure I can't drop you?
- Kiss Mammy for me.
Oh God.
Leave him.
He's finished.
- You can't bring this in.
- Please.
- No fruit or vegetables.
That includes... pomegranates. It's on your form.
- I like to eat the seed of this fruit.
One each day. For luck.
- I'm sorry, that's not allowed.
[Announcement]: For security reasons, please do not leave your bags unattended.
Veuillez garder avec vous vos bagages a main en tout temps pour des raisons de securite
- What are you doing?
- This way, I don't need to bring it in.
I eat it here, at the gate of your country.
Look.
So, I bring luck in my stomach.
Will you try it?
Raffi, the real point of this poem is that the girlfriend is crazy!
'No!' The girlfriend said angrily,
'I want your mother's heart!'
So the boy went and killed his mother.
You know what they say...
There's always a woman at the heart of it.
As he ran through the streets with her heart in his hands, he tripped and fell.
His mother's heart cried out...
'My poor boy!'
'Did you hurt yourself?'
- You know what?
I completely forgot you had a party.
- I told you she...
The party's not the point.
The fact is, you make these physical appearances without letting anybody know.
I mean, it makes perfect sense to me.
- Why would I need to tell anyone?
- I'm not saying you need permission.
Permission for what?
- Celia, just try to understand her point of view.
Raffi, stop talking about your mother.
Why can't I read her book?
- Just wait till it comes out.
- But you've read it.
- Give me your copy.
- No.
- Why not?
I'm part of the family.
- Look, I promised her that I...
- What?
- I wouldn't give you my copy.
- Please.
- Celia, come on.
- I'm making it hard for you to be the perfect son.
I'm sorry.
- I don't get why it has to be this way.
- Yes, you do.
- I was happier when you got along.
- It wasn't as much fun.
- Says who?
- The ghost of the father... my father, not yours.
Yours died like a hero.
Mine died in a stupid accident, according to her.
You look after your goals,
Raffi. And l'II look after mine.
- Did you give her my book?
- This is too weird for me.
- What is weird, Raffi?
Smoking pot? Or sleeping with your step-sister?
- I'm old enough to know what...
- What are you telling me, Raffi?
That this is all normal?
That she should continue to harass me?
Tell people that l'm responsible for her father's death?
No one asked her to come here.
She could've stayed in Montreal.
- She needed us.
- What she needs is to destroy me the same way she thinks I destroyed him.
- Mom...
- She will never understand why I stopped loving her father's.
- Or for seeing someone else?
- I'm not accountable to her.
- I am.
- Why?
- Because I love her.
That's a new twist to the story.
Why do you need to call it a story?
Don't you have anything better to do at your age than fall in love?
My age? You were married at my age!
- Thank you.
- Tony, why don't you say grace.
- For what we are about to receive, may the Lord make us truly grateful. Amen.
- Amen.
- Dad?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you say 'Amen'?
- Well, I say it inside.
- Inside where?
- Inside my head.
- Can God hear it inside your head?
- What do you think, Dad?
- God hears all your thoughts.
- But you don't believe in God.
Grandpa, that's not really what happened.
- See you.
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Here's the situation, Dad.
Whenever Tony comes over alone, he's fine.
We play, he laughs, he's full of joy.
Whenever you're around, he becomes quiet and withdrawn.
- That isn't true, Philip.
- And we can't stand it.
The more oppression you...
- Oppression?
He loves when l'm there.
- The more you bring this heavy cloud into our apartment, the more he believes that the way we live is wrong.
- Now, I have never told him that.
- You don't need to.
He can feel your disgust.
- Philip...
- And where did he get that...
Ali doesn't believe in God?
- He asked me why your friend doesn't say grace with us...
- My friend.
- I told him he had his own God.
And that's true.
Philip, l'm... l'm trying really hard to... accept all this. I really am.
- Dad... you're retiring soon.
You're gonna have a lot of time on your hands.
Either you make an effort to change your attitude, or you're not... welcome at our place anymore.
- Where you coming from?
- Turkey.
- Can you open this?
What are these?
- It's film.
It's motion-picture film.
It's for a movie.
I have, uh...
- This sort of thing is usually done through a bonder.
- Well, they wanted me to hand-deliver it.
- Who's 'they'?
- It's very valuable footage.
- Can you open it?
- Well, no.
It's exposed film.
It'II destroy it.
- Oh?
- It's for a movie that's being shot here in Canada.
I had to go to Turkey to get some process shots.
- Process shots?
- Shots that'II be used for digital effects. And plates.
That sort of thing.
- I don't understand.
- There needs to be scenes of hundreds of people passing through these places.
And it's too expensive to take actors and extras to the middle of nowhere, so we shoot empty shots of locations.
It's cheaper to add people in later on.
- Huh.
L'II be back.
Arshile Gorky's Studio
New York City, 1934
- Arshile Gorky remains one of the most influential figures in modern art.
His most famous painting,
'The Artist and His Mother,' is based on a photograph that was taken in 1912; the only image that exists of the artist's early life in his native land.
Gorky is seen holding a bunch of small flowers as a fragrant gift to his absent father, the intended recipient of this remarkable photograph.
- I'm confused.
Had Gorky changed his name by this point?
- No.
He changed it in his twenties, after his arrival to the United States.
- Celia, sit down.
- Gorky looks prematurely solemn.
With almond eyes and oval face, his hair combed neatly to the side,
Shushan looks bravely at the camera, challenging her absent husband...
- Challenging?
Why would you say that?
Isn't it obvious he knew the Armenians were about to be massacred? He went to America to prepare a life for his family.
They wanted to send him a photograph to let him know they're still alive.
There's nothing challenging...
- Gorky never understood why his father did not return.
- Celia, just sit down. Come on.
- Aren't you confusing Gorky's father with your dead husband?
I mean, your first dead husband.
The one who was shot by the police. The terrorist.
- Sit down.
Sit down. We're here to listen to this lecture.
- Let's go.
- 'The Artist and His Mother' is not simply a painted version of a photograph.
The differences underline the expressive elements that make this piece such a powerful work of art.
Gorky's homage to his mother was bound to take on sacred quality.
His experience as a survivor of the Armenian genocide is at the root of its spiritual power.
With this painting, Gorky had saved his mother from oblivion, snatching her out of a pile of corpses to place her on a pedestal of life.
Let me look at you son.
You're missing a button!
It must have fallen off...
Hold your hand in front of it.
Like this?
Yes.
I'm just so shocked to see you here.
I've seen all your films and I really...
- Please. Please.
- We're the ones who are overwhelmed by this.
I've been writing this screenplay for five years, done as much research as possible and you come up with this.
- With what?
- Well, that Gorky was a child during the rebellion in Van, that he was there.
It's amazing.
- My mother was a genocide survivor.
All my life, I promised to make a film to tell her story, how she suffered.
And now, we are making this film.
- I'm not understanding something.
Is Gorky in your film?
- Not yet.
- As you were speaking, we got very excited about the idea of working him in. As another character.
Well, not an entirely new character, but a character we could build on.
See, this amazing artist as a young kid...
It would be great to have you as a consultant.
- You have her photos, a gift from the ashes of all that has been destroyed.
We can open this gift together.
- What's going on?
- Why did you bring up my dad?
Well, he didn't run away.
Okay, my mum just had to distance herself from him.
- Huh. To save the family.
- He wasn't a terrorist.
- I didn't say he was.
- You said he was a terrorist.
- Did I? Well,
I suppose you could see it that way.
I mean, he was about to assassinate a diplomat.
- He was a freedom fighter.
Celia, there's a difference.
- Sure, it was a really cool way to go.
A lot better than my dad... jumping off a cliff.
- Jumping.
- He committed suicide.
- Well, that's new.
I thought the story was my mom pushed him off the cliff.
- Story.
You think l'm making up a story?
- No, it's... it's not what I meant.
- Raffi, l'm saying that what happened to my father matters.
I know that no one else cares, but it matters to me.
- Well, then how do I make it matter, what happened to my father?
- You just do.
- How?
- You go there.
And you stick it in here.
And you listen to it beat.
Beat all night, all day.
That way, you never forget.
- Mount Ararat.
When I was a boy, my mother used to tell me this was ours.
Even though it was so far away.
And I used to dream of a way to approach it, to make it belong to who I was, to who I became.
- Marty, this book is the key to your character.
It's the actual journal of Clarence Ussher, published in Boston and New York in 1917.
Every scene in this film is based on this document.
Think of it.
It is the true story of a man who sees an entire community wiped out and is sickened by it.
So... so you can't play it...
- l've read this book.
As well as every available piece of archival material that so much as hints at the region or these people or the Armenian genocide.
I'm currently rereading the Bible with Ussher in mind, so beyond that, it's pretty much... up to my imagination.
And now l'm here to make a film with Edward...
Saroyan.
Okay?
- This painting was very, very popular even 100 years ago, when it was painted.
And it's very popular now.
People love this painting.
And I think it's because... because it's such a warm, safe picture of two little kids.
We get the feeling that these two kids in front of the fire, warming themselves after their bath...
- How'd it go?
- Think it went great.
- Did you get it?
Did he like you?
- I think so.
[Ring!]
Hello.
Yeah. Oh my God!
Oh my God!
- Good news?
- He just got a big part.
In a movie.
- Let me call you right back.
'Cause l'm in a gallery and I can't really talk.
- Do you play a good guy or a bad guy?
- I play a very, very, very bad man.
Rah!!!
Rah!
Outside the city of Van,
Eastern Turkey, 1915
Just look at them!
Nice and comfortable... sipping their coffee.
No idea what's about to hit them.
Let me take a shot...
You couldn't shoot a cow!
There's another twenty... twenty five... creeping up on us...
And in the front... one chicken.
Aim!
Fire!
- Leave your weapons outside!
Get him inside.
Get his clothes off.
And get him ready for surgery.
To make sure that we get help, l'm sending each of you out to deliver a copy of this letter.
[Armenian]
The letter says to Americans or any foreign consul, that there are internal troubles in Van.
[Armenian]
So inform the American government that American lives are in danger.
[Armenian]
- And cut.
- That's a cut.
- Okay, everybody.
- Everything you see here is based on what my mother told me.
What is it?
- You wouldn't be able to see
Mount Ararat from Van.
- Well, yes, but I thought it would be important.
- But it's not true.
- It's true in spirit.
- See what you can do, okay?
And let me know.
Okay, I gotta go.
Yeah, I gotta get off.
Okay, l'II talk to you later.
Okay, bye.
Sorry, I had a call.
- Rouben, Ani's confused about the mountain, Ararat.
She has noticed quite correctly that it would not be seen from Van.
- Well, we thought we could stretch things a bit.
I mean, it's such an identifiable symbol and given the moment in history that we're trying to show, l just...
- So it's something you could justify?
- Sure. Poetic license.
- Where do you get those?
- Wherever you can.
- So that's my job?
To let you feel better about distorting things?
- The young boy in our film gets sent by Ussher to deliver a letter.
He gets caught by the Turks.
- That's the character we'd make into Gorky.
- How would you do that?
- Okay. By April 1915, the Turks have completely surrounded the Armenian quarter.
Within the quarter, inside these fortified walls, the American mission, run by a Dr. Clarence Ussher. Okay?
Outside, a few hundred men armed with ancient guns are surrounded by well-armed troops with the latest in European artillery.
Miraculously, through their ingenuity, or their teamwork, they're able to hold the Armenian position, but they're completely isolated.
They're cut off from the outside world.
Ussher has to somehow get word to the outside world about what's about to happen.
And so he hopes that one of these boys...
Gorky, will get through.
- So do it.
- That's it?
That's all you have to say?
Edward Saroyan is one of the greatest directors in the world.
- Twenty years ago.
- Yes...
- Whatever.
- Raffi, you know how long l've been working on this.
If it can help Gorky's story get told...
- Go for it.
What?
- Why do you still sleep here?
- It's my home.
- Doesn't she want you there?
- It's uncomfortable.
It's too humid.
- Can we talk about what happened the other night?
- Sure.
- That's why she wanted to read my book, so she could humiliate me?
- So fight back.
- Don't be ridiculous.
She knows next to nothing about art. And l'm certainly not going to respond to her accusations.
- You seem to be doing a pretty good job.
- What are you talking about?
- Just the way you use history like a weapon.
I mean, talking about
Gorky's mother as a way of attacking
Celia's issues.
- Celia's issues.
Are you out of your mind?
It was a prepared lecture.
Raffi, she wants to believe that I murdered her father's, that I pushed him off a cliff.
Would I do that?
Would you like to believe that your mother is a killer?
Is that remotely possible to you?
- Her new theory is that you made him jump.
- How?
- She thinks the whole last chapter of the book is a... a way of admitting guilt.
- Oh, I see.
The idea being since Gorky committed suicide, her father's must have as well.
- It's easy to make fun of her.
- Not as easy as you think.
Raffi, she wants her father's' death to be more meaningful that it was.
It gives her a cause.
- We all know how dangerous those can be.
- She has no right to compare it to a man.
Your father died for something he believed in.
- L just wish I had some idea of what that was.
- This film was shot in Toronto almost a year ago.
- Yeah, that's right.
- And now you're coming back from Turkey with these cans of footage?
Well, this tells me you worked on this film as a production assistant and driver.
This is a letter of recommendation for future employment.
It doesn't explain why you're returning from Turkey months later.
- There was some stuff they wanted to add in Turkey.
They added a character.
They?
- Well, the director.
And the writer. And my mom.
- Your mom?
- Yeah.
She's an art-history professor.
She was a consultant on the film.
She, uh, she got me the job.
- So who's this new character?
- Arshile Gorky. The painter.
- Turkish painter.
- Armenian.
- Now why did you go to Turkey to shoot an Armenian painter?
- Well, that's where he's from.
He was born there.
Armenia was historically part of Eastern Turkey. Anatolia.
- And they sent you alone?
Without a crew?
- Well, they wouldn't have gotten permission to send a crew there.
- Why not?
- Well, it's not that easy to shoot a story about the Armenian genocide in Turkey.
It's politically... sensitive.
- In what way?
- Because the Turkish authorities don't want to admit it happened.
- Oh. Why not?
- Well, you'd have to ask them.
- So, uh, what's this story about?
- It's very good.
Yourfather's very good.
- Effendi.
- Yes.
- Can we discuss a payment?
- Do you know what I think of as I look at these faces?
- No, effendi.
- I think of what's in their mind as they stare in your camera.
Their desperate need to be remembered.
For what, we may ask.
Payment is a gesture of thanks, no?
- Yes, effendi.
- So let us examine what it is that you have to be thankful for.
A man of my position has chosen you to take his portrait.
And this has brought you prestige?
Honour?
How will you give thanks?
You're welcome.
Would you like to thank me as well?
- Stefan!
- Anothertime, another means.
Very different ways to... express gratitude.
- But deliver us from evil.
[Armenian]
Forthine is the kingdom.
And the power and the glory
[both: Armenian]
[Both]: Amen.
[All]: Amen.
- We have to go.
- God bless you.
Do you remember when we took this photo to send to yourfather?
Yes.
If the Turks capture you, you will never give up yourfaith.
You will neverforget your mothertongue.
If you survive... it will be to tell this story.
Of what has happened here.
Of what will happen...
We will win, Mother.
Take this picture with you.
You will not forget me.
We will win.
- Now I want you to remember that this has to be nailed into the ball of the heel.
Not the sole,
'cause there is no bone in the sole. It'II fall off.
- Ahhh! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ahhh!
- An appeal for Christian help.
Did your missionary feel so persecuted?
We've invested you Greeks and Armenians with power and freedom.
You should be thankful!!
[Faraway screaming]
This your mother?
- Well, she's given you this photograph so that you may remember her.
Look at it now.
This is a face of a woman who has raised you to feel superiorto us.
She's taught you that Turks are vengeful and ignorant.
That we're bloodthirsty.
Now l'm going to teach you something.
What is about to happen to your people is your own fault.
For as much as you talk about your prophet Jesus Christ in the depths of your souls, you believe in nothing... but commerce and money.
My streets overrun with your markets and moneylenders.
Your greed has led us to corruption and ruin.
Now you yourselves will be ruined.
Get this back to your American missionary.
Pick it up!!
You take that back to your American missionary.
He must sign it. Otherwise, he must accept 50 of my soldiers in the mission compound.
You understand?
- You said that this character gave something to the boy to take back to the missionary for him to sign.
- It was a document stating that Ussher refused Turkish protection.
- But that's obvious. He's was helping protecting Armenians.
- Exactly.
Actually, Ussher and Jevdet Bey had met a few times before.
He tried to stop him from carrying out his plans.
- What plans?
- For genocide.
Over a million people were killed.
An ancient civilization living on ancestral lands.
It was systematic and fully planned.
The entire Armenian population of Eastern Turkey was eliminated.
- Now I need permission to put
50 soldiers with supplies in your mission compound.
- Why?
- Well, to protect you, of course.
- We're underthe protection of the United States of America.
- The United States of America.
They're so far away.
- It won't be safe to send so many Turkish soldiers into the heart of the Armenian quarter.
It's bound to cause trouble.
What danger are you trying to protect us from?
- Lf you have a problem with taking my soldiers, you must sign this statement that you refuse the protection of the Turkish government.
[Raffi]: Lf Ussher signed the document, it would be like giving the Turks permission to slaughter the Americans in the compound.
The same way that they were massacring the Armenians outside.
- You've lost me.
- Well, it was the same document that he'd presented to the boy.
If the United States government ever made an inquiry into the incident, that statement, the document the Turks wanted Ussherto sign, would affirm that the Americans were offered protection but that they refused.
- And if he let them in?
- Well, the Turks would use it as a strategic point.
With that many soldiers and artillery based in the mission, they'd have a foothold in the Armenian quarter.
- A Trojan horse.
- Right.
- So what did he do?
- Our premises are part of the United States of America.
They're extraterritorial by treaty right.
Completely neutral.
And we will preserve this neutrality to the last.
[Armenian]
Stop! Levon stop!
What are you doing, brother?
Levon, you'II be killed.
Come back, Levon!
- They were heroes.
What happened in Van in April 1915 was an amazing act of self-defence.
We hadn't done anything like that since we held back the Persians.
- And when did you hold back the Persians?
- Well, like I said, we, uh... we go back.
- Could you come back to the office please, sir?
- See, I don't know why l'm wearing this sword.
I didn't have it in the movie, so it's kind of ridiculous.
This is so tight, I can't...
Does it have to be so tight?
- I wanted to thank you.
- Are you kidding?
- All right, we'II just take it from the top here, all right?
- This was... this was a huge break for me.
I mean, you're one of my favourite directors.
I want to thank you.
Can I... can I ask you something?
Did you cast me just because l'm half Turkish?
- No.
It's because I thought you would be perfect forthe part.
- But being Turkish didn't hurt.
- Ah, didn't hurt, no.
- You know, you never asked me what I thought of the history.
- What is there to think?
- Whether I believed it happened.
A genocide.
- Well, l'm not sure it matters.
- I don't want to take up yourtime, ljust...
The thing is, when I... play a part, it's supposed to... come from here.
Not here. All right?
'Cause I was doing some research and, uh...
I think the Turks had a real reason to believe that the Armenians were a threat to their security.
I mean, their eastern border was threatened by Russia and, I mean, if they believed that the Armenians were gonna betray them...
So this was... this was war.
Populations get moved around all the time. So...
- Then again, thank you for your work.
- Ali, we're ready for you.
- I got your car around back.
Drive you home.
Mr. Saroyan!
- Yes?
- Why didn't you answer him?
- Because he's having regrets about playing the part.
I can understand. He will receive angerfrom his people.
- But he thinks Turkey was at war with Armenia.
Doesn't it botheryou that he doesn't get the history?
- No, not really.
- I mean, why didn't you explain to him that we were citizens, we were Turkish citizens.
We had a right to be protected.
- Are you driving him home?
- Yeah.
- Huh. Take this.
Buy him a bottle of champagne.
Let him think that he has done something... special?
- Something special.
- L'm sorry, Mr. Saroyan,
I don't think I understand.
- Young man, do you know what still causes... so much pain?
It's not the people we lost, orthe land.
It's to know that we could be so hated.
Who are these people, who could hate us so much?
How can they still deny their hatred?
And so hate us... hate us even more?
- That was a good scene.
- Thanks.
- Must be really weird to get into that... head space.
- Yeah.
- I mean, I was raised with all these stories, you know.
Evil Turks and everything, so... l'm a little hardened to it all.
But what you did today,
I mean, it, uh...
It made me feel all that anger again.
- Hey, thanks.
So I take it you're, uh...
Armenian.
- Well, yeah. Yeah, that's what
I meant when I said I was, you know, raised to feel out of hatred to... the person you're playing.
- Right. Right.
- You really pulled it off.
- Well, it'd be kind of hard to disappoint you.
- What do you mean?
- Well, you were kind of prepared to hate my character... you said.
- Well, sure.
But l'm also kind of suspicious of stuff that's supposed to make me feel anything. You know?
When I was watching it, like even though I know you were supposed to make me feel like hating you, l... I resisted it. But, uh...
But then, I mean, by the end of the scene, ljust... I...
- You felt like killing me.
- Yeah.
My dad was killed trying to assassinate a Turkish diplomat.
It was almost 15 years ago.
I could never understand... what would make him want to murder... what he had to imagine that
Turkish ambassador represented.
But today, you gave me a sense of what was going on in his head.
I wanna thank you.
- Well... you're welcome.
- Shit.
- What's this?
- It's from Edward.
He wanted to give it to you.
And thanks.
- Now, was this before or after my conversation with him?
- After. I guess he wants to show there are no hard feelings.
- Ah.
Okay. Thanks.
- Were you serious about what you told him?
- What?
- That you don't think it happened?
- What, the genocide?
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna shoot me or something?
Look, I never heard about any of this stuff when I was growing up.
You know?
I did some research forthe part.
From what I read, there were deportations and...
Lots of people died.
Armenians and Turks.
It was World War I.
- But Turkey wasn't at war with the Armenians.
I mean, just like Germany wasn't at war with the Jews.
They were citizens. They were expecting to be protected.
That scene you just shot was based on an eyewitness account.
Your character, Jevdet Bey, the only reason they put him in Van was to carry out the complete elimination of the Armenian population in Van. There were telegrams, there were communiquTs.
- Look, l'm not saying that something didn't happen.
- Something...
- Look, I was born here.
So were you. Right?
- Yeah.
- This is a new country.
So let's just drop the fucking history and get on with it.
No one's gonna wreck your home.
No one's gonna destroy yourfamily.
Hmm?
So let's go inside and uncork this thing... and celebrate.
Hmm?
- Do you know what Adolf Hitler told his military commanders to convince them that his plan would work?
'Who remembers the extermination of the Armenians?'
- And nobody did.
Nobody does.
[Announcement]:
For security reasons, please do not leave your bags unattended.
Veuillez garder avec vous vos bagages a main en tout temps pour des raisons de securite
- Roll up your sleeves.
- Why?
- Please, roll up your sleeves.
- I don't take drugs.
- Can you open that bag, please?
The numberyou gave me has been disconnected.
- They must've closed the production office.
- Then who's paying your bills?
- What bills?
- The cost of yourtravel.
- L'm paying for it myself.
- I thought this was forthe film.
- It is.
- Then why wouldn't they be paying for it?
- Because... they don't know I went.
They didn't want to shoot there, so I... I went myself.
I found myself a cameraman and we went to shoot this material.
I thought the director might need some extra shots, stuff that he could cut in later.
- And what about the digital effects, the people marching?
- Well, that can still be added if that's what they want to do.
- Can you play one of these on this?
- Yeah.
- Could you put it on, please?
- Kind of personal.
- Then let's go somewhere private.
- 'L'm here, Mum.
Ani.
In a dream world, the three of us would be here together.
Dad, you and me.
I remember all the stories
I used to hear about this place.
The glorious capital of our kingdom.
Ancient history.
Like the story that Dad was a freedom fighter- fighting for the return of this, I guess.
And then he died.
And now something in me died too.
What am I supposed to feel when I look at these ruins?
And do I believe that they're ravaged by time, or do I believe that they've been wilfully destroyed?
Is this proof of what happened?
Am I supposed to feel anger?
Can I ever feel the anger that Dad must've felt when-'
- When he tried to kill a Turkish diplomat?
- How did you know?
- You gave me your passport.
Files are kept.
You have to be the son of a... terrorist.
Will you turn that back on, please?
- 'He tried to kill that man.
Why was he prepared to give us up for that?
Mom, what's the legacy he's supposed to have given me?
Why can't I take any comfort in his death?
When I see these places,
I realize how much we've lost.
Not just the land and the lives, but the loss of any way to remember it.
There is nothing here to prove that anything ever happened.
[Turkish]
- Excuse me, please don't get too close to the paintings.
- I like looking at the details.
Do you know anything about this artist?
- Not really. I mean, I picked up a little from that lecture the other night.
The one you left.
- What do you remember from the lecture?
- How much he suffered, losing his family.
His mother dying of starvation in his arms.
- When you look at this painting, can you understand?
- Understand what?
- That he would kill himself.
His home was lost, his family destroyed, neverto be seen again.
This painting shows his pain.
So much pain.
He couldn't stand it.
[Armenian music playing]
- What do you think?
- I haven't finished it.
- What you've read so far.
- Rouben... l'm not the best judge forthis kind of thing.
L've never read a script before.
- Did you get to the part where
Gorky rushes into the street and grabs the rifle from the wounded Turk?
- Yes.
- I know Edward's style is a bit overthe top, but...
- It's really...
It's very... good.
Listen... maybe l'II get more excited when I actually see it.
It's... it's difficult for me to... imagine these things
Go retrieve the rifle! Run! Run!
As a boy involved in the heroic defence of van,
Gorky was witness to one of the most courageous moments in Armenian history.
But the years which were to follow would see him lose a home, his people, and most dramatically, his beloved mother.
In his most famous painting,
Gorky leaves his mother's hand unfinished.
As if the history of its composition, like that of his people, had been violently interrupted.
The earthly sensuality of the mother's touch is no more.
Only pure, burning spiritual light remains.
- Excuse me.
You said before that Gorky worked on that painting
10 years.
- That's right.
- Is it possible to work on something that long and leave it unfinished?
- The painting is finished.
The unfinished hands of his mother were left purposely that way.
- Yeah, but... don't you think he finished his mother's hands and after, decided to erase them?
That he needed to destroy what he made?
Can we talk about his suicide?
- No.
- Why not?
- Because it was not what I had intended to read today.
- L'm just curious about the way you described the suicide in your book. You... you make it sound as if Gorky was obsessed with memories of the genocide, but you don't talk about...
...coming to this event.
- Okay, okay. Ljust want to talk about the suicide.
What's yourfucking problem?
- You... you said something to my father.
Like what?
- That you were having an affair.
Don't get involved in things that don't concern you.
Did you intend to destroy his life?
What are you talking about?
My father left my motherforyou... my father gave up everything foryou.
I have nothing to apologize for.
My father loved you.
My father was suffering, if he knew that you were having an affair...
I have no doubt that he would have killed himself.
Yourfather died accidentally.
He tripped, and fell.
I don't have any other way of explaining it.
It's a question of time.
There's no rush to separate...
Listen, I didn't see him fall.
You didn't see him fall, oryou don't want to think you saw him fall.
I don't remember anything but the fact that he slipped and he fell.
I can't remember it the way you want me to.
And even if I could remember what you want me to remember...
...I wont.
I don't need to.
Do you understand?
- Hey! Hey, no!
Let go. Let go.
- She was carrying a knife.
- Yes.
- So there was a certain degree of premeditation?
- It was a pocketknife, something she always carries.
- Because she never knew when she might need it.
- What do you mean?
- L'm talking about her job, what she did for a living!
Oh, yes, I know all sorts of things.
When she was arrested, the police discovered she'd dealt drugs, as well as various credit frauds on the Net. You were questioned about your involvement; she insisted you had nothing to do with it.
It's all on yourfiles.
Was that true?
- What?
- That you had nothing to do with it?
- L... I knew about it.
- Well, you didn't tell anyone?
- No.
- So you didn't have a problem with the fact that your sister was dealing in drugs?
- Step-sister.
- Ah, yes, step-sister.
Most people are... obvious about the crimes they commit.
By the time I get them to this room, it's just a matter of time before... it all comes out.
- What?
- Their shit.
- I don't understand.
- My job becomes pretty simple, really.
I sit where you are,
I watch them on this toilet, waiting forthe truth, the compressed tablets of heroin.
Sometimes they get so nervous, the body acid breaks the package and they overdose.
But that can take hours.
I sit and wait.
It's usually pretty silent.
They have time to think.
So do I.
You know what goes through my mind, Raffi?
I wonder if I should feel sorry forthem.
They're usually kids around your age; l'm about to destroy their lives.
I know they're sorry for what they've done and they'II never go through it again.
But the action has been taken.
It's too late.
- I had to go there.
- I have no doubt about that.
Aflame was lit in your heart.
You thought things would be clarified by... going there.
They weren't.
You lost meaning.
And people are vulnerable when they...
Iose meaning.
They do stupid things.
- I didn't lose meaning.
It's more like the meaning of things changed.
- What are you doing?
- There's something
I need to read to you.
- Ani, you're being ridiculous.
Her attacking the painting had nothing to do with this film.
- I won't go on with this.
- You need to. We all do.
- What does this mean to you?
- L'm sickened by it.
- Because you feel responsible?
- No, of course not.
L'm sickened because people shouldn't do those things.
- What, attack works of art?
- What's your point, Ani?
- Rouben, you're sickened because that painting is a repository of our history.
It's a sacred code, that explains who we are and how and why we got here.
- Excuse me, you can't cross set.
We're rolling.
We have an intruder on set.
- Okay.
We'II handle it from here.
- Oh, clamp, clamp.
- What is she doing?
- Oh, look at this.
- It took us hours to set this up.
- I need to talk to you.
- Better be paying me for overtime.
- Please, we're shooting a scene.
- All right, no. We're cutting.
- What is this? Godammit!
We're surrounded by Turks.
We've run out of supplies.
Most of us will die.
The crowd needs a miracle.
This child is bleeding to death.
If I can save his life, it may give us the spirit to continue.
This is his brother.
His pregnant sister... was raped in front of his eyes, before her stomach was slashed open to stab her unborn child.
His father's eyes were gouged out of his head and stuffed into his mouth.
And his mother's breasts were ripped off.
She was left to bleed to death.
Who the fuck are you?
'-In a field of cinders, where Armenian life was dying, a German woman, trying not to cry, told me the horrors she'd witnessed.
I must tell you what I saw so people will understand the crimes that men do to men.'
It was Sunday morning, the first useless Sunday dawning on the corpses.
I saw a dark crowd in the courtyard lashing a group of young women.
And animal of a man shouted,
'You must dance, dance when the drum beats.
With fury, the whips cracked on the flesh of the women.
Hand in hand, the brides began their circle dance.
Dance, they raved.
Dance till you die.'
'...dance with bare breasts, without shame...'
[cracking whips and shouting]
Then, someone brought a jug of kerosene.
'The brides were anointed.
'Dance,' they thundered.
There is a fragrance sweeter than any perfume.
With a torch, they set the brides on fire.
And the charred bodies rolled to their deaths.
The German woman looked at me and said:
'How shall I dig out these eyes of mine?'
Tell me. How?'
[Screaming]
This is it, Mom.
The Madonna and child, on the island of Aghtamar, where it all began.
I was there when they shot that scene.
It was the same day she attacked the painting.
The painting based on this.
I left for Turkey a week later.
- Does she know you went to the island?
- Who?
- Your mother.
- No. No, she doesn't.
- Have you spoken to her?
- No.
- People lose touch.
- There's something l've been meaning to ask you.
- Yeah?
- Aren't there dogs used forthis sort of thing?
- What sort of thing?
- Well, if you think there are drugs in these cans...
- Yeah, we have dogs forthat.
- So, uh... why don't you use one?
- What?
- A dog.
- A dog would take away what I like most about this job.
- What's that?
- The opportunity to... better understand how the mind works.
A dog would come in and bark.
And that bark would mean only one thing:
That there were drugs in these cans.
Ruff! You're lying.
I caught you. You're a liar.
That's what a dog does.
- Right.
- L'm not saying that what a dog does isn't important.
But there are... other issues involved.
Aren't there?
Things a dog doesn't have the capacity to consider.
A dog... wouldn't know he's being retired, that this is his last day, his final interrogation.
Is someone picking you up?
- No.
- Good.
Might be worried.
Even l'm worried.
- About what?
- About you.
What are we gonna do?
There's no one I can contact.
There's no way of confirming... that a single word that you've told me tonight is true.
- Everything l've told you is exactly what happened.
- My mother never told me about what happened during the march.
Only one story.
They had a pomegranate tree in the garden.
And when they came to take the family away, she grabbed one of the fruit.
She knew the journey would be long.
Every day, she would take out one seed and eat it.
She would bite it bit by bit, pretending that one seed was a whole meal.
Try it.
Now, when I eat a pomegranate seed, it gives me two things:
Luck and a powerto imagine.
[Beeping]
- Hello?
- Mom. Hi.
- Raffi?
Raffi, where are you?
- Ljust got back to Toronto.
They've stopped me here at Customs, with all the footage
I got forthe film.
They're wondering what's inside the cans.
- What cans?
What are you talking about?
- The stuff I had to shoot around Van.
They've stopped me here at Customs and, uh... they want to open the cans, but they can't. Because...
Raffi, do you want me to lie?
- Yes.
I miss you too.
I have so much to tell you, Mom.
I went to Aghtamar.
- Aghtamar?
- I found the mother and child on the church.
I had some days free, so I went to Aghtamar.
Here, l'm gonna hand you overto the inspector.
I think he wants to know more about the film this is for.
- Hello. Are you Raffi's mother?
- Yes, I am.
- Are you a professor at the university?
- Yes, that's right.
- And you're involved in this film?
- Yes, I was hired as a historical consultant.
A book I wrote was used as a reference.
- What was the book about?
- It was about the life of Arshile Gorky.
- Is he the main character in the film?
- No.
- What was your son shooting in Turkey?
- He had to go to the place where Arshile Gorky was born.
- Why?
- To shoot some material.
- And how is this material to be used?
- To help show what happened.
- How did he die?
- Who?
- Gorky.
- Why are you asking me these questions?
- Did he kill himself?
[Cheering and clapping]
- Ani, we have to go.
- Where are you?
- Where am I?
- Listen, she's at the premiere of the film, and she'II have to get back to you, okay?
- Hello? May I speak to my son, please?
- So the film is completely finished.
- Please, let me speak to my son.
Raffi?
- Yeah.
Tell me what to do.
- Sure.
L'II meet you at home.
- Marty, how are you responding to the people who say this is all an exaggeration?
- It's, you know... it's documented.
And really, every word I say is directly quoted from Ussher's own journal.
- Marty!
- That's where I met them, right on the train.
- To Ararat.
- Yeah. They were shooting a commercial.
- A commercial?
- I became friends with the cameraman and I told him that I wanted to get an image with this. This.
I wanted to get a shot of Ararat in the picture.
- What for?
- Forthe film. I thought it was something we could use.
- How? The film is finished.
- I wasn't thinking about that.
He had to bribe a soldier to take us up.
That's a military road, okay?
You can't just go up there.
That's his voice. You can actually hear it on the...
We went up about halfway and then... We shot this footage from there. On film.
On this film.
- Why didn't you tell me this before?
- I had to tell you the other story.
- Why?
- Because it meant something to me.
- So this voice on the tape, this crew person, gave you the film, let you use his camera, bribed a soldier... and then drove you up
Mount Ararat.
- Yes.
- Did he ask you to do him a favour in return?
- Who?
- Raffi...
Did he ask you to bring anything into this country?
- He asked me to bring those cans.
- And what's in them?
- He said it's film.
- Why did you believe him?
- Ani.
Ani!
[Screaming]
- Close the door.
- Can we turn out the light?
- Why?
- So the film won't be ruined.
- You're still convinced.
- You can feel it in the dark.
- All right, Raffi.
Turn out the light.
Forthe last time, what do you think is in here?
- Film.
That's what he told me.
That's what I need to believe.
- And what would happen if you didn't believe it?
- L'd be a criminal.
- And what would you say if I told you it was heroin?
- It isn't.
- What makes you so sure?
- You'd turn the light on.
- Sir? The arrivals?
The international arrivals?
- You let him go?
- Yep.
- But what was in the cans?
- Would you believe me if I told you?
- What do you mean?
- Heroin.
- No.
- Film?
- But I don't get it.
You did check the cans.
- Yeah. One.
- What was in it?
- Ah, it doesn't matter, for Chrissake.
- Dad!
- I trusted him.
- But he was lying to you all night. He...
He changed his story.
- The more he told, the closer he came to the truth.
Till he finally told it.
I couldn't punish him for being honest.
- But he was smuggling drugs.
- He didn't think he was.
- How do you know?
- He didn't believe he could do something like that.
- Dad... what came overyou?
- You did, Philip.
I was thinking of you.
- How are you responding to the people who say this is all an exaggeration?
- This film is the kind of film-
- You have a visitor.
...you can do only once in your lifetime.
Because it tells a story which is a true story...
- Arshile Gorky was born in a small village on the shores of Lake Van.
From the shores of this village, the island of Aghtamar was in plain view.
Gorky, as a child, would go to this island with his mother, who would show him the detailed carvings on the walls of the church.
- Why are you showing this to me?
- This is the origin, from the memory of this place, right to the photograph, to the sketch, to the painting.
You told me to go there.
I had to put something in my heart. If that was gonna happen, it was gonna happen here.
That I was prepared to throw my whole life away.
And last night, as we were sitting in that... dark room, as I heard him open the can,
I felt it.
- You felt what?
His ghost.
The ghost of my father.
There.
Technicals, nine o'clock.
Oh, shit! Did you see that?
Chief, we got unarmed civilians getting shot down here at nine o'clock.
I got it, Matt. I don't think we can touch this.
Command, Super 64... we got militia shooting unarmed civilians down at the food distribution center.
Request permission to engage.
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.
Negative, command.
U.N. 's jurisdiction, 64. We cannot intervene.
- Return to base. Over.
- Roger.
64 returning.
Leaving.
General Garrison?
No, no, thanks. I got one.
But these are Cuban.
Bolivar Belicoso.
So is this.
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.
I see not catching Aidid is becoming a routine.
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.
Me?
But am I that important?
I hardly think so.
- You're just a businessman.
- Trying to make a living.
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.
You've been here, what?
Six weeks?
Six weeks you are trying to catch the general.
You put up reward posters.
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?
It's the O.K. Corral.
Do you think bringing me in will make him suddenly come to you?
Make him more agreeable?
You know where he sleeps.
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.
And we will find him.
Don't make the mistake of thinking because I grew up without running water...
I am simple, General.
I do know something about history.
See all this? It's simply shaping tomorrow.
A tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.
Well, I wouldn't know about that.
I'm from Texas.
Mr. Garrison,
I think you shouldn't have come here.
This is civil war.
This is our war.
Not yours.
300,000 dead and counting.
That's not a war, Mr. Atto. That's genocide.
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?
How'd he strike you?
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.
Yeah, he's a good catch.
It'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.
I'm not sure time is something we got in great supply.
This isn't Iraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.
I'm just saying they've been calling for these dang situation reports... every morning this week.
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott.
I'll be your pilot this afternoon.
Federal regulations has designated the non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.
For those of you moved on
Mogadishu frequent flyer program... you'll be earning 100 free credits this afternoon.
And as always, the air sickness bags are located in the seatback in front of you.
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.
You're still clear.
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.
I've got some bad news.
"Limo" is a word, Durant.
I don't want to hear about it.
It is not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.
"Limo" is a word in common usage.
That is the key phrase in Scrabble, my good friend. Common usage.
No, if it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!
It does have to be in the dictionary!
Listen, when we get back to the base, it's coming off the board.
You touch my "limo" and I'll spank you,
Nightstalker. You hear me?
Yeah, promises.
That's a nice beach down there.
How's the water?
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.
That's great.
- Thinks he's funny.
- Yeah. Well, I don't.
Hear that?
- Nervous?
- I'm ready to go, man.
Beautiful day to fight.
- Name.
- Todd.
- Last name.
- Blackburn.
First name, Todd.
- So, what's it like?
- What's what like?
Mogadishu. The fighting.
- Serial number.
Firstly, it's "the Mog" or simply "Mog."
No one calls it Mogadishu here.
Secondly, I wouldn't know about the fighting, so don't ask.
Why not?
Didn't I just say, "Don't ask"?
You're not a Ranger.
I am a Ranger. Six years.
I was in Panama chasing down Noriega, and in the Gulf.
I'm a vet, my friend.
In combat?
Look, kid, you look like you're about 12, so let me explain something to you.
I have a rare and mysterious skill that precludes me from going into missions.
Typing.
- Can you type?
- No.
- Date of birth.
Well, I'm here to kick some ass.
Let's bring it in.
Nice, man! Very smooth!
Single shot through the engine block.
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Fucking Delta.
Sergeant Eversmann.
- Sergeant.
- Yeah?
Private First Class Blackburn.
Yeah?
Reporting for duty.
Not to me you're not.
You're reporting to It. Beales.
He should be around here somewhere.
Can I leave him with you?
Yeah, go ahead.
- You brought your weapon.
- Yes, sir.
Want me to shoot? I'm rested.
- When did you get in?
- Just now, Sarg'nt.
First things first.
This will be your best friend in all of Africa.
It's called BullFrog.
Get some on over here, all right?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Schmid! Take over for me, would you?
All right. Let's get you unpacked.
Hey, who's hungry?
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?
- Not if General Garrison is asking.
- I'm asking.
Have a nice meal, Captain.
- Hey, man, there's a line.
- I know.
- Well, this isn't the back of it.
- Yeah, I know.
Sergeant. Sergeant.
What's going on here?
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.
I'm talking about your weapon.
Now, Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.
Well, this is my safety, sir.
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.
You Delta boys are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.
When we get on the five-yard line, you're going to need my Rangers.
So y'all better learn to be team players.
We're done here.
Speak up. You say this is your safety?
Well, this is my boot, son.
And it will fit up your asses with the proper amount of force.
- Is that a Jersey accent?
- I'm trying to do this, give me a break.
Take those sunglasses off, soldier.
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's their business.
I don't want to see them on you again.
Hoo-ah?
Is that a hot weapon?
Is that your move?
Is my hand on the piece?
I can mate you in three whatever you do.
I'd keep my eye on that queen before counseling with the others.
Well, she's just lying in wait.
Stranded and condemned, Gordy.
Your move.
Cribbs.
Yikes.
It's good. You're really improving.
If I may make a suggestion... Observation.
Go ahead.
- It's a children's book, right?
- Right.
They are not supposed to scare the living shit out of the children.
This is the part of the story where our knight, our warrior... is about to slay the one-eyed dragon.
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.
Thought you finished that last week.
You done?
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.
You understand?
Can you count? One, two, ten.
Okay? Where are my running backs?
Where are my running backs?
Hey, I didn't see you at church on Sunday, soldier.
You had something more important to do?
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.
I will make you believe, you understand?
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?
It was a good impression.
I recognize myself.
All right, carry on.
- I'd like a word, specialist.
- Sir.
Tell me, Pilla, you understand why we have a chain of command, don't you?
Roger that, sir.
'Cause if I ever see you undermine me again... you'll be cleaning latrines with your tongue... till you can't taste the difference between shit and French fries.
- Are we clear?
- Hoo-ah, sir.
All right.
Listen to this:
If one skinny kills another skinny, his clan owes the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.
A hundred camels.
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.
Is that really true, Lieutenant?
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes the skinnies.
Sgt. Eversmann, you really like the skinnies?
It's not that I like them or I don't like them.
I respect them.
See, what you guys fail to realize is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.
He believes in this mission down to his very bones. Don't you, Sergeant?
Look, these people, they have no jobs... no food, no education, no future.
I just figure that, I mean, we have two things that we can do.
We can either help... or we can sit back and watch the country destroy itself on CNN.
Right?
I don't know about you guys, but I was trained to fight.
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?
Well, I think I was trained to make a difference, Kurth.
Like the man said, he's an idealist.
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.
Stay away from the cans!
Die, gas-pumper!
Stay away from those cans!
Beales!
No, no, stay back, stay back.
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. It's okay.
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.
I'm putting you in charge of his chalk.
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.
Now, it's a big responsibility.
Your men are gonna look to you to make the right decisions.
Their lives depend on it.
All right.
- Rangers lead the way, sir.
- All the way.
Good luck, Sergeant.
A long anticipated meeting of Aidid's senior cabinet may take place today at 1500 hours.
I say "may" because we all know by now... with the intel we get on the street, nothing is certain.
This is actual intel confirmed by three sources.
Two tier-one personalities may be present:
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor... and Abdi Hassan Awale, Interior Minister.
These are the guys we're after.
Today we go.
Same mission template as before.
1545, Assault Force Delta will infiltrate the target building... and seize all suspects within.
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks, under the command of Captain Steele... will rope in at 1546... and hold a four-corner perimeter around the target building.
No one gets in or out.
Extraction Force:
It. Colonel McKnight's humvee column will drive into the city at 1547... on Hawlwadig Road and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel here.
Wait for the green light.
Now once Delta gives the word...
McKnight's column will move to the target building... and load the prisoners on flatbed trucks.
Immediately after the prisoners are loaded... the four Ranger chalks will collapse back to the target building... load up on humvees... and the entire ground force will exfil the 3 miles back to base.
Mission time from incursion to extraction, no longer than 30 minutes.
Now, I had requested light armor and AC-130 Spectre gunships... but Washington, in all its wisdom, decided against this.
Too high-profile.
So Black Hawks and Little Birds will provide the air cover... with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.
Colonel Harrell.
In the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews will coordinate the air mission... and I will coordinate ground forces.
Colonel Matthews.
Mission launch code word is Irene.
Questions?
Which building is it, sir?
Exactly which building, we're confirming right now.
Somewhere around the Bakara Market.
I don't choose the time or place of their meetings.
I didn't say a word, sir.
Make no mistake, once you're in the Bakara Market... you're in an entirely hostile district.
Don't underestimate their capabilities.
Now we'll be going through friendly neighborhoods before we hit the market... so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.
Now, let's go get this thing done.
Good luck, gentlemen.
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?
No Spectre gunships, daylight instead of night... late afternoon when they're all fucked up on khat... only part of the city Aidid can mount a serious counter-attack on short notice...
- What's not to like?
- Life's imperfect.
Yeah. For you two, circling above it at 500 feet, it's imperfect.
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.
You two say hello to me from up there.
You'll do fine.
Thanks.
What the fuck, Smith?
- Well?
- Well, what?
We going?
- Why should I tell you that?
- Because I'm me.
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.
- Bakara Market.
- All right.
Listen, Smith, I need you to back me up out there today, all right?
Keep sharp.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.
Nothing.
Hey.
Sit down.
How'd this happen?
I don't even remember.
Think I was just goofing off.
Playing ping-pong, I think.
Sort of hit the concrete.
Okay.
You can fix it up though.
We're going out today.
You're not going anywhere.
Jesus Christ!
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.
This, my friend, is a science.
I mean, you're looking at the guy that believed the commercials.
You know, about "be all you can be."
I made coffee through Desert Storm.
I made coffee through Panama, while everyone else got to fight... got to be a Ranger.
Now it's "Grimesy, black, one sugar" or "Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?"
- What happened to you?
- Ping-Pong accident.
What?
So guess what.
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.
You're fucking me.
You're taking my place assisting the 60 gunner.
Sergeant Eversmann said to get your stuff and get ready.
It's what you wanted, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.
Hell, yeah.
Grimesy, I want you to stick with Waddell and give him ammo when he needs it.
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.
I wouldn't worry about that. Generally speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.
Don't worry about it.
Just watch out for the sammys throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.
Might even be fun.
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.
Choppers going to cover us, and we'll be all right.
Look, you guys, I know this is my first time as chalk leader... but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.
We're elite.
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?
Hoo-ah!
Any questions?
We're going to be okay.
All right, grab your gear. Let's move out.
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.
You're not gonna need that, either.
We'll be back before dark.
You might as well take dope and beer instead.
What?
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got about 50 pounds of gear as it is.
You don't need another 12.
I don't know about you, but I don't plan on getting shot in the back running away.
Well, I better keep mine in.
Hey, Grimes.
The most important thing:
Just remember, when everybody else is shooting, shoot in the same direction.
All right.
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.
- That's bad luck.
- No, it's smart.
All Delta do that.
That's bad luck, too, man.
Come on, let's go.
It's a good thing you're right-handed, Adonis.
- If not, I don't know what you'd do.
- You're a funny guy, man.
- I'm not taking no death letter.
- We have a deal.
I'll give it to you back in an hour.
- Blackburn, you okay?
- Excited.
In a good way.
I've been training my whole life for this.
You ever shot at anybody before?
No, sir.
Me neither.
Think he's reliable?
Well, we'll see. It's his first time out.
- Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
- Yes, sir.
Tell him to turn his radio off.
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy, leave us a message. Thank you.
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?
Pick up if you're there.
I'm just calling to check up on you, make sure everything's all right.
I'll call you in a couple hours.
You'd better not be sleeping.
Your move, Randy.
I'm missing you.
I love you, baby.
Hello? Hello?
Thanks, bud.
- Sorry, I didn't see you there.
- It's all right.
You know, it's kind of funny.
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.
Could almost be a good place to visit.
Almost.
You don't think we should be here.
You know what I think?
It don't really matter what I think.
Once that first bullet goes past your head, politics and all that shit... just goes right out the window.
I just want to do it right today.
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.
Now, is this supposed to be the place, or did his car just take a dump?
Abdi, come in.
Abdi, can you hear me? Is this the place?
Abdi, come in.
Can you hear me? Abdi.
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?
To my right hand side, above the cafe.
Sir, he says this is the building.
He's certain?
Abdi, you need to be sure.
Are you sure?
Well, it's down the road, two blocks over on my left.
But there's too many militia.
If I go closer, they might shoot me.
Now he's saying the building's actually a couple blocks down... but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.
I'll fucking shoot him myself a couple blocks down.
Tell him I want his skinny ass parked in front of the damn building.
He's not getting paid till he does exactly that.
It's three miles to the target area.
We're never off the main roads.
At the K-four traffic circle, we turn north, then east on National... and we wait until extraction of prisoners is complete here.
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig... we load the prisoners, and then the assault-blocking forces... and bring them back.
Home in an hour. Okay?
Now there will be some shooting.
Bakara Market is the Wild West.
But be careful what you shoot at because people do live there.
Hoo-ah.
Hoo-ah.
Last one of these guys shot himself in the head playing Russian roulette in a bar.
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time?
- He sounds scared shitless.
- Good. That's always a good sign.
That's it. That's our signal.
All right.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All QRF out of the airspace.
All units, Irene. I say again, Irene.
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up and ready. Star 41 up and ready.
Irene!
Copy, Irene.
Fucking Irene!
Come on.
Good luck, boys.
Be careful.
No one gets left behind.
What's wrong?
Nothing. He's just never done that before.
Aw, fuck!
Let's go.
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.
Grimesy!
Two minutes.
Two minutes.
Why are they burning tires?
Signals to the militia that we're coming!
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies on the ground.
Looks like I've got a tally on the voice intercept.
One minute.
One minute.
What's that for?
Last rope, I almost bit my tongue off.
Touching base.
Two feet, one foot... clear.
Little birds touching down at target.
Ropes!
Go! Go! Go!
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.
Down! Get down!
Down! Stay down!
Get down! Everybody down!
You, down!
Get down!
On the floor.
Captain Steele, tell your men to stop firing at us.
26, this is 64. Cease fire.
You're firing at Delta.
I repeat, cease fire. Over.
You stay close to that ammo, Grimesy.
Is this normal enemy fire?
No, no, this is 10 times worse than I've ever seen it.
Let's go, let's go!
Grimesy! No fear!
Oh, yeah, right!
Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.
Colonel, they're shooting at us!
Colonel, they're shooting at us!
Well, shoot back!
This is 64. Chalks on the ground, going into holding pattern.
Roger that.
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to cover pattern.
Super 62, take up an overhead pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground, going into holding pattern.
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!
Go, Blackburn!

Take up overhead pattern to provide sniper cover. Over.
Roger that. 61 coming out.
13, go ahead. I need you to move to the north of the street.
Right to the north.
Right there. Right there. Over.
Doc! Doc Schmid!
Come on!
Schmid, we got a man hit.
- Where's he hit?
- He's not. He fell.
- What?
- He fell.
Why aren't you shooting?
We're not being shot at yet!
How can you tell?
A hiss means it's close.
A snap means...
Now they're shooting at us!
Galentine!
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.
Blackburn, can you hear me?
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.
I can't get him!
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!
We need to get him out of here! Over.
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.
We've got a man down! Over.
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.
- Man down!
- Missed that, 25.
- Fuck it.
- Say again.
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.
Okay.
What did he say?
Super 61, we got a man wounded on the ground.
- Stretcher!
- Get me a stretcher!
Come on. Stretcher.
Come on, come on!
Grab this end!
Let's go!
- All right.
- Go.
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.
Up to the humvees! Now!
Go! Go!
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!
- Secure!
- Let's move out!
Everybody up! Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go! Let's move!
- Grimes, run!
- All right.
C-2, this is Super 61, beginning my orbit of the target area.
Roger that.
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.
Kilo 11, this is 61, providing cover for prisoner extract. Over.
Kilo 64, green light.
- Ready for extraction. Over.
- Roger that, Kilo 11. Will relay.
That's it. We got them.
Uniform 64, ready for extraction. Over.
Roger that. There's the call. Let's move out!
- Let's move out!
- Hold on.
- How much longer?
- Five minutes, sir.
- What?
- Five minutes.
Nothing takes five minutes!
What happened to him?
- He fell! Missed the rope!
- How'd he do that?
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!
Let's go! Let's move it!
Move, move! Come on! Move!
Get him in there!
Get ready to move!
Go! Everybody move! Move!
Get the fuck up!
Grimes! Come on!
Grimes! Grimes!
Fuck this!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Let's go.
Come on!
Go! Move it!
Move!
Romeo 64, I need to send out three humvees with a critical casualty.
He looks real bad. I need to evac now.
Roger that, Uniform 64.
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you. Over.
Roger that.
Hey, Sanderson,
I need extra security on these humvees!
I'll go. I'll take my team, make sure they get back okay.
Do it.
Struecker, you're lead humvee.
First three vehicles mount up, we're moving back to base.
Move out!
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?
I don't want to talk about it now, Colonel!
I'm busy.
Sergeant Pilla's hit!
Christ, he's fucked up!
Is anyone hit?
Struecker, talk to me!
It's Sergeant Pilla!
What's his status?
What's his status?
He's dead.
He's dead.
Pilla's dead, sir.
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.
Roger that.
Get on that 50!
Someone get on that 50!
It's mine.
Three guys with RPGs, coming up on your side now!
Stay with it!
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.
You want to pull those PCLs off-line or what?
Right, babe.
Come on.
61 going down.
61 going down.
61 is going down. She is going down.
- Super 61 is going down.
- 61 is going down.
Super 61 is going down.
61 is going down.
I repeat, Super 61 going down.
61 is going down.
Hold on!
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.
Super 61 is on the deck now.
Get an MH-six on site. Check for survivors.
Send in the SAR bird.
I want ground forces to move and secure a new perimeter around that crash site.
Can you guide the convoy in there?
Roger that.
Well, move quick.
The whole damn city will be coming down on top of them.
Star 41, come inbound and see if you can land at the crash site.
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.
We just lost the initiative.
25, this is 64. Over.
This is 25. Over.
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.
64, I can't see the crash site. Over.
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk on foot to the crash.
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow. Over.
25, do you read me? Over.
Roger that.
Galentine! Schmid!
Go get Yurek.
Get Twombly.
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.
Twombly, Nelson, you're gonna stay here.
You're gonna hold this corner and then exfil with the humvees.
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
All right? Let's go.
- Hoo-ah?
- Hoo-ah.
How come I got to stay back here?
Because you're dependable.
All right... let's go!
I hate being dependable, man.
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing, parallel west to your position.
Be advised, women and children among them. Over.
Hit the wall.
Incoming!
Grenade!
Go.
We still got guys inside!
All right, all right,
I'm gonna go to the crash.
You take the rest of the team.
I'll finish loading the prisoners.
Negative! We're gonna proceed to the crash site together.
Secure the perimeter, wait for the humvees. Right, sir?
- Roger that.
- Follow my lead.
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?
Yeah, I heard you.
We should be leaving soon.
All right, we need to move out now!
I'll finish loading the prisoners and pick you up at the crash site!
Let's move out!
Moving out! Go!
Get in! Get in!
Move!
Eight o'clock!
Hey, Grimes, stay away from the walls.
Hey, Grimes. You okay?
Yeah!
Let's go, Maddox.
- C-2, convoy's moving out.
- Roger that.
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!
Hey, Twombly!
What?
- I think they've forgotten us.
- What?
It doesn't matter.
63, confirm. We've got Skinnies moving in from all directions.
We need to get them help now.
Indigenous personnel advancing to Wolcott crash site.
Say again. Over.
A lot of people closing in.
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?
- Six blocks, sir.
- They need to haul ass.
Get down! Get down!
Scotty, are you okay?
No, don't go back!
Get down! Get down!
Technicals!
Got them!
Six o'clock! Move, move!
Come on. Get out of the way.
Go, go, go!
Go, go!
Come on!
Yurek, leaving!
Come on!
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.
Romeo 64, I need to know before I get to the goddamn street!
You have to slow down. There's a delay.
From the time directions are relayed from surveillance to JOC, then to me.
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!
We can't slow down!
Danny, I'm getting information from Orion surveillance above.
So get me my fucking directions to the crash site!
Danny, hold on. I no longer have the best view of your route.
Just get your ass in the right place,
God damn it!
What in the hell is the status of Struecker's humvees?
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.
ETA to base momentarily.
Open the gate!
- Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
- Come on.
Watch his head.
Easy.
- Blackburn. Blackburn, you hear me?
- Get him to a medic.
Star 41 is at the crash site to evacuate the injured. Over.
Roger that.
I got you.
Easy.
Galentine, you all right?
Galentine, Kurth, with me! Cover fire, now.
Full cover!
How many are in there?
Two pilots are dead, the two crew chiefs are wounded!
This guy's hurt bad.
We gotta get out of here now.
All right. Go ahead.
26, 26, this is 25. Is that you shooting up the technicals? Over.
This is 26. Roger that.
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

Claire?
- Move up.
- Thank you.
Roast mules go topsy-turvy.
Ten letters ending in "T."
- I'm hopeless at this.
- Me too.
"Somersault. "
Bletchley.
It's a walk.
I know.
I've been here before.
This bus for Yardley...
This bus for...
Hello? Yes.
I'll try that extension for you.
Please hold the line.
I'm just putting you through.
Yes, you're through.
- Mr Skynner?
- Come in.
It's been a pleasure, sir.
I never wanted you back.
Logie says he needs you.
Well... he's got you.
Conference in half an hour.
And keep your mouth shut.
You're only there for show.
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
You do look bloody terrible.
- We missed you, Tom.
- I know why you want me back, Guy.
You've lost the crown jewels, haven't you? You've lost Shark.
We got a call from one of the intercept stations in Scarborough.
And they started picking up a single word broadcast on the hour, every hour... coming out of U-boat headquarters in Sainte-Assise.
- In Morse?
- No, it was a human voice.
- "Akelei. "
- Meaning what?
- It's a flower.
- I know it's a bloody flower, Guy.
Aquilegia. Columbine.
But what did it mean?
It meant,
"Change the weather code. "
The Germans have switched their U-boats to a new code book, and we're blacked out again.
Is that why the Yanks are here?
Skynner's in a panic.
They want to take over his empire.
Here comes our team.
- You! You!
- Hello.
- You in the Royal Navy?
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Only for a day or two. I mean, actually on a ship.
- What was your ship?
Look, I can't be expected to remember every little thing.
Sorry.
Welcome to Bletchley Park, sir.
Three convoys left New York in the past week... and are presently at sea.
Convoy SC 122.
Fifty merchant ships carrying fuel oil, tanks... iron ore, bauxite, also meat, sugar and wheat.
Convoy HX 229 departed
New York on Monday.
Forty merchant vessels carrying explosives, manganese... timber, powdered milk.
Convoy 229-A left New York on Tuesday... carrying steel, timber, powdered milk.
I don't want a shopping list.
What's the total?
One hundred and forty-one merchant ships, gross tonnage just under a million tons.
- Plus cargo of another million.
- And where are the U-boats?
A submarine tracking rumour had three U-boat packs operational... in the North Atlantic as of OO hundred Thursday... here, here and here.
Midnight Wednesday?
- So where are the U-boats now?
- I'm afraid I have no idea.
I thought that was why we were here.
Our intelligence has been shut off.
You're telling us that the largest assembly of merchant shipping... we've ever sent across the North Atlantic... is now steaming towards the largest concentration of U-boats... the Germans have ever put in the North Atlantic... and you don't know where the hell the goddam U-boats are?
- Gentlemen, if I may...
- Shut up.
What are our convoys making, hmm?
Something over 220 miles a day.
Well, I'd say we have four days, maximum... before the convoys come in operational range of where you last had the enemy.
So, Leonard, this blackout... will it be over in four days?
Uh, it's possible.
Yes, well, all things are possible,
Leonard, but is it likely?
Is it likely that you can break this code, this, um... What'd you call this?
This Shark? Before our convoys come in range of the U-boats.
- We'll give it every priority.
- Yes, I know damn well you'll give it every priority, Leonard.
- That's not the question.
- Well, sir, as you press me, yes, I think we may be able to do it.
Is that what you all believe?
Um, well, I suppose you could say we know more about Shark now than we did the last time.
If Guy thinks we can do it,
I would certainly respect his opinion.
And you?
You don't seem to have much to say.
Tom Jericho. He's the one who got us into reading Shark. If there's anyone alive...
Can you break Shark again in four days?
Have you any idea what you're talking about?
Tom's been on sick leave for the last month, so I don't think he's fully in the picture...
Enigma is a very sophisticated enciphering machine... and Shark is its ultimate refinement...
so we're not talking about The Times' crossword.
It weighs 26 pounds, battery included... and goes anywhere.
The Enigma machine.
The Germans have thousands of them.
What's it do?
It turns plain-text messages into gobbledygook.
Then the gobbledygook gets transmitted in Morse.
At the receiving end, there's another Enigma machine to turn it back into the original message.
Press the same key any number of times, it will always come out different.
- And you have one of your own.
- Courtesy of the Polish Cipher Bureau.
So what's the problem?
Problem?
The problem is the machine has 115 million million million ways of doing it... according to how you set these three rotors and how you connect these plugs.
And that's Shark.
No. No, no, no.
This is the one we can break.
Shark is enciphered on a machine with a fourth rotor specially developed for U-boats... which gives it about 4,OOO million billion different starting positions.
And, uh, we've never seen one.
Holy shit!
I haven't understood a word.
Can somebody give me a straight answer to a straight question?
- Will this blackout definitely be over in...
- Nobody can say definitely, sir.
Yes or no?
- No.
- Thank you.
So it isn't over in four days.
When will it be over, hmm?
Hmm? Hmm? You.
Well, all I have to measure it by is how long it took last time when Shark first came in.
- And how long did it take?
- Ten months.
Well, this is a great day for Adolf Hitler.
Ten months?
But you did break it?
Yes.
- How?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
I think it's time we...
I think it's time
I got back to London.
It's not just a million tons of shipping.
It's a million tons of shipping every week!
It's our capability to supply Russia, to support the army in North Africa... to invade Europe and drive the Germans out.
- It's the whole fucking war.
- Sir.
Satisfied? Now, send the stupid bugger back to where he came from.
Don't waste a match.
Back to Mayfair?
No.
How many people knew about the German weather code... how important it was to us?
A dozen, maybe. Why?
Make me a little list?
What are you doing here,
Mr Wigram?
You think there's a spy in Bletchley Park?
I'm Cave.
Naval Intelligence.
I'll be liaising with the admiralty.
They've given me an office in your hut.
I'm ultra-cleared.
- What does that mean?
- That means I know how you broke Shark, in principle.
You used a captured copy of the German Navy's weather code book.
Gave you a pretty good idea of what their weather signals were supposed to be saying.
Can I see it?
Midnight, two days ago, the Germans changed to a new book.
- So we lost that crib.
- Well, why do you think they did that just then?
Don't know.
And the other one?
Short signal code book.
The U-boats employ it for reporting their position, course and speed.
Unfortunately, if you don't know where the U-boat is or what it's doing... the short signal code book isn't much help as a crib.
Two men died saving those little books... from a sinking submarine.
Fasson and Grazier.
We caught the U-boat on the surface in the eastern Med.
The sub went down when they were inside trying to bring out its four-rotor Enigma.
November '42.
I was in destroyers.
It was my last ship.
Bletchley is the lucky number in this war.
- One and six, please.
- One and six.
Here you are.
Girls, guess I'm off.
- See you later.
- Yes, I'll see you later.
Miss Wallace?
Mr Jericho.
When did you get back?
Just today.
How, uh... How are you?
How am I?
Yeah, all right.
How is she?
She's... She's Claire.
- Well, will you tell her?
- If I see her.
She hasn't been sleeping at home the last two nights.
Sorry.
Good morning, sir.
- Worrying about your babies?
- Puck.
Thomas.
So, they say you're not crazy any more.
- It thinks it's found a possible.
- "It thinks"?
- Why not?
- Been in the hut?
- Come on. Get it over with.
- No, I'm fine, Puck.
Sure, you are.
Hey, Betty, wait for me!
Gentlemen, we have a ghost.
Tom, how the hell are you?
- Well. Very well.
- Have you escaped, or what?
- I thought this was the asylum.
- How are you?
- Good.
- Bloody hell!
- How's the revolution, Alec?
- Coming along, comrade. Coming along.
- T... T... T...
- Yes, it's me.
I, uh... I want to see all the Shark traffic we haven't been able to break.
- In at the deep end.
- Why not?
- Yes, why not?
- Have you got yesterday's Porpoises?
Open the file.
Besides, it wasn't really Shark that made you crazy.
Was it, Tom?
I suppose you all know.
You think I made a fool of myself?
Forget about it.
You're among friends.
So, what about the code breakers?
Kingcome, De Brooke,
Upjohn, Pukowski.
- Spot the odd one out.
- Puck lost his parents when Poland was invaded.
His kid brother is missing in action.
He hates the Germans.
Pinker?
Bit of an arty, isn't he?
He writes detective stories.
Baxter. They say he sleeps with a picture of Stalin under his pillow.
Perhaps you haven't heard.
Stalirs on our side now.
- And Jericho. The famous Mr Jericho.
- Mathematician.
Went off his trolley, didn't he?
About some girl.
We took him out of Cambridge on the first day of the war.
He worked himself into a breakdown, so we shipped him back to Cambridge to get well.
And that's all there is to it.
It's never all there is to anything.
Shift's not over yet, ladies!
The 3:OO's from Beaumanor all need blisting.
You know, without your glasses, you don't look half bad.
Do you know, without my glasses, nor do you?
Claire?
I'm here.
Sorry it took an age.
Well, now you know where I am.
It's, um, off the beaten track.
Yes, well, it's better than being snooped on by landladies.
Welfare found out I had a spare room, so I had to share.
But Hester's a sweetie, really. Oh, there's no sugar, I'm afraid, but it's lapsang.
And I always think sugar would rather spoil lapsang, don't you?
Don't know.
You're my first lapsang.
I knew you'd ask me out.
- I thought you asked me out.
- Well, I had to get you started. Arert there any pretty girls in Hut 8?
- How do you know where I work?
- We've got an interesting men tracking room in Hut 3.
- You're not supposed to tell me where you...
- Besides, you're rumoured to have done something very clever... and I want to know what it is.
Oh, my God.
Where did they find you?
Oh, where did they find any of us?
I'm the lucky one.
You know, they've got perfectly clever girls working like post office clerks.
Not like me on the German book.
I want that for my scrapbook.
- Can I see it?
- If you want. It's upstairs.
That's Hester.
And this is me.
You've been busy.
- Where is this?
- Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where I'd like to be old.
If I'm ever old.
Do you think it's beautiful?
Why are you a mathematician?
Do you like sums?
I like numbers.
Because with numbers, truth and beauty are the same thing.
You know you're getting somewhere when the equations start looking... beautiful.
And you know the numbers are taking you closer to the secret of how things are.
A rose is just plain text.
My God.
What have you done?
What has she done?
- Mr Jericho?
- Miss Wallace.
I came looking for Claire.
I was worried about her.
I could fill a bus with men who are worried about Claire Romilly... but that's no reason why
I shouldn't go to the police.
She'd be the first person they'd arrest.
Miss Wallace, please put that poker down.
And if you know where she is, for God's sake, tell me.
She's gone missing.
What are those, exactly?
Intercepts. German signals.
Yes, I know that much.
Five-letter groups. German Navy signals are sent in four-letter groups.
So this must be army or Luftwaffe.
Picked up by the radio scanners at Beaumanor.
All sent between 9:30 and midnight on April 17, nine days ago.
- But never deciphered.
- How do you know that?
Well, if it'd gone through the machine, then plain text would be stuck on the back.
All from the same source.
"ADU. ADU."
Does the call sign ADU mean anything to you, Miss Wallace?
Miss Wallace?
"Angels Dance Upwards. "
- What?
- Well, that's how we'd reference it.
- Who is it? Who is ADU?
- I don't know.
But you could find out.
Do you have any idea what you're saying?
We can't just go digging through Bletchley looking for information about missing cryptograms.
If we want to find Claire, then we need to find out what she was hiding.
- You think Claire is a traitor.
- Would it matter if she were?
Of course it matters.
Look... she was probably flirting with an officer and forgot to file those intercepts... so she hid them rather than get told off.
Or she stole them and then she ran away.
You really are mad, aren't you?
And I would have to be even madder to have any part in this little amateur sleuthing adventure.
Miss Wallace.
Miss Wallace!
You said yourself that she was missing.
Now, is that normal?
Is that her habit?
Well, she does always come home to change her clothes.
Well, there you are.
Is she seeing anyone, do you know?
What exactly is your interest here?
You can reach me at Armstrong's
Guest House in Albion Street.
ADU, Miss Wallace.
Angels Dance Upwards.
They call it Black Bottom the new twister
It's sure got 'em and, oh, sister
They clap their hands and do a raggedy flop and a hop
Old fellows with lumbago
And high yellow
The waves they go
They jump right in and give us all that they've got
They say that when that river bottom's covered with ooze
You silly, silly girl.
These people keep such funny hours.
I haven't heard...
Oh, Mr Jericho!
You have a visitor.
You can have the parlour.
We don't have guests in the bedrooms after 1 O: OO.
Oh, Mrs Armstrong, it's perfectly sweet of you to worry... but I don't mind taking the risk just this once.
Well, I suppose it's all right if you're from the park.
Mr Wigram, would you care for a cup of Ovaltine?
Ovaltine?
I haven't had Ovaltine since... no, no...
Ovaltine. Thank you.
I don't think my system could take it.
What a charming house.
And hunting prints.
Do you hunt?
Where are you based?
Here?
Bliss.
What can I do for you,
Mr, um, Wigram?
There's something
I've been wondering about.
You're the man who broke the U-boat code.
Hmm?
Champagne all around.
Happy days are here again, all right?
Then you fell out of your pram.
So what happened?
It was personal.
I can keep a secret.
Wonderful thing about war...
Peacetime is about keeping the people in their place.
But then war breaks out, and life was never so glorious.
The toiling masses turn into heroes... and their little women start dropping their drawers like debutantes.
- Well, if that's all you...
- And best of all, the swots.
Dragged out in a cloud of dandruff from some dim backwater... and invited to the ball.
At Bletchley, you're as glamorous as fighter pilots.
Girls you couldn't even hope to meet go weak at the knees... at the thought of the size of your brain, isn't that right?
If talking through your arse is what they teach you in spy school...
I'm talking about you and a girl called Claire Romilly.
We're rather worried about her.
Officially been missing for 14 hours, give or take. When in fact, it's more like 48 hours.
She hasn't been seen since she went off-duty on Thursday.
Rather a good friend of yours, I gather.
L- I haven't seen her since befo... since before I...
Quite.
Heard from her?
- No.
- Apart from the postcard.
Let's try to remember everything.
It saves misunderstandings.
Did you go to the cottage tonight?
Don't think about it.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Yes.
Mind if I sit down?
I've been away for a month.
I wanted to look her up.
You ever discuss your work with her?
- Of course not.
- Um, how about a gun?
- Any guns?
- A gun?
A gun from that museum of yours... liberated from a captured U-boat along with the code books, the captairs teddy bear and what have you.
All very improper and unsigned for, but I turned a blind eye.
But no reason why you should know, a chap like you.
Mind if I check the coat?
While we're at it...
- You sure you don't mind?
- I'm beginning to.
You see my point, though, don't you?
One day the Germans black us out in the North Atlantic.
Next day, girlfriend of crack code breaker disappears... vanishes.
- Code breaker returns, shiny new shooter goes missing.
- She's not my girlfriend.
Hmm? What is she, then?
We were... I suppose the phrase is
"seeing each other"... for about a month.
Is that what happened to you?
What?
Is Claire Romilly what happened to you?
There was a concert.
I went on my own.
Oh, it's you.
You found my slipper.
Afterwards, Claire, Hester...
Miss Wallace, who shares the cottage... and I, we came out together.
Next week was going to be Bach.
Oh, we must go.
Oh, I can't.
I'm on the night shift.
Oh, Hester. Poor you.
"Poor you," she said.
That's one of her phrases.
So, I asked her.
I say, I hope you don't think it fresh of me, but should we go together?
Of course you did.
And, uh, after that?
After that?
I had the happiest month of my whole life.
Not happiest. Something.
- You can! You can.
- I can't.
You can. Yes.
Ready? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
- Sorry.
- No, you can't.
- Claire!
- Aaron!
- May I?
- Do you mind?
No.
It's my favourite club.
- Mine too.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure.
How do you get the petrol coupons to go zipping up and down to London?
Secret, darling.
I know a chap.
- No, but how?
- It's not what you think.
Do you have to know everything?
I don't know why you want me.
Let's get married before it stops.
- Tom, don't.
- I love you!
They say you shouldn't fall in love in a war. You never know what's coming.
I love you.
I really love you.
No cottage.
- Is that code, darling?
- Yes.
- I want to see where you sleep.
- Landlady has rules.
So have I.
Hester's at home.
Oh.
I'll be quiet as a mouse.
Promise.
Shh. Shh.
Sleep with her?
I'll take that as a yes.
And then you quarrelled?
Quarrelled? No.
Claire? Darling?
Sorry, darling.
Go back to sleep.
- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking through your things.
No photographs?
You've never given me a photograph.
You're all secrets, aren't you?
I've no secrets from you.
Please come back to bed.
What's this? What's the entscheidungsproblem when it's at home?
That's just something
I was working on at Cambridge.
It's a... It's a theoretical machine that...
- Theoretical. So it doesn't exist?
- Please, come back to bed.
Well, this will do.
I want something of yours to keep.
Give it back.
- Why?
- Because it means nothing to you and a lot to me.
- Arert I clever enough, darling?
- Please, Claire!
No!
Give it back.
Give it back.
It's not funny, Claire!
Claire, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.
I'm really, really sorry.
Claire...
She moved on.
Why won't you answer my letters?
Are you seeing someone else?
I'm always seeing someone else.
Yes.
She moved on.
Not right, Mr Jericho.
Can't quite put my finger on it... but definitely not right.
Were you surprised when they told you that Admiral Doenitz... had changed the German Navy weather code?
Any bells go off?
Germans were always nervous about Enigma.
Well, the Germans are supposed to think that Enigma's an unbreakable system... because it would take thousands of years to go through every setting... to find the one that turns the code back into the plain text.
Next day, it's different again. Using human beings, Enigma is safe forever... but we don't use human beings for that.
Do we...
Mr Jericho?
- No.
- No.
And that is the secret inside the secret.
All they know thus far is that the weather code opened a crack in the system... because somebody told them.
But what if somebody tells them just how we do do it?
Your thinking machine.
Clackety-clack, day and night.
Programmed with a menu, thanks to your big brain... that reduces the odds to just a few million to one... till it locks on to the winning combination.
There goes the war.
Oh.
I've got a little list.
You're on it.
Communists, foreign nationals... geniuses just this side of barking mad.
Altogether, a security nightmare.
But of all these names, Mr Jericho, you are the only one... who got himself fucked into a nervous breakdown by a missing blonde.
You live quietly from now on.
Where does one pee around here?
To the right.
Good night, Mrs Armstrong.
Talk to me!
What do you want to know?
Do you want to know about Shark?
Do you want to know about Shark?
Any secret. Ask me.
Ask me! I'll tell you!
Poor you. I really got under your skin, didn't I?
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You look tired, sir.
Morning!
- Have you heard the latest?
- No.
Utility knickers... one Yank, and they're off.
Naughty, naughty.
- Came through the door for you.
- If there is some other way
To prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
Preserve my body and soul into everlasting peace.
Take and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for you.
Thank you for your note.
I take it it's about Claire.
Have you heard anything?
She hasn't turned up, if that's what you mean.
- But you've got something.
- Take this and eat this in remembrance that Christ died for you.
I don't know why I'm doing this.
The body of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, which was given freely.
Preserve my body and soul...
ADU is the call sign of Nachtrichten, Regiment 537... a motorized German
Army signals unit based... in the Ukraine.
Its messages are encoded in the standard cipher for the Russian campaign.
- We call it Kestrel.
- Kestrel.
Seven messages with the call sign ADU... were intercepted in March and April... not counting the last four on April the 17th, which you found.
I've written down the dates and times of interception.
A spy doesn't steal the enemy's signals.
And anyway, they were never de...
They were never decoded. Why would she steal four messages she can't read?
She must have stolen them to read them.
She stole them to read them.
But there's no way she could have.
- Why not?
- She couldn't. It just...
Just take my word for it.
God preserve me.
Another one.
I seem to move, Mr Jericho, in an endless round... from one patronizing male to another... forever being told what I am and what I am not allowed to know.
Well, that ends here.
So, what would she need to read them?
I'm sorry.
You can't ask me that.
But you can ask me to sneak into the Index
Room and risk getting hung up by my thumbs.
- Good morning.
- Cheerio, then.
Oh, Chr... Miss Wallace.
Miss Wallace!
She'd need...
She'd need a Typex machine.
Every day, our Typex machines have to be set... the same way the Germans set their Enigmas.
Otherwise, you just get nonsense from nonsense.
And working out each day's settings is the hard part.
That's where the code breakers come in.
- How?
- Well, you... you need a crib.
- I'll see you later, then.
- Suppose that gravestone was in code.
If I knew who was buried here, more or less, I'd know what the code meant.
That's a crib.
And when you've set the machine, you type in the coded message.
If it comes out nonsense, the settings are wrong.
If it comes out
"Mary Jane Hawkins"... you've broken Enigma for that day.
Why would Claire get hold of the
Kestrel settings for April the 17th?
She couldn't have, unless she had help.
Kestrel would be filed in Hut 6.
It's your hut.
So now I'm a traitor too.
Well, maybe she got access to one of the Typex machines from you.
Typex girls work around the clock.
Sorry.
Stuck.
Look.
The first seven ADUs were decoded.
Now, what happens to decoded messages?
They get written into the German book.
That's Claire's job.
Then what?
Well, then they get filed with everything else in the main registry.
- Ever been in there?
- Once or twice to check some...
No. No, no, no, no.
Oh, dear, would you like some tea?
- Reference or loan?
- Reference.
- Section?
- Hut 6. Control.
- What are they?
- Kestrel intercepts, March and April.
- He's been a dark horse, hasn't he?
- Hmm. Surprise a minute.
But there are complications.
Sorry to have been so long.
I've never come across this before.
- The file was empty?
- There was a typewritten note... dated April the 17th... referring all inquiries to the Office of the Director General.
And that night, four final ADU messages got in under the wire... never deciphered, never filed... taken home by Claire and hidden.
Who is the Director General?
Chief of the Special
Intelligence Service.
And he gets his orders straight from the prime minister.
We're stuck again.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I've got the hang of this detective work.
But I've been told that everything's okay
You're out of bounds!
- Mr Mermagen.
- What are you doing?
Can you help me?
Machine Room needs the Kestrel settings for the last couple of weeks.
They've found a batch of intercepts fallen behind a desk.
- They've done what?
- I know.
But please don't tell.
It was actually a friend of mine.
Ah, you girls.
You know, I should really report you for this... but...
One good turn deserves another, hmm?
Why, Mr Mermagen.
What will your wife say?
The Kestrel settings for the whole of March and April.
Christ.
So, at least there's still a chance we can read the ones you found in Claire's bedroom.
- I've burnt them.
- You what?
Hello, Tom.
Mind if we join you?
- You can't m-m-m-mean it.
- Well, of course I mean it.
Drowning herself was Virginia Woolf's greatest contribution to English literature.
- Actually, we were just leaving.
- Waste not, want not.
Whale meat.
Brain food, Tom.
- You burned them!
- I had a close call with that lounge lizard Wigram from Special Intelligence.
I panicked. But the worst of it is,
I could have read them.
- How?
- I didn't need a Typex machine.
We've got a real Enigma in the museum.
- Well, when did you find that out?
- Well, I knew. I just... I just forgot.
You forgot?
And you're the genius.
You know, I won a newspaper crossword competition.
I beat two men. All three of us were recruited for Bletchley.
They're cryptanalysts now.
And I'm a glorified file clerk.
'Course, if I'd been a daddy's girl from some posh finishing school...
God, look, it's time to go back on shift.
- You?
- Not for a bit.
Right.
Did she ever say anything about me?
Well, she must like you.
The way she talks about the others...
A bus load, you said?
The Romilly effect.
One look, and they're "Romillied. "
Who was she seeing?
I only mean it might be a way forward.
- I know what you think about me.
- No, you don't.
Well, I feel like an idiot.
And you aren't the one standing here with the
Kestrel settings stuffed into your knickers.
Look, I don't know who she was seeing... and I really think we'd better call this a day.
Don't you?
Bye, then.
Miss Wallace.
I haven't been lookir to the right or left... so there's something
I didn't see clearly.
What's that?
That you're a remarkable...
I think you're simply wonderful.
Tom, nice of you to turn up.
- Look, I don't know what Skynner's been saying.
- Shut the door.
He wants you out.
"Send him back to Cambridge, and this time make the bugger walk. "
I got you the rail pass.
- Not now!
- No, you can't do that, Guy. Tell them you want to give me a couple of days.
- Why?
- To see if I can find a way back into Shark.
Tom, it was you that announced that it couldn't be done in four days.
It was you that made Skynner look a fool in front of his clients.
Now you want me to go back and tell him... Piss off, for God's sake!
Sorry, Guy. Hello, Thomas.
You'd better come and hear this.
Two long signals from U-boat headquarters in the last 12 hours.
One just before midnight, one just after. Rebroadcast twice.
- Then nothing. U- boat fleet is on radio silence. - Christ.
They're on battle stations.
Say 12 U-boats 20 miles apart... possibly two lines, possibly three.
An ambush covering hundreds of miles of ocean.
And this time, we don't know where.
And one golden rule... absolute radio silence.
- And wh... wh...
- What then?
Either the convoy is lucky and misses the ambush, or it isn't lucky.
And the first U-boat to make contact with the convoy breaks radio silence.
- How?
- Minimally, using the short signal book.
It compresses the necessary information to a few letters... sighting of convoy, position, course and speed.
That's repeated every two hours. As it's picked up by the other U
- boats in the line... they start to converge on the convoy and send a contact signal in their turn.
Contact signal.
They'll shadow the convoy till nightfall.
They prefer to attack in the dark.
We haven't got as much time as we'd thought.
I'd say, a day, a day and a half at the outside.
- Mary Jane Hawkins.
- The oracle has spoken.
They changed the weather code, but they didn't change the short signal code book.
It's our way back into Shark, so long as the U-boats find our convoy.
Don't you see?
It's our convoy.
We know what the U-boats are sending.
It's the crib that we've been looking for.
- Would you get enough material?
- How many signals do you need?
One group of letters for the convoy sighted... two groups for grid reference, one group for course, one group for speed.
Five groups of letters per contact signal every two hours.
Shadowing the convoy for maybe 1 O hours,
12... that's 25 groups of letters.
And how many U-boats joining in?
Eight, ten?
Each one a contact signal every two hours.
My God, he's right.
He's found us a crib.
- Brilliant.
- A-A-Appalling.
We've never had an operation on this scale. The contact signals could easily build up to give us a crib... of 1 OO group of letters and we've got the short signal code book in the museum.
He's right, Guy.
Where are the keys to the museum?
Good Christ, Tom. We have to protect the convoys, not sacrifice them.
You know what it's like out there.
The success of this plan depends on arranging a massacre.
No. No, we are not arranging anything.
What happens is going to happen.
But if we can use it to our advantage, we'll be able to decipher every signal... sent by every U-boat on the high seas for 24 hours!
- Including the weather reports.
- Yeah. We'll have the plain text.
We can make a start on reconstructing the new weather code.
- This puts us back in the fight.
- And there will be many more convoys to protect.
You're back in business, old thing.
Garbled text from Beaumanor.
Somebody get on the blower.
Miss Chamberlain, would you?
Get them to check their file copy.
Pam, does Beaumanor keep copies of everything they send us?
- Yes. It's all there on file.
- Thank you.
Hello. Could I have Beaumanor 392?
Miss Wallace!
No female visitors upstairs.
That's the rule!
Mr Jericho, wake up.
It's not over.
- We need to borrow your Enigma machine.
- Didrt you hear?
Top copy goes straight to your people by teleprinter... or by dispatch rider, depending on priority.
The second copy we keep, in case of garbles.
Can we see?
Well, if you want.
There's not much to it.
It's a treat for us, you know, a visit from head office to the country cousins.
It's good of you to say so, but, um... a fat lot of use we'd be without your intercepts, Major.
We keep them a couple of months, filed chronologically.
These sets are tuned to the
Eastern Front... Kestrel, Buzzard, Kite.
- And you're intercepting everything?
- Absolutely.
Except that time the other week, of course.
Kestrel, wasn't it?
Yes, your Miles Mermagen came on the blower in a frightful panic.
"No more ADU, thank you very much.
Not now, not ever. "
- What's that about?
- Orders from above.
We'd just sent him four good, clean signals.
It was Kay here who handled our mystery station.
Carry on.
Yeah, he has a good fist, ADU.
Touch like a concert pianist.
He's still transmitting?
Of course, I don't take him down any more, but he was awful busy last week.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
What was it you said you did again, Mr...
- Jericho.
- Jericho.
Can't say, I'm afraid.
Catch you up.
- Major, how many machines did you say you have here?
- We have 48 here.
Excuse me.
He's on now, if you're interested, sir.
Thank you.
I don't mean to bother you, sir... but it is important, isn't it?
I know I shouldn't ask.
I mean, no one ever tells us.
You are making sense of it?
It is important?
Yes.
This is our only war, you see, in here... beep, beep, bloody beep.
And it's always nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
Yes, we are making sense of it... and it is important.
Eleven ADU signals and launchings.
That's the car.
Man, woman, two-seater roadster.
Invite him to stop, shall we?
Take him, man! Take him!
Mr Jericho, stop! Stop! Stop!
Look out!
Shit.
Bravo, Mr Jericho.
Reckon, given the circumstances,
Miss Wallace... we might now risk first names.
Hester.
Tom.
This might be good.
It looks deserted enough.
Well spotted.
Bliss.
- What would they do to us if they knew?
- Feed us to the dogs.
Charming.
Right.
March and April
Beaumanor log sheets... and the intercepts from March 28th...
April 3rd, April 9th,
15th, 16th, 17th... and Kestrel settings... last one first.
Might tell us why Claire disappeared.
Right. April 17, rotor order.
R- X-O.
- Plug board settings.
- A-O-E-M.
The current passes from the keyboard... to the lamps by way of the rotors and the plugs.
And every time you press a key, it changes the path of the current.
Press the same key ten times, it comes out ten different ways on the lamp board.
You never know which letters will light up. Simply brilliant.
Message key X-A-T.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- "Y."
- "K."
- "E."
- "A."
"W."
"C."
- "U."
- Zed.
"M."
"V."
- "Q"
- "X."
It's not right, is it?
This isn't German.
Keep going. Sometimes the operator pads out with nonsense.
Keep going.
- Um, "K."
- Zed.
- "E."
- "R."
- "O."
- "A."
- "F."
- "D."
Isn't German.
Come on, genius!
I'm sorry. It's double coded, or the settings must be wrong.
It's all been for nothing.
I'm afraid I have to ask you to hurry up.
Search the barn.
This is Mr Leveret.
Detective Inspector Leveret.
He wants to know what you've been up to.
But first things first.
You've been here before?
And you?
Line up in the street and search the area.
Have a look at this, sir.
It's down there.
- Right, sir.
- There?
Drag the river.
Please talk to me! What do you want to know? I'll tell you anything you want.
Give me your hand.
Do you wanna know about Shark?
Any secret. Ask me!
Come this way.
I've got something to show you.
Get your notebook out.
Miss Wallace first.
I am showing the witness one ladies' coat, colour grey... trimmed with black velvet.
Label: Hunters, Burlington Arcade.
- And the witness responded...
- Yes. It's hers.
Yes.
Next, one ladies' shoe... black high heel.
Uh, heel snapped off.
And the witness responded...
Yes.
It's an old quarry.
They built the town with what they dug out.
That makes sense, making one hole out of another.
- How deep is it?
- Sixty, seventy foot in the middle.
Christ, we'll need a submarine.
I would very much like to arrest you... but we don't have a body.
It's a quarter to 8:OO.
Mr Leveret will take you back.
I believe your day is just beginning.
Chaps.
Easy, everyone.
Just stopped by to wish you luck.
I'm sure you're all aware, as I am, what's at stake here.
I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say... this could be one of the decisive nights of the war.
- So shut up, then.
- A mighty battle.
Probably... the greatest convoy battle of all time is about to start.
Three hours ago, convoys HX 229A...
229 and SC 122... had entered the presumed operational area... of the U-boat packs.
Now, in our long island history... we have picked up the gauntlet more than a few times.
Shakespeare coming up.
"Out of this nettle, danger, may we pluck this flower, safety. "
So, gentlemen, go to it.
Come and dance.
Boop-boop
Come on. Come and dance.
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can. It's easy.
- No, really, you do it.
- Right, left.
Left, left.
Ah! You're getting the hang of it.
C- Can someone remind me?
A- Are w-we hoping for the U-boats to find the convoys, o-o-or not?
- Not.
- I am.
- Yes, well, you would, Baxter.
- Y-You'd sacrifice o-o-our...
Sacrifice a convoy to get back into Shark? Of course.
How many men has Stalin had to sacrifice so far? Five million?
It's called the greater good.
Spoken, of course, by someone who doesn't happen to be in the North Atlantic at the moment.
You can only fight your own war.
What do you think, Tom?
About what?
So, Claire, what were you doing?
What were you hiding?
Right.
Start at the beginning.
Kestrel settings, March.
Atlantic time is two hours behind.
It's still dark.
Here, mate,
I got a lighter.
Thanks.
"Urgent. "
Mary Jane Hawkins.
It is German.
Signal 7-3-6-9-K-C-S.
We're in business.
Direction finders have a fix.
Scarborough, 2-5-9 degrees.
Witt, 2-4-6, 30 degrees.
Flowerdown, 2-6-8 degrees.
There she is...
She's shadowing convoy HX 229.
No air cover. Sitting ducks.
Grid square?
B- D-1491.
- Convoy course?
- Seventy degrees.
- Convoy speed.
- Ten knots.
- From the code book, we have C-K-S-A for convoy sighted. - First message?
K- A-F-B-N-W-Zed-Jacob for position.
Q- K-D-X for course, Q-R-Zed-A for speed.
That's five four-letter groups.
Message setting, B-H-B.
"A-V, V-K, A-K."
Check.
Yeah, me too.
- "M-S, S-M."
- Check.
Two loops. Confirmed?
And no clashes.
O4.
One down.
Now the wolves will be gathering.
Still nonsense. Why?
Can you fix B-D-1611?
Convoy speed and direction same.
New position:
K- A-F-V, N-C-L-A.
Skynner's offered a bottle of Scotch to the first man to come up with a menu.
- Does he know I'm still here?
- He didn't ask.
Oh, Puck, there's a message left for you at the switchboard.
It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.
There's no name, and I'm not your social secretary.
- Message key: R-M-U.
- Sorry, Guy.
How much more material do you need?
We've got 9 signals.
Another 20, 25 would be better.
Suppose it starts before you have them.
Naval grid square B-D-1386.
Course: 70 degrees.
Speed of convoy: 1 O knots.
I'm pretty sure there's enough for a stab at a menu. Let's try it.
- You have 17 contacts, Mr Jericho.
- It's not enough.
Well, why the hell not?
When I'm done, we'll be looking for a needle in a haystack... but if we stop now it'll be a hundred thousand haystacks.
You know that.
Full moon.
Ten U-boats, somewhere.
Thirty-seven merchants, five escorts, one of which has lost contact with the convoy.
No rescue ship and no air cover.
Eighteen.
- Flowerdown, 2-6-8 degrees.
- It's what you might call a bitch.
- Twenty-three.
- Not enough.
- What have you got?
- I need one more link.
I can't see it.
Names. They're names.
- You?
- No.
Getting a very bad feeling now.
Polish names.
- There.
- Yes.
- Menu.
- Let's hope to God it works.
It's started. Bastards.
Don't you have homes to go to?
- How's it going?
- Four hits so far.
Probably 300 men lost.
A Dutch cargo and a Norwegian freighter went straight to the bottom.
And an American liberty ship's on fire.
Half the crew are drowning.
The other half are trying to save them.
Tom. Unfinished business.
Congratulations.
It's a half bottle, as it turns out.
Typical Skynner.
That should go back.
Where's the museum key?
Oh, sorry, Guy.
I've still got it.
Tsk, tsk.
Security around here.
Then get off home, old thing.
- Havert you got a girl waiting for you?
- She's dead.
Tom.
Oh, my God. Come on.
- What?
- Come on.
It's Polish.
Polish names, all of them.
The Germans found a mass grave.
Look, doesn't it say
4,OOO corpses?
"Polish officers buried in the forest at Katyn in 1940...
"during the Soviet occupation.
Shot in the back of the head. "
Murdered by the Russians.
By our Russian allies.
They were comrades-in-arms against the Nazis.
My God.
That's why the file was empty... on the orders of Secret Intelligence.
And that's why Beaumanor was ordered to stop intercepting the signals.
It was too big a secret.
Just knowing that can get you killed.
And Claire discovered it.
Copied it into the German book, and she had to tell... someone.
- Adam Pukowski.
- What?
Missing in action.
Kid brother of Jozef Pukowski.
Claire stole those intercepts for Puck... because he was looking for his brother's name.
- Puck!
- Wait! Please!
This Puck killed her. Why?
Because he had a secret, too, and she could've given him away.
- What secret?
- I can't tell you that!
Tom!
Hello. Could you get me
London Adelphi 4-2-4-3, please?
I'm sorry. That number is not in service.
What the hell is this about, you and some skirt waltzing around Beaumanor?
Leonard, unless you're asking me to dance, let go of my arm!
I should've cooked your goose when you made a fool of yourself over that blonde... who fucked half the park.
What?
Stand away! Stand away!
What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?
He's two carriages up.
Snug as a bug in a rug.
Morning, sir.
You knew?
About Pukowski?
We had no proof, but when Miss Romilly went missing...
- Puck and Claire were having an...
- Were seeing each other, as you like to put it.
Seeing each other's brains out.
Jozef Pukowski, who'd been wondering what could have happened... to all those Polish officers who hadrt been heard from since the first year of the war... and Claire Romilly...
who was reading the Wermacht traffic from the Eastern Front.
They were made for each other.
And lo, mass graves.
Polish uniforms, names.
- We've been bracing ourselves for the Nazi propaganda.
- Propaganda?
Four thousand Poles murdered by Stalin?
It's what Hitler would give his last ball for.
Think of all those Polish names in the U.S. Of A.
Think of our convoys full of American goods... some of them in American ships... running the U-boat gauntlet so our supplies can keep Stalin in business.
- But it's true, isn't it?
- The Katyn massacre?
Oh, really, do shut up. There's a war to win, and Stalirs helping us win it.
And they hate the Russians, you know.
They've hated them for centuries.
So what's Pukowski going to do to get back at them?
Help the enemy. That's what.
His enemy's enemy.
And he's got a big piece of knowledge that can help the Germans... Shark.
- The weather code.
- Claire couldn't have known what he'd do. She wasn't a traitor.
I'm sure you're right.
But then Pukowski heard that you were coming back.
Jericho, the lover who wouldn't let go, who'd cracked once before.
The swot who was invited to the ball, found Cinderella's slipper... and went so crazy he would've told her anything.
And you would have, wouldn't you?
About how we lost Shark.
And the rumour that there was a mole in the park, probably in your hut.
How long would it have taken Claire to work out that the traitor was Puck? About a minute.
So he killed her.
One-way to Manchester, according to the ticket collector.
Change the watch.
Well, let's see where and to whom he will lead us, hmm?
Train approaching, platform three.
It's the 3:15 to Manchester.
How do you get the petrol coupons to go zipping up and down to London?
Secret, darling. I know a chap.
Train standing, platform three.
3:15 for Manchester only.
Manchester, next stop.
That's it for you.
Go home, keep your head down... and I might try and forget about you and your moll breaking the Highway Code... and the Official Secrets Act on the same day.
Train standing, platform three.
3:15 to Manchester only.
You've been trying to frighten me into keeping my head down right from the start. Why?
Because somehow
I frighten you. Why?
Because of Claire.
My connection with Claire.
Be careful now.
The night you came to my room, you already had Pukowski in your sights... yet you went out of your way to play the heavy with me.
And then you were more concerned about
Claire Romilly than you were about Shark.
- A girl who'd missed her shift? Why?
- Why? She was his girlfriend.
Oh, no. She was more than that.
She was working for you.
Claire was your agent.
She told you everything, even how I found her shoe.
As you said, Bletchley was a security nightmare, so you put a girl in the park to do your dirty work.
Surely you mean her patriotic duty.
Everything that she did, she did because you told her. You had her fucking for England.
And then when she got to Pukowski, it went wrong. She took pity on him... and she told him what she was writing in the German book.
No wonder you were frightened.
You'd made a terrible mistake, and your agent paid for it with her life. Claire.
He's jumped!
He's gone!
Come on! Back it up!
Back the train up!
What are they doing?
Sir, please. The statiors clear.
Roadblocks are in place.
- Search the train again.
- He's not on the train!
- We'll have to let it go.
- Please be patient.
Oh, Puck, there's a message left for you at the switchboard. It's Adelphi 4-2-4-3.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you very much.
- To the station, rather fast, please.
- Ma'am.
You bloody idiot.
This time I can't save you.
You broke Skynner's cheekbone.
Tom. Well, weather code is, uh, c-c-cracking open.
Where's Puck?
- Check our weather report...
- How bad is it?
It's bad.
But we are reading Shark, thanks to you lot.
- What's this? - Grid square A-M-2-9.
We think it's a garbled signal.
- Signal to a U-boat?
- Mmm. U-617.
Ordered out of battle to proceed immedi...
Yes?
Where is this?
Loch Feochan, in Scotland, where
I'd like to be old. If I'm ever old.
So, it's the real thing.
U-671, rendezvous in 24 hours.
Our turn to find a sitting duck.
My God.
- Be careful.
- I will.
Damn it.
- I'm on the chosen frequency.
- Sir.
- There's probably interference.
- Swing around. I'll fine-tune it.
Perfect.
Just in time to bugger up the whole operation.
- Do you want to abort?
- Are you serious?
- I didn't kill her.
- I know.
Do you think
I'm here for that?
- That's right, my darling.
- They're ready.
Up you come.
What about the rest of it?
The real secret you want to tell the
Germans, about how we really broke the code?
- About my machines!
- Thomas, Thomas.
- You can have your enemy. Let me have mine.
- No.
Well, shoot me, then.
- It's your show, but your man...
- He is not my man.
Serve it up.
- Go ahead.
- Tell Auntie Mae the package is ready.
Dinner's ready.
Bullseye!
- Run out a couple of yards there.
- You're looking in the wrong place.
Oh, it's Mr Jericho.
Come home again with his batteries dried out.
You turned out to be some swot.
- I tip my hat to you.
- She's not there. Didrt you hear me?
She's moved on.
The murder scene was like a pile of clothes left on a beach.
Sometimes it means somebody's dead.
Sometimes it means somebody wanted to disappear.
Like an agent who'd been turned by her target.
It was you who saw it before I did.
What makes you think that?
Pukowski was on the train, and you were letting him run.
He knew the secret that could lose us the war. Remember? The thinking machine.
You were holding back to see who he would lead you to.
Who the hell could it be to make you take that risk?
Only Claire.
Well, I was wrong, wasn't I?
She wasn't with Pukowski.
She was waiting for him up the line to take him to her little Scottish hideaway... where a couple of runaway lovers could sit out the rest of the war.
Do you think I didn't check?
She loved him, and Pukowski brought her all the way to the brink... but then he had to tell her what she didn't know... about the U-boat coming to pick him up, and why.
If they got caught, they'd both hang.
But there was no going back.
Only forward, to Germany.
But then, he didn't know Claire.
She was no traitor.
She's out there, somewhere... like a sword hanging over your head.
In different ways, she fooled us all.
She was unreadable.
- Stick to sums.
- I think I've got something! Easy does it!
What have you got there?
Steady.
- We're losing her, lads.
- Do you want it to be her?
Steady, now.
False alarm!
Shut up.
Keep looking.
Oh, I will.
I will.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right.
I was getting worried about you two.
- Mr. Szpilman?\N- Hello.
I came specially to meet you.\NI love your playing.
- Who are you?\N- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.
- You're bleeding!\N- It's nothing.
You can write him a fan letter later.\NThis isn't the best time. Come on.
Jurek, where have you been\Nhiding her?
- I don't know what to take.\N- You always take too much.
How many suitcases are you taking?
What do you think, should I take\Nuncle Szymon's portrait?
Take it, don't take it,\Ntake what you like.
Can't you see I'm worried sick?
He'll come home, he'll be alright.
- I should have another case.\N- Mama, Wladek is home!
Thank God.\NWladek! You're wounded?
- No, it was nothing.\N- I've been worried sick.
I told her not to worry.\NYou had your papers on you.
If you'd been hit by a bomb,\Nthey'd know where to take you.
Henryk, don't say things like that.\NGod forbid. God forbid.
- Papa, Wladek is home.\N- What did I tell you?
- What are you doing?\N- Where's my hat with the wide brim?
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.\N- Warsaw is not the only radio station.
Pack, darling.\NGet your things packed.
- Where are we going?\N- Out of Warsaw.
- Out of Warsaw where?\N- You haven't heard?
- Heard what?\N- Haven't you seen the paper?
- Where's the paper?\N- I used it for packing.
- She used it for packing.\N- The government has moved to Lublin.
All men must leave the city, go across\Nthe river, set up a new line of defense.
There isn't anybody left here, only\Nthe women. The men are all gone.
What do you think you'll do while\Nthey set up a new line of defense?
- Wonder around with your suitcases?\N- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.
- I'm not going anywhere.\N- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.
Don't be ridiculous,\Nwe've got to keep together.
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to\Ndie in my own home, staying put.
- God forbid.\N- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.
...from the BBC in London.\NThe British government... having received no reply\Nto the observations presented... to the German government... has declared war on nazi Germany.
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!\N- It is expected that...
...within the next few hours, France\Nwill make a similar declaration.
Poland is no longer alone.
Wonderful, wonderful!
- Mama, that was a great dinner.\N- It certainly was.
When there's something to celebrate,\Nyou've got to make an effort.
Here's to Great Britain and France!
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?\NAll will be well.
Five thousand and three.
- Is that all?\N- Yes. It's all we've got left.
- It's 3,003 too much.\N- Look.
"Further restrictions\Nregarding liquid assets.
Jews will be allowed to keep a\Nmaximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "
- What do we do with the rest?\N- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough\Nto deposit money in a German bank?
We could hide the money. Look here.\NWe can hide it under the flowerpots.
I'll tell you what we'll do.\NWe'll use try and tested methods.
You know what we did\Nin the last war?
We made a hole in the table leg,\Nand hid the money in there.
- Suppose they take the table away?\N- What do you mean?
Germans go into Jewish homes and\Ntake furniture, valuables, anything.
- Do they?\N- Why'd they want a table like this?
- What on earth are you doing?\N- Listen. Look.
This is the best place. No-one would\Nthink of looking under the flowerpot.
- No, listen. I've been thinking...\N- Really? That's a change.
- You know what? We use psychology.\N- We use what?
We leave the money and the watch\Non the table, covered. In full view.
- Are you stupid?\N- The Germans will never notice it.
That's the stupidest thing I've ever\Nseen. Of course they'll notice. Look.
Look here.
Idiot.
- And you call me stupid.\N- Very good. That's the last place...
- This would take hours.\N- We're not in a hurry.
- It won't take hours.\N- How will you get them out? Tell me.
- How will you get them out?\N- Quiet! Order, please!
- You reach them out individually.\N- No-one listens to me!
Quiet, please, quiet.\NOrder, order, please.
- The lawyer, she likes order.\N- Listen, just listen. Look.
The watch we put under the flowerpot\Nand the money we stuff in the violin.
- But I'll still be able to play?\N- You'll find out.
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.\N- Wladek, how are you?
We're fine, thank you.\NAnd you?
Fine, under the circumstances.\NI guess I know why you're calling.
There's nothing we can do.\NThey won't reopen the station.
- Yes, I know, but I...\N- No music, no radio for the Polish.
But sure you'll find work.\NA pianist like you.
Maybe, maybe not, but... don't be offended, but I didn't call\Nto discuss my future carrier.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,\Nand at last he gave in and said...
"All right, come with me tomorrow",\Nso I came and... they bombed the station.
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.\N- Really?
Yes, it was unforgettable.
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.\N- Call me Wladek, please.
- No-one plays Chopin like you.\N- I hope it's a compliment.
- Of course, I mean it.\N- I was... trying to be funny.
- Should we go and have a coffee?\N- I'd like that.
- And you, what do you do?\N- I finished with the conservatoire.
- You're a musician?\N- Yes. But only just.
- What instrument?\N- The cello.
I love to see women\Nplaying the cello.
JEWS FORBIDDEN
This is disgraceful.\NHow dare they?
You know what people are like, they\Nwant to be better nazis than Hitler.
- I'm going in there to complain.\N- It's better not, believe me.
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!\N- Good-bye.
We'll find somewhere else.
- We can walk in the park.\N- No, we can't.
Official decree.\NNo Jews allowed in the park.
- My God. Are you joking?\N- I'm not joking, it's true.
We could sit in a bench, but\N"no Jews allowed on public benches".
This is absurd.
We can just stand here and talk.\NI think we're allowed to do that.
So, you play the cello. That's nice.\NAnd who's your favorite composer?
Chopin? Really? Well... you'll have to learn to play\Nhis cello sonata, won't you?
What about you, Wladek?
Perhaps I could accompany.\NMe on the piano, you on the cello.
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,\Nquite wonderful.
Call me Wladek, please.
"Free emblems for Jews\Nin the Warsaw district.
I hereby order that all Jews\Nin the Warsaw district... will wear visible emblems\Nwhen out of doors.
This decree will come into force\Non the first of December, 1939... and applies to all Jews\Nover 12 years of age.
The emblem will be worn\Non the right sleeve... and will represent the blue star\Nof David on a white background.
The background must be\Nsufficiently large... for the star to measure eight\Ncentimeters from point to point.
The width of the arms of the star\Nmust be one centimeter.
The Jews that do not respect this\Ndecree will be severely punished.
Governor of the Warsaw district,\NDr. Fischer. "
- I won't wear it.\N- I'm not going to be branded.
Let me see this.
Does it say that we have to provide\Nthese armbands ourselves?
- Where will we get them?\N- We're not going to wear them.
You!
Come here.
Why haven't you greeted us?
I'm sorry.
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.
Go to the gutter.
- Have you seen this?\N- What? What? I'm working. What?
What is this?
- It's where they're going to put us.\N- What do you mean "put us"?
"By order of the governor of the\NWarsaw district, Dr. Fischer... concerning the establishment of\Nthe Jewish district in Warsaw.
There'll be created a Jewish district\Nin which Jews will have to reside. "
Look here. "Jews living outside\Nof the prescribed area... will have to move to the Jewish\Ndistrict by 31 of October, 1940."
They won't get all of us.\NIt's too small.
There's 400 thousand of us\Nin Warsaw.
No, 360 thousand.\NSo it will be easy.
What am I supposed to do?\NYou tell me.
Mama?
Mama, what is it?
20 zlotys!
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,\Npotatoes, potatoes.
That's the price.\NThat's what I'm offering.
My advice is to accept.\NYou won't get more from anyone else.
- But it's a Bechstein!\N- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.
What are you going to do when\Nyou're hungry? Eat the piano?
- Get out!\N- What's the matter with you?
- Stop it!\N- We'd rather give it away. Get out!
Haven't you eaten today?\NWhat are you suffering from?
You people are crazy.
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand\Nand I'm paying for the removal.
I'm not even charging\Nfor the removal!
You haven't eaten today.\NYou're crazy.
Take it.
Hello.
Hello. Hi.
I didn't want to come.
I didn't want to see all this, but...\NI couldn't stop myself.
- How are you doing?\N- Fine.
Good.
No, not really.\NThey arrested my cousin.
Jurek says they'll let him out.
- This is disgraceful.\N- It won't last long. Don't worry.
That's what I said myself.
It's too absurd.
I... I should go.
Well, I'll see you... soon.
Good-bye.
Well... to tell you the truth,\NI thought it would be worse.
- Where will we sleep?\N- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.
You, Henryk and papa, in here.
Look.
Come and look.
Go away.
Go away! Go away!
Papa! Papa!
- Sell anything?\N- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".
- 3 zlotys.\N- It's better than yesterday.
Three lousy zlotys. And there are\Npeople there making millions.
- I know.\N- You don't know, believe me.
They bribe the guards,\Nthe guards turn a blind eye.
They bring cartloads of food,\Ntobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.
And the poor are dying all around\Nand they don't give a damn.
Excuse me, have you seen\Nmy husband, Izaak Szerman?
A tall handsome man,\Nwith a little gray beard.
- I'm afraid not.\N- Excuse me. Good-bye.
Sleep well. But if you see him,\Nwrite to me, yes?
Izaak Szerman.
Why do we have to have a gentile\Nstreet running through our area?
Why can't they go around?
Don't worry. They're about to build\Na bridge. Haven't you heard?
A bridge! Those idiots.
The Germans claim to be intelligent.
But do you know what I think?\NI think they're totally stupid.
I have a family to feed.\NI spend half of my time here... waiting for them to let us through.
Maybe they think I come here\Nto listen to the music?
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?\N- What's wrong with you?
- Come on, do something.\N- Right. Dance!
- Dance!\N- Dance!
Come on, come on! Dance!
Very well.
What about you?\NDance with him.
Let's clear the street,\Nso the Jews can dance.
Come on. And you.
Go on.
Faster!
Come on!
Faster!
Come on!
Faster!
Come on, move! I said faster!\NCome on, Jews!
- Keep dancing.\N- Dance.
Good, they're here.
Itzak Heller has been\Nwaiting for you.
- What's this about?\N- Sit down, have tea.
I'll start lunch\Nwhen the girls get here.
- So, what are you doing here?\N- He brought cakes.
His father is back in the jewellery\Nbusiness. He's doing well.
Amazing, jewellery.
- We're recruiting.\N- Who is recruiting?
Don't be clever with me.\NI'm coming as a friend.
They're bringing Jews in\Nfrom all over the country.
Soon there will be half million people\Nin the ghetto.
- We need more Jewish police.\N- More Jewish police!
You want me to beat up Jews\Nand catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.
- Someone has got to do it.\N- But why me?
I thought you only recruited boys\Nwith rich fathers.
Look at my father, look at us...
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm\Nhere. You can have a better life.
- You want to survive selling books?\N- Yes, please.
I'm doing you people a favor.
What about you?\NYou're a great pianist.
We've got a police jazz band.\NThey'd welcome you with open arms.
- Join us. You've got no work.\N- Thank you, I've got work.
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.
Who wants me to stop?
I always say,\Nlook on the bright side.
You're in a small ghetto with\Nintellectuals, professional people.
You're better off than us. Here in\Nthe large ghetto it's a cesspool.
- You have to give me something.\N- You're an artist... you keep peoples' spirits up.\NYou do enough.
- I want to help, do something.\N- You're too well known.
And you know what? You musicians\Ndon't make good conspirators.
You're too... too musical.
- Who is that?\N- Symche.
Majorek.
There are notices going up. City is\Nto be cleansed of the undesirables.
- There's always notices going up.\N- Hello, Symche.
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.
Jehuda, working hard?
This is the greatest pianist in\NPoland. Maybe the whole world.
Wladyslaw Szpilman,\Nmeet Majorek.
- How do you do?\N- I know your name.
- I've never heard you play.\N- Majorek used to be in the Army.
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got\Nagainst him is he's not a socialist.
You better go now, Wladek.\NIt's nearly curfew.
You know how many copies\Nwe print of our newspaper?
Five hundred.
You know how many people on\Naverage read one copy? Twenty.
That makes 10 thousand readers.\NThis will start the uprising.
Majorek hides them in his underpants\Nand leaves them in toilets.
- Toilets?\N- As many toilets as I can find.
Germans never use Jewish toilets.
They're too clean for them.
Please, mister, please.
Hold it!\NYou little bastard!
Take this!
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it!
Come on, come on.\NCome on, boy.
Stand up! Stand up.
Please, tonight for once, I don't\Nwant anything bad talked about.
- Enjoy your meal.\N- Then I'll tell you something funny.
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?\N- The surgeon.
The Germans allowed him into\Nthe ghetto to perform an operation.
On a Jew? They let a Pole\Nto come in to operate on a Jew?
He got a pass, that's all I know.\NAnyway, so... he puts the patient to sleep\Nand starts the operation.
He'd just made the first incision\Nwhen the SS burst in... shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja\Nand everybody else who was there.
Isn't that a laugh?
The patient didn't feel a thing,\Nhe was anesthetized.
I said nothing bad.
What's the matter with you all?\NYou lost your sense of humor?
It's not funny.
You know what's funny? You're\Nfunny, with that ridiculous tie.
What are you talking about? What's\Nmy tie have to do with anything?
- I need this tie for my work.\N- Your work?
- That's right, I work.\N- Playing the piano for the parasites.
- Parasites...\N- Boys. Boys!
- They don't give a damn.\N- And you blame me for their apathy?
I see it everyday. They don't even\Nnotice what's going around them.
- I blame the Americans.\N- For what? For my tie?
The American Jews,\Nand there are lots of them.
What do they think they're doing?\NPeople here are dying.
Haven't got a bite to eat.
The Jewish bankers should persuade\NAmerica to declare war on Germany.
The lights! The lights!
Turn on the lights.
Come on!
Open the door!\NWe want to go in!
Open the door!
Stand up!
You, stand up! Come on!
Throw him out!
Mama...
Come on, run!
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.\N- Go in. Not you.
- What?\N- Come. It's terrible.
- What?\N- They're hunting people in the streets.
They've taken Henryk.
Go home, alright? Go home,\NI'll take care of it.
Excuse me. Have you seen\Nmy husband? Izaak Szerman?
- I'm afraid not.\N- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.
If you see him, write to me.\NDon't forget. Izaak Szerman.
What happened here?
They've got my grandson. They\Npick them up and take them away.
What they do to them,\NI've stopped believing in God.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Itzak?
Itzak?
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.
- Henryk is in there.\N- I haven't seen him.
Believe me.\NThey picked him up.
- Can you help?\N- Now you need me. Now you need me!
Can you help us?
- It costs.\N- I have no money.
Then there's nothing I can do.\NYou should have joined us.
- They told me you had influence.\N- Who told you?
People I know. They said\Nyou're an important man.
Itzak...
- Hands up.\N- How are you?
- How are you?\N- You, bandit.
Dead! Dead!
- He's crazy.\N- Hands up.
- Want a cigarette?\N- Cigarette?
Thank you.
Everything is alright!
He looks very happy.
Everything is alright.
Everything is alright.
Hands up! Hands up!
It's alright.
Help! Help!
Let go! Help!
- Why did they pick you up?\N- So you go to Itzak Heller?
- Did I ask you to talk to him?\N- You're out, aren't you?
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?\N- I asked him to help you.
What did you pay him?
With what could I pay him? Every\Nzloty I earn we spend on food.
- I can look after myself.\N- They were taking you away.
It's got nothing to do with you.\NIt's me they wanted, not you.
Why do you have to interfere\Nwith other people's business?
- You're mad. That's your trouble.\N- That's also my business.
What's the matter?\NAre you sick?
Hungry.
Employment certificate. What's that\Nmean, no employment certificate?
You have to have an\Nemployment certificate... to work for the Germans\Nin the ghetto, otherwise...
- Otherwise what?\N- You'll be deported.
- So the rumors were true.\N- They're going to resettle us... and send us to labor camps,\Nin the East.
- They're closing the small ghetto.\N- Oh, God!
Wladek? Wladek?
I thought you were on tour playing\Nin London, Paris, New York, Chicago.
- Not this week.\N- You look terrible.
Have you heard the rumors? They're\Ngoing to resettle us in the East.
Rumors! You take it all too much\Nto heart. What's the trouble?
I've been trying to get the certificate\Nof employment for my father.
I managed to get one for me and my\Nfamily, but I need one for my father.
- I've been to all the firms and shops...\N- Why didn't you come to me?
I didn't know you were\Nin the certificate business.
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Can you help?\NI have no money.
Please, don't insult us.\NCan you do something for him?
Be at the Schultz workshop\Ntomorrow, four o'clock.
See what a wonderful piece\Nof luck you've had today?
That's the historical imperative in\Naction! That's why I always say:
- "Look on the bright side!"\N- Yes, I know.
- How's your back?\N- Better.
Better?
Better not ask.
- Thank you.\N- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.
At least we got work\Nin the ghetto.
At least we are still together.
Everybody out!\NTo the courtyard!
Move, move!
We are workers. We have\Nemployment certification.
Wait.
Here.
Go over there. Hurry.
You.
You. You.
You.
You.
You.
The others, put your clothes on\Nand come back here.
Bring your things with you.\N15 kilos only.
Where are you taking us?
I'm sorry, I did my best.
- I thought the certificates'd save us.\N- Stop it, Wladek.
Let's just hope that Henryk\Nand Halina will be better off.
- Where will we be going?\N- You're going to work.
You'll be much better off than\Nin the stinking ghetto. Move.
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?\NWhy did I do it?
Why did I do it?
Don't you have a bottle of water?\NHe's dying.
My child is dying of thirst.
- I beg you.\N- I'm sorry.
- Don't you have water? I beg you.\N- Can you hear what I'm saying?
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.\N- I can hear you.
Letting them take us to our death\Nlike sheep to the slaughter.
- Not so loud.\N- Why don't we attack them?
There's half a million of us here.\NWe can break out of the ghetto.
At least we can die honorably, not\Nas a stain on the face of History.
Why are you so sure they're\Nsending us to our death?
You know why I'm not sure?\NBecause they didn't tell me.
- They're going to wipe us all out.\N- What do you want me to do? Fight?
To fight, we need organization,\Nplans, guns.
He's right. Do you think I'm going\Nto fight with my violin bowl?
The Germans would never squander\Na huge labor force like this.
They're sending us to a labor camp,\Nit's obvious.
Sure.
Look at that cripple, the old people,\Nthe children. They're going to work?
Look at you. You're going to carry\Nlogs on your back?
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!
I missed you.\NI wanted to be with you!
I wanted to be with you!
Stupid. Stupid.
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
She's getting on my nerves.
- What did she do, for God's sake?\N- She smothered her baby.
They prepared a hiding place\Nand of course they went there.
The baby cried\Njust as the police came.
She smothered the cries with\Nher hands, the baby died.
A policeman heard the death rattle\Nand found where they were hiding.
What are you reading?
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?\NIf you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
And, if you wrong us,\Nshall we not revenge?"
- Very appropriate.\N- Yes. That's why I brought it.
Idiot. What does he think\Nhe's gonna do with the money?
Boy, come here.
Come here.
- How much for a caramel?\N- 20 zlotys.
For one caramel? What do you think\Nyou're gonna do with the money?
20 zlotys.
We've got 20 between us.
I've got 10, I think.
- Halina?\N- What?
- It's a funny time to say this, but...\N- What?
I wish I knew you better.
Thank you.
Szpilman?
Papa? Papa?
Mama? Halina?
Halina? Mama?
What do you think you're doing?\NI've saved your life. Just go! Go!
Don't run!
Anna!
Anna!
Off they go to the melting pot.
- This stays.\N- Give it to me!
What are you doing?\NShe's pregnant.
Wladek?
Why are you here, Wladek?
It's like this, I...
We...
All of them, all of them.
All of them.
Perhaps they're lucky.\NThe quicker, the better.
It's not finished yet. We'll stay\Nhere for a couple of days... until things die down.
I've bribed the policeman,\Nhe'll come when it's over.
Attention!\NOn the march!
Onward!
My God, I haven't been outside in,\Nit must be two years.
Don't get overexcited.
It's gold.\NVery good price.
Someone you know?
A beauty.\NWho is she?
She's a singer. I knew her well.\NHer husband is an actor.
They're good people.\NI'd like to talk to her.
Don't forget, Wladek.\NThey hang them for helping Jews.
Turn left!
On the march!
Stop! Halt!\NAttention!
At ease.
Turn right!
Step forward.
You.
You. You.
You.
Down on the ground!
Down on the ground!
Turn left!
On the march.
How long have you been here?
Since last night.
I was pleased to see you.
They're going to start\Nthe final resettlement now.
We know what it means.
We sent someone out.\NZygmund, a good man.
His orders were to follow\Nthe trains out of Warsaw.
He got to Sokolow.
A man told him the tracks divided,\None branch's leading to Treblinka.
He said everyday freight trains\Ncarrying people from Warsaw... branch off to Treblinka\Nand return empty.
No transports of food\Nare ever seen on that line.
The civilians are forbidden\Nto approach the Treblinka station.
They're exterminating us.
It won't take them long.
We are 60 thousand left,\Nout of half a million.
Mostly young people.
And this time we're gonna fight.
We're in good shape.
Organized.\NWe're prepared.
If you need help, I...
You! Come here!
Shit!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know what I was thinking.
Take this! Take this!
Take him away.
I hope you play the piano better\Nthan you carry bricks.
He won't last long\Nif he goes on like this.
I'll see if I can get him\Nsomething better.
Trouble.
Round up only the Jews!
Round up!\NOnly the Jews.
The Polish keep working.\NOnly the Jews.
I have good news for you.
There are rumors going around\Nthat we like to... to resettle you.
I promise you that now\Nand in the future... nothing else is planned.
For this reason, we put\Ninformation posters on the wall.
To show you our goodwill... you should vote one of you\Nto be allowed... to go in town daily... and bring 3 kilos of potatoes... and one loaf of bread\Nfor each of your workers.
So, why should we do something\Nlike this if we'd resettle you?
You can make good business\Nout of the things you don't eat.
Isn't that something that you Jews\Nare good in? Making money?
Dismiss them.
That one, with the string.\NThe others, tied by wire.
Now!
Majorek.
I have a favor to ask.
I want to get out of here.
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll\Nsurvive on the other side that's hard.
I know.
Last summer, I worked for a day\Nin the Zelazna Brama Square.
I saw someone I knew,\Nshe's an old friend.
A singer, her husband\Nis an actor.
I've filled their names down and\Ntheir address, if they're still there.
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej\NBogucki. They're good people.
Would you try to make contact?
You go to town everyday. Ask them\Nif they'd help me get out of here.
Have you got any plaster?
What are you up to?
What have you got there?
We are allowed to take\Nfood to the ghetto.
Three kilos of potato and bread.
Open it.
- It's only potatoes and bread.\N- You're lying. That's not true.
Open it.
Potatoes!
You Jews are all alike.
We reach you with a finger... and you take the whole hand.
If you lie to me again,\NI'll kill you. Personally.
I've tried your friends.
- They don't live there anymore.\N- Did you make contact?
- Be ready to leave.\N- When?
- Soon.\N- Halt!
Shit! Shit!
Wait. What's going on here?
Take this! Take this!
I'll teach you some discipline,\Nyou dirty Jews.
Do you know why\Nyou're being hit?
- No.\N- Do you know why you're being hit?
- Why?\N- To celebrate New Year.
On the march!
March and sing!
Sing something nice!
Loud and clear!
Reunite tonight\NAnd follow the white eagle
Stand up and fight\NOur mortal enemies
Rise on the day\NLet's give them fire and brimstone
We'll do away\NThe Yoke of slavery
Punish and rout\NThe rapists of our nation
We'll slash them out\NTo save our dignity
Come.
I'm sorry.
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.
We haven't much time.\NCome on.
We must hurry.
Here. See if this fit.
We have to keep moving you. Germans\Nare hunting down indiscriminately.
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.
You better shave.\NUse my razor on the shelf.
You'll be looked after\Nby Gebczynski.
He's on the other side of town.
You stay there tonight,\Nthen we'll find you somewhere else.
- I'll bring you food.\N- Alright, let's go.
I'll show you where\Nyou're going to sleep.
You have to stay here\Nuntil tomorrow afternoon.
We have a flat for you near\Nthe ghetto wall. But it's safe.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
I'll be fine.
Thank you.
Here. Here. Give it to me.
Go as near to the front as possible,\Nto the German section.
DO NOT PASS
I'm going to draw the curtains now.
But you leave them open\Nduring the day. Don't forget.
Must feel better on\Nthis side of the wall, eh?
Yes.
But sometimes I'm still not sure\Nwhich side of the wall I'm on.
Some bread, potatoes, onions.
I'll come again.\NJanina will visit you twice a week.
To bring more food,\Nsee how you are.
Thank you.
This is very important.\NIn case of emergency...
I mean emergency,\Ngo to this address.
What do you mean you forgot?
What do you think I mean?\NI forgot, that's what I mean.
- You know, you treat me like dirt.\N- Because you are a dirt.
- Pig! Pig!\N- Bitch!
- Dirty pig!\N- You are a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one. Pig.
- You play like an angel.\N- Then why don't you listen?
- I'm listening.\N- Liar.
You fell asleep. Pig.
Spread out!\NWe're being attacked!
Take cover!
Shoot!
Take cover! Fire!
Come on, get out!
The attack was successful.
That building...
Turn that way!
Shoot!
Thank you.
- I wanted to come earlier, but...\N- No, thank you.
No-one thought\Nthey'd hold out so long.
I never should've come out. I should\Nhave stayed and fought with them.
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.
Just be proud of them.
- My God, did they put up a fight!\N- Yes.
- So did the Germans.\N- They are in shock!
They didn't expect it. Nobody\Nexpected it. Jews fighting back.
- Who would have thought?\N- What good did it do?
What good?
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.
They died with dignity.\NAnd you know something else?
Now the Poles will rise.\NWe are ready.
We'll fight too.\NYou'll see.
Get your things together.\NYou have to leave.
What? What's happened?
- I'm on the run.\N- What's happened?
The Gestapo found our weapons.\NThey've arrested Janina and Andrzej.
They're bound to find out about this\Nplace too. You must get away at once.
Where do you want me to go?
Look at me, I'm not leaving.
- Can I take my chances here?\N- That's your decision.
But when they storm the flat,\Nthrow yourself out the window... don't let them get you alive.
I have poison on me.\NThey won't get me alive either.
Open up!
Open the door\Nor we'll call the police!
Are you from this flat?\NYou're not registered.
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just\Ncame to visit, but I missed him.
Have you got your identity card?
- Let me see your identity card.\N- Yes, of course.
- I want to see your identity card!\N- What's happening?
He's a Jew! A Jew!
Stop the Jew!
Don't let him out!\NStop him!
- Yes?\N- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.\N- Dorota.
Come in.
I'm sorry.
I was given this address and\NI'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.
Come in.
Sit.
I need help.
He'll be back before curfew.
I've been in hiding.
- I need somewhere to stay.\N- He'll be here soon.
- How long have you been married?\N- Just over a year.
And how is Jurek?
Dead.
- When is your baby due?\N- Christmas.
This is not a good time to\Nhave children, but then...
This is my husband.\NWladyslaw Szpilman.
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.\N- Yes, I remember.
He said to contact you\Nonly in case of emergency.
Don't worry now.
We can't move you tonight.\NYou'll sleep on the sofa.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry,\Ncould I have a piece of bread?
Yes, of course.\NWe will eat.
Sit. Please, sit.
Thank you.
You're on a very German area.
On the opposite is a hospital taking\Nwounded from the Russian front.
And next door is the\NSchutzpolizei.
Safest place to be.
Right at the heart\Nof the lion's den.
I'll be locking you in.
No-one knows you're here,\Nso keep as quiet as possible.
All well?
Thank you.
This is Antek Szalas.\NHe'll be looking after you.
- How do you do?\N- How do you do?
Thank you.
I've given him a second key. He'll\Nbring food, see that you're alright.
He's with the underground,\Nhe's a good man.
- You don't remember me?\N- I don't think so.
Warsaw Radio.\NI was a technician.
I saw you almost everyday.
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.\N- It doesn't matter.
You've nothing to worry about.\NI'll visit often.
You'll be pleased to hear that\Nthe Allies are bombing Germany... night after night,\Nafter night.
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.
And the Russians are giving them\Nhell. It's the beginning of the end.
Let's hope so.
Come here.
Be careful with it.
That's it. Be careful.
Still alive then?
Here. Sausage, bread.
You still got that vodka?
- How long is this meant to last?\N- Not long now.
I think I've got jaundice.
Don't worry about that.\NIt just makes you look funny.
My grandfather was jilted by\Nhis girlfriend when he got jaundice.
Drink up.
Why didn't you come sooner?\NIt's been over two weeks...
Problems.
Money.
I've got to raise money\Nto buy the food.
I need things to sell,\Nit's not easy.
Here. Sell this.
Food is more important than time.
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!\NThe Allies have landed in France.
Russians will be here soon.
They'll beat the shit\Nout of the Germans... any day now.
Wladek?
I knew it.\NI knew this would happen.
- I'll get a doctor.\N- You can't. It's too dangerous.
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.\N- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.
- He's still a doctor.\N- No.
You stay. I'll go.
We came to say goodbye.
We're going to stay\Nwith my mother in Otwocks.
The baby is already there.\NIt's safer.
There's talk that the uprising\Nwill begin any day now.
That man Szalas should be shot.
He's been collecting money\Non your behalf all over Warsaw.
Apparently people gave generously,\Nso he collected a tidy sum.
My God.
The liver the size of a football.\NInflammation of the gall bladder... but he'll leave.
I'll try to get him some laevulose,\Nbut it's not easy.
- Can you visit him again?\N- Who knows.
- Doctor, thank you.\N- Don't speak, rest.
Thank you so much for coming.
We've brought you some food.
I'll prepare something now\Nfor you, then we must go.
I'll throw a grenade!
There's a wounded man over there!
Come.
Watch out! Watch out!
- I'll go get help!\N- Hurry!
Come on! Bring the litter!
Go back inside!
Get out, get out in the streets!
Get out now! The Germans\Nhave surrounded the building!
Somebody...\NSomebody help me!
Are you alright?\NThere's too much dust.
I'll check this side.\NDon't worry.
Be careful!
- Heinrich?\N- I'm checking!
Is there anybody here?
- Come on down!\N- Alright, I'm coming.
Come on, pile them up.
Throw it.
We have to mark everything.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
Who are you?
- Do you understand?\N- Yes.
What are you doing?
I was... trying to open this can.
Do you live here?
Do you work here?
No.
What do you do for a living?
I am...
I was a pianist.
Pianist?
Come.
Play something.
Are you hiding here?
Jew?
Where are you hiding yourself?
In the attic.
Show it to me.
Have you got anything to eat?
According to them,\Nit's very important that...
Attention!
- At ease.\N- At ease.
Jew?
Please.
What does it mean,\Nall that shooting?
The Russians,\Non the other side of the river.
You just have to hold on\Na couple of weeks, not more.
- What's going on?\N- We're leaving.
- Are the Russians here?\N- Not yet.
I don't know how to thank you.
Thank God, not me.
He wants us to survive. At least,\Nwe have to believe in that.
Here. Take it.
- And you?\N- I have another one. Warmer.
What are you going to do\Nwhen this is over?
I'll play piano again at\Nthe Polish radio station.
Tell me your name.
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.
Szpilman.
Perfect name for a pianist.
German! German!
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!
I'm Polish!
- Come out with your hands up!\N- Please! I beg of you!
Don't shoot, don't shoot.\NI beg you, I'm a Polish.
Come down!
Please, I'm Polish.\NPlease.
He's Polish.
Yes, he's Polish.
Why the fucking coat?
I'm cold.
Look at them.\NGerman fuckers!
Murderers! Murderers!
- Dirty bastards!\N- Assassins!
- Bastards!\N- Look at you now!
You took everything I had.\NMe, a musician.
You took my violin,\Nyou took my soul.
Musician?
Are you a musician?
Do you know... a pianist called Szpilman,\Nfrom the Polish radio station?
- Of course I know him.\N- I helped him to hide himself.
Tell him I'm here.
Ask him to help me.
- What's your name?\N- Hosenfeld.
What?
It was here, I'm certain of it.
Well, it's not here now.
I shouted, abused them. I'm not\Nproud of it, but that's what I did.
I stood where you are now.
There was a barbed wire\Nand this German came up to me.
- You didn't catch his name?\N- No.
I'll ask at the factory.\NThey may know something.
{2817}{2905}Housewives are showing|the enemy what they're made of.

{4237}{4301}Their raid|on the Western lsles of Norway

{5156}{5298}One mistake or miscalculation|and the results can be catastrophic.
{5370}{5419}Let me tell you a story.
{5436}{5503}I was sitting in a shell hole,|surrounded by the enemy,
{5508}{5570}with not much left|of the chap on my right.
{5575}{5630}The chap to the left|was no better off.
{5635}{5733}Sitting beside me was a young soldier|screaming in agony.
{5755}{5838}Never seen anything like it,|rocking like a child,
{5843}{5923}clutching his head,|calling for his mother.
{5959}{6009}Believe me, gentlemen,
{6014}{6089}toothache in the field is no joke.
{6115}{6164}Know what I did?
{6169}{6265}I made a stopper out of some brackish|mud, a shell case from my 38
{6270}{6319}and a clove of garlic.
{6324}{6398}The chap was back in action|in under two minutes
{6403}{6484}and the enemy ran like buggery|when they smelt him coming.

{7604}{7668}So let's not waste any time, alright.
{7673}{7772}An army marches|on its stomach, Cuthbertson
{7777}{7851}and an army that can't bite|is an army that can't fight.

{44890}{44989}The station master thinks|they took the train to Plymouth.
{44994}{45010}Hmm... Plymouth.
{45048}{45099}Tell me,|what kind of spirits was he in?
{45104}{45170}Fine and dandy, sir.|First class soldier, sir.
{45175}{45182}- Yes, quite and off the record?|- Barking mad, sir.
{45362}{45394}It's not a problem.
{45416}{45423}No.
{45470}{45577}We'll wait until the tide is back|in and we'll give it another go.
{45821}{45870}It's a good thing we got the room.
{46118}{46125}KNOCKlNG
{46434}{46491}Mum says,|'How do you like your pilchards?'
{46622}{46684}WlRELESS: We've had|a lot of letters from listeners
{46689}{46738}who advise cooking with steamers.
{46743}{46830}- Two pints of stout, Brenda.|- Be with you in a minute.
{46860}{46884}More potatoes, Private?
{46954}{46995}I'm fine thanks, Mrs Fraser.
{47008}{47093}Are you sure the Colonel|doesn't want something on a tray?
{47098}{47139}He says he's not hungry.
{48012}{48019}Better?
{48066}{48073}Much.
{48154}{48203}You smell like a damp dog.
{48208}{48276}I'm sorry about that.|I fell in the harbour.
{48281}{48322}It's alright. I like dogs.
{48375}{48424}What were you doing in the harbour?
{48429}{48486}I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
{48554}{48620}You could be anyone.|You could be a spy.
{48646}{48703}That's right, I could.
{48747}{48796}Walls have ears, don't they?
{48856}{48915}That's right they do.
{48996}{49076}Is it very... dangerous what you do?
{49082}{49106}Oh, yes, very.
{49150}{49215}Are you going|somewhere dangerous now?
{49221}{49228}Yeah.
{49275}{49341}You will be careful,|won't you, Leslie?
{49346}{49378}Of course I will.
{49428}{49452}I'll be fine.
{49484}{49537}WlRELESS: British Commandos|have seriously damaged
{49542}{49607}the submarine pens and dry docks.
{49613}{49701}It will be months before|St Nazaire is operational again.
{49706}{49747}Did he say St Nazaire?
{49824}{49890}- I'm not interested.|- It's not my fault.
{49896}{50012}It will be high tide soon.|Get out of here, get a boat and go.
{50069}{50143}We'll sleep during|the day and travel by night.
{50148}{50245}The whole place will be crawling|with men and machinery. Move!
{50250}{50307}There's a war on|or had you forgotten?
{50321}{50328}(MUTTERS) Travel by night...|Crawling with men and machinery.
{50674}{50706}Leslie! What are doing?
{50728}{50785}Oh, for Christ's sake,|get her sorted out.
{50988}{51046}What are you doing?|You can't do that.
{51052}{51133}It's a secret mission.|You can't tell anyone.
{51138}{51215}I'll have to tell Erin.|It's his boat.
{51220}{51285}- We told him already.|- Cuthbertson!
{51290}{51365}I've got to go. I'm sorry.
{51506}{51544}Sorry.
{52265}{52306}Take care of yourself, Leslie.
{53969}{54042}- Morning, ladies.|- Morning, Arthur.
{54048}{54055}- How's the allotment?|- Potatoes are coming on well.
{54172}{54277}- How are the Garden Room Girls?|- Morning, Major.
{54299}{54306}- Morning, Arthur.|- Morning, sir.
{54366}{54465}What has our Prime Minister received|today from the great unwashed?
{54470}{54527}Nothing for the PM's eyes yet,|Major Merton.
{54553}{54616}Anything good|in the 'potty pile', Daphne?
{54621}{54720}Eight death threats, three requests|to open air raid shelters,
{54725}{54789}seven and six in postal orders and...
{54835}{54905}a cigar... probably poisoned.
{54927}{54959}God bless the lunatics.
{54981}{55080}Do you know that without them,|this war could be quite serious.
{55284}{55336}Were you ever married, Sergeant?
{55342}{55387}What would I do that for?
{55392}{55434}Did you ever ask anyone?
{55440}{55534}- Why do you want to know?|- I'm only interested.
{55540}{55547}Sorry.
{55677}{55684}Gladys.
{55731}{55860}Nurse Gladys Potter.|Stitched up my leg.
{55866}{55890}Field Hospital, Passchendaele.
{55962}{56040}Tucked me in of a night.|Plumped up my pillow. I asked her.
{56045}{56052}- Really?|- Really.
{56167}{56204}Do you want a bun?
{56209}{56216}- They're a bit stale.|- No thank you.
{56456}{56522}So what did she say then,|this Gladys?
{56528}{56602}She said she spent too much|of her life mending people,
{56607}{56687}to spend the rest of it with someone|who smashed them up!
{56717}{56768}That wasn't very nice of her.
{56773}{56814}She did me a favour.
{56958}{56974}PHONE RlNGS
{57248}{57289}Morning, Faith. Is he in?
{57342}{57391}He hasn't left, Major.
{57397}{57438}It's chucking it down outside.
{57464}{57521}Outside... Remind me again,|where is that exactly?
{57581}{57638}What is this?|This ought to be upstairs.
{57692}{57751}He's been on one of his wanderings.
{57757}{57836}< Don't come back|until you have something.
{58022}{58080}It's not been a good morning.
{58086}{58142}Rommel advancing,|Tobruk falling,
{58147}{58196}and it's not even 10 o'clock.
{58222}{58254}Merton, get in here.
{58335}{58386}Faith, you look terrible,|get some sleep.
{58906}{58970}- I can't see a sodding thing.|- Shush.
{58976}{58992}Keep looking.
{59171}{59220}Do they always shoot deserters?
{59226}{59250}We're not deserters.
{59280}{59337}We know that but do they, Sergeant?
{59410}{59417}- Do you think he's got it?|- Has who got what?
{59491}{59545}Has the Prime Minister|got the letter?
{59550}{59582}Of course he has.
{60574}{60634}- Serg, I wasn't asleep-|- Shush.
{60656}{60663}Listen.
{60810}{60817}RUMBLlNG
{60916}{60932}What's that?
{61054}{61070}What's that?
{62069}{62126}I'm so bored of powdered egg.
{62131}{62172}It gives me frightful dreams.
{62187}{62261}Yes, but we all have to do our bit.
{62282}{62314}Any word from Ken?
{62336}{62402}Still on convoys... as far as I know.
{62426}{62500}You know what they say,|'no news is good news'.
{62610}{62659}Are these soldiers' pay books?
{63242}{63283}How much further?
{63288}{63320}Two or three hours.
{63587}{63632}Bloody hell!
{63795}{63819}Take the controls.
{63876}{63920}Keep your head down.
{65264}{65314}We need to find a landmark.
{65385}{65434}DlSTANT VOlCES
{65532}{65564}What the hell's that?
{65634}{65666}It's just some women.
{65733}{65740}- They're going on about a recipe.|- What did you say?
{65841}{65932}Down there somewhere, sir, some|women are going on about a recipe.
{66075}{66082}- What?|- Speak French do you?
{66173}{66222}No, they're speaking English.
{66356}{66363}- Bugger!|- Welcome home, Private.
{66487}{66519}How could that happen?
{66541}{66620}We would have known|if we were going round in circles?
{66625}{66699}At least Mohammed|found the right sodding mountain!
{66816}{66908}At least we tried. Most people|would have given up at Cornwall!
{66913}{66945}This is bleedin' Cornwall!
{67034}{67075}We'll be a laughing stock.
{67108}{67149}We can explain, can't we?
{67185}{67226}We'll have to explain alright.
{67245}{67269}Bloody court martial.
{67322}{67363}I don't mind dying, Cuthbertson...
{67403}{67410}..but I won't be humiliated.
{67519}{67560}What a complete bloody fiasco.
{67586}{67677}We've still got the boat.|I don't mind giving it another go.
{67709}{67775}Do you want to give it another go?
{68044}{68097}WlRELESS: Then, there's half a leek,|one teaspoon...
{68169}{68218}WlRELESS: Have you got that?
{68223}{68311}WlRELESS: Half a leek,|one teaspoon of mixed herbs
{68316}{68402}and a teaspoonful of salt|and then there's two ounces...
{68407}{68414}Psssst!
{68461}{68468}Psssst!
{68584}{68648}Ah! Sergeant?
{68794}{68826}Was that you, Sergeant?
{69000}{69032}What are you doing?
{69072}{69096}There's a German!
{69126}{69217}There's a German!|There's a sodding German!
{69222}{69271}# FLANAGAN & ALLEN: Run Rabbit|Run
{69276}{69313}# Run run run
{69318}{69404}# Run rabbit run rabbit|Run run run
{69409}{69458}Shall we go back and kill him?
{69463}{69562}I haven't come all this way|to shoot a Kraut who likes cooking!
{69608}{69657}He's probably gone by now anyway.
{69700}{69757}At least we're here,|that's the main thing.
{69891}{69940}Open wide, Adolf!|the dentists are coming!
{69972}{69988}Cuthbertson! >
{70026}{70042}Sorry, Sergeant.
{70080}{70189}# So run rabbit|Run run run. #
{70234}{70316}You don't have to tell me|if you don't want to.
{70354}{70403}If you must know...
{70408}{70520}..it's cold, wet with more rats|than you can shake a stick at.
{70544}{70551}Blimey.
{70598}{70739}For 28 days you were bored to tears|and then on the 29th - boof!
{70744}{70839}The sky lit up, you got your head|down, ran like the clappers
{70844}{70928}and hoped some other|poor bastard got it, not you.
{70933}{70965}Now, go to sleep.
{71047}{71104}Didn't you save the life|of a General?
{71118}{71167}Oh, yes...
{71192}{71241}General Sir William Hyde.
{71246}{71301}I was his driver.
{71306}{71313}- What happened?|- Nothing.
{71364}{71388}Go to sleep.
{71512}{71561}My dad was in the trenches.
{71619}{71635}At Amiens.
{71698}{71797}He was one of the lucky ones,|he came home in one piece.
{72020}{72052}What are you doing?
{72095}{72111}Tapping. Sorry.
{72149}{72215}- It's a habit when I'm nervous.|- Well, stop it.
{72396}{72412}Did he...
{72480}{72579}..say much, your dad...|about the trenches?
{72595}{72637}- My dad?|- Yeah.
{72708}{72757}I thought you wanted to go to sleep?
{72762}{72811}I do...
{72822}{72885}..but I'd rather you talked|than tapped.
{72979}{72995}Not much.
{73033}{73157}He was killed by a tram when I was|three so I never really knew him.
{73189}{73255}He was just a face|at my bedroom door.
{73385}{73476}My mum always showed me pictures|and I do think about him.
{73612}{73669}He tells me off in my head.
{73692}{73716}Not always though.
{73768}{73809}Sometimes I make him laugh.
{73937}{73984}Can I ask you something?
{73990}{74006}What now?
{74167}{74208}Why did you choose me?
{74237}{74311}Who else would be daft enough|to carry the grenades?
{74641}{74673}He would like this.
{74731}{74772}It would make him smile.
{75246}{75314}- Can you reach it?|- I would if you stood still.
{75351}{75396}Here.
{75460}{75517}Here. You do it.
{75548}{75603}- It was your idea.|- Really? Thanks.
{75891}{75965}Bloody hell?|How many of those buns did you eat?
{76013}{76071}- How many shall I cut?|- Cut them all.
{76085}{76134}Keep your voice down.
{76298}{76347}It's a lot harder than you think.
{76377}{76419}Did you see that?
{76424}{76537}You could have your eye out with|one of those. I've got a good idea.
{76543}{76641}We'll make a list of the things we do|and then keep it as proof.
{76758}{76840}We could tot up the damage.|How much are these lines worth?
{76845}{76889}Five quid each?
{76895}{77020}Well, that's one, two, three...|.. that's 25 quid the lot.
{77025}{77074}< Depends what's on the other end.
{77133}{77177}That's a point.
{77183}{77299}So, supposing these go to like,|the hospital or the Resistance even?
{77304}{77353}Just suppose you get on with it.
{77471}{77575}Still, 25 quid is 25 quid, isn't it?
{77771}{77836}Well, it's not actually,|it's only Â¡Ãª20.
{77855}{77903}What do you mean?
{77908}{77947}- I left one.|- What for?
{77971}{78020}In case of emergencies.
{78241}{78296}- How much does cement cost?|- What?
{78322}{78384}If we were blowing up|a gun emplacement...
{78389}{78450}I was trying to work out|how much it's worth.
{78455}{78516}- What for?|- Well...
{78521}{78628}We put the damages on the left|and what it's worth on the right.
{78633}{78682}Are you a bloody accountant now?
{78688}{78830}No, listen. I had a mate who bought|a Riley Roadster before the war.
{78835}{78948}He polished it every Sunday, but the|birds kept crapping on the bonnet.
{78953}{79008}So, what he did was,|he bought a garage.
{79015}{79109}The only problem is he reckons|the garage cost more than the car.
{79114}{79165}Has this got a point, Private?
{79170}{79223}Yeah, yeah, the point is,
{79228}{79350}I reckon that two garages costs|the same as one gun emplacement.
{79418}{79462}Sergeant?
{79467}{79511}To put it another way,
{79516}{79605}one gun emplacement costs the same|as three Riley Roadsters.
{79626}{79691}You've got a head|like a toy box, Cuthbertson.
{79783}{79827}When are we going to eat?
{79833}{79907}Hello? Hello? Hang on, sir.
{79913}{79962}Africa,|that's where we stand or fall.
{79967}{80014}He's on the line now.
{80019}{80062}About time. Put him through.
{80067}{80183}I want answers yesterday, Merton.|Lose Africa and we lose the Med.
{80214}{80313}Hello? No-one here, Faith.
{80319}{80366}One moment, Prime Minister.
{80372}{80454}< He's on line three, Prime Minister.
{80471}{80543}Hello, Monty.|How are you, old cocker?
{80561}{80631}Jolly good.|Now tell me something, General...
{80649}{80720}..what do your knees|look like in shorts?
{80852}{80926}'Sleep during the day,|travel by night', you said. >
{80931}{81013}That's alright.|So far, it hasn't been necessary.
{81070}{81119}'Crawling with men and machinery'.
{81148}{81247}Thanks, Private. All we need do|is find a road or a signpost.
{81264}{81344}To where? There's nothing to do.
{81368}{81482}It's not a problem. There will be|plenty to do when we get there.
{81487}{81526}< Get where?
{81557}{81625}There's no-one around,|the whole place is shut.
{81693}{81761}Hello? Anyone?
{81766}{81827}We're here! We've invaded!
{81832}{81871}Shut up!
{81941}{82021}- I'm starving.|- I'm Sergeant King, how do you do?
{82026}{82129}Well, maybe we could get|something to eat or something.
{82134}{82241}- Maybe we could steal a car.|- Oh, yes. Good idea (! )
{82246}{82367}Which one of the many fine vehicles|would you care to requisition?
{82519}{82657}First rule of survival behind|enemy lines: live off the land.
{83047}{83091}Oh, I'm sorry. Oh...
{83107}{83146}I-l-I'm English.
{83167}{83225}Er... English?
{83543}{83582}Bloody hell!
{83752}{83842}I'm really sorry. I-l-I'm just|so hungry. I-l-I'll put it back.
{83868}{83911}Look, see?
{84260}{84305}Emportez-le.
{84328}{84377}Emballez-le, emportez-le, allez-y.
{84525}{84571}Emportez-le, allez-y.
{84638}{84678}Wrap it?
{84684}{84738}Er, do you,|do you want me to wrap it?
{85073}{85115}Can I go now?
{85334}{85426}Thank you. Thanks very much.
{85431}{85463}Attendez.
{85590}{85632}Vivement la liberation!
{86098}{86148}I was only getting some food.
{86184}{86239}I don't know what the problem is.
{86244}{86300}You said get some food and I did.
{86305}{86354}Anyone could have been in there.
{86359}{86418}The whole Third Reich|could have been in there.
{86423}{86472}- We should be so lucky.|- What?
{86510}{86616}- Can we eat the pie now?|- Don't you get lippy with me, son!
{86621}{86680}I'll knock|the living daylights out of you.
{86685}{86772}- Can we eat the pie now?|- You've jeopardised this operation.
{86777}{86833}You've been like|a kid on a school outing,
{86838}{86902}buying buns, waving stockings about,
{86907}{86963}cosying up to your|little Cornish pasty.
{86968}{87046}Then when I send you|to get some food, what do I find?
{87051}{87168}You canoodling up to some French|tart, practically slipping her one.
{87173}{87212}- Piss off.|- Eh?
{87257}{87306}- Piss off!|- Don't tell me to piss off.
{87311}{87335}No!
{87366}{87412}Everything you've asked, I've done.
{87418}{87480}Every order you've given,|I've followed.
{87500}{87551}Where has it got us? Nowhere.
{87576}{87623}Now, I'm a deserter.
{87628}{87679}I've nearly been drowned.
{87684}{87737}I'm tired and I'm hungry.
{87759}{87832}Whether you like it or not,|I'm going to eat this pie.
{87977}{88026}I can't believe you've done that.
{88155}{88217}No, I take that back.
{88235}{88279}I can believe it.
{88304}{88343}Look at you.
{88372}{88427}You know why|you're called the Kaiser?
{88454}{88544}You're a jumped-up, washed-up,|over the hill has-been.
{88549}{88586}- Finished?|- No!
{88634}{88673}You know what?
{88678}{88778}Back home, you command about|as much respect as a fly on dog shit!
{88783}{88857}Smart-arsed little turd!|I gave you a chance.
{88862}{88963}Nobody else would be stupid enough|to give you a gun, but I did.
{88968}{89073}I thought you had guts, but the only|thing you're good at is whingeing.
{89079}{89182}It's a good thing|your dad died when he did,
{89187}{89254}so he never saw|the whining tosspot
{89260}{89317}that his son had become.
{90555}{90617}Can you see anything?
{90654}{90720}- Nothing.|- A sign or something?
{90762}{90856}- No.|- We've got to find out where we are.
{91322}{91366}I'll see what I can find.
{91500}{91573}I didn't mean...
{91597}{91646}..what I said about your dad.
{91738}{91782}I'll stand guard then.
{91860}{91892}Sergeant...
{91897}{91958}They don't all call you the Kaiser.
{91963}{92012}Yes. You stand guard.
{92074}{92118}(WHlSPERS) Yes, Sergeant.
{92200}{92244}(WHlSPERS) Yes, Sergeant.
{94281}{94330}BUZZER
{94689}{94738}(MlMES) Kill him.
{95105}{95157}I-l-I'm sorry, Sergeant.
{95162}{95211}I missed him. He just got past me.
{95434}{95468}It's a train.
{95550}{95605}- It's stopping.|- It's waiting for the signal.
{95611}{95650}Well, which one is it?
{95756}{95800}Must be one of these.
{96138}{96191}It's full of bloody Germans!
{96218}{96258}Heh! Was ist hier los?
{96406}{96450}Warum mussten wir anhalten?
{96921}{96961}Ist jemand zu Hause?
{97121}{97162}They're on their way up!
{97219}{97273}There's got to be a lock.
{97277}{97338}- Wir haben nicht viel Zeit.|- Sonst kommen wir nie nach Brest.
{97370}{97394}Now try.
{97544}{97588}In Ordnung, kommt wieder runter!
{97941}{98014}Danke.|Naechstes Mal 'n bisschen schneller.
{98880}{98912}Supplies.
{98979}{99065}What shall we do with him?|He'll tell someone he has seen us.
{99238}{99288}Drunk in charge of a signal box.
{99300}{99349}They won't believe a word he says.
{100102}{100126}Mind the string.
{100197}{100276}How much do you reckon a|railway line's worth? About 70 quid?
{100281}{100354}- More.|- Â¡Ãª80.
{100370}{100414}Put that away.
{100498}{100542}Ready?
{100670}{100708}RUMBLlNG
{100713}{100783}- What was that?|- What's wrong?
{100807}{100862}(WHlSPERS) I think I heard something.
{101012}{101069}Nah, it was nothing.
{101346}{101390}- Bloody hell!|- Gordon Bennett!
{101501}{101563}I think I've gone deaf. Have you?
{101637}{101686}Looks buckled to me.
{101692}{101736}Does it look buckled to you?
{101765}{101814}Yeah, definitely.
{101841}{101890}Loose as old knickers that is.
{101920}{101966}I wouldn't fancy travelling on it.
{101972}{102019}One grenade in the right place.
{102063}{102112}- Just like you said.|- Come on.
{102425}{102516}# Whether the weather|may be wet or fine
{102521}{102606}# We'll just rub along without a care
{102626}{102737}# We're gonna to hang out|the washing on the Siegfried line
{102743}{102827}# If that Siegfried line's|still there. #
{102873}{102922}Let's find out where we are.
{102949}{102993}You've got the matches.
{103095}{103169}- Is that cheese off?|- Nah, it's French.
{103195}{103244}Do you want some?
{103250}{103351}No, I want you to strike a match|so I can see what I'm doing.
{103488}{103537}Closer. That's better.
{103583}{103657}Now then,|there's the railway line so we're...
{103726}{103775}- Lancasters.|- Lucky buggers.
{103796}{103844}Hold it still.
{103849}{103921}Sitting down to|bacon and eggs in half an hour.
{103926}{103965}You and your belly.
{104049}{104108}SlREN BLARES
{104791}{104871}- Oh, you're still here?|- So are you.
{104921}{104995}- We're all still here.|- Faith, you look terrible.
{105000}{105053}- Is he still here?|- No.
{105058}{105154}He's meeting with the Joint Chiefs.|A chance to make a break for it.
{105160}{105204}Oh, good luck.
{105210}{105276}- Thanks.|- More light reading for you.
{105282}{105326}Sorry about the cigar ash.
{105332}{105386}He was on one|of his nocturnals again.
{105392}{105437}This belongs up here, I think.
{105465}{105514}How are we supposed to run a war
{105519}{105576}when the Prime Minister|keeps interfering.
{105581}{105625}Nobody listens! >
{105680}{105729}Why won't the buggers listen?
{105751}{105799}Faith.
{105805}{105875}Oh, bad luck, Faith.|10 feet short of the wire.
{106096}{106189}- (WHlSPERS) They look like teacups.|- (WHlSPERS) Bloody big teacups.
{106229}{106266}What do you think?
{106271}{106317}Nah. Too risky.
{106377}{106437}- What's that fly swat thing?|- Fly swat?
{106458}{106551}Looks like an aerial.|Some sort of listening device.
{106573}{106623}That must be worth a fortune.
{106629}{106698}Come on.|We wouldn't make it to the fence.
{106719}{106754}Move.
{106759}{106809}Well, it's just over there.
{106814}{106912}Come on,|it's crawling with bleedin' Germans.
{106918}{107004}Of course it's crawling|with Germans, that's why we came.
{107067}{107116}I don't believe this.
{107140}{107222}You were going to blow up|the Scharnhorst with one grenade.
{107227}{107286}Destroy St Nazaire single-handed.
{107315}{107413}We find one piddly observation|post and you say it's too risky.
{107418}{107461}Keep your voice down!
{107466}{107515}One hand grenade, you said.
{107540}{107591}We've got a bag of the bastards.
{107650}{107705}Well, if you won't, I will.
{107710}{107773}You wouldn't last five minutes.
{107805}{107854}I'll be out in four then.
{108535}{108582}Once it's dark and I'm inside...
{108606}{108667}..I'll attach some grenades|to the fly swat,
{108684}{108770}move to the ops room with the|remaining grenades, then up it goes.
{108776}{108836}- Wait. Where am l?|- You're that pebble there.
{108841}{108914}- What pebble?|- By the fence, where we cut through.
{108919}{108980}- What am I doing there?|- Standing guard.
{108985}{109028}I don't want to stand guard!
{109034}{109099}I didn't come here to stand guard.
{109104}{109196}- I am giving you an order.|- Well, I'm disobeying it.
{109201}{109281}I'm younger and I'm faster|and I want to blow up the fly swat.
{109286}{109386}You can't! Whoever goes|in there is going to die!
{109392}{109453}Then what's the point|in standing guard?
{109537}{109591}Here. Take the grenades.
{109638}{109701}- Blow your arse off.|- You and your medal.
{109706}{109777}- It's not that.|- You can't stop being a hero.
{109782}{109843}- I wasn't a hero.|- Don't give me that tosh.
{109848}{109890}< It's not tosh.
{109896}{109951}I changed a tyre, that's all I did.
{110022}{110066}What? I don't understand.
{110100}{110207}The General was in the back seat.|A bombardment went up.
{110213}{110299}A piece of shrapnel caught|the front tyre and we got a puncture.
{110304}{110346}And?
{110351}{110435}General Sir William Hyde|told me to get out and change it.
{110440}{110528}A shell exploded to the right of us,|the jack slipped,
{110533}{110581}the car fell on my foot.
{110586}{110654}I drove some 10 miles|with a smashed heel.
{110719}{110773}So you were decorated|for changing a tyre?
{110778}{110818}Yes, I know,
{110824}{110884}RAC patrol men do it every day.
{110946}{110998}Can we get on|with the weapons check?
{111068}{111112}Two revolvers...
{111128}{111186}..and twenty rounds.
{111210}{111253}Grenades?
{111259}{111347}Five in the bag|and five in the nylons.
{111381}{111451}- Did you see any more action?|- I didn't.
{111456}{111539}I was invalidated out|and joined the Medical Corps.
{111588}{111679}So you haven't done|anything like this before.
{111739}{111788}Well, I hate to say this, Sergeant...
{111793}{111848}..but I wish you hadn't told me that.
{111867}{111922}It's fine. It's not a problem.
{112021}{112064}Four for the fly swat
{112069}{112168}and the rest for the ops room|and no-one stands guard. Agreed?
{112280}{112317}Agreed.
{112361}{112428}Hope you've got a handbag|to go with them stockings?
{114116}{114166}- Alright?|- Yeah.
{114171}{114215}Through you go.
{115220}{115260}Wait!
{115286}{115350}Cuthbertson. Mirror.
{115757}{115797}Right.
{115814}{115919}(SNlFFS) I can smell beef...|and onions.
{116484}{116535}Kaiser, komm her.
{116541}{116622}Komm her, du bloder Koter.|Komm her!
{116657}{116726}Was denkst du, was du da machst, hm?
{116732}{116771}Komm her.
{116805}{116844}Dummer Hund.
{116869}{116902}Komm!
{116907}{116941}Bei Fuss.
{117527}{117613}When you're ready, blow the bastard.|I'll be in position.
{118790}{118839}..drei Briefe gehabt letzte Woche...
{118844}{118885}- Drei?|- Ja.

{125103}{125145}Pack it in!
{125205}{125283}Sergeant Mohammed,|it's Private Mountain.
{125409}{125451}What kept you?
{126564}{126624}- We did well.|- Keep your eyes on the road.
{126669}{126755}- You driven one of these before?|- It's not a problem.
{127129}{127191}We couldn't have done|all that, could we?
{127197}{127259}Let's get the hell out of here!
{128334}{128382}Leslie!
{128480}{128550}Sorry to trouble you. I'm looking|for a Miss Emma Fraser.
{128641}{128758}Now, Africa is the absolute priority.
{128793}{128856}What the hell|did I do with that thing?
{128861}{128949}I want to know everything|that is going on out there.
{128970}{129051}When I say everything,|I mean everything.
{129056}{129125}I don't want a camel|to so much as break wind
{129130}{129184}without it ending up on my desk.
{129190}{129229}Here it is.
{129238}{129280}There, no it isn't.
{129306}{129356}What the hell is this?
{129410}{129442}Not funny.
{129447}{129565}Now, I don't want another shambles|like Singapore, gentlemen.
{129581}{129642}ENGlNE FALTERS
{129734}{129783}Hold up.
{129902}{129947}We're out of petrol.
{130163}{130216}Cop hold of that oar, Cuthbertson.
{130248}{130292}The oar?
{130722}{130808}- Are we going to row?!|- No, we're going to knit a jumper.
{130843}{130933}It'll give you an appetite.|One, two, three.
{131879}{131938}He's depressed.|He won't get out of his cot.
{131943}{132042}- Have you tried Clemmie?|- She's dining with the Archbishop.
{132091}{132143}He's an old man, he needs a holiday.
{132148}{132197}Failing that, a victory.
{132210}{132296}Anything. Something to lift|his spirits. Good luck.
{132358}{132402}- Whose turn is it?|- Yours.
{132419}{132488}- I sat with him last night-|- Reading Kipling.
{132546}{132610}- Why don't you go home, Faith?|- Yes, I know...
{132629}{132678}I look terrible.
{133068}{133120}I promised the King victory, Merton.
{133192}{133241}Gave my word to the country.
{133336}{133385}I don't know if I can do it.
{133418}{133474}Well, would you like a whisky, sir?
{133520}{133569}No, Merton, I don't want a whisky.
{133626}{133675}I want a wander.
{133808}{133889}I don't know if this rabbit|is going to come out of the hat.
{134106}{134164}Cuthbertson...
{134170}{134219}..we've got company.
{134262}{134311}< Come on.
{134581}{134635}It's bloody following us!
{134769}{134827}Throw something!
{135402}{135498}- I bet it's one of ours.|- It can't be one of ours!
{135504}{135528}That's not fair.
{135558}{135617}Not after what we've done!
{135764}{135813}Come on! Blow, you sod!
{136297}{136336}Wie heissen Sie?
{136439}{136481}Sergeant King.
{136521}{136580}- Was tun Sie hier?|- I don't speak German.
{136586}{136644}- Was tun Sie hier?|- Sergeant King.
{137011}{137060}Private Cuthbertson.
{137116}{137165}We're dentists.
{137363}{137426}- Have we got the girl?|- She's on her way.
{137479}{137550}- Is there any tea in this pot?|- Stewed, I'm afraid.
{137555}{137604}Right.
{137766}{137804}Yes, that's Leslie.
{137809}{137882}- Are you sure?|- Positive. Where were they?
{137888}{137948}Reconnaissance|spotted them in the Channel.
{137954}{138019}- Floating on some wood.|- That was lucky.
{138025}{138125}That depends on how you look at it.|We don't take too kindly to spies.
{138151}{138213}- Spies?|- Yes. Or deserters.
{138268}{138333}Don't worry.|We'll find out soon enough.
{139293}{139334}Out!
{139729}{139778}Prisoner escort. Attention!
{139798}{139842}Quick march!
{140316}{140398}No, he said that|he had to do something dangerous.
{140403}{140467}He couldn't talk about it|as it was secret
{140473}{140541}and I might be a spy.
{140572}{140670}So I know they're not spies|because they borrowed a boat
{140675}{140724}and said they were going somewhere...
{140730}{140815}..which must have been France|which is where the war is,
{140820}{140881}so they can't be deserters either.
{140949}{140999}Sorry, do I sound a bit muddled?
{141005}{141087}Not at all. Thank you, Miss Fraser.|You may sit down.
{141308}{141347}Well, gentlemen...
{141353}{141445}Let me tell you, I've presided over|many court martials,
{141450}{141523}too many if I'm honest,|and i's not a task I relish.
{141541}{141658}Never before have I been asked|to listen to such appalling drivel.
{141695}{141741}You're deserters.
{141746}{141830}You know it, I know it,|everyone in this room knows it.
{141848}{141912}You ran away|for a coward's chance on easy street
{141918}{141995}and when your boat|sank on the way to lreland...
{142015}{142103}..you invented this fairy tale|to save yourselves.
{142133}{142184}What sticks in my throat above all,
{142189}{142304}is that even after you failed to|produce evidence in your defence,
{142310}{142419}you still persist in this ridiculous|'Boy's Own' adventure
{142424}{142503}of some personal invasion of France.
{142606}{142714}You have brought shame on the uniform|worn so bravely by so many.
{142766}{142807}You, Sergeant King,
{142813}{142862}you're beyond contempt, frankly.
{142867}{142926}Not only have you duped|an impressionable...
{143009}{143061}Begging the court's pardon, sir.
{143066}{143120}Who is this? What does he want?
{143125}{143200}I'm so sorry, Colonel, but er...
{143205}{143295}..if I might crave the court's|indulgence for a few moments?
{143321}{143402}- Who are you?|- I want to interview the prisoners.
{143407}{143484}- What?|- I'm Major Desmond Merton.
{143489}{143582}Chief lntelligence Advisor|to Mr Churchill.
{143617}{143665}Now, I have here...
{143708}{143821}..a ground plan... of some buildings.
{143827}{143884}Major, these are|official proceedings. >
{143889}{143960}These buildings|that you see here, gentlemen...
{143983}{144027}..do you know what they are?
{144033}{144083}Yes, sir. It's a listening post, sir.
{144088}{144143}A 'Cap de la Hague', sir.
{144163}{144212}Interesting. How do you know?
{144226}{144274}It says so at the top, sir.
{144367}{144406}Does it?
{144449}{144501}- Oh, so it does.|- Major...
{144507}{144565}One moment, please, Colonel.
{144570}{144640}Are you familiar|with these buildings?
{144645}{144722}- Yes, sir. I think so.|- What can you tell me about them?
{144728}{144788}Well, that's the fly swat thing, sir.
{144794}{144842}The... the what?
{144848}{144913}The signal receiver thing, sir.
{144918}{144982}It appeared to the uninitiated eye
{144987}{145060}to be a giant implement|for the swatting of flies.
{145066}{145122}I see. What about these chaps here?
{145127}{145176}They're the two teacup things, sir.
{145181}{145284}They had the general appearance|of teacups placed on their side, sir.
{145290}{145378}They were outside the perimeter,|so we left them alone.
{145383}{145432}Excellent. Right.
{145460}{145510}Now what was it that you did?
{145516}{145565}Blew up the ops room,|with grenades.
{145570}{145607}Major...
{145613}{145728}They are disgraced. They're guilty|of theft, deceit and desertion.
{145734}{145822}You're not suggesting there's any|substance to their story?
{145827}{145911}I'm merely trying|to ascertain the facts.
{145916}{146007}This operations room. Did anything|strike you as unusual about it?
{146047}{146095}No, nothing, sir.
{146144}{146196}- Apart from the smell.|- The smell.
{146201}{146281}- The smell? What smell?|- Er, beef and onions, sir.
{146287}{146350}- Beef and onions?|- Burned beef and onions.
{146355}{146402}Major, I really must insist...
{146407}{146491}Burned beef and onions! Ah!
{146525}{146566}Thank you, Colonel.
{146571}{146668}- I've heard all I need to hear.|- Well, thank God for that.
{146673}{146756}In your opinion, Major,|are they telling the truth?
{146770}{146830}No, sir. They are not.
{146904}{146955}They didn't destroy|the operations room.
{146985}{147034}They destroyed the cookhouse.
{147040}{147080}LAUGHTER
{147170}{147228}I'm not putting up with this.
{147233}{147338}Unless you can substantiate that|claim, I intend to pass sentence.
{147344}{147396}- I'm sure that I can, Colonel.|- How?
{147402}{147460}You're not going|to tell me you were there?
{147502}{147612}Not personally, no, sir, but|the 2nd Parachute Regiment were.
{147618}{147735}- The Paras where there?|- 119 of them to be exact.
{147740}{147794}There were after|those two teacup things,
{147799}{147855}which you were good enough|not to blow up.
{147861}{147952}Their task was to bring bits home|for our boffins to play about with.
{147958}{148093}There were reports of an unexpected|and very useful diversion...
{148114}{148182}..but until now,|no-one has been able to confirm it.
{148188}{148312}Initially, we put it down to|the French, but it just didn't tally.
{148318}{148417}Anyway, there we are.|Well done, gents.
{148423}{148516}Thank you, Colonel for allowing me|to clear up that little puzzle.
{148533}{148609}Oh, yes, and I nearly forgot.
{148615}{148665}Message from the Prime Minister.
{148670}{148771}He thanks you very much for your|letter. It cheered him up no end.
{148777}{148844}He apologies for the delay|in replying,
{148850}{148899}but he has had rather a lot on.
{148904}{148948}Next time you're in Whitehall,
{148953}{149024}he would be delighted|to see you for a cup of tea.
{149061}{149151}That is tea for King|and Cuthbertson, sir, not...
{149183}{149227}Well...
{149232}{149264}Oh, yes...
{149316}{149400}Here are your pay books back...
{149405}{149458}..which he has signed.
{149463}{149556}He didn't want you to go short.|As he said to me...
{149561}{149654}A few more lunatics|like those dentists, Merton,
{149659}{149714}and I can win this war by Christmas.
{150236}{150268}Cookhouse. The bloody cookhouse.
{150839}{150882}Well done, lads!
{152142}{152205}I'll see you in 28 days, Sergeant.
{152249}{152300}I'll be here, Private.

By 300 AD, the Roman Empire[br]extended from Arabia to Britain.
But they wanted more.
More land.
More peoples[br]loyal and subservient to Rome.
But no people so important[br]as the powerful Sarmatians to the east.
Thousands died on that field.
And when the smoke cleared on the fourth[br]day, the only Sarmatian soldiers left alive were members of the decimated[br]but legendary cavalry.
The Romans, impressed by their bravery[br]and horsemanship, spared their lives. ln exchange, these warriors were[br]incorporated into the Roman military.
Better they had died that day.
Father.
They are here.
For the second part of the bargain they[br]struck indebted not only themselves...
The day has come.
..but also their sons,[br]and their sons, and so on, to serve the empire as knights. l was such a son.
There is a legend that[br]fallen knights return as great horses.
He has seen what awaits you,[br]and he will protect you.
Lancelot! Lancelot!
Lancelot.
Don't be afraid. l will return.
- How long shall we be gone?[br]- 1 5 years, not including the months it'll take[br]to get to your post.
Lancelot!
Rus!
Our post was Britain -[br]or at least the southern half, for the land was divided by a 73-mile wall[br]built three centuries before us to protect the empire from[br]the native fighters of the north.
So, as our forefathers had done, we made our way and reported[br]to our Roman commander in Britain, ancestrally named for the first Artorius, or Arthur.
Mother, l finished.
That's beautiful.
Mother...
Pelagius. For you.
Well done, Artorius.
You keep it.
Deliver it to me[br]when you come to Rome.
Come.
Behold, Arthur. Young knights. lf you so choose, they may some day[br]be yours to lead, as your father before you.
- l'm to be their commander?[br]- Yes.
But with this title comes a sacred[br]responsibility to protect, to defend, to value their lives above your own[br]and, should they perish in battle, to live your life gloriously[br]in honour of their memory.
And what of their free will? lt has always fallen to a few[br]to sacrifice for the good of many.
The world isn't a perfect place, but perhaps people like you, Arthur,[br]and me and them can make it so.
Ah, as promised, the bishop's carriage.
- Our freedom, Bors.[br]- Mm. l can almost taste it.
And your passage to Rome, Arthur.
Woads!
Rus!
Rus!
Rus.
Gratia plena, Dominus tecum. Benedicta[br]tu in mulieribus et Dominus tecum.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus.[br]Benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.
Benedicta tu in mulieribus...
Save your prayers, boy.[br]Your god doesn't live here.
Why did Merlin send you south of the wall?
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
- Bors.[br]- What a bloody mess.
That's not the bishop.
God help us.
- What are they?[br]- Blue demons that eat Christians alive.
You're not a Christian, are you?
Does this really work?
Nothing.
Maybe l'm not doin' it right.
Stand down.
Arthur!
Arthur Castus. Your father's image. l haven't seen you since childhood.
Bishop Germanius. Welcome to Britain. l see your military skills[br]are still of use to you.
Your device worked.
Ancient tricks of an ancient dog.
And these are the great Sarmatian knights[br]we have heard so much of in Rome. l thought the Woads control[br]the north of Hadrian's Wall.
They do, but they[br]occasionally venture south.
Rome's anticipated withdrawal from Britain[br]has only increased their daring.
- Woads?[br]- British rebels who hate Rome.
Men who want their country back.
- Who leads them?[br]- He's called Merlin.
A dark magician, some say.
Tristan, ride ahead[br]and make sure the road is clear.
Please do not worry, Bishop.[br]We will protect you.
Oh. l've no doubt, Commander.
No doubt.
Dozens don't worry me[br]nearly so much as thousands.
Thousands? l don't like him, that Roman. lf he's here to discharge us,[br]why doesn't he just give us our papers? ls this your happy face?
Galahad, do you still[br]not know the Romans?
They won't scratch their asses[br]without holding a ceremony.
Why don't you just kill him,[br]and then discharge yourself after? l don't kill for pleasure, unlike some.
Well, you should try it someday.[br]You might get a taste for it.
- lt's a part of you. lt's in your blood.[br]- No, no, no. No.
As of tomorrow[br]this was all just a bad memory.
Ohh. l've often thought about what going home[br]would mean after all this. What will l do? lt's different for Galahad. l've been in this life longer than the other.
So much for home.[br]lt's not so clear in my memory.
You speak for yourself. lt's cold back there[br]and everyone l know is dead and buried.
Besides, l have, l think, a dozen children.
Eleven.
You listen. When the Romans leave here,[br]we'll have the run of all this place. l'll be governor in my own village[br]and Dagonet will be my personal guard and royal ass-kisser. Won't you, Dag?
First thing l will do when l get home is[br]find a beautiful Sarmatian woman to wed.
A beautiful Sarmatian woman?
Why do you think we left in the first place?
What about you, Lancelot?[br]What are your plans for home?
Well, if this woman of Gawain's[br]is as beautiful as he claims, l expect to be spending[br]a lot of time at Gawain's house.
- His wife will welcome the company.[br]- l see. And what will l be doing?
Wondering at your good fortune[br]that all your children look like me. ls that before or after l hit you with my ax?
Where you been, now? Where you been?
And what will you do, Arthur,[br]when you return to your beloved Rome?
Give thanks to God that l survived to see it.
You and your god! You disturb me. l want peace, Lancelot. l've had enough.
- You should visit me.[br]- Ah! lt's a magnificent place, Rome.
Ordered, civilized, advanced.
A breeding ground of arrogant fools.
The greatest minds in all the lands[br]have come together in one sacred place to help make mankind free.
And the women?
Open the gate!
- Welcome back, Arthur.[br]- Jols.
Lancelot.
Bishop, please, my quarters[br]have been made available to you.
Oh, yes. l must rest.
- Where have you been?[br]- Oh...
- l've been waiting for you.[br]- Oh, my little flower. Such... passion!
Where's my Gilly? Gilly.
- You been fighting?[br]- Yes.
- You been winning?[br]- Yes.
That's my boy.[br]Come on, all my other bastards!
Let us not forget that[br]we are the fortunate ones.
Let us raise our wine to those gallant[br]and extraordinary men we have lost, but who will be remembered for eternity.
To freedom.
Pelagius.
Very kind of Arthur to give up his room.
But, of course, it is to be expected.
Sir, l'm here to escort you[br]to the fortress hall.
When my master meets with your knights,[br]he must be seated last and he must be seated[br]at the head of the table.
Your master can plonk his holy ass[br]wherever he chooses.
His Eminence, Bishop Naius Germanius.
A round table?[br]What sort of evil is this?
Arthur says for men to be men[br]they must first all be equal. l was given to understand[br]there would be more of you.
There were. We have been[br]fighting here for 1 5 years, Bishop.
Oh, of course.
Arthur and his knights[br]have served with courage to maintain the honor of Rome's empire[br]on this last outpost of our glory.
Rome is most indebted[br]to you noble knights.
To your final days[br]as servants to the empire.
Day. Not days.
The Pope's taken[br]a personal interest in you.
He inquires after each of you, and is curious to know if your knights have[br]converted to the word of Our Savior or...?
They retain the religion of their forefathers.[br]l have never questioned that.
Of course, of course.
They are pagans. Hm?
For our part, the Church[br]has deemed such beliefs innocence, but you, Arthur,[br]your path to God is through Pelagius?
- l saw his image in your room.[br]- He took my father's place for me.
His teachings on free will and equality[br]have been a great influence. l look forward to our reunion in Rome.
Ah.
Rome awaits your arrival[br]with great anticipation.
You are a hero. ln Rome, you will live out your days[br]in honor and wealth.
Alas...
Alas, we are all but players[br]in an ever-changing world.
Barbarians from every corner[br]are almost at Rome's door.
Because of this, Rome and the Holy Father[br]have decided to remove ourselves from indefensible outposts,[br]such as Britain.
What will become of Britain[br]is not our concern anymore. l suppose the Saxons will claim it soon.
- Saxons?[br]- Yes. ln the north a massive[br]Saxon incursion has begun.
- The Saxons only claim what they kill.[br]- And only kill everything.
So you would just[br]leave the land to the Woads.
And l risked my life for nothing.
Hm.
Gentlemen, your discharge papers with safe conduct[br]throughout the Roman Empire.
But first, l must have a word[br]with your commander.
- ln private.[br]- We have no secrets.
Come. Let's leave Roman business[br]to Romans.
Let it go, Bors.
Rome has issued a final order[br]for you and your men.
Final order?
You are to travel north[br]to rescue the family of Marius Honorius and return, in particular,[br]with Marius's son, Alecto.
Alecto is the Pope's[br]favorite godchild and pupil. lt is his destiny to become a bishop,[br]perhaps even pope one day.
On this day you ask this of my men.
On this day.
They have risked their lives for 1 5 years[br]for a cause not of their own.
And now, on the day they are to be[br]liberated, you send them on a mission which is far more dangerous[br]than any other they have undertaken.
You tell me, Bishop,[br]how do l go to my men and tell them that instead of freedom l offer death? lf your men are truly the knights[br]of legend, perhaps some will survive. lf it is God's will.
Your men want to go home, and to get home they need to cross[br]the entire breadth of the Roman Empire.
Deserters would be hunted down like dogs.
Will you defy the Pope, Arthur?
Rome? God himself?
Everything l've done has been[br]for the Church and for Rome.
Do not mistake a loyal soldier[br]for a fool, Germanius.
Would you leave a defenseless[br]Roman boy, destined to lead our Church, at the hands of the Saxons?
Fulfill this mission, and your men[br]will receive their discharge.
Their papers will be waiting here[br]the moment they return.
You have my word.
You think very hard upon that vow, Bishop,[br]for l will hold you to it.
Break it, and no Roman legion, papal army, nor God himself will protect you.
That is my word.
- She gave me fleas.[br]- You better hope they're fleas.
Best of three.
Who wants another drink?
When you gonna leave Bors[br]and come home with me?
My lover is watching you.
You look nothing like him.
You're all Bors.
- Tristan...[br]- How do you do that? l aim for the middle.
Oh, they want more!
- Here. Be a mother to your son.[br]- Oh, come here.
Dagonet, where you been?[br]We've got plans to make.
Here, please. Sing.
- No.[br]- Just a last one.
- No, l'm trying to work.[br]- Come sing. Shut up!
Vanora will sing.
- No, no.[br]- Sing! Sing!
- Sing about home.[br]- Don't drop the baby.
Land of bear and land of eagle
Land that gave us birth and blessing
Land that called us ever homewards
We will go home across the mountains
We will go home[br]We will go home
We will go home across the mountains
We will go home singing our song...
..hear our singing, hear our longing
We will go home across the mountains
We will go home[br]We will go home...
Arthur!
Arthur!
Arthur! You're not[br]completely Roman yet, right?
Rus!
Knights... brothers in arms... your courage has been tested[br]beyond all limits.
Yes.
But l must ask you now for one further trial.
Drink.
We must leave on a final mission for Rome[br]before our freedom can be granted.
Above the wall, far in the north,[br]there is a Roman family in need of rescue.
They are trapped by Saxons.
Our orders are to secure their safety.
Let the Romans take care of their own.
Above the wall is Woad territory.
Our duty to Rome,[br]if it was ever a duty, is done.
Our pact with Rome is done.
Every knight here[br]has laid his life on the line for you.
For you.
And instead of freedom[br]you want more blood?
Our blood?
You think more of Roman blood[br]than you do of ours?
Bors! These are our orders.
We leave at first light, and when we return[br]your freedom will be waiting for you.
A freedom we can embrace with honor. l am a free man! l will choose my own fate!
Yeah, yeah.[br]We're all going to die someday. lf it's a death from a Saxon hand[br]that frightens you, stay home.
Listen, if you're so eager to die,[br]you can die right now!
- Enough. Enough![br]- l've got something to live for!
The Romans have broken their word.
We have the word of Arthur.[br]That is good enough. l'll prepare.
Bors?
- You coming?[br]- Of course l'm coming!
Can't let you go on your own![br]You'll all get killed! l'm just saying what you're all thinking!
Vanora'll kill me.
And you, Gawain? l'm with you.
Galahad as well.
O merciful God,[br]l have such need of your mercy now.
Not for myself, but for my knights, for this is truly their hour of need.
Deliver them from the trials ahead, and l will repay you a thousandfold[br]with any sacrifice you ask of me.
And if, in your wisdom, you should determine that that sacrifice[br]must be my life for theirs, so they may once again taste the freedom[br]that has so long been denied to them, l will gladly make that covenant.
My death will have a purpose.[br]l ask no more than that.
Why do you always talk to God[br]and not to me?
Oh, pray to whomever you pray[br]that we don't cross the Saxons.
My faith is what protects me, Lancelot.[br]Why do you challenge this? l don't like anything[br]that puts a man on his knees.
No man fears to kneel[br]before the god he trusts.
Without faith, without belief in something,[br]what are we?
To try and get past the Woads[br]in the north is insanity.
- Them we've fought before.[br]- Not north of the wall!
How many Saxons? Hm?
How many?
Tell me. Do you believe in this mission?
These people need our help.
- lt is our duty to bring them out.[br]- l don't care about your charge, and l don't give a damn about[br]Romans, Britain or this island. lf you desire to spend eternity in this place,[br]Arthur, so be it, but suicide cannot be chosen for another!
- And yet you choose death for this family![br]- No, l choose life!
And freedom for myself and the men!
How many times in battle have we[br]snatched victory from the jaws of defeat?
Outnumbered, outflanked,[br]yet still we triumph.
With you at my side, we can do so again.
Lancelot, we are knights.
What other purpose do we serve[br]if not for such a cause?
Arthur, you fight for a world[br]that will never exist.
Never.
There will always be a battlefield. l will die in battle.
Of that l'm certain.
And hopefully a battle of my choosing.
But if it be this one, grant me a favor.
Don't bury me in our sad little cemetery.
Burn me.
Burn me and cast my ashes[br]to a strong east wind.
Don't touch their women.
We don't mix with these people.
What kind of offspring[br]do you think that would yield?
Weak people.
Half people. l will not have our Saxon blood[br]watered down by mixing with them.
According to our laws, no man[br]may deny me the spoils of our conquest!
He speaks the truth, Father.
My lord! O, my lord!
God's thanks, my lord.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Kill her.
No! No!
Are you challenging me? lf you want to challenge me,[br]you have to have a sword in your hand.
As long as my heart beats,[br]l rule and you hold your tongue.
Or l'll cut it out.
To represent the holy court,[br]my trusted secretary, Horton...
Horton?
..will accompany you on your quest.
Jols, find him a horse.
This way.
Godspeed,[br]as you fulfill your duty to Rome.
My duty is also to my men.
Then get them home.
We are three days' march from[br]the Great Wall, if we camp at night.
We won't camp.
The wall - what troops are stationed there?
Light Roman infantry and possibly Sarmatian knights.
Arthur Castus is their leader.
Arthur? Who is this Arthur? lt is said he has never been defeated[br]in battle. lt is said he is a great warrior.
Why should l trust you?
You're a traitor to your own people.
Tell my father of the Roman estate.
Speak up!
A very high-ranking family live there.
They are of great importance to Rome.
Father, their ransom[br]could pay for the entire campaign. l'll attack from the north[br]with the main army.
You bring your men down here.[br]Cut off their retreat to the south.
Burn every village, kill everybody.
Never leave behind you a man, woman[br]or child who can ever carry a sword.
Woads. They're tracking us.
Where?
Everywhere.
Get back!
Get back!
This way!
What are you waiting for? lnish.
Devil ghosts.
- Why would they not attack?[br]- Merlin doesn't want us dead.
- Who are you?[br]- l am Arthur Castus,
Commander of the Sarmatian Knights,[br]sent by Bishop Germanius of Rome.
Open the gate. lt is a wonder you have come.
Good Jesus.[br]Arthur and his knights.
You have fought the Woads.[br]Vile creatures.
Our orders are to evacuate you[br]immediately.
But that... that is impossible.
- Which is Alecto?[br]- l am Alecto.
Alecto is my son.
And everything we have is here in the land[br]given to us by the Pope of Rome.
- Well, you're about to give it to the Saxons.[br]- They're invading from the north.
- Then Rome will send an army.[br]- They have. Us.
- We leave as soon as you're packed.[br]- l refuse to leave.
Go back to work! All of you!
- You heard! Go![br]- All right, all right.
- Go![br]- Get back to work, all of you!
Go back! lf l fail to bring you and your son back,[br]my men can never leave this land.
So you're coming with me if l have to tie you to my horse and drag[br]you all the way to Hadrian's Wall myself.
My lord.
Lady, my knights are hungry.
Go.
Come!
Come. Let us go, hm?
Sir, you're famous.[br]You're Arthur, aren't you? l'm Ganis. l'm a good fighter and l'm smart.[br]l'd serve you proudly.
Are you from Rome?
From hell.
- Sir.[br]- Who is this man?
He's our village elder.
What is this punishment for?
- Answer me![br]- He defied our master, Marius.
Most of the food we grow[br]is sent out by sea to be sold.
He asked that we keep[br]a little more for ourselves, that's all.
My ass has been snappin' at the grass[br]l'm so hungry!
You're from Rome. ls it true[br]that Marius is a spokesman for God and that it's a sin to defy him? l tell you now.
Marius is not of God.
And you, all of you,[br]were free from your first breath!
Help this man.
Help him!
Now hear me. A vast and terrible army[br]is coming this way.
They will show no mercy, spare no one.
Those of you who are able[br]should gather your things and begin to move south[br]towards Hadrian's Wall.
Those unable shall come with us.
You, serve me now.[br]Get these people ready.
Right, you heard him.
You go grab enough food and water[br]for the journey.
Let's get a hurry on, else we're all dead!
Come on, hurry.
They have flanked us to the east.
They're coming from the south,[br]trying to cut off our escape.
They'll be here before nightfall.
- How many?[br]- An entire army.
And the only way out is to the south?
East.
There is a trail heading east[br]across the mountains.
It means we have to cross behind Saxon[br]Iines, but that's the one we shouId take.
Arthur, who are all these peopIe?
They're coming with us.
Then we'll never make it.
- Come on, get back to work![br]- Back to work!
Move.
Move.
Move!
- What is this?[br]- You cannot go in there.
No one goes in there.[br]This pIace is forbidden.
What are you doing?[br]Stop this!
Arthur, we have no time.
Do you not hear the drums?
Dagonet.
- Key.[br]- It is Iocked.
From the inside.
You, you... go.
Move!
- Gawain.[br]- Exaudi orationem meam.
Exaudi orationem meam.
In nomine Dei Patris omnipotentis[br]et in virtute Spiritus Sancti.
Who are these defiIers[br]of the Lord's tempIe?
Out of the way.
The work of your god.
Is this how he answers your prayers?
See if there's any still aIive.
How dare you set foot in this hoIy pIace?
- There was a man of God.[br]- Not my god!
- This one's dead.[br]- By this smell, they are all dead.
And you.[br]You even move, you join him.
Arthur!
You must not fear me.
Water! Give me some water!
His arm is broken.
And his famiIy?
She's a Woad.
I'm a Roman officer.
You're safe now.
- You're safe.[br]- Stop what you are doing!
What is this madness?
- They're all pagans here![br]- So are we.
They refuse to do the task[br]God has set for them!
They must die as an exampIe!
You mean they refused to be your serfs!
You are a Roman.
You understand.
And you are a Christian.
You! You kept her aIive!
- My Iord![br]- No! No, stop!
When we get to the wall[br]you will be punished for this heresy.
Perhaps I shouId kill you now[br]and seaI my fate.
I was willing to die with them.
Yes, to Iead them to their rightfuI pIace.
It is God's wish[br]that these sinners be sacrificed.
OnIy then can their souIs be saved.
Then I shall grant his wish.
- Wall them back up.[br]- Arthur.
I said wall them up!
Don't you see it is the will of God[br]that these sinners be sacrificed?
- Unhand me, defiI... They're sinners![br]- Get in there!
We're moving too sIow.
The girI's not gonna make it,[br]and neither is the boy.
The famiIy we can protect, but we're[br]wasting our time with all these peopIe.
We're not Ieaving them.
If the Saxons find us, we will have to fight.
Then save your anger for them.
Is this Rome's quest or Arthur's?
- Arthur.[br]- How is he?
He burns.
Brave boy.
Some of your fingers are out of pIace.
I have to push them back.
If I don't do this, there's a chance[br]you may never use them again.
They tortured me.
With machines.
To make me tell them things that...[br]that I didn't know to begin with.
And then...
I heard your voice in the dark.
I am Guinevere.
You are Arthur... of the Knights from the Great Wall.
I am.
The famous Briton[br]who kills his own peopIe.
I found tracks coming from the south,[br]but none going back.
Horsemen traveIing Iight and fast.
CouId be Roman cavaIry.
CouId be knights.
They know we're after them.
They'll head east now,[br]through the mountains.
God's hoIy work has been defiIed.[br]I am a servant of God!
No, pIease, I...
He says they walled him up in a buiIding[br]and took the famiIy.
Someone who goes[br]by the name of Artorius.
It's him.
It's Arthur.
Take your men east. Hunt them down.
I'll take the main army to the wall.[br]Bring the famiIy there.
- And the monks?[br]- Put them back where you found them.
I am a servant of God!
PIease, I... I am a servant of God!
Unhand me, you defiIer!
Burn it all.
My father toId me great taIes of you.
Really?
And what did you hear?
Fairy taIes.
The kind you hear about peopIe so brave,[br]so seIfIess, that they can't be reaI.
Arthur and his knights.
A Ieader both Briton and Roman.
And yet you chose your allegiance[br]to Rome.
To those who take[br]what does not beIong to them.
That same Rome that took your men[br]from their homeIand.
Listen, Iady, do not pretend[br]you know anything about me or my men.
How many Britons have you killed?
As many as tried to kill me. It's the natural[br]state of any man to want to live.
Animals live! It's a natural state of any man[br]to want to live free in their own country.
I belong to this land.
Where do you belong, Arthur?
How's your hand?
I'll live, I promise you.
Is there nothing about my land[br]that appeals to your heart?
Your own father married a Briton.
Even he must have found something[br]to his liking.
We'll sleep here.[br]Take shelter in those trees.
- Tristan.[br]- You wanna go out again? Yeah.
'Tis a beautiful country, is it not?
If you say so.
And where do you come from[br]that compares?
The Black Sea?
This is heaven for me.
I don't believe in heaven.[br]I've been living in this hell.
But if you represent what heaven is,[br]then take me there.
Rain and snow at once.
A bad omen.
It is here, given to us by the Pope.[br]These people, they send an army for us.
What was it like, your home?
We sacrificed goats, drank their blood,[br]danced naked round fires.
What I do remember...
Home...
Oceans of grass from horizon to horizon,[br]further than you can ride.
The sky, bigger than you can imagine.
No boundaries.
Some people would call that freedom.
That's what we fight for -[br]our land, our people.
The right to choose our own destiny.
So you see, Lancelot,[br]we are much alike, you and I.
And when you return home,[br]wiLL you take a wife, have sons?
I have killed too many sons.
What right do I have to my own?
No family, no religion.
Do you believe in anything at all?
I would have left you[br]and the boy there to die.
You betrayed me.
He means you no harm.
Peace between us this night,[br]Arthur Castus.
So Rome is leaving. The Saxon is come.
The world we have known[br]and fought for is ended.
Now we must make a new world.
Your world, Merlin, not mine.[br]I shall be in Rome.
To find peace?[br]The Saxon will come to Rome.
My knights trust me[br]not to betray them to their enemy.
Rome was my enemy, not Arthur.
We have no fight between us now.
You tell that to the knights[br]you killed before my eyes, whose bones are buried in this earth.
We have all lost brothers.
You know nothing of the loss I speak!
Shall I help you remember?
An attack on a village.[br]The screams of an innocent woman.
Mother!
Artorius!
Mother!
Mother!
I ran to the burial mound[br]of my father to free her.
To kill you.
Father, please let loose your sword.
I feel the heat of that fire[br]on my face even now.
I did not wish her dead.
She was of our blood, as are you.
If you were so determined to leave us[br]to slaughter, why did you save so many?
My men are strong,[br]but they have need of a true leader.
They believe you can do anything.
To defeat the Saxon[br]we need a master of war.
Why do you think[br]I spared you in the forest?
That sword you carry is made of iron[br]from this earth, forged in the fires of Britain.
It was love of your mother[br]that freed the sword, not hatred of me.
Love, Arthur.
- It is your destiny.[br]- There is no destiny.
There is only free will.
And what of the free will of your knights?
Did they die in vain?
Seize him!
No!
No...
I have the boy!
- Kill him![br]- No, don't! Let him go!
Kill him now!
Down!
Your hands seem to be better.
Artorius!
Do we have a problem?
Huh?
You have a choice.
You help or you die.
Put down your weapons.
- Do it now![br]- Yeah!
- How many did you kill?[br]- Four.
Not a bad start to the day!
Armor-piercing.[br]They're close. We have no time.
You ride ahead.
I'm sorry for your loss.
My father lost his way.
He used to say the Church[br]is there to help us stay on our path.
My father said the Army
makes all men one.
But you never know which one.
He didn't know Roland Bozz.
Get up!
Get the fuck up!
Come on.
Get your fucking low-life asses out of bed!
You got 15 minutes or you're gonna do pushups until I pass out.
Let's go. Let's go.
Get up! Let's go!
Get your socks on and get outside, you fucking pussies!
- Hurry up!
- Move!
- Ain't got all day.
- Move your ass, soldier.
Next time won't be no weekend in the stockade.
It'll be a full-scale motherfucking court-martial.
Maybe a few years hard time in
Leavenworth. How's that fly, dipshit?
Discounting reception, basic training corrective custody...
...been in the Army more than three months. Most of it in the stockade.
Get on that fucking deuce!
Get up on that deuce, boy!
You don't need no special invitation, son!
Do as I ask! Hoist that
GI ass on that deuce!
Let's go. Get it done!
Get it done!
Private Bozz, Roland.
No middle initial.
You're going to infantry.
I bet my left nut they bag and tag you in a week.
Any man tries that hard to get out will never see home again.
I don't like the rehearsal, so I'll skip the show.
Fuck you. Get on that deuce.
Let's go!
Bozz.
I got a buddy in Charlie Company says he knows a fellow by that name.
Says he's the biggest fuck-up in the Army.
Clowning around and always acting like fucking bozo.
Article 15, recycled through basic, all kinds of goldbrick shit.
Sounds to me like that fellow's no more than a goddamn coward.
Afraid of Tigerland, huh?
Should be scared.
They hump your ass until it falls off.
- I heard a guy from Bravo died there.
- No, man, that's a rumor.
You afraid of big old Tigerland,
Private Fuck-up?
Read this and tell me what happens.
I gotta get away from this guy.
Go for it, Bozz!
Private Bozz!
What the fuck?
Stop the goddamn truck!
Goddamn it!
What the fuck is your problem?
You stupid motherfucker!
You're nothing but a...
Get back in that truck, you little fuck!
The rest of you motherfuckers, sit your asses down!
Good morning, gentlemen.
My name is Captain Saunders.
Commanding officer, Alpha Company.
Third advance infantry training brigade.
Welcome to the infantry, gentlemen.
No matter where you did your basic, either Fort Polk or elsewhere...
...rest assured that we train the proudest, the toughest...
...the best-equipped soldiers.
This base is the largest supplier of combat troops overseas.
So don't let any man here start having any little...
...pasty fucking daydreams about being anyplace else.
I shit you not, gentlemen.
You are headed for a two-way firing range.
You will be sent to the war.
You will be here for an eight-week training cycle.
After that, you will remain here for a week more.
We will ship you to an outpost
10 miles from here...
...that is known throughout the Army as the second worst place on earth.
Tigerland.
It is the stateside province of Vietnam...
...and it is as close to the war as we can make it.
Now, gentlemen, it behooves you to learn...
...what little we can teach you here.
For if you do, then maybe...
...just maybe...
...you will return one day to play stink-finger with Sally back home.
Let's get squared away.
Those of you not on detail will have a pass for the weekend.
Training begins Monday at 0430.
From that time on, every son of a bitch humps his own load.
- Sucky-sucky, baby?
- Oh, no, thank you.
There you go.
- You got a high sex drive.
- You're right.
Which line says that?
I'm no expert but it says you're gonna have sex real soon.
- What about me?
- Sex for Sheri as well.
There you go.
- Did you read it?
- No, I didn't.
Me, neither. I keep it around to piss everybody off.
Jim Paxton.
Let's not become friends. You could die and I'd miss you too much.
Excuse me?
It's a joke. Forget it.
Roland Bozz.
This here is Sheri and Claudia or Claudia and Sheri.
Ladies, Jim Paxton.
- Good to make your acquaintance.
- Nice to meet you.
Charmed, I'm sure.
- Let me buy you ladies a drink.
- Right on.
Four, please.
- You girls from here?
- Born and bred. You?
- Upstate New York.
- New York.
How about you, Bozz?
Where are you from?
Texas, Jim. It's in the
Southwestern part of the U.S.
Oh, yeah? Well, I'll double-check that on the map. Thanks.
They came down hard on you in company.
- I'm surprised they let you off base.
- They didn't.
- I'm confined to company air.
- Oh, you're AWOL?
Man, the children.
To peace on earth and a cure for cancer.
- Cheers.
- Amen.
Don't take it all so seriously, Jim.
Lighten up.
Man, all I said was, "To peace on earth and a cure for cancer."
- Who said it's a joke?
- You're doing a routine.
A funny soldier with two girls in a bar...
Man, I'm not doing any routine.
If you're gonna be an asshole about it, fuck you.
Now, Jim, that's not the answer.
Oh, really, smart-ass?
Then what is?
The answer is, I got a hotel room.
We're gonna take these ladies and fuck till the war is over.
Okay.
Hello. This is fun.
Oh, really, really fun.
- It's not bad for a couple grunts.
- Not bad for a couple grunts?
Who are you?
Sergeant Rock, Easy Company?
Who are you playing?
Absurd man in an absurd world?
You're playing a fool fighting the system.
- There's a difference, Paxton.
- Really, what?
I'm a failed fool.
Yeah, you've got a rep. I heard you're the biggest fool around.
Oh, well, thank you.
But that's it.
I'm still here when I should be out.
- And I'm gonna get out.
- Not me.
I enlisted.
- Is this some war shit again?
- Yes.
- I got the munchies.
- Me too.
I wish I hadn't heard you say that.
I was starting to like you.
You know, I thought a lot about it, Bozz.
I don't like the war.
Maybe I'm even against it.
But I'm not against my country.
Is there room service here?
Where's the phone?
That's some fancy political thinking, professor.
Let me give you some advice.
Figure out a way to go.
- Get out, singing while you go.
- Guys, help us.
- We're hungry, you know?
- Me too, man.
You know, that's not all, man.
It's not just political.
I want to go.
I want to see what it's like.
I want the experience.
I'm taking notes on everything.
Shut up. I'm taking notes on everything. One day...
One day I'll write something like James Jones or Hemingway.
What will you write?
That war is hell, men are brave, that kind of old crap?
So you've popped my fucking balloon.
Jesus Christ, Bozz.
- 24-hour place on Bourbon Street.
The girls are gone.
Yes, they are.
Okay.
Hey, how you doing?
Keep your head down.
Fucking AWOL, piece of shit son of a bitch.
That bag of shit of yours in the dirt.
Private Bozz is showing the proper way to dig a hole under fire.
Under fire, you will fall to the earth and lie flat.
Under fire, you will ask God to remove your button...
...to get closer to the ground.
Under fire you will dig a hole with your teeth if you have to.
Open your mouth.
Now, shitbird.
Do it! Eat dirt!
I don't hear you. "Yes, sergeant."
- I'm still not hearing you.
- You wear a dress, sergeant?
- What did you say, you piece of crap?
- Go kiss my ass, sergeant!
You little finger-fucking cocksucker.
I will make you push Fort Polk into the sea!
Sir, I already have a man in mind.
Thank you.
Eat dirt. Do it!
Do it! Eat dirt!
- Eat it!
- All right, sergeant, that's enough.
Get these men moving.
Move it! You heard the man.
Let's move it! Get going!
Miter, you're the new platoon guide, the 2nd Platoon.
Get Bozz in line.
If it don't happen...
...even Jesus won't be able to save you, understand?
- Yes, sergeant.
- Have these men fall in and fall out.
Platoon, fall in.
Fall out to your weapons.
Bozz, Bozz, Bozz, Bozz!
What is wrong with you, private?
Move your ass, son.
Let's go.
Move it!
- Bozz.
- Let's go!
Get that bag of shit in the dirt.
That's mine.
Platoon, listen up.
Platoon, we got a heavy day tomorrow.
Everybody hit the racks.
Lights out.
- Lights out.
- You like being in control, boy?
I ain't took no shower.
I gotta take one.
God, shut up.
I don't fuck with you when you're talking, so don't fuck with me.
Sergeant Thomas.
Private Cantwell reporting to the weapon shed as ordered.
Sergeant Thomas?
Glad you waited up for me, Dad.
I think everybody did, Bozz.
This the scene where the troublemaker gets beaten by his buddies?
Somebody got beaten.
Cantwell.
Jesus!
- What happened?
- I think it was Sergeant Thomas.
Damn it.
Anybody report it?
Why? It's not gonna put his face back together.
He was trying to fuck around like you.
I'm sorry this happened to you.
There ain't gonna be no more clowning from you.
You hear?
Go wash up and hit the rack.
Shut your cake-hole, Miter.
You're giving Cantwell a headache.
I'm telling you, and that's like getting an order from the sergeant.
Don't make me put you on report.
Give it a rest.
It's been a hard day for all of us.
Don't you give me a hard time, Paxton.
You're okay.
You'll be a good soldier, but this individual...
He wants to be a bumblefuck.
He wants to laugh at everything we do.
He'll hurt this platoon.
What are you, 20 years old?
Just because you wear sergeant stripes don't mean you ain't gonna die.
Where you going that we ain't, Bozz?
You best start to soldiering, boy, or you're coming home in a bag.
Fuck.
Just wanted you to know,
I've taken a great dislike to you.
- Is there anything else, Wilson?
- No.
I don't reckon there is.
I'm gonna tell you something.
This is the last time you'll hear it.
You can't kill a dink with a ricochet.
Oh, this is all about killing people?
Well, shit.
So you can shoot when you want to.
When I want to.
Idea of killing dinks excite you?
Cease fire. Cease fire.
Get your targets, scumbags.
All clear.
You can't hit your targets, there'll be hell to pay.
Shit, I do believe that's
Cantwell's target there, boys.
- Not a single bullet hole in it.
- Shut your cracker face, Wilson.
Sgt. Thomas'll chew my ass for chow.
You ain't gonna be making any phone calls home.
You gonna be busy. All asses and elbows, picking up ciggie butts.
You're a one-man campaign to make the world uglier.
- I ain't afraid of you, Bozz.
- Yes, you are, Wilson.
- You're just too stupid to realize it.
- Okay then, Sunday school.
You're such a goddamn saint, give Cantwell your target.
- I'll give him yours.
- You take that and I'Il...
Jesus H. Christ, what's the purpose of this clusterfuck?
- Wilson switched targets with Cantwell.
- That's true.
- That's bullshit.
- Lie down.
- Permission to...
- Now, shitbird!
Yes, sergeant.
You know why this man's on the ground?
Because he's dead!
He's dead.
And you can't bury him.
Do you know why?
- Why, sarge?
- Because you're dead too!
You're all dead...
...because you don't know how to fire weapons on semi-automatic.
Or how to hit Charlie with short bursts...
...so your goddamn barrels don't overheat.
And because this shitbag can't hit his fucking target.
Any questions?
- No, sergeant.
- I got a question.
If I'm dead, how come
I can ask you a question?
I know exactly what you're doing, you pissant fairy.
I want you...
...and your two girlfriends here...
...to report to the mess sergeant after chow tonight.
Get up, Lazarus.
You're resurrected.
Get up.
Cantwell.
You're getting a lot less funny, Bozz.
There's some big old moon shining down.
Reminds you what this world is all about.
- What, peeling potatoes?
- It's good you talk so slow, Cantwell.
Paxton there is taking notes.
Maybe he'll put you in a book.
Another one of his hokey characters:
The bumpkin saint.
I don't rightly know what you're talking about.
I don't read much.
Never got past sixth grade.
Got married. Got a wife back home.
Poor little girl.
She has seizures.
These spells, you know?
Four children gotta go without a mama now and again.
Jesus, Cantwell, when did you get married? When you were 12?
Hell, no.
I was 15.
We had two together.
She had two previous.
I'm 19, but she's a might older.
She's 28.
I got a little boy who's 1 and a little girl who's 2.
What the fuck are you doing here, man?
Don't it strike you how it's the same moon shining?
And it's shining down on us here...
...and shining down on that little girl who's my wife.
It's the same moon...
...that'll be shining when we go to war.
Same moon that's shining down on those boys getting shot.
Don't it strike you what it means?
How each of us is a bit of everything.
And everything is shit.
I know that back home...
...preacher be talking about right and wrong.
About the Lord and God and Jesus.
But you know...
...if the Lord or God or Jesus...
...be standing here right now...
...he'd say, "Cantwell...
...you forget about all these promises.
You forget about what all anybody say.
And you forget about all them big Sunday fancy ideas.
Even what we tell you.
You look up there.
Did you ever see such a moon?"
Goddamn it, Cantwell.
Shit.
Shit.
Fuck, I don't even know you, man.
You sitting there telling your fucking story.
Make me want to fucking cry.
What's that about?
I mean, fuck you, Cantwell.
The world is fucking made of pain.
You shouldn't even be in this army.
You're just too stupid to get yourself out.
I told them my predicament.
They said, "Wait till you go to war, then complain."
And you bought that?
The man said it.
I know Army regulations the way prisoners know the law.
You're a hardship discharge, man.
Okay. Look, I'll get you out of the Army.
What are you saying?
You don't care about him.
Jim, shut the fuck up.
I know what I'm doing here.
Just peel some fucking potatoes or something.
- One, two, three.
- Two.
- One, two, three.
- Three.
- One, two, three.
- Four.
- One, two, three.
- Five.
Who put you up to this, son?
Nobody, sir.
- I know my rights.
- No, you don't.
Your case won't be reviewed until after you're overseas. Dismissed.
No, sir.
I don't believe that's correct.
And I believe if you don't allow me to see a J.A.G. Officer, sir...
...then under the uniform code of military justice...
...I can file a complaint with the inspector general.
And nobody can keep me.
Jesus Christ!
When did "My country, right or wrong" turn into "Fuck this"?
It's Private Bozz, sir.
I can smell him from here.
No, sir, it wasn't Bozz.
I read it. In a book.
You read it? In a book?
Yes, sir.
How far did you get in school?
Almost sixth grade, sir.
I guess they study law early where you come from.
Sir, if I may speak frankly.
You underestimate the harm someone like Bozz can do.
He's bad for the Army, sir.
Haven't you heard? Everything's bad for the Army these days. Even war.
Now drive your knee through his face.
Shove his brain through his ear. Good!
Thank you, sir.
What's your solution?
Shit-can him out of the Army?
Of course not. That's what he wants.
- Exactly.
- Court-martial him.
I guarantee he'll snap shit then.
Sergeant, you know we won't court-martial him.
It'll cost beaucoup dollars...
...and battalion will ask why I can't keep one asshole trainee in line.
Five weeks from now, he'll be in the war.
And he'll soldier then, by God.
Good or bad. Sure as shit.
Maybe not. Got Cantwell out.
Two other guys from his squad.
Every son of a bitch J.A.G. Shrink bleeding heart pissed down on us.
That's Bozz, sir.
X-ray vision for loopholes in the ARs.
Sergeant, we are losing a war.
The whole goddamn Army is falling apart.
You want me to fiddle-fuck around with one smart-ass barracks lawyer?
I think he's something more, sir.
- Is that all, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
What the hell you doing, soldier?!
Goddamn it, Bozz!
You're supposed to strangle him, not become his fuck buddy!
Yes, sergeant.
Pussy-fucking-coward.
What the fuck you looking at, you bunch of no-nut sad sacks?
Get your little pussies back to work!
You try that again, you're gonna be pissing blood, Bozz.
Now get those little pussies back to work...
...you bunch of sad sack, no-nut fuck-ups!
Hey, Bozz, you did well by Cantwell.
He's two-stepping from the poorhouse with a crazy wife. I envy him.
You saved his life.
Shit, sometimes when we talk, my stomach hurts.
I don't care what you say.
You should feel good.
Good shit, pussy-fucking-coward.
I won't be proud until Wilson's out.
Know what would settle your ass?
A blanket party.
Put a blanket over you, hit you with a rock.
Shut up, Wilson.
I'll stop this damn truck.
- Both of you can walk back...
- You bastard...
...you think you so damn smart.
I hear Northern boys are the first to go in Vietnam.
Yeah, but at least we can find it on a map.
Real fucking funny, Pax.
Ain't nobody gonna die.
Keep that talk to yourself.
Ain't nobody gonna die? Shit, Miter, you're one damn dumb cracker.
When you go home, they'll call you
"Mr. No-Legs Motherfucker."
- That any better?
- You watch yourself, mister.
I still got these stripes.
Acting sarge.
You're chicken without that stripe down your back.
- I ain't seen a dink that can take me.
- Jesus, Wilson, you a dumb-fuck.
Them motherfuckers killed the Chinese ass...
...and the French ass.
They gonna kick ours.
- Who are you? "Ask Mr. Negro Wizard"?
- My brother was there in '68.
Don't make you no hero.
You know what your problem is, Wilson?
You need to listen for the pop.
What's "the pop," Johnson?
The sound you'll make when your head exits your ass for the first time.
Damn, Johnson,
I know you a damn coward.
Now I believe you a damn communist.
Maybe a damn faggot alongside being a goddamn nigger.
- Oh, hell no!
- Ain't this some shit.
- Want a piece of me, chump?
- Get him!
- Get him!
- Get off of me.
Get off, motherfucker!
Come on!
That's enough.
Which one of you motherfuckers killed my truck?
- Get off me, man!
- Get off!
All right, now, you truckload of shit.
Fess up, or the whole damn drag-ass squad...
...does the airborne shuffle six miles back to base.
Goddamn it, shit for brains!
Who did it?
I did it, sergeant.
Good. Come down here, boy.
And bring your shit!
Rest of you, sit your asses down.
Nobody saves anybody, you stupid son of a bitch.
What the fuck are you doing, man?
It's not doing me any favors.
Charlie 6, this is Charlie 2.
Miter has properly demonstrated...
...the use of the TA-312 field radio.
Except for this, which is not in the manual.
If you ever catch Charlie...
...you might want info on where the rest of his buddies is.
Only Charlie is a close-lipped bastard who won't tell you fuck all.
That's why you tie his gook hands, take down his gook pants...
...and grab his gook balls.
Here, Miter, hold these.
You pinch these clips on each of his slant-eyed nuts...
...and you juice up the radio...
...that'll send enough shock so he'll tell you anything you want.
Hell, he'll tell you the minor league baseball scores.
- You read me?
- Yes, sergeant.
He'll tell you how his mother wipes her ass if you give him this juice.
Not only that, you'll be able to find him real easy next time.
Because he'll light up the fucking night.
No one said you could leave.
- Why?
- Why what?
Why would I do that to another human being?
Brother's right.
What the fuck's wrong with you?
That's one of your men.
Get him back here, boy.
- Bozz!
- Go get him, boy.
Jesus, Bozz.
Don't do this to me.
Get back here, you worthless sack of shit!
You can't control your own men, it is your ass.
Drop trou.
- What?
- Drop trou!
Double-time, come on! Skivvies too.
Well, what do you know?
You do have a pair of balls after all.
Wilson, get over here.
Crank this thing.
We'll now demonstrate the proper way...
...to give information when connected to the TA-312.
See if you can tell me why you can't control your men.
See if you light up tonight.
- Light him up.
- Shut the fuck up, Hicks.
Contact.
Never even touched you, son.
That's it. Class dismissed.
Go on to your next class.
Go on.
Go on!
Wilson, looks like we're having roasted nuts tonight, huh?
I didn't know you was so goddamn funny.
I can't wait to catch me a VC, spark his balls off.
I'll start with you tonight, Miter.
Got this, Pax?
The crazed, sadistic soldier...
...who flips out and kills people.
I think I saw you look at
Miter's balls earlier.
Funny there, Bozz. Funny, yeah.
You're a disgrace to the uniform, fucking piece of shit!
Hey! Hey, what the fuck?
Break it up, man!
Get the fuck up! Civilian bullshit!
What the hell is going on? Miter!
You better do some fast explaining or your men in a world of hurt.
There was an argument...
...and one of the men...
...- Slipped on the soap in the shower.
Wrestling. It got out of hand.
It happens when people live together, fuck together.
Sorry, soldier, you must've slipped on some soap yourself.
What's wrong with you?
Look like you ate some frozen shit for breakfast.
Nothing's wrong, sergeant.
It better stay that way, you read me? All of you.
- Goddamn it, do you hear me?
- Yes, sergeant!
You got guard duty. Four listening posts at the edge of the perimeter.
Dig yourself a hole and forget about chow.
Out here, you're challenged on guard duty. And you do it by the book.
But in Nam, if you hear something in the bushes...
...I mean anything, you open fire.
You fire into those bushes until you kill whatever made that sound.
When the sun comes up,
I don't give a fuck...
...whether it's man, woman, child or little Johnny next door.
Kill it or you're not coming home.
Like the My Lai massacre, sergeant?
Paxton...
...why don't you join your asshole buddy?
Missing a meal would be good for your wisecracking ass also.
Now let's fall back in for chow!
Goddamn it, do it now!
You want to march six miles tonight?
Fucking weapons at ease!
Feel like I'm digging my own fucking grave here.
When I was a kid...
...I used to think I could dig my way to China.
You watched too many cartoons, Jim.
Maybe if we dig long and hard enough, we'll tunnel our way out of this dump.
Why don't you?
My arm's too tired.
No, really. Why don't you get yourself out of the Army?
I'm not that brave.
In that case, I'll just have to bury you myself!
Move it out! Come on, move it out!
Stay the fuck down!
Stay the fuck where you are!
Move! You got to move it!
Stay the fuck down!
They're firing in our path!
- Move it!
- Cease fire.
Miter! What the hell's wrong with you?
When your men are told to move out, they move out!
When I give orders, you're supposed to jump.
- Do you read me?
- Yes, sergeant!
The M-60s fired directly across our path! They'd have cut us in two!
Who told you to open your fucking mouth? Miter's platoon guide!
You gotta flank that M-60!
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
If you want these dumb-ass bitches dead...
...you wouldn't take them in the belly of a pig...
...with a 762 to split their skull!
You flank the objective!
- You read me?
- Yes, sergeant!
- Get these fucking men out the hole!
- Move it out!
Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down!
What did you say, maggot-brained son of a bitch?!
I said, stay down.
Get these men out the hole now!
- Platoon guide, do it! Move it!
- Come on, goddamn it!
Stay down.
Are you stupid enough to fuck with me, boy?
Tomorrow at base it's you, me and the captain.
If your insubordinate ass ain't in stockade by midday chow...
...I'll kill you myself!
You won't kill me, sergeant.
I don't know what you'll do to me, but you won't kill me.
- Goddamn you, boy!
- Out of the trench!
Don't turn your back on me!
Get your ass with the other men now!
I understand your position. I ain't trying to fuck things up for you.
You got your army to run and people to kill. I'm not part of it.
Nobody quits the Army.
I'm not quitting...
...I'm just not playing.
What's your first name, sergeant?
Ezra.
Ezra.
Can I offer you a smoke?
What the fuck is wrong with you?!
That doesn't fucking do it!
That doesn't fucking do it!
Give me a fucking answer!
Fuck!
Now you listen to me, son.
I been to where you're going.
Over there, you go from living to dead awful quick.
What I'm trying to teach you may save your worthless life, maybe.
I tell you what. If you snap shit and soldier like I know you can...
...I'll forget about this.
- Can't.
Shit, even if I wanted to,
I'm not there anymore.
What kind of bullshit statement is this?
Ezra, no.
It's just me.
Okay, Bozz, all right.
I'm gonna let you go.
But now it's you and the CO, I'm out of it.
Soldier, this army's gonna come down on your ass hard. Both feet.
You know that, don't you?
They'll push through your papers and send you where the dying's sweet.
Is this a trick?
Trying to make me a hero or something?
Nope.
Well, good, Ezra.
Now you get your ass up and join these men right now.
You're a big fucking baby!
Get out of my sight.
- Miter!
- What's he doing?
- Sergeant Landers!
- Goddamn it, what is it now?
- That's enough, sergeant.
- You got some fucking nerve, shitbag!
Come on!
Time to go home, soldier!
I said, that's enough!
Let's go.
Goddamn it, you men will learn to soldier.
The next dick tries a stunt like that gets my size-14 Deltas...
...so far up their ass they'll choke on the heel!
- Do you understand!
- Yes, sergeant!
You! Paxton!
- How much school have you had?
- Two years of college.
You're the next platoon guide.
Arrest him.
They didn't teach us how to do that in college.
Are you some kind of fucking idiot?
You inbred retard.
You don't know how to do a thing, do you?
Tell the man he's under arrest...
...he's confined to barracks, he won't leave the area.
You get a card table and set it up at the door!
Why, sergeant?
So a guard can sit there, you backed-up, sperm-brained college boy.
You're fired as platoon guide, dumb-ass dipshit!
You think that's funny?!
Goddamn it!
Goddamn it! Give me 10, you think it's fucking funny!
- Wilson!
- Yes, sergeant.
Get a card table.
You're on guard.
Guard, sergeant?
You heard me!
You want these 14s up your ass?
No, sergeant!
Bozz.
You're new platoon guide.
You put that piece of shit under arrest.
You tell these men to get their haircuts. Every swinging dick.
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sorry about that, Jim.
Oh, man.
Jealous?
Miter.
How you doing, man?
Okay, guys!
I ain't taking any of this shit seriously.
Just do what you have to do so we can live together.
If any of you are gonna run off and hide, let me know.
You can't do this.
You ain't got the rights.
Bleeding-heart son of a bitch.
It ain't your army. Hear me?
Sit the fuck down at your dumb card table, punk.
Hey, fellas. Hey!
Look, all I know is that no one's talked to me like that...
...since I got in this goddamned green mean machine.
- Damn right.
- I attest to that.
So yeah, Bozz.
See what happens, baby.
What else they gonna do, send us to Viet-fucking-Nam?
Too late for that.
Say, Bozz? Can I get a weekend pass?
Put your panties away, your mama's panties.
They're your mama's panties. You ain't been laid in three years.
Get me off this base, I'll show you!
Miter, baby, you gotta lay still.
Gotta lay still, man.
Take a deep breath.
Take this shit off.
You gotta relax.
Shit, you gonna run again?
I hear people in New Orleans help me get to Mexico.
It ain't that easy.
Army's got men, their whole job's to look for you.
I don't care.
They'll catch you, bring you here and put you in prison.
You best move, don't make me have to thump you.
Want to go to military prison?
You're not that crazy.
Shut the fuck up!
Calm the fuck down, you'll wake up Wilson. You don't want that.
Shit. What you gonna do now?
I'll bust my hand.
I'll bust my hand.
- Shit, man, that won't work.
- Watch!
I said, that won't work!
Bust my hand, they'll have to let me out. Right?
- It ain't gonna work.
- Come on, Bozz!
Break my goddamn hand so I can go home!
You know what I am, Bozz?
I'm a butcher.
Yeah, we all butchers.
No, I'm a real butcher.
- You haven't killed anyone yet.
- Goddamn it, I mean a real butcher!
Back home. I cut meat.
I do it damn fine too.
Did it in high school, did it after high school.
I could cut you a piece of meat so clean...
...it'll have you praying to beefsteak.
I'm a good butcher, Bozz.
It's all I ever wanted to be.
You laughing at me?
No, Miter. I ain't laughing at you.
My wife, she laughed at me.
My daddy too.
I didn't make no money.
Just a store boy, that's what my daddy said.
"Hey, store boy. Hey, boy!"
Called me boy. Imagine that? Shit kicker, calling me boy all the time.
I ain't a boy, goddamn it!
Telling me how he's a big fancy war hero!
And my wife, that little...
My wife.
She's pretty.
Prettiest girl in Lake Charles High.
Prettiest girl in the state of Louisiana.
She was mad at me because
I was working all the time.
Giving her the money...
...for junior college.
I knowed then, like...
...like I knowed later on...
...she was seeing a fucking college boy on the side!
Goddamn it! My daddy said it.
He said, "See? See what a dumb-ass bastard you are?
Blinded by the beaver store, boy.
You ought to have a little ring in your nose."
So you thought you'd join the Army and kill yourself like a real man.
Bozz, I know you can get people out.
Maybe.
Even in this wild-ass nonsense, some rules fly by.
Please, Bozz. Please get me out of here. Please?
Well, look here.
Goddamn.
That captain sure didn't want to let me go at first.
But I did like you said.
Told him the Army wants me to see a psychiatrist.
- And that was it, huh?
- I wanted to thank you personally.
Doctor sent me on leave.
He'll contact the Red Cross, get me out-processed...
...so I don't have to come back.
Good, Miter. Glad to hear you're nuts, man.
- Best of luck, Miter.
- Thanks, Paxton.
Take care, Johnson.
Thanks again, Bozz.
- So long.
- Go be a butcher, Miter!
- Try not to get shot, hear?
- Don't let your meat loaf, man.
Yeah, fuck you.
- Private Bozz, reporting as ordered.
- At ease.
So you're the new platoon guide for 2nd Platoon?
Yes, sir.
The fucking world is full of fucking surprises.
It wasn't your plan to wear sergeant's stripes...
...a week away from
Tigerland in a war.
I don't know, sir. The idea crossed my mind now and again.
I just didn't think it would all be so pitiful sad.
Been looking over your 201.
You're a Texas boy.
Couple run-ins with the law.
A year in state college.
Dropout, worked construction.
- Get drafted?
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn't you stay in school?
- Maybe I needed some trouble, sir.
Well, you got it.
You also got responsibility.
You got a platoon to run.
The company's like the bad end of a shit storm. Your platoon's the worst.
- Thank you, sir.
- That's not a compliment, smart-ass.
I don't want any more calls from battalion...
...asking me why this troopie needs a hardship discharge...
...and that troopie needs some kind of a mental wet nurse.
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.
Wipe that fucking grin off your face.
A week from now you'll ship out to Tigerland.
That'll crawl in your skull and look out your eyes.
So let's start fresh.
- Give your people a weekend pass.
- Already done it, sir.
You are a goddamn piece of work, Bozz.
I believe you could soldier as well as any man in this army.
I even think you want to, but you won't.
I'm just trying to keep myself alive.
We're fighting a war, private. Nobody knows how he's gonna come back.
That's not the kind of alive
I'm talking about, sir.
Here's 150 bucks.
Happy Halloween!
Cough it up, Brian.
Next time, Pax.
- Catch you later, buddy.
- All right.
Who's that girl you're talking to, Bozz?
- Trying to score some weed.
- Know what I don't get?
Why they haven't tossed you out on some lunatic discharge...
...some bullshit like that.
- I ain't crazy.
You're out of your fucking mind.
My reasons are my reasons and no one has to like them.
What about these fucking war games?
What if it's a lie?
What if the guys who tell you and me shit to do were lied to also?
Maybe since everyone believes in the same mistake, you know...
...maybe they're all as confused as we are.
All this "Boy's boy, man's man" bullshit.
Ever feel you're just being stupid?
Yeah. And it gives me a warm, gooey feeling inside too.
Oh, man, we need women, Pax!
Oh, I hear you, buddy!
I hear your asshole's tighter than a migraine.
- Fuck you!
- Hey, man.
- You're Bozz, right?
- Uh-huh.
Fellas say that if you don't want to go to Nam...
...you better pray to Jesus or talk to Roland Bozz.
- Better start praying to Jesus, then.
- Sorry, kid!
- Oh, my God, look here.
- Oh, Jesus!
- I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble!
- You are!
- Come here, baby.
- I'll come if you got some money.
- I might have some money.
- You might or you do?
- You better have some.
- That's what I need to see.
- You want to see it?
- Yeah, I do.
- You got me covered, right?
- Here it is.
As I was about to come, I let out a fart. Should've seen her face.
Heard it in the next room.
Thought a grenade went off.
- How was yours?
- Expensive.
- You feel guilty?
- Because I'm broke?
I figured you for a guy who left a sweetheart back home.
- She left me.
- That's why you joined the Army.
- Go on, confess.
- No, she broke it off when I enlisted.
- Didn't want to be a widow.
- She's got a point.
After all this bullshit...
...you still want to go kill women and children in rice paddies?
- Come on, Paxton!
- Where you going, Bozz?
- I have no idea.
- Fuck.
- We are gonna jump, my young friend!
- Shit, Bozz, I'm too drunk.
- Come on, Paxton.
- I'll break my neck.
I don't want to go without you, man.
All right, I see what this is.
This jump, it's like this existential leap of faith.
Abso-fucking-lutely.
I have no idea what that means.
We'll break those legs and get out of the war.
- Okay, let's go.
- That's it, here we go.
- I'm ready.
- That's it.
It's gonna be on my count, it'll be one, two, three.
- Let's break those legs.
- Okay, one!
Two!
Three!
- Was that the count?
- That was the count.
- Okay, okay.
- Here we go, here we go.
- Hot girl.
- Oh, yeah, hot girl.
On my count again, one, two, three.
Okay, one!
Two!
Three!
The legs won't move. Shit.
They're out for themselves.
Goddamn it.
If that bottle was a leg, we'd be out of the war about now.
- Looks like that would really hurt.
- Oh, fuck.
Canadian Atlantic Railway.
There's your ride out of here, Bozz.
Go to Canada and live with a fucking moose? No way, man.
Mexico, that's where I'd disappear to.
Can't you just smell it?
See it? Shit, I can smell it from here.
All that sunshine and tequila. All those little seÃ±oritas walking around.
- Would you...
- What?
If I told you about people who can get us to Mexico...
...away from the war, would you go?
No.
No, I wouldn't.
I enlisted, so there's a place for me.
If I don't go, somebody has to take that place.
And if they die, well...
...they're dying for me.
You're a brave man.
- You're the brave one, Bozz.
- Bullshit.
Courage is when you're the only guy who knows how shit-scared you are.
Then you're right.
I am the brave one.
Let's get out of here.
We gotta get back.
Fucking Sergeant Thomas will chew my ass for chow!
- Anytime today, Private Paxton.
- I'm coming, Private Bozz.
Fuck.
We should have jumped.
Yeah.
We can always go back.
Come on, man.
Fight!
Calm the fuck down here!
Calm the fuck down!
Get him, Bozz!
Get him, Bozz, get him!
Let him go! You're gonna hurt him, Bozz, let him go!
Let him go, Bozz!
Let him go! Come on! Get off!
Goddamn it!
Damn you, Paxton. Let them fight.
Shut the fuck up.
You know he deserved every bit of it!
Took four hours for my nose to stop bleeding.
Get off it, Wilson!
You had it coming, man!
- I was just fucking with him.
- If Paxton here had kept quiet...
...boy, you'd be in hell right now, sure as shit!
If I knew Bozz would stop,
I wouldn't have said anything.
Apologize, Bozz.
Get off it.
You heard me, Bozz.
You apologize to me right now.
Yeah, Bozz. Apologize to the man.
Say, "I'm sorry I didn't kill your ass!"
Think that's funny?
Fuck.
You tried to embarrass me in front of every fucking person here.
Apologize.
Cease firing!
Clear your weapons!
Weapons clear.
Next group on the line, let's move!
Next group on the line!
- Weapon safe?
- Yeah, all clear.
Take a mag.
Ready on the right.
Ready on the left.
Firing line is ready.
Shooters, prepare to fire!
Fire!
Cease fire! Clear your weapons!
- Weapon clear, Barnes?
- All clear, Bozz.
- The fuck you doing, Wilson?
- Killing me a Cong.
What the hell's going on?
Unload that weapon!
Head or the body, Bozz?
You choose!
Unload that fucking weapon!
- Head or the body?
- Damn it, unload that piece!
- Fuck you, Bozz.
- Unload that weapon!
Fuck you, Bozz!
It's jammed.
Did you see that? Did you see that?
Looks like a misfeed jammed it.
Well, you are one lucky dick, Bozz.
It would've killed you and the three people next to you.
- Hope you're not too disappointed.
- What do you want to do?
How about get Wilson as far the fuck away as possible, sir?
Well, you have the right to press for a court-martial.
Otherwise, you can let us handle it our way.
I'd personally prefer that option.
- Consider it a personal favor to me.
- Get Wilson out, sir.
I don't recall telling you to open your stinkhole.
He's right, sir. Wilson shouldn't be in the Army.
Even if he did try to kill somebody.
You and I need to exchange some ideas.
That doesn't solve our problem.
We need to get him out now or we'll file for a court-martial.
Paxton, you're dismissed.
Yes, sir.
He's learning.
Bozz, do you think the Army's never seen pissants like you before?
I know you think you're some big swinging-dick hero.
I know a lot of the men think so too.
But I know you for what you are.
You are a coward.
You're a born leader and you're afraid to take any real responsibility!
That's why you dropped out of school, why you drop out of everything!
You're pissing your life away!
I don't need the fucking Army...
...and I don't need the war to tell me that, sir!
Get on your feet, soldier.
Attention!
I don't want you in a stockade.
I don't want you recycled.
I don't want you drummed out on some bad conduct discharge.
I want you exactly where you are.
And we'll just naturally chew you up.
I'll take care of Wilson.
You get the fuck out of my face.
Sure glad they got Wilson's ass out.
Good riddance to bad rubbish.
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- You shut the fuck up.
- Guys, relax.
- I ain't starting.
You already got your ass beat once.
- Just watch your back in Tigerland.
- I'll do that.
I guess I'm supposed to joke about how I owe you my life.
- He almost killed you.
- You jealous?
You wanted to know what it was like.
What what was like?
The great lesson of being close to death.
Know what I know?
Same thing you know.
We're in a real bad way.
Fuck.
Real bad way.
All right! Let's go! Move it!
Come on! Let's go!
- Come on! Move! Move!
- Move your ass!
Come on, fat boy! Move your ass!
Let's go, soldier!
Let's go! Let's go!
Welcome to Tigerland!
Your final training
before you're shipped overseas!
Here, everything's done
exactly as it is over there.
You will search and destroy,
hunt and kill!
You'll move by chopper to secure
any area deemed necessary.
You'll be allowed one hour's sleep.
Minor mistakes will pay back major punishment.
Maybe you've heard we've lost this war.
Or we've lost the support of people here at home.
It's too late to ask those questions.
You're not back on the block.
You're alive in a year, we'll talk about it.
When you arrive in Nam...
...it's important to get acclimated as quickly as you can.
Remember to think.
- You understand me?
- Yes, sergeant!
What matters now is sharpening your ability to find and destroy the enemy.
Practice how to stay alive.
I know what you're thinking.
I've been there myself.
You're thinking you'll
go somewhere safe.
You'll luck out.
Tigerland is where
you stop bullshitting yourself.
Sarge, you got any advice on how to stay alive in Vietnam?
- I do, private. Don't go.
- Right on, right on.
My friend here wants the experience.
Says he ain't scared.
Well, good luck.
If you ask me, I'll stick with the smart and the scared.
You'll be under the care of NCOs and officers who were in combat.
Listen to them.
They know what they're talking about.
Cota.
I'm Staff Sergeant Cota.
I've done two tours in Vietnam.
My first in '67 with the 101 st.
I just completed my second with MAC-V.
I only have two words
of advice for you.
And those are to listen...
... and to learn.
All right, let's saddle up.
Let's go! Let's saddle up!
Let's go, goddamn it!
Get down!
Good job, Paxton. Good job.
Good job, Johnson.
All right.
Get your ass behind that tree!
Fantastic. You guys move like fucking soldiers!
Get your ass down!
Ryan, get your ass down!
Go! Move! Move!
Bozz, keep that barrel out of the dirt!
Move, move, move!
Paxton, why are you slowing up?
Get your ass down!
You are the weak link!
This is not the time to slow up.
Adapt! Overcome!
Move! Get in there!
You good?
Why were you slow, Paxton?
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine, sergeant.
Diagonal, Private Barnes.
- So you don't chop your knee off.
- Yes, sergeant.
Go ahead, Paxton.
I gotta take a piss.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
"Jim Paxton on personal guide to pain."
Get that fucking torch out of my face and put that cigarette out.
You might as well hang a big neon sign that says:
"Dumb-fuck grunts, right here."
You broke light discipline.
Therefore, you're dead.
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
- I'm still alive, sergeant.
- What did you say?
- I said, I'm still alive.
I miraculously survived the attack.
- You didn't get hit?
- No.
Are your friends alive?
Yeah, Paxton's good.
Johnson, he's good and he's good.
If you're gonna make up a story, make up a happy one.
I ain't making anything up, son.
And in Vietnam there are no happy fucking stories.
I had a best buddy, Kelly Morgan...
...that I went to AIT with.
In '67, when the call came, we got sent off to Nam.
We had only been in country a few days. We was green as grass.
We were in a two-man listening post, talking just like we are here.
Kelly lit up a cigarette.
One minute we're naming his unborn child...
...and the next second his brains were in my lap.
The sniper zeroed in on the cherry of his cigarette, Bozz.
Gentlemen, it's all about respect.
Respect for your superiors and what they're trying to teach you.
Respect for yourselves and your unit.
And most important...
...respect the enemy.
You have 42 minutes...
...then the squad's on patrol.
Gentlemen, this is the best Vietnamese village we could create for you...
...here on the base!
Now, listen. You're all gooks, so nobody speaks English.
Anybody asks you a question in English, you answer, "No bic."
It means, "I don't speak" in gook-ese.
Let's hear it.
Good. Private Bozz, you are the only man that speaks English.
Speak only to the man who identifies himself as interpreter. Understood?
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Private Paxton.
You are the Vietcong.
They come through, their objective is to find the VC sympathizer.
In other words, you, Private Paxton.
They have five minutes.
You tell them nothing.
I warn you, they're beat up.
They've been awake three nights.
Forced marched all day.
They fuck this up,
they'll march another six miles.
One other thing:
They find out
which one of you is VC...
... and you'll be the ones
out in the boonies...
... on no sleep, forced marching
for the next two nights.
Understood?
- Yes, sergeant.
- Let's get to work.
Private Bozz, Paxton. Over here.
Lets see...
Lukins, Barnes, in this hooch.
Make it as realistic as possible.
This is not a fucking joke.
I like this.
It's like a war theme park.
I'm so tired. I'm gonna pass out.
Hey, here they come.
Shit.
It's Wilson.
What?
- I thought we got him out.
- There's a war going on.
Plenty of room for psychopathic killers.
Let's move it.
We don't got much time.
We gotta find the VC.
Fuck me.
VC?
Get your ass on the ground!
Get on the fucking ground!
You VC?
You VC?
How'd that feel?
Need an interpreter?
I'm the only one that speaks English.
How does that feel, Paxton?
What are you gonna write about now?
What are you writing in your journal?
Don't fucking move!
Let go of him, goddamn it!
- You're in charge! On your feet!
- Yes, sergeant.
Where is your weapon, soldier?
There it is.
Why didn't you secure the area,
Private Wilson?
I'll tell you why.
Because you lost control!
Yes, sergeant.
Did you find any VC?
No, you didn't.
That's the fucking answer.
Come here.
I promise you tears before breakfast.
Get your men and get out of here.
Get out of here! Let's go. Move!
- I'm gonna kill you.
- Is that right?
- You gonna kill me again?
- I'll kill you.
Get your hands off him!
You want to go?
Get the fuck out of here!
- Get the fuck out!
- I'll break your neck!
- Let's move!
- Get the fuck out of here!
Somebody grab my steel pot.
Get out of here.
- How you doing?
- Shit.
Is he all right?
No, he's not all right.
Take your time.
- You going?
- I can't take you with me.
Not me. Paxton. He's hurting.
He signed up.
And you judged him for it.
You even made me feel guilty and I was drafted.
You saw what Wilson did to him today.
He's broken down.
And the Army didn't do all the breaking. Take him.
It's not my fault if he just realized what he did.
I only got time for my sad story.
- Take him with you.
- Fuck off!
Wilson's gonna take his hate out on somebody.
You run, he'll kill Paxton.
If not here, for sure over in Nam.
Johnson, I like you, but fuck off.
Yeah, well,
I ain't standing in your way.
Rise and shine, gentlemen!
Let's go, gentlemen! Roll em!
Let's go! Move! Get on your feet!
I know you're tired, but you'll be doing a lot of this in the next year!
If you're not...
...then you're in a body bag.
- Where's Bozz?
Waiting for a dust-off.
Where is your squad leader?
Is this his weapon?
Does anybody know where your squad leader is?
Where is he, Johnson?
- Where is your weapon, Private Bozz?
- Right here, sarge.
I know that.
The next time you decide to take a piss or a fucking shit...
...you make sure you have your weapon.
Your weapon is your lifeline.
Why didn't you have it?
I was gonna make a break for Mexico.
I didn't think I'd need it.
Very funny.
You take point.
Paxton, take slack. Johnson, drag.
The rest of you fall in behind.
Listen up.
You'll square off against the boys from yesterday.
They may have booby traps.
They may have forward observers watching.
They may do all manner of shit that you don't know.
That's why you will keep your eyes open and your mouths shut.
- Is that fucking understood?
- Yes, sarge.
Let's move out.
- Welcome back.
- You owe me 150 bucks.
Hurry up, Paxton. Let's go.
Dixie, dixie, my 12.
Dixie, my 12.
Move it! Come on!
You okay?
Fuck, Bozz. Joke's over.
Can't you see we're fucked?
Relax. You'll be fine.
You'll be fine.
Wilson, what the hell are you doing?
That's live ammo.
Ambush! 12:00!
Live ammo!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Private Wilson!
Private-fucking-Wilson!
Private Wilson, look at me, goddamn it!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Look at me.
You will place your weapon on safe!
You will raise your weapon above your fucking head...
...or I'll blow your fucking brains out!
Oh, Jesus!
Do it!
On your fucking knees, now!
Get on your fucking knees!
You will be court-martialed!
Do you fucking hear me?
- What happened?
- An accident. My fault.
Let me look.
Get him up.
Let me see the eye.
Let's go, move it!
This war is not gonna last forever!
Bozz, bus number three!
You don't want to miss this war!
Let's go!
- Want to come along?
- I did, but you wouldn't let me.
How's your eye?
Got an injury bad enough to get out, no permanent damage. Imagine that.
More corny wisdom for your book.
"In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."
Pretty fancy shooting, Tex.
Thank you.
It was just luck, Jim.
I could have killed you.
No, it wasn't.
Somebody had to take your place.
Last chance.
Don't make me bring the war to you.
Write me when you get there.
This is it, man.
No more phony Army buddy crap.
Go home.
Live a long time.
Try not to be too much of an asshole.
I'm gonna write a whole book about this.
Tell everyone about you.
Sergeant Thomas...
...sorry for my misbehavior earlier.
Real sorry.
See you back here. Take care.
- Watch your back.
- See you.
- I'll write a book about you, Bozz!
- No, you won't.
Come on, quit playing.
That's my journal.
Jesus! Bozz!
Come on, quit fucking around.
That's my book!
What are you doing? Shit!
Stop the bus!
What is this shit?
I never saw Bozz again.
Some guys said he died in Nam...
... but he was never listed.
Some said he just
disappeared over there.
One guy called and said
he thought he saw him in Mexico...
... with a beautiful woman.
But knowing Bozz...
... he'd be pissed off
I was talking about him anyway.

If you can't run, you're dead.
You're dead. So you run.
Bullets flying every which way, you are dodging the exploding shells.
You think, ''Where's God? Where are all these angels they talk about?''
You're thinking about your mother and you're thinking about... your home address, a cigarette, about nonsense.
Our work is about ugliness, idiocy and human nature.
About hatred.
So, when you're in a situation when you think you're going to die...
'cause it's natural to think about something beautiful in life, right?
There are two types of people in this world.
Those who have been to war, who have seen war up close... and those who haven't.
It's not the same animal.
Rescue squads arriving on the
scene, watched heplessly...
Cesar, if you don't understand, you have to ask your teacher.
Yes, but it's hard to.
She's always busy.
You need a lot of courage to talk to the teacher.
So, are we done yet?
-I'm done.
-Done done, or ''kinda sorta'' done?
Done, done.
What's the surprise?
Daddy?
Is it Daddy?
Daddy! Daddy!
Cesar. Cesar.
Come on, come on.
Hi, sweetheart!
I'm sparkling done!
Hey, you little man.
Come here!
It's good to see you!
Come on, get your brother!
Get your brother!
Let me see you.
Love you!
Have a great day!
-What's happened here, Freddy?
-Nothing. It was last night.
They robbed the register.
The fourth time.
-What will it be? Juice oranges?
-Were they armed?
A pretty lady like you doesn't have to worry about things like that.
...People's Liberation Army has
intensified battle in South Sudan.
The threat of disease and
malnutrition has increased...
as civilian refugees by the
thousands in makeshift camps...
with poor hygiene
and little food.
Although diplomatic efforts
in declaring a truce...
seemed to have gained ground in
international circles yesterday...
here in the South of Sudan there
seems to be no respite in sight...
Harrison!
Harrison?
Harrison?
Sweetheart.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Oh, God, that's good.
-I'm going to be late.
-No, no. Don't worry.
I'll make out right with Brubeck.
He knows how it is.
Don't you dare say anything to Bru...
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Good morning!
-Good morning.
-Good morning!
God! You look exhausted.
No really, you got the flu?
Gotta a problem this morning?
Excuse me.
Oh, my God, you look terrible.
Are you coming down with something?
You look awful, maybe you should've called in sick!
How are you doing?
Did Harrison get back to you?
Give me a break!
I had to get out there.
That world wasn't for me.
I came back here to the farm and I got no regrets.
l liked Harrison.
He always wrapped a note for her...
around his film boxes. Beautiful stuff,
l wish l could write like that.
From South Sudan, fresh off the plane. Shot two days ago.
He once wrote, ''They're all insane''.
And I thought,
''This guy is freaking out!''
l always ate at this Jewish
restaurant, Katsman's Deli.
Harrison ate there all the time.
l heard it all. Brubeck can say
whatever he likes, l heard it.
-Margaux, Sam.
-Margaux.
Just 'had' to recite her multiplication tables. Twos.
I had fifteen phones ringing off the hook and she's there...
''One times two is two, two times two is four.''
You've made some progress in Math, Sam!
David's pictures aren't bad.
Take a peek when you get upstairs.
A little lacking in the impact department, as usual, but not bad.
-Want a beer?
-No.
-I'm giving it up, Sam.
-What, beer?
That's why I wanted to see you.
Right away?
Why?
You'd be bored shitless, Harrison.
-You gave it up.
-I didn't have your talent.
-Why now?
-Sam, my luck bank is down to zero.
Never used to get clammy hands with guys going at each other around me.
I took my pictures clear-headed, even when I was up to neck in shit.
And I was proud. The more it stank, the more dangerous it was...
I was proud to expose it. I was conscious of doing my job right.
-I wasn't afraid of anything.
-So?
Sam, all I can think about now is
Sarah and the kids.
-And I'm sick of it.
-Yes, I'm sick of it, too.
What the hell do you think?
Every damn day I'm sick of it.
But we can't just drop it.
You can't and I can't.
There is a magazine, for Christ sake...
Look.
Hang on a while.
Just a little while.
Give me time to get organized.
Then I'll find you something safe, cushy and overpaid.
Okay, Sam.
I'll stick it out for a while.
But this is just for you. And
I'm warning you it's not for long.
No, no. Not for long.
Not for long.
Anyway, you're under contract, remember?
You really are a bastard!
-Daddy, watch this!
-Watch what?
-My submarine, please, just once!
-I'm going to be late, pumpkin.
I'm going to be late.
I can't, I'm sorry.
-Please, daddy, please just once!
-Just once. Just once.
Please!
What are you going to do?
Where did you go?
Come here!
You are the best submarine in the whole world.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
-What is it, Harrison?
-Nothing.
Just Cesar.
I don't know. I can't...
Every time I start talking to him and he clams up.
-I can't figure out why.
-Because you're always away.
-He's not used to having you...
-What's that supposed mean?
Nothing. I want us to have a good time tonight. I don't want...
No, tell me. What does that mean?
What does that mean?!
-If you showed a little interest...
-Shit! I show interest in him... in you! In Margaux!
How do you think I spend my time?
Sarah, shit!
Why do you think I do what I do?
For who? It's...
-Oh, shit!
-Saying ''shit'' forty times... isn't going to help you with your relationship with your son. Shit!
This student, alone... has become the symbol for the forces of freedom... facing the forces of tyranny.
Television stations from all over the world covered this event... but is this image, this single photography... which has become synonymous with the drama of that historic moment.
Yeager Pollack was the man who captured that magic moment for us.
Wait for it.
Wait for it!
And here tonight, to introduce him... his friend and colleague,
Pulitzer Prize winner himself, 1 989...
Newsweek's Harrison Lloyd.
There are very few things that we can be absolutely certain of... and never call into question... no matter how many lives we live.
And it is my pleasure, my supreme pleasure... my honor, and... to share one of those certainties with you tonight: and that is that Yeager Pollack is the best among us.
Hey, buddy.
Thank you.
I love your shoes.
Thank you, thank you.
I've made a lot of mistakes... in my life, but I think the biggest mistake I've made... was being born in he era of Harrison Lloyd.
Look up!
All my life, we've been in constant competition... over just about everything. So when
I heard that he got this prize...
I said to myself,
''I got to get this too.'' So... but seriously, I... this prize means a lot to me... because he gave it to me.
And that his work taught me that... photographs can prize the communal memory of our time...
And...
I go by that.
Thank you very much.
It's a gift that his work...
Thank you.
We divorced about two or three years later.
Yeager wasn't made for marriage.
He was made to do his job.
No, I mean... it was no secret.
He was in love with Sarah.
That's why it was so strange,
because Harrison was his friend.
His one friend.
And when Sarah
went through all that stuff...
he proved that!
Yeah.
Yeah, I think somewhere Yeager wanted Harrison dead.
-I heard your voice up there...
-Excuse me, I've got to take a leak.
No, no. Wait a second...
-He's taking off.
-Darling, you have nice ears.
We're having a little get together for Yeager at Katzman's...
...and I'd love for you to come.
-I don't think I could make it.
I'm counting on you, even though you don't like old war stories.
Thanks, Sarah.
-Nice speech, Harrison.
-Thank you, sir.
Nice speech.
''Do you know how many guys died in Bogota.. so you could powder you nose, Kyle?''
Did I say anything?
Not anything.
I know a guy who died, Lloyd.
Yesterday.
My friend Leroy got bumped off in Yugoslavia.
I know, I heard.
And no one gives a shit about that, right?
'Cause Leroy was a tiny little photographer...
Tiny.
In a tiny little country, taking pictures of a tiny little war.
You, you're up there... you're fancy, you and the others.
Life, Time, Newsweek.
You guys, you travel first class... with twenty-five cameras... and your fancy little hotel rooms... and then you give each other prizes.
Don't fucking touch me!
Don't touch me.
Leroy was twenty-five, Harrison.
He was broke.
Remember what that's like?
-I do.
-You do?
Yet no one gave him an assignment.
So he spent his own money... he put everything he had into making something for himself... and still no one would use his fucking pictures... and now he's fucking dead on his own nickel!
-I'm sorry, Kyle...
-Yeah, you're sorry...
...but it happens, okay?
So just calm down, all right?
-Go fuck yourself!
-Come on...
Fuck!
Hey, you want to get funny?
-You wanna get funny?
-Yeager.
I'll fucking break your leg, come on!
lt's so heavy!
l know. lt's so good!
-Harrison?
-Sarah, look. Come here!
Look at this.
Now I know why the only thing
I can shoot in color are flowers.
-And you, of course.
-You must want something.
-Is that from Peter?
-Yep.
Your brother's a hypocritical son of a bitch.
Going around picking flowers while people kill each other...
-He should be ashamed of himself.
-He doesn't pick... he saves them.
-And he gets paid good money for it.
-I know.
And the St. Louis Botanical Gardens is a waste of the taxpayer's money.
I'm kidding.
Your brother's a very wise man and I envy him.
So what is it?
''Catharanthus roseus''.
Madagascar pink periwinkle.
Never seen one of these before.
It has some therapeutic uses... cures certain forms of infantile leukemia.
It's beautiful and a lifesaver.
Just like you.
I was trying to be clever.
-What's the matter?
-No, nothing, nothing. Just...
It's so heavy!
It's so heavy!
Shit! Brubeck has been looking out for you. Sorry, I completely forgot.
Sam! What's up?
Zagreb, and then...
Where is it? North?
I got it, I got it.
What's happening in Yugoslavia?
Civil war, it's nothing earth-shattering.
No TV crews, even on CNN, they don't have anything.
Brubeck wants me to go there for the international edition.
Just about a week. You know,
Time is sending somebody.
Sweetheart, can you give me that map there on the couch?
Yeager's furious he can't go.
He has to have his knee operated on.
Hope it's nothing serious.
-You'll look in on him, right?
-Sure.
-Promise?
-Promise.
Graz. G-R-A-Z.
Make sure there's an airport there, okay?
Yes, master.
Cesar is going to be so disappointed.
I promised him you'd be home for his birthday. You will, won't you?
Hi, Lisa. It's Sarah Lloyd,
I'm calling for Harrison.
Yes, he needs a ticket for Graz.
G-R-A-Z.
Yes, I think they have an airport.
It's in Australia.
Nope.
Austria!
Austria.
She loves me.
-She loves me not.
-So what time? 2:45 PM.
Lay over in Zurich. Mom's in Zurich.
You have lunch with her.
-She loves me not.
-Okay, thank you.
Good morning, Lisa.
Nice hat, Sarah.
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to get some coffee.
Do you want some?
Yes, decaf. Skinny! Foam!
Vanilla! The works!
-He pulled the trigger.
-No, he just wanted to scare her.
Scare an old woman?
What for?
Harrison's using a 1 35. Odds are the guy never saw him take the picture.
I'm sure he pulled the trigger.
Fuck!
There is no price...
and no force powerful
enough...
-What's going on?
-First footage out of Yugoslavia.
...the Serbian Leadership won't
sway them from their goals...
or their battles
for human rights.
-Gonna be another Beirut.
-You can't tell.
All we have is Croatian TV.
It's confusing.
Rival militias settling old scores.
Add a pinch of religion, cover and let simmer...
...you got yourself a messy war.
-Could spread a full-scale war.
-No, it's just a...
-What? A police action?
No. Just ethnic skirmishes.
The Europeans haven't moved and it's right in their own backyard.
They know what they're doing, don't they?
Well...
-What's this?
-Pictures of ''ethnic skirmishes''.
...a very sad item of information
from one of our correspondents...
live, right now, inside Yugoslavia,
Bill Bruce.
A German reporter,
Karl Libb...
was shot to death yesterday
in the region of Karlovac.
We've apparently lost transmission
with our reporter...
but, l repeat, German television
reporter, Karl Libb...
was shot and killed last night
in the region of Karlovac.
As you can see, there's footage
coming in right now from Karlovac.
Hello?
Hello?
Harrison?
Harrison?
Hello.
Hello.
Harrison? Harrison?
I can't hear you.
But you can hear me, right?
Yes, I miss you, Harrison Lloyd.
If that's why you're calling.
Actually, all I've done is think about you for the last few days.
You know, I've had these dreams.
You know, those dreams.
Your hands, your mouth!
It's very frustrating, you know!
You're laughing at me.
You know,
I've thought about it, Harrison... when I turn on the TV
I wish I could watch CNN... and feel like it doesn't affect me personally.
You can hear me, I hope.
You know? You could...
Hello?
Hello?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Good morning.
-Is there anything for me, Lisa?
-Nothing.
Sarah.
Sarah...
Sarah, wait.
Sarah, please.
Sarah, I must..
Sarah!
-Sarah, sweetheart!
-Don't say it.
Please. Just... don't say it.
The Red Cross sent word yesterday.
We were waiting to be sure before we told you.
ZDF confirmed.
They lost a cameraman and a reporter too.
Drink this, it'll do you good.
Where?
Some small town.
I don't know.
Near Osijek.
When do they bring his body back?
Well, it won't be right away.
They won't bring him back.
He was... in this house and it collapsed.
And they buried everyone right away to protect against epidemics.
They're sending his backpack with some of his cameras.
He went light, dropped most of his gear off... with one of our guys in Zagreb.
I won't see him again?
I won't see him...
It's a filthy fucking war, Sarah.
Just like all the other filthy fucking wars.
We were wrong.
It's not just skirmishes.
We were all wrong.
I'll take you home.
Sarah, I'll take you home.
I'll take you home.
Come on, I'm taking you home.
Sarah.
She made me promise I wouldn't say anything to the children.
She said that one thing and then she didn't talk.
Yes, it was
the Wednesday after, l think.
Her mother came up
from Washington.
lt was in the morning.
Mr. Brubeck was real worried.
He told her...
Sarah, darling!
She never would cry, and she didn't
want anybody else to cry either.
That's Sarah.
That's just the way she is.
Then, a few days later, they came with the bags, Mr. Lloyd's bags.
Thank God the kids were in school
that day, because that was...
Sarah! Sarah!
Sarah, please.
Open this door.
Sarah, you must get hold
of yourself!
Sarah!
Sarah!
CNN Weekend continues with
our top story...
a story of immeasurable importance.
Serbian troops are moving through
taking one city after another.
Refugees abound, leading toward
the capital city of Zagreb.
After several days of resistance
the village of...
An estimated 1 00 prisoners
were captured by the Serbs...
who may now use them in
exchange with the Croatians.
The important question remains
however for the Serbs to answer.
What has become of
the seven thousand inhabitants?
What is this?
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
-Saying Kaddish, Sarah.
-But no one is dead.
There's no reason for this.
Where are my children?
Sarah. Sarah, we need closure!
Get your hands off of me!
No one is dead!
He's not dead, Peter! Okay?
Would you just tell them to leave?
He's not dead.
Sarah?
I'm going to take Cesar and Margaux with me to St. Louis tomorrow.
They'll be...
They'll be with their cousins.
I think they'll be better off.
Is that all right with you?
Hi, Peter.
Hi, you.
Nina will stay here.
Mom wants to stay, too.
If she bothers, you give me a call.
Something would've broken inside if he were dead.
It's not possible otherwise.
Do you understand, Peter?
Yes, you understand.
Do what you have to do.
Take your time.
When you decide...
I'll bring the kids back or you can come to Saint Louis, all right?
Thank you.
Sarah.
You have two beautiful children.
Since the tanks have occupied
the city...
thousands of refugees have been
trying to flee the region of Osijek.
Men and women who have
seemingly lost everything...
now flood the main arteries
out of the city.
The violence of the Serbian militia
known here as the Chetniks...
is matched by that
of the Croatian militia.
lnside the city of Osijek,
snipers are in every window...
posing a constant threat to lives
of men, women and children.
If Vukovar falls...
the Croatian chances of controlling
Osijek and Vinkovci are very slim.
-The international community...
-Nothing can halt our offensive.
Vukovar is the key we must hold.
After that, the Croatians
will have nothing left.
No one can say at this point, Gary .
We have some extraordinary...
Why Vukovar?
Our strategy was to smash Vukovar
and cross the Drava river...
Once we got to the other side,
we could probably be free.
-They burned my house.
-Who did this?
l don't know.
l didn't recognized the uniforms.
l don't know.
They burned my house.
They destroyed my flowers and they
burned my greenhouse.
The few survivors of this massacre
have sought refuge...
in the mixed Serbo-Croatian
city of Vukovar...
where already hundreds of homeless
people roam the streets...
fleeing the Serbian army.
Vukovar's only hospital is
overflowing with wounded...
and, in many cases, it is proving
impossible to determine...
where they come from ,
or even who they are.
...in many cases, it is proving
impossible to determine...
where they come from,
or even who they are.
...proving impossible, where they
come from, or even who they are.
...as the population reacts to
rumors of internment camps...
mass exterminations and
acts of extreme cruelty.
The task of journalists reporting
on this conflict...
is made all the more difficult by
persistent weariness on both sides...
of this conflict, with respect
to the international press.
As they report incidents...
This report concluded one final
interview, or rather, one final image.
Of a woman who, on the outskirts
of the city of Osijek...
searches the hundreds
of people walking around...
in the hope of seeing one face.
Please, stay with us for a moment.
I'm going to bring him back, Cesar.
Okay.
You take care of Margaux.
I love you.
I love you.
So, please, you take everything and then sign over there.
-You are a journalist?
-No.
-You not going to Yugoslavia, yes?
-No.
Where are you going?
-I have business in Graz.
-Fine.
Because we had cars returned with holes in them.
-One gave us just the keys back.
-No kidding.
Here, the car is outside.
There.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
-Sorry, can you bring me?
-You going to Graz?
No, bring me where you go.
Please. Please.
-I don't understand.
-You go where?
Go where?
-To Vukovar.
-I know road.
I show if you bring me.
Please.
I'll help you.
Really, please.
I'm a student in Paris.
But I'm Croatian.
I go to find family.
Wife and baby.
My baby five months.
I have a picture to show you.
-She's beautiful!
-Thank you.
I want bring them with me in France, in Montpellier.
-Have you children?
-Yes, two.
Cesar and Margaux.
What is it?
Frontier. Always line.
Stop! Stop here.
Stop here.
-Okay.
-Should I go?
It think it's okay.
Right smack in the middle of
all that, there she was.
The only soldiers she'd ever seen were in movies or photographs... like everybody else, I suppose.
No, she didn't know the first thing
I don't think, not even that... you could have fighting to the dead in a certain zone... and then a few hundred yards down the road, life goes on as usual.
We go first to Nasice, okay?
We see war situation.
-Your name?
-Sarah.
-Pretty.
-Thank you.
My name is Chtiomac.
-Stomach?
-No.
No stomach.
Chtiomac.
-Thought that's what I said.
-No, you said stomach.
Stomach it's like tummy!
-Say it, ''Chtiomac''.
-Chtiomac.
It's good.
So, what do you study in Paris?
I want to be teacher.
French teacher in Croatia.
Vukovar is very far and dangerous.
We pass Osijek.
Chetniks! Chetniks!
Come on! Come on!
Press! Press!
Please, please.
He's not a soldier. Please!
Please!
Please! Please!
Please!
Please, please, please...
It got nasty out here.
I don't like it here.
Why?
It's so nice and quiet.
Hey, she's alive!
She's lucky, they didn't have time to rape her.
Come on, come on.
Serbian? Croatian?
Please, say something.
We're going to bring you back to Osijek, okay?
-You understand me?
-They killed him.
They killed him for no reason.
English? American?
What are you doing her?
-She's a photographer.
-You're a photographer?
Don't shoot! We're photographers!
Don't shoot!
Please, go! Go!
I was shitting bricks there, to be honest.
For the first time in my career really.
I mean, I'd covered a dozen wars already... and I like this... but there, it was... bad.
I saw snipers shooting down kids, then scratching marks on the wall.
Here we are.
No problem finding a room.
Tourism is not exactly booming right now.
You'll like it here.
River view suite, a cozy bar... got one star in it.
-Where have you been this evening?
-Went to an opening.
Oh, yeah?
Big production?
Crucified snipers, corpse compacting, the works.
No bar at that party though.
I'd kill for a fucking drink.
-Me too.
-Do you have a beer?
I'll order something for you, Kyle?
Sarah, it's you!
You're out of your fucking mind?
You're out of your fucking mind?
Are you out of your fucking mind!?
-What's the problem?
-You're out of your fucking mind?
You already said that, didn't you?
-Do you know her?
-Where the fuck did you find her?
Near her car.
There was another guy with her.
-He's dead.
-Who is she then? Do you know her?
Well, come on.
Who the hell is she already?
Sarah Lloyd.
I'm going to Vukovar.
I'm not going to Zagreb.
Not in your wildest fucking dreams!
Sarah, you can't stay in this country.
This country is...
No one knows what this country is!
So you'd better beat it out of here and fast!
I didn't ask for anybody's help.
I have a press card, just...
They don't give a shit about press cards... or white flags, or their own fucking mothers!
Listen, Serb, Catholic,
Croatian, Orthodox... there's no bad guys, there's no good guys.
They're going to shoot you first and then they'll think about it.
This is no place for you.
This is no place for the living, all right?
-They are fucking insane!
-Calm down, Kyle.
You tell her!
You can't go into Vukovar.
The Serbs control the roads.
They bomb everything.
We can't, even if we wanted to, we can't.
-And Sarah, Harrison is...
-Harrison is there... and I'm going to get him.
He called me. After the date they said he was dead!
And if you could just tell me where Osijek is... and Vincovci, Nustar, and Vukovar...
I'm going to go to the hospital in Vukovar, and after that...
Excuse me, are you deaf?
Or you're just not listening?
It's impossible. You think you'd arrive at the airport and call for a taxi?
''Take me to Vukovar, please.''
This is a war we have here.
Real war with real blood... real death, real bombs, mines, bullets.
With real pricks who'd love to cut your stomach out.
War.
Didn't your husband ever mention it?
Here, here. Take this.
It'll relax you.
-This woman is a lunatic.
-This is a sucker, isn't it?
Everybody up.
Come on, we've got work to do.
No, it's across the street, the Croatian TV building.
Who gives what they're shelling?
They're shelling! Let's go!
They're behind us!
Behind us.
On the other side of the river.
Look! Look! See the shell's fire?
I'm moving up.
I'm moving with you.
What's this all about?
Harrison is alive?
Yep, so is Elvis. I saw that fucking building blow up! I was there.
-You saw him dead?
-The house went down!
But what about that phone call?
-You all right?
-Yeah.
If you know something, please tell her, Kyle. Please!
I made the call! I made the call,
I wanted to tell her.
She couldn't hear me at the other end of the line.
-She couldn't hear me.
-They're hitting the hotel!
Sarah!
-You get her...
-Sarah!
Sarah! Sarah!
Get the fuck out!
Get up. Get up.
You can't be afraid, let's go.
Let's go, please. Go.
Come on.
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Sarah!
Come on!
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Sarah?
Come on, get out of here.
Let's go or we'll die!
Get outside!
Get outside!
Hide in the basement.
Shit! We're never gonna get down to that cellar. It's full up!
We're gonna be stuck in there like mice in a fucking trap!
Don't they have a bloody wine cellar?
-This isn't a French restaurant!
-Let's get the fuck out of here!
We got nurse!
Fuck!
Shit! Shit!
Fuck!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
-Get in the fucking car!
-Animals!
Get in, get in!
-Get in! Get in!
-My fucking car!
Shit!
I'll be on the Avis shit list for sure!
Three cars these assholes totaled.
Where you're going?
-Morris!
-We are going to Vukovar.
-You're out of your mind!
-We're going to Vukovar.
Calm down.
I've got an errand to run for this lady.
He must have tried to cross through Osijek.
And then he tried to follow the Serbs... to get as close as he could to Vukovar.
Or else he went by way of Vincovsci.
What would you have done if the
Serbs had closed off the roads?
He would've gone to Vukovar. That's where we have to go to get the shot.
Right.
And once you're in Vukovar, can you contact anyone outside?
-And if he is injured...
-Checkpoint.
-Here. It's loaded.
-Blink your headlights.
-You're a photographer, remember.
-Jumpy bunch of little brats.
Slow it up, will you?
Got anything white?
-No.
-Have you?
Slow it fucking up!
How many times did I tell you?
-Right down, right down.
-Shut up, shut up.
They're fucking mad!
Don't say a word to them. Don't...
...are you listening to me?
-Cool it.
Shit!
Press. Press.
How you doing?
Smoke?
-You speak English?
-So-so.
-So... what's new?
-The war.
Exactly!
Who holds the city?
-Who holds it?
-We took west side... from the Bokan militia.
East side is still fighting but we hold.
-The Chetniks have all the rest.
-This road over here, is it safe?
One kilometer, Serb snipers.
After, I don't know. But they'll attack, probably tonight.
Kyle, the Chetniks have all the rest.
Risk your own neck, not mine.
Please, please.
I'm looking for this man.
Have you seen this man?
Photographer. American.
He was here taking pictures.
Have you seen this man?
Let her be, Kyle. Let's go to
Graz, put her in a plane... and the hell with it.
Lloyd's dead, you know he is.
Everybody fucking knows he is.
Did you see his body?
Did you?
No, okay?
I didn't see anything, so... if she thinks he's alive, then maybe he is alive.
-Cut the bullshit, Kyle.
-I'm not bullshitting!
You can't fucking go there.
Why are you doing this?
Look around.
Because If you see that they're killing everybody... every fucking way you look... than it doesn't matter if I'm in
Vukovar or somewhere else.
Who gives a shit?
Why are you taking her?
Stevenson... get off my case, all right?
Or go home to mummy.
Shit. I'd love to see my mummy.
Look at her.
I tell you what, you go over there and you say:
''Sarah, there's really no use hoping
'cause your husband's dead.''
Go ahead, Marc.
You do it if you got the balls.
I don't.
Please. I'm looking for this man.
Have you seen this man in the area?
He takes pictures.
It's an American photographer.
He could be injured. No?
Please, have you seen this man?
You're out of film.
Picturesque, huh?
They're lucky, you know, they still have their eyes.
You know what they say?
They say certain Chetnik extremists when they come to town... not only do they torture and kill everybody... they cut out their eyes to keep score.
You want to make this trip?
Are you sure?
-Well?
-No way.
They can't warn the snipers.
He says they'll see the
TV sing on the window.
There's always hope.
That's the first quarter mile.
-Fantastic.
-After that, they don't know.
After that, if we're still alive, it's Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.
Put your hand on the door handle.
You hear one shot... you hit the door and go down in the ditch. Ready, Marc?
Come on.
Step on it. Let's go.
I think we made it.
Shit! Don't jump. Don't jump.
Hang on. Hang on.
Get inside!
Get up! Get up!
Get inside!
Sarah!
God! Help me!
Put the head up!
There's nothing we can do.
-What she's saying?
-She's praying.
What the fuck is that?
It's tanks.
Oh shit!
Shit! My car!
They are fucking destroying my car!
Get down!
Get over to the wall! Come on!
Get away from the window, Marc.
Get away from the fucking window!
-I'm shaking like a fucking leaf.
-Get behind the fucking wall!
Fuck it!
-Shit!
-We're fucking dead.
White House, some analysis...
Nelson? What is it?
-What?
-Look at the name, sir.
Excuse-me
Yes, yes. What is it?
There is no note?
-Nothing?
-No.
Well, yes, there was, but very short.
No, everything's fine...
You know, nothing in particular.
No, no, it's quiet there now.
Yeah, relatively quiet.
It's removed from the fighting.
Yes, yes, I know, but there's no use worrying.
All right, thank you.
How long did it take for the film to get through?
Three days.
It's getting worse and worse.
Kyle Morris.
Who's he shooting for?
A.F.P.
-Did you call Simon?
-Yes, right away.
They don't know anything.
Just film they get from time to time.
It looks like Morris left this town called Binkowski... and followed the Serbian offensive.
Since then...
He sent his film along with Sarah's, that's all we know.
-She's looking for Harrison.
-Oh, great! Give the man a cigar.
She's off her rocket, for God's sake!
Look, look here.
-They're good pictures, though.
-Look at this.
No, there!
The children are so beautiful here.
I'd love to put them in the back and take them somewhere else.
Yeah, we should've bought the bus.
Hang on, we're in trouble here.
They're going to the front. Marc, put a hook in their ass, come on!
-Get out of the street.
-There's Vukovar. To the right!
Now we're gonna get there.
Now we're gonna get there.
-How many miles?
-About fifteen.
But between the checkpoints and the mines, it'll take us about 3 hours.
We're going to waltz right through this, right through!
Maybe the last waltz.
Go right! Go right!
Oh, Christ.
Now, where we go?
-What's this?
-Hold on! Hold on!
What's this?
Hang on, hang on!
Fucking mess!
Got to get the fuck out of here, guys! Fucking Serbs are coming!
-The shit is gonna fly!
-Where you coming from?
The road from Vukovar.
We couldn't get through.
It's a goddamn bloodbath! They are killing anything that moves.
A fucking conversation?
Move it, move it!
-Didn't you hear what I just said?
-Kyle, maybe he's right.
Get back in the fucking car!
We're going to Vukovar.
-Move the fucking car.
-He's coming from Vukovar!
You listen to your girlfriend.
It's crawling with death back there!
We've got go in a convoy. We gotta move to the border all the way...
...to the back, in a convoy!
-We're going to Vukovar, understand?
And you are one dead asshole.
Thanks a lot! Have a nice life.
Be safe.
Get back in the car. You want to take a rip back with this guy?
You want to get a nice hot bath in Zagreb?
I understand, stay. Why don't you grab your bag and stay!
And let you get shot, I don't care.
You're joking me?
That's good, that's what I want to hear.
-Fuck!
-Help me push it out.
All right, go!
Yeah, I see you.
Very funny. Fuck you too.
Shit! Christ!
It's a fucking inferno.
I'm not gonna stand this.
Come on, we gotta go.
-Where are we going?
-There's a basement over here.
Shit!
Get up.
Come on, Marc.
You okay?
I'm scared too.
We're all scared.
I really don't like dead bodies.
They know that our photos are going to tell the story of this war.
You understand that?
They know that's why we're here.
Alright? If we don't take them, nobody will.
They want us to do what we do.
Maybe I can wake up some guy who's yelling about a parking ticket!
Show him there are better things to be upset about.
It's good work your husband does, you know? Really good.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what? This?
This is for me. 'Cause I haven't done anything with my life... and I've always wanted to be a boy scout.
Just needed an opportunity.
You want to sleep or you want to stick it out, 'cause I've got...
Phenobarbitol and
I've got Benzedrine.
Come on! Look. If there's even an excuse to do drugs... you're looking at it.
Besides, when you sleep, you forget about food.
And I'm starving!
Are you hungry?
-Yes.
-Well, there's your dinner.
Harrison and I got into a fight the night of the Pulitzer.
I know.
-He told you about it?
-Yes.
Well, I feel bad about it now.
I mean... just stupid.
Don't worry about it,
I'll explain it to him.
Good night.
You think he's dead, right?
Are you kidding?
Harrison's immortal.
Gentleman!
Dumb and dumber, huh?
You're blind as well as ignorant.
Look at them.
I knew you guys were here.
I saw your car outside.
Sorry, you got a parking ticket.
I tried to stop her... but it was too late.
It had already started to rain.
'Evening, ma'am.
Nice to see you again.
Still kicking around our neck of the woods?
Sure am.
Where's Cathy?
Died.
Yesterday.
Took a sniper's bullet... right in the head.
Never felt a thing.
Where?
On the road to Vukovar.
Look at this.
Shit!
Shit!
Shit.
Put this on your face for the stink.
It's that girl in the yellow dress.
They fucking raped her!
Fucking raped her!
Are you okay?
Come on. Come on!
-Slow it up!
-All right, all right.
What is this?
-Slow it.
-All right, all right.
Jesus. What the fuck is that?
-Press.
-Press.
-Come on, buddy.
-God Almighty!
Come on, guys.
Ever get the feeling you're not welcome?
They're freaking out. They lose
Vukovar, they lose the war.
They lose the war, they're dead.
Oh, God!
Look at that dog.
Look!
Park it up. Looks like someone got here before us.
Look at that!
Yeager, fuck face, Pollack!
Don't tell me this war has gone prime time.
It's a miracle you're still alive.
So let's praise God and thank the
Lord and let's get back to Zagred.
-Doesn't anyone thank me?
-Thanks, Kyle.
Yeah. For?
-For taking care of Sarah.
-That's right.
-For taking care of Sarah.
-That's much nicer, you see?
''Thanks, Morris, for taking care of Sarah Lloyd.''
-Polite and nice.
-What I am not saying?
That's not enough?
-So now what? Vukovar is out?
-That's right!
-Can you let her speak for herself?
-Asshole!
There are Serbian snipers not a hundred yards away.
They are shooting fish in a barrel.
You can't get through.
What do you think the Croatians are getting ready for?
A party?
Doesn't that give you some inkling about what's going to happen here?
I'm going anyway.
You can't get in to Vukocar, man.
Nobody gets in nobody gets out!
All you can do in Vukovar is die.
What the fuck do you know?
Jumping out of an airplane.
What you're fucking looking at me for? I'm trying to help you, guys!
-What is this with you?
-I got photos to take.
You got photos to take! Take them!
Nobody is telling you not to take!
-That's enough!
-You don't have to take her!
-It's enough.
-I'm going, Yeager. I have to go.
If there's half a chance he's in that hospital. I have to go.
He's dead!
He's dead, Sarah! Please!
Sarah!
You'll run out of film, Stevenson.
What you're doing here, anyway?
Get on with your life, write a book or something!
-Write a book!
-Well...
I know why you are here.
I know you came for her... but you're not going to change her mind from doing what she needs to do.
Not unless you show her
Harrison's body. So... do what I do. All right?
Help her.
We better both pray that some day we find somebody... that loves us the way she loves him.
Understand?
There was this mercenary, this Frenchman guy...
Fuck!
He saw a guy, an American photographer, about 6, 8 days ago.
The Frenchman said he looked pretty bad, but he was alive... but he might be in there, in that hospital.
Well, next stop, Vukovar!
We went to see the base Commander
to ask him to let us leave.
We were exhausted. The fear was eating through us at that stage.
We knew the horror that was... waiting for us.
If she had hesitated for one second, we would've turned back.
She didn't hesitate.
So, we got ready.
We leave at ten-second intervals.
The highway should be about 3/ 4 of a mile behind that wooded area.
We run for one minute, stop for one minute, then go again.
Any shooting, we stop and count again from zero.
Any one of us catches up with anyone else, we wait to... re-establish the distance. Anybody gets wounded, no going backwards.
The next one will take care of it, okay?
What if the last one gets wounded?
You go first.
Then Kyle, then Sarah.
I'll bring up the rear.
-I'll go first.
-Sarah, please.
-Okay, Stevenson?
-Okay.
Go. Anytime you're ready.
Go. Go.
Sarah!
-Where are we?
-Okay, listen.
You gotta take this off.
Take this off.
You're all right?
Smile. Stay cool.
They can't get over us making it past their snipers.
They admire strength, they hate weakness. Keep your chin up!
They think we're fabulous.
Your leg is bad?
It's okay.
Will they let us through?
Whatever's going on the other side they don't want any witness.
Relax. Put a smile on your face.
They love us.
They think we're hilariously funny.
See that big guy there?
Say hi to the big guy.
Nobody's made it through before us.
What do we do?
-Walk. Walk.
-Thank you.
-They know where the hospital is?
-We'll find it, we'll find it.
Listen! Listen!
-It's time to go back to Zagreb.
-It's so stupid it might work.
Don't turn around!
Don't turn around!
You want a photo?
Keep walking!
We kept walking, l don't know
how far, how long but... then we were in the streets of Vukovar.
lt wasn't fighting.
lt was extermination.
They would later call it ''ethnic
cleansing'', we were watching this.
Bayonets, knives, teeth.
Children, they slit the throats
of children.
There were corpses everywhere.
There was one woman. She had a
sign around her neck saying:
''l carry the child of a Serb.''
And I asked myself,
''What are we doing here?''
Get back, get back.
Bastards!
They're bastards!
You bastards!
lt was unbelievable. l was asking
myself, ''What are we doing here?''
''Have we gone crazy or what?'' We
walked straight into the darkness.
And we weren't gonna
come out again.
Photographers!
Photographers!
That's the fucking hospital.
Come on, come on.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Go! Go! Go!
Come on, Marc.
Over here.
Get inside!
The fucking Arkan guys!
Man! They're crazy!
Marc!
Marc, get over here!
Come on, come on!
Fuck! Fuck!
-Come on.
-I don't want to be here.
-I don't want to stay here.
-Come on.
My bag! My bag!
I don't wanna go.
-It smells! It stinks of death!
-Take it easy, Marc.
No, no. We gotta go!
We can't stay here.
-You can't go out there!
-We can't!
Stay put!
Just listen to me!
They're going to kill us.
I'm begging you, Kyle.
Please. I got to go now!
Get your hands off me!
Stay over here!
-You can't go out!
-Get off!
Hang in there.
Look at me.
You're looking for a dead man?
There's thousands of them!
I know, I know.
Marc, come on.
It's all right. Look, they're gone.
They're gone, Marc.
Kyle! Kyle!
I got you! I got you!
I got you. Don't worry.
You're gonna be all right. Come on.
Come on!
Come on, I got you.
Going to be all right.
Shit.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Shit!
It's almost nightfall.
If the Serbs attack, they are going to hit the hospital first.
It there's any hope in getting
Harrison, we got to move now.
And we'll come back...
This is what we came for, right?
God-damn it.
All right, all right.
We better get going.
All right, all right!
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Come on, come on.
God-damn it.
This way.
We can't, Sarah. It's too late.
We got to get to shelter! Come on!
Marc, shelter!
Sarah!
Sarah!
I'm looking for an American man.
-Help me!
-Take a photo!
They must know!
They must know!
Harrison!
Harrison!
Harrison!
Harrison! Harrison!
It's me, Sarah!
Harrison. My God!
My God, Harrison.
Harrison.
It's me, Sarah.
It's me, Sarah.
Harrison.
What's wrong with you?
Harrison!
Come on!
Come on!
No one knows how Harrison
left the hospital.
He was suffering from what they call ''bomb blast effect''.
It's trauma caused by a bomb exploding in close proximity.
Harrison was delirious.
Sarah took off his dirty bandages.
And realized he had burns
over most of his body.
He was in unbearable, unspeakable
pain, but he said nothing.
He was somewhere else.
He couldn't eat. So...
Sarah would give him little pieces of bread dipped in water...
like you would a wounded bird
or something.
lt was beautiful.
She kept talking to him,
reassuring him.
She seemed...
she seemed at peace somehow.
l know it sounds crazy
to say but...
she seemed almost happy.
November the 1 8th, 1 991 , silence was restored.
Ever since that day
I've known that peace is silence.
Mile Dedakovic had ordered his
Croatian troops to surrender...
after eighty-seven days of siege.
And finally Vukovar felt.
Milosevic had won.
ln that one battle,
the battle of Vukovar...
over fifteen thousand
people lost their lives.
Come on, it's all right.
It's okay.
Cesar is enormous.
They change so much at this age.
He's...
In the last few months... he's become a young man.
I think I did the right thing by not bringing the kids to the hospital.
I didn't want them to see you.
I mean, when you weren't well, you know...
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Hi, daddy.
Okay. Margaux.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Watch this, daddy.
Daddy? Watch this.
I'm going to do the submarine.
Daddy?
Come here.
Sit down. Sit down!
Sit down.
Sit down.
I'm going to do the submarine.
I took care of your flowers.
Not one of them got ruined.
I'm going to do some work.
I'm going to do the submarine again.
Harrison?
Harrison!
Sarah.
Hi, Sarah.
Cesar took care of the flowers.
All this time, he told me he took care of the flowers.
My little boy took care of the flowers.
What happened to me?
They live in St. Louis now.
They've got a house there ,
not far from the Botanical Gardens.
Harrison's doing fine, thank God.
He never watches the TV news
anymore, that's for sure...
and he takes pictures of flowers.
Fletcher Ridge, Illinois. Large enough to have a U.P.S. office... and a driver named Jarod Harper.
Very good, Broots.
Any physical description?
Size, weight and color all match Jarod perfectly.
And he got the job at almost exactly the same time that...
- I calculated his position.
- Call Lyle.
- I already have. He's on his way.
- Great. Let's go.
[Cell Phone Rings, Beeps]
- What?
- [Mr. Parker] Angel.
- Angel, I have to see you.
- [Whispering] Daddy?
The junkyard near the Quentin Street
Overpass, and hurry.
- Daddy!
- [Dial Tone]
You look bothered, Miss Parker.
Don't you have a bake sale to organize?
I know these are stressful times for you.
That's why I want you to have this.
It's a prayer card.
I slept with it under my pillow.
- That explains the grease stains.
- I asked for it to be filled... with the answers you need.
- God bless.
- You too.
Parker?
Are you coming?
I'll be back.
- What about Jarod?
- What about Lyle?
Um, buy me some time.
A few hours.
[Siren Wails]
[Second Siren Wailing]
Ouch!
Sorry, mister.
It got away from me.
- Wow. This is a great car.
- Thanks.
- I bought it with my tooth fairy money.
- "Tooth fairy"?
You know, where you put your tooth under your pillow... the tooth fairy takes it and leaves you money.
Didn't you ever get that when you were a kid?
I wasn't really a kid when I was a kid.
Thanks, mister.
[Bell Tolling]
[Woman] Would you just shut up?
I don't want to talk about this anymore.
Damn it, Sarah, we don't have a choice.
Cam, we don't need to be making these arrangements.
The hell we don't! These people at the hospital already showed... they don't care whether us Larsens live or die- Billy, come on.
- Cam, the doctors said-
- I know what the doctors said.
I know what needs to be done.
- Why do you have guns?
- [Engine Revs]
Cam! What are you planning to do?
- I didn't start this, Sarah.
- Cameron!
- Go home!
- [Screams]
Come on, damn it!
[Crying]
Damn it!
Here you go.
Use mine.
[Beeps, Dials]
- [Line Ringing]
- [Woman] 9-1-1. Can I help you?
Yes, ma'am. My name is Sarah Larsen.
My brothers are on the way to the hospital. They have guns.
I don't know! Look, you just gotta do something... before somebody gets hurt, okay?
- [Sobs]
- [Beeps]
I appreciate- Mister?
[Woman On Police Radio] All units, hostage situation at Saint Mary's Hospital.
- Men considered armed and dangerous.
- [Sirens Wailing]
[People Clamoring]
[Cam] Billy, hurry up and get those windows painted.
Nobody moves and nobody gets hurt!
We're all gonna be here awhile, so just get comfortable.
[Woman On P.A.]
All medical personnel.
Prepare to evacuate all non critical patients from the first floor.
- How you doin', Pop?
- [Machine Beeping]
[Man]
Keep evacuating!
Everybody sit tight and wait for my command.
If there's a clear shot, you let me know.
Well, that's an interesting philosophy.
Shoot first, ask questions later.
- Who are you?
- Special Agent Jarod Jackson, Chicago F.B.I.
I'm the hostage negotiator.
- This is my show now.
- Damn!
[Man Narrating]
There are Pretenders among us.
[Jarod]
I was taken from my family.
36 hours and he's already demonstrating more talent than any of our others.
How many people died because of what I thought up?
Since I broke out, I've spent every moment searching for my past.
[Miss Parker]
He's a Pretender-
A genius who can become anyone that he wants to be.
- The Centre wants him alive.
- Preferably.
[Miss Parker]
He defends the weak and abused.
Life's a gift.
- You a doctor?
- I am today.
Best we can figure, there's a half a dozen people being held.
Including three patients in the seized wing that could die... in the next few hours without treatment.
- Kill that alarm!
- The hostage-takers?
Billy Larsen. He's 21.
Good kid, with no priors.
Big brother Cam's 28.
He's a hothead... with a sheet that goes all the way back to high school.
- Weapons?
- Rifle and shotgun, according to their sister.
- I'll need her brought here as soon as possible.
- Yes, sir.
- They make any demands?
- Nothing yet.
- What's your read on the situation?
- You're the big badge.
- You tell me.
- They've isolated the situation... to a specific area of the hospital where their father is a patient.
My guess, it's some sort of grievance against the hospital.
- How do you figure that?
- Like you said, I'm the big badge.
Let's go to work.
This is F.B.I. Special Agent
Jarod Jackson.
I want to talk to you about your demands.
If you've got something on your minds... now might be a good time to discuss it.
This is between us and the hospital.
You've got your father in there.
Innocent people who need medical attention.
Neither one of us want anyone to die here today.
So why don't you tell me what you want...
- and we can end this thing.
- [Cam] I want you to write this down.
Not a penny more, not a penny less.
Over and out.
All right.
I'll see what I can do.
Need to establish a direct phone line into that room.
- Yes, sir.
- What if they don't answer?
Hell, they could have already killed somebody, and we'd never know it.
Where can I get blueprints of this building?
- I can get 'em here 10 ten minutes.
- All right.
I need a fiber-optics video camera, with a transmitter and microwave intercept.
Hold on, Einstein.
This town has two red lights, three hardware stores.
- Meaning?
- Meaning, if you want a hammer,
I can help you out.
You want to build a nuclear reactor, you're outta luck.
- This town have an electronics store?
- That we got.
I'm going to make a list of things I need.
Get these to me, A.S.A.P.
[Engine Revving]
[Beeping]
[BabyCrying]
[Crying Continues]
Angel.
- Ugh.
- You weren't followed?
- Daddy, you look-
- Oh, I'm sorry to scare you.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
- Daddy, what the hell is going on?
- Come on, come on.
Come on back here.
Sit down.
- [Panting]
- Where have you been?
Underground. This is the last place they'd look. [Panting]
Now, look.
There's a strongbox in SL-22.
- In a panel behind the fire hose.
- Strongbox?
Yeah. It's filled with cash.
Bring it to me.
But don't tell anybody.
Life and death, understand?
- No, I don't.
- Brigitte and I had to leave our hiding place.
I need the money to last us a few weeks.
- Daddy, if I knew why you were running-
- [Cell Phone Rings]
- [Beeps]
- What?
Bad news. Jarod never showed up for his shift at the U.P.S. job.
- We missed him!
- Lyle?
He's looking for you, and he is peeved.
What else is new? I want you to keep searching for Jarod.
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- [Kissing Sound]
Daddy?
[Woman] This whole thing is gonna turn into a nightmare.
Nobody's gonna want to get treated at the O.K. Corral.
- Who are you?
- Rebecca Simons, hospital administrator.
Dr. Stephen Franklin, chief cardiologist.
They spoke to the Larsen boys before they pulled their guns.
- I'm listening.
- Family brought their father.
- Jake Larsen.
- He was complaining of chest pains.
- Family thought it might be a heart attack.
- He was admitted to C.C.U.?
Yes, yes. I diagnosed him with a type of arrhythmia known as atrial fibrillation.
It's painful, but it's not life-threatening.
- Apparently, his sons had a different opinion.
- Maybe I should have kept...
Mr. Larsen one more night to ease their minds.
Does this figure mean anything to you, Doctor?
- Not in particular. What is it?
- [Sighs] That's a good question.
Agent Jackson, there are patients in there... who will die in the next few hours if left untreated.
[Sighs]
Excuse me.
Sarah, my name is Jarod.
- The man with the telephone.
- I'm with the F.B.I.
I think it's safe to say that neither one of us woke up this morning expecting to be here.
- [Sighs]
- I realize that you're going through... a very difficult time right now.
But I have to understand:
Why are your brothers doing this?
Look, I want to end this thing without anybody getting hurt.
But the truth is, I can only hold those men off for so long.
Move over there.
Get that door.
Everything was always pretty crazy in our family.
But things seemed to really come undone after Mom died.
- Especially for Cam.
- Your mom was here, at this hospital.
Same room where Daddy is.
[Sighs] She was so sick when they sent her home... and... she died a few days later.
And now your father's here.
Look, my brothers may be doing the wrong thing... but they must be doing it for the right reason- and I am not gonna help you kill them for it.
Agent Jackson.
Got the equipment you wanted.
All right. Let's see what's going on in there.
- [Heart Monitor Beeping]
- [Moaning]
- What are we gonna do, Cam?
- I'm thinking!
[Softly]
I'm thinking.
[Billy] I hope you know what you're doin', big brother.
- I don't get it.
- Sometimes it helps to be a fly on the wall.
Or in this case, the airvent.
Grab those blueprints.
This will give us a better sense of the space where the hostages are being held... windows, exits-
[Deputy]
I'll be damned.
I could use this to get a clean shot. I have men on the roof, next to the seized wing.
Isn't it your job to consider everybody's safety?
My job is to save the lives of those civilians inside!
If I hesitate, and one innocent person dies, it's my fault.
I won't make that mistake.
The sheriff seems a little on edge.
[Deputy]
He has his reasons.
[Jake] Cam! What the hell do you think you're doin'?
- [Cam] I know what I'm doin', Pop.
- You wouldn't be here... if your mama was still alive.
Well, she's not, and I am.
Stop talkin'.
Just get some rest.
Man, there are guns and badges all over the place down there.
[Sighs] Well, what the hell did you think was gonna happen?
Come in here with guns, they'd leave a parking ticket on our car?
Just keep lookout.
Sheriff says, kill the air and the lights.
[Motors Decelerating]
You two get down!
- [Jake Gasping]
- What now?
[Phone Ringing]
- Yeah.
- Cam. This is Agent Jackson.
Turn the lights and air back on!
All right, I'll give you what you want, and you give me a couple of hostages.
- Why should I trust you?
- You have my word.
No harm will come to you or your brother, as long as we keep talking.
It's going to get really warm in there.
Now, do we have a deal?
Cam. You can trust me.
- Cam? Talk to me.
- [Gunshot]
Get down!
Everybody get down!
[Screaming]
[Gunshots Continue]
I had Cam's trust until your sniper got trigger-happy.
Hey! Cam Larsen isn't a man who can be trusted.
He incited a riot while he was in prison.
Did you know that?
The guards were beating the prisoners, and they were convicted on brutality charges.
Did you know that?
I got Cam on the line.
- Cam.
- Are you guys crazy?
I had nothing to do with that shooting, I swear to you.
Look, i-it's important that I come in there and speak to you face-to-face.
I'm not here to talk!
I'm here to save my dad's life.
Understand? It's too hot in here.
Turn on the air, now.
Yes. Yes, I will turn the air conditioning back on, I promise.
- Now, can I come in there?
- [Sighs Deeply]
Okay. But just you.
Unarmed. Ten minutes.
- All right. Ten minutes.
- [Line Clicks]
- Those are Cam's kids.
- I had them brought in.
- To get under his skin?
- To get into his heart.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]
- What?
- Where are you?
- Never mind. Did you find Jarod?
I was scanning police chatter in Fletcher Ridge... and I came across a hostage negotiation situation there at a hospital.
- F.B.I. involvement.
- And?
It sounded like something that Jarod would be drawn to...
- so I-I contacted the Chicago office of the F.B.I.-
- Let me guess.
- No F.B.I. involvement.
- If there were any agents on the job there... they would have come from the Chicago office, and they hadn't sent anybody.
[Groans] He never left town. Get the jet ready, and I'll be back as soon as I can.
- [Softly] What about Lyle?
- Lyle who?
[Hangs Up Receiver, Beeps]
Hmm.
I love ice cream.
[Smacking Lips]
I want to help your dad, but I'm going to need your help to do it.
[Siren Wailing]
Last night, Daddy was yelling at Billy and Sarah.
- He was angry?
- He said the hospital was gonna send Grandpa Jake home to die.
Just like they did Grandma.
He said they were murderers.
- Murderers.
- [Sighs]
- Looks like you just lost a tooth.
- It fell out.
Are you going to put it under your pillow?
For the tooth fairy?
- Tonight.
- Wow.
- How much you figure you're gonna get?
- Mm-
- Maybe a dollar.
- A dollar.
How would you...
- [Helicopter Whirring]
- like to make five?
[Helicopter Passing By]
It's Agent Jackson.
I'm coming in, and I'm unarmed.
[Heart Monitor Beeping]
Check him out.
He's clean.
Could have got somebody killed, shootin' in here like that.
That was a mistake. That officer has been removed from the line.
We're not exactly talking about an elite police force out there.
- [Cam] Tell me about it.
- So, are you ready to end this thing, Cam?
Get your father taken care of?
I know you care about him.
That's why you're doing this.
- You don't know nothin'.
- Why don't you explain it to me?
- That's an odd price to place on somebody's life.
- It's not my price. It's theirs.
- [Moaning]
- Oh, she's gettin' worse.
- Hey-hey!
- So, what are you gonna do?
You gonna keep her here and let her die?
Her life for your father's, is that it?
- Cam, maybe we should let her go, huh?
- Billy, shut up!
- [Gasps]
- You're not a killer, Cam.
You let this woman die, and you're going to spend the rest of your life in prison.
You and Billy, here.
- Think about your children.
- My kids.
- They won't understand this.
- Can't believe how much your little boy looks like you.
- You talked to my boy?
- It'sprocedure. Oh, Cody.
He asked me to give you this.
[Helicopter Whirring]
- So, how much do you want me to leave for him?
- How much?
Money. From the tooth fairy.
Right. Tooth fairy.
You got a dollar?
- All I got's a five.
- Give it here.
- You're gonna give him five bucks for a baby tooth?
- Just give me the money.
You walk outta here now, you can still put this money under your son's pillow yourself.
I can't leave him.
[Sighs]
Man, you don't get it, do you?
This isn't just about my father. It's about every person out there who is sick... and deserves to be treated with dignity.
They're gonna send this man home. Does he look like he should go home to you?
- [Gasping]
- At least, give me a hostage.
- [Scoffs]
- You gotta work with me here, Cam.
There are a lot of people out there looking for any reason to shoot you... and your little brother over here.
[Woman Breathing With
Diffilculty, Coughing]
All right. Take that lady.
Take her. Help him.
Unhook her, and get her out of here.
- What about the others?
- One at a time.
Allright, allright, allright.
One at a time.
You're doing a good thing here, Cam.
[Chattering On Police Radio]
If some of those patients don't get treatment real soon, we could have a disaster here.
- Meaning?
- Maneuver Cam to a window.
One shot, and it's over.
Why is it that you feel that bullets are the only option?
One shot.
Deputy, may I have a word with you?
[Heart Monitor Beeping]
[Spitting]
- What's your name?
- Lindsay.
L-Lindsay Tyler.
Shouldn't bite your nails,
Lindsay. It's a bad habit.
- I know.
- Y-You don't remember me, do you?
- Should I?
- Cindy Perkins?
Junior high school,
Sadie Hawkins dance-
I asked you to dance once, and you said yes?
- [Sighs]
- I had stringy hair, braces-
Yeah, yeah.
You chased me around the gym all night.
What was that, 10, 15 years ago?
You kept asking the band to play your favorite song.
- "Dream Weaver." [Chuckles]
- That's a damn fine song.
[Helicopter Passing Overhead]
You know, my dad died of heart problems.
Th-That's why I went into nursing.
Your father sort of reminds me of my dad.
[Jake Coughing]
Look, Cindy-
[Sighs Deeply]
I'm sorry about all this.
I never meant to-
- Cam?
- [Alarm Beeping]
- Cam, come here.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
He's not breathing!
- [Ringing]
- I need a doctor in here now! Now!
All right, Cam. I'll send one in.
Get your gear.
- [Doctor] No.
- What did you say?
Those men are heavily armed, and they've threatened the lives of innocent people.
Unless you can assure me of my safety, I'm not going anywhere.
- Get the lights back on in that room.
- What are you gonna do?
Agent Jackson.
Agent Jackson!
Cam, it's Agent Jackson.
I'm coming in.
- I asked for a doctor!
- Cam, he's going into cardiac arrest!
- Let him in, Cam.
- [Alarm Buzzing]
- We didn't come here to kill our own father.
- [Alarm Continues]
- [Assisted Breathing]
- Come in!
- Easy, easy!
- Where is the doctor?
[Jarod] There isn't a doctor available.
I can handle this.
- [Exhales]
- [Huffs]
I hope you can handle this.
'Cause if my old man dies, so do you.
[One Long Beep]
- [Cindy] He's been flat for 15 seconds.
- [Electrical Whining]
- Paddles charged?
- Clear.
- [Electrical Thumping]
- [Cindy] Nothing. 25 seconds.
- Talk to him.
- What?
I need him to fight.
Tell him a story from your past.
Something you did together.
Talk to him. Clear.
- [Thumps]
- Nothing.
- We're running out of time. Talk to him.
- [Cindy] 40 seconds.
Dad, remember when I was five years old... how you used to take me hunting up near Patchett Lake?
I'm going to 360 joules.
Keep talking.
- [Paddles Charging]
- Used to wake me up early, while it was still dark out.
I used to hate gettin'up so early, but you said it was important...
- to get out before the sun.
- [Jarod] Clear!
You told me that a sunrise in the woods was as close to God as a breathin' man could get.
- [Paddles Whining]
- Remember when you said that?
Remember that, Dad?
- [Cindy] One minute.
- Clear.
- [Thumping]
- [Gasping]
- Come on, old man. Fight! Don't give up! Fight.
- [Cindy] 70 seconds.
- Don't leave us, please.
- [Paddles Charging]
- We need you.
- I'm gonna hit him again. Clear!
Come on, you can fight this!
Come on, Pop.
We need you.
Cody and Kerry need their grandpa.
If we don't get him back quick, there could be permanent damage.
Don't die on me, Dad. Hang in there.
Come on. Don't die on me, Dad.
- Come on, pop!
- I'm getting a pulse.
[Steady Beeping]
They really train 'em up there at the F.B.I. Academy.
[Police Chattering On Radio]
Let's get a closer look.
[Whirring, Banging]
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know. The signal went dead.
- [Panting] Look, Cam.
You've made all the right choices up till now.
Let me take another hostage out of here.
- Okay. Yeah. You, Cindy. Go home.
- No.
- What?
- I don't leave until you do.
For my father.
I-I'll go.
- I've got to get that picture back.
- [Jarod, Indistinct]
- [Deputy] We've still got sound, Sheriff.
- [Whirring, Banging]
What the hell is this?
You've been watchin' us the whole time!
I should blow you away right now!
I knew I couldn't trust you people!
- [Moaning]
- No, no!
No. Cam. Not like this.
[Helicopter Whirring]
All right. Get out.
Take her with you.
No more talking! Just get out!
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Please take care of her.
- Are you out of your mind?
- Hey, it was an accident!
You could have gotten all of us killed in there. We can't keep pushing him.
- Why can't you get that through your head?
- I've had a bellyful of you.
- Oh, yeah? And what is that supposed to mean?
- You're the big badge.
You figure it out.
[Keypad Beeping]
- [Line Ringing, Clicking]
- Alice? Get me the number for the F.B.I. office in Chicago.
[Sighs]
[Sydney] I doubt you'll find Miss Parker searching through her desk.
[Broots] We saw her this morning.
I think she had some errands to run.
She didn't say where she was going?
You know your sister. You know she dances to the beat of a different drummer.
- [Slams Book Closed]
- So I've noticed.
You two wouldn't lie to me, would you?
So, a-anybody see the, uh, 
Redskins game this weekend?
Agent Jackson. Any idea when
I might be allowed back in my office?
- No idea.
- Oh. [Sighs]
That's very impressive, the way you handled that code situation.
I didn't have much of a choice, did I?
Tell me something.
How are insurance claims processed at this hospital?
In the middle of a hostage situation, and you're wondering about billing procedure?
I'm just curious.
For instance, an H.M.O. claim.
H.M.O.'s rely on the information provided by the attending physician.
So a particular medical procedure would be approved or denied...
- based upon your recommendation.
- Yeah, that.
And the recommendation of the facilities administrator.
- Rebecca Simons.
- In the case of this hospital, yes.
What percentage of major surgeries have been denied at this hospital?
- [Sighs] Oh, I-I don't know.
- Take a guess.
[Stammering]
I-I don't know. Fifty percent?
Sixty-eight percent: 11 percentage points higher than the national average.
- Why do you think that is?
- Maybe there are just a lot of healthy people in this town.
- Maybe.
- [Helicopter Whirring]
[Dialing Phone]
- [Line Clicking]
- Uh, we need to talk.
[Siren Wailing]
[Scoffs]
You look like hell.
[Chuckling]
That's the way it is when you're dyin'.
Got yourself in a real mess here, boy.
Like everything else in my life.
Look, maybe I didn't do the things
I should have when you were small.
Hell, I- I was makin' it up as I went.
But I taught you kids right from wrong. I did that.
- I'm tryin' to save you, Dad.
- Why?
Because we're a family.
I never knew my own old man.
Not more than a smack in the head now and then.
I just did the best that I could, and-
[Sobs]
When your mama died-
I think a little bit of me went too.
Guess we've been fightin' the same pain.
[Sobbing]
I miss her. Every day.
Me too, Pop.
[Exhales]
[Jarod]
This is the exact amount this hospital charges for heart bypass surgery.
- What are you talkin' about?
- Jake Larsen has sky-high levels of creatine kinase enzyme...
- in his blood.
- So?
- His fingertips are blue from lack of oxygen.
- I still don't follow.
He has heart disease.
He's headed for a massive heart attack.
His only chance of survival is heart bypass surgery.
The same surgery this hospital denied him. [Sighs]
- Who the hell are you?
- Excuse me?
I called the F.B.I. Nobody's ever heard of an Agent Jarod Jackson.
Well, it's a big agency.
Maybe you talked to the wrong person.
If any of those people in there die, it's on your head.
You understand what that means, to have somebody's blood on your hands?
As a matter of fact, I do.
And so do you.
Your deputy told me about that hostage situation a year ago at the grocery store.
The way you lured that perpetrator into the doorway... and hesitated to take the kill shot.
Did he tell you how that same hostage-taker took his gun... and shot to death a 15-year-old stock boy?
Did he describe the sick feeling 
I get every time I see that boy's parents on the street?
- You did what you thought was the right thing to do.
- And an innocent boy... lost his life.
That's the blood I have on my hands...
Agent Jackson.
[Siren Wailing]
Certainly has been a long day, hasn't it?
- Agent Jackson.
- I was wondering if you and I could have a little talk.
Oh, well, the truth is,
I'm late for a meeting. Perhaps later.
I know about the cover-up concerning
Jake Larsen's coronary disease.
But what could an H.M.O. possibly have to gain by such a cover-up?
I saw you and Dr. Franklin arguing in the parking lot. I know what's going on.
We could talk about it here in private, or we could go downtown... and talk under the glare of the television cameras.
It's up to you.
Is it just for the money?
Or is it something more personal?
I see the way you and
Dr. Franklin are together.
My girlfriends and I... used to dream about meeting a doctor.
Falling in love, and living happily ever after.
I actually believed that's the way it would be for Stephen and me.
Your signature is on the release forms for all the patients in question.
I made my decisions based on
Franklin's recommendations.
I looked the other way in one case, next thing I knew, I was-
All for money.
Franklin was getting kickbacks from the H.M.O.'s for not doing expensive surgeries.
By denying certain procedures to critically ill patients... he saves the H.M.O. hundreds of thousands of dollars.
- And makes a nice percentage.
- I swear to you...
I didn't know about Jake Larsen until his sons took over the hospital.
Franklin said that you questioned him, and he threatened to expose me... if I said anything, and-
I was afraid.
Not half as afraid as those patients who were sent home to die.
- The key you gave me doesn't work.
- Really? Huh.
Must have given you the wrong one.
Here, let me try this one.
- [Key Turning Lock]
- Yep. That works. [Chuckling]
Angel, I'm sorry I had to drag you into this.
"Baby Parker."
Wh-What was that?
Oh, it's nothing.
- It looked like a medical record.
- It's ancient history.
- It is mine, or Lyle's?
- It doesn't matter!
Trust me. Some day, when I have more time,
I'll explain everything to you.
- But right now, I need your gun.
- My gun?
This is about that hit out on you.
Yeah, the bastards are closin' in.
- Who ordered it?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I do know... this... is the only thing that really matters.
It's the future of our family.
It's the heir to the Parker name, and it's growing inside Brigitte.
The baby'll be here soon.
- What else can I do?
- Well, the key is still Jarod.
Bring him back, and it'll be just like it was.
[Cell Phone Ringing]
[Ringing]
- [Beeping]
- I'm on my way.
[No Audible Dialogue]
[Phone Ringing]
- Yeah?
- Dr. Franklin?
Agent Jackson. Cam and Billy Larsen have tapped into hospital records... and are trying to find information about patients who were denied care.
- Can you cut them off?
- We tried.
I suggest I download everything. I wouldn't want you to lose any patient records.
No! No, I'll, uh-
I'll handle that.
I-I know which files are important.
Can I get back in my office yet?
I don't think that's a good idea.
Things are still pretty dangerous up here.
I couldn't assure your safety.
Dr. Franklin?
- Dr. Franklin.
- I'm on my way up.
If you think that's best.
[Coughs]
- [Gunshots]
- [Glass Breaking]
- What happened?
- I was shot! The Larsen boys.
They're crazy!
They're coming down the hallway.
They say they know who's responsible for trying to kill their father.
I've gotta get out of here.
[Grunts]
- Doctor?
- I can't breathe! [Panting]
My heart!
[Groans]
[Panting]
What's happening to me?
The same thing that you let happen to Jake Larsen.
You're having a massive heart attack.
[Gasping] Wha-
What have you done to me?
I laced your keyboard with a tricyclic antidepressant.
It's absorbed through the fingertips.
Speeds up the heart's rhythm.
That's why I faked getting shot... told you that the Larsen boys were coming down the hallway-
I wanted to scare you. You see, adrenaline, it really increases the effects of the drug.
- [Gasping] Why?
- Because of what you did to Jake Larsen.
Because of the drugs you gave him to cover up the symptoms of his coronary disease.
- [Groaning] Who are you?
- I'm everyone.
I'm no one.
If you tell me the truth...
I can bring your heart back to normal.
Look, we're all on the same side here- [Grunting]
There's no reason to let this become a problem.
Oh, it became a problem when you aligned yourself with an H.M.O.... that cared more about profits than taking care of patients.
God, Larsen wouldn't have survived another year no matter what we did.
That is not the point!
You're a doctor!
Your job is to give care, not take it away!
- [Groans In Pain]
- That cyanosis must really be setting in right now.
You should really seek treatment.
Or you can die within minutes.
- Please! Please!
- How many people?
How many people did you let die so you could stuff your pockets?
[Grunts] All right,
I took kickbacks from the H.M.O.'s... to send patients home- now please, help me!
- Please!
- Sorry, Doc.
But your claim has been denied.
No! No.
[Sobbing, Groaning]
[Chattering On Police Radio]
- Is he really gonna die?
- I just laced his keyboard with trigoxin.
He has nothing more than a really bad case of heartburn.
And he'll probably lose bladder control for a couple of days.
[Chattering On Police Radio]
[Grunting]
- [Sighs]
- [Siren Wailing]
I'm gonna drop some of the charges against the brothers.
Let the judge deal with the rest.
Considering the circumstances, I think they've suffered enough for one family.
I think you're right.
Thank you for keeping me from doing something stupid.
I guess we can't let the mistakes of our past ruin our future.
Will you excuse me, Sheriff?
Excuse me. Are you from the Chicago office?
- Are you a reporter?
- Blue Cove Gazette.
Have you been involved during the entire crisis?
No, I just arrived on the scene.
There was another negotiator involved.
Our source from your Chicago office...
- tells us he was an impostor.
- That's what we've been told.
- And where is he?
- No idea.
I don't know how he did it, but witnesses say he really knew what he was doing.
Excuse me.
It's your fault we missed him.
[Mr. Parker]
Now don't tell anybody.
Life and death, understand? Someday, when I have more time, I'll explain everything to you.
Well, the key is still Jarod.
Bring him back, and it'll be just like it was.
You're gonna be held accountable for this, Parker.
I know. Let's go home.
Before the war, my whole family lived in Loszi.
How are they?
I don't know.
Probably died during the Jewish revolution.
The last time my mother wrote to me, was a month before the war.
I don't know anything at all.
My dear bird
Your way home will be filled with peace.
You return from a nation of passions.
When you left my residence that winter, do you know how your voice had touched me?
Sing and confide, my dear bird.
The wonder in that remote land.
Tell me, in that beautiful country, are there such sorrows and pains?
The dew on the mountain, are they pearls or teardrops?
How are you, the limpid streams of Jordan River?
How are you, mountains and valleys? and the brothers who sow the field in tears.
Are they happily harvesting?
I only have wings to fly.
In the country of dates and almonds!
Rosa is my inspiration.
My father and I,
We joined the armed forces in 1939.
He passed away in Modoson.
But I was rescued after the war ended.
I went to Sosnowick.
The neighbors told me, in the end of 1939 winter,
They were all taken away, no one knew where they went.
Rosa was lucky, we sent her to Siberia.
Siberia? Would she survive?
Are you talking about Russia?
Yes, I meant Russia.
You should talk to Rosa about Russia.
How did you survive Siberia?
Nowadays I miss the ice- and snow-covered mountain.
The winter, forest, and snowstorms there.
It is always very hot here.
It was very cold there.
It should be very cold there now.
I never realized it is so cold here!
But it will be over very soon.
Follow me!
Everyone, pull yourself together!
To the right!
Ready?
Left, right, left!
Klibanov, I tell you, take these to the kibbutz!
We will regroup at Fagenfao.
Other people wait here!
You don't have to wait for anyone, we'll take care of everything.
Did you pick up Rosa?
Don't leave here, and everyone else!
Don't stay, we'll meet again in Fayoukela.
What are you doing? Go on, forward!
What about her?
Moussa, put this on.
Go forward, go, go!
Come over, follow me.
Englishman!
Are you all right?
I'm exhausted.
Would you like some water?
No.
Did you see Yanush?
No, you?
I last saw him on the beach.
Then it was a chaos.
Did he leave you anything to eat?
No?
My box is still on the beach.
All of them?
Yes, all the food.
Do you remember how we got here?
No I don't.
How about now?
No.
We have to stay in the camp for the night.
Moussa!
Wait for us!
I'm going to cry, and my tears will sweep the whole world.
I've cried for my fate and for my people.
Cry a good cry for all that was gone. that we didn't even get to say goodbye to.
Dad was scared, and mom was crying.
They were leaning on me and said,
"don't leave, don't leave us."
Mom is a Jew, and you know...
My younger brother Linka said to me,
"I'll go with you, I'll look after you"
He wanted to look after me and my younger sister.
Dad assured me to leave them.
Run away, and get out of here.
There is no time to waste.
The night fell in a summer holiday.
They walked me out of the house.
When I got to the railroad intersection, they went home.
And I have not seen them ever since.
I hopped on the car, and grabbed the handle.
Incredibly, I didn't fall off.
Then the driver opened the door, and I dropped in.
He said to me, "hide under the stool."
I did what he said and hid under the stool.
We arrived at Jew residence that would soon fall into the enemy's hand.
The city gate of Gareyana.
I saw a German military policeman, he asked the driver whether he saw anyone hopped on or jumped off the bus.
He replied,
"I didn't see anything,
I don't know anything."
From underneath the stool, I saw the boots, he walked towards me, and walked away.
And he finally left.
We past through another world, where the Aryans lived.
Children were going to school, and
Christians dressed to go on a journey.
I didn't understand.
Are we living on the same planet? No!
I was really amazed, and everyone noticed that.
I was so amazed, I felt that they were all staring at me.
Are they going to sell me to Germany... for 2 kilograms of sugar and one liter of vodka?
They used to make money that way, you know?
I fell into a big pit.
I was praying, and said to myself,
I had overcome the first obstacle.
I thought I overcome the hardship.
Suddenly, a Polish came over and asked me,
"Are you Jew?"
I said to him,
"No, I am Polish, just like you."
He said, "Don't lie to me"
"I can smell a Jew a kilometer away."
"Give me all your money, and we're going to the Gestapo."
I said, "I don't have any other valuables."
"Take them all out."
I gave him everything.
Money, gold, everything.
Even then, he said to me,
"all right, we're going to the police."
I cried and begged him, "I want to live."
He pitied me, and let me go.
But I was still caught.
Three policemen caught me underneath the bridge.
They brought me to the squad.
Four Gestapos were there eating apples.
They tied me up like a target.
"Why do you stand there?"
I said to them.
"You would waste a lot of energy like this,"
"a good target".
They said to me, "you are really abnormal."
"I am very normal, I want to live."
"I didn't murder and arson
I want to live, just like you."
They said to me,
"You left the Jew residence, you would be killed."
"with a bullet in your head".
But one of the officers said,
"you have typhus fever, so we are not going to kill you."
"You go back to Jew district."
"You will die there."
And then, rebels arose in the ditches and forest.
I've finished telling my story.
That takes time, these people are tired.
I hope you won't get angry, Moussa.
No, take these to the kibbutz.
I have too many of these packages.
I agree.
Maybe you could ask them,
What does he do?
He knows...What do you do?
What do you do?
I am a singer.
What?
He sings songs.
Oh, a singer!
What can you sing for us?
Sing about what I have seen and heard.
Good.
He sings pretty well.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, my old friend.
We're not in a synagogue, sing something a little cheerful.
Universal pastry day pean!
The universal pastry day !
Thank you, thank you.
Tell him to stop.
You are working.
Like we said, there's no such thing as a free lunch.
Don't you feel cold?
Is it cold? A little bit.
Milek, get Igal, we're leaving.
Strike camp.
I'll go in the front.
Bye, Isha.
We'll wait for a while.
Jerusalem
Eastern Jerusalem.
This is west, south.
North. Do you think it is north?
I'm very sorry, it's all over.
But, this is the fact.
We are helpless.
We have to wait for the other people.
I'll take you in case they do not come.
They went to Jerusalem, it was assiegeed.
What does "assiegee" mean?
Being sieged, sieged.
There's no food left.
We're going to the kibbutz, and you can rest there.
What is kibbutz?
Kibbutz! Communism, socialism.
A place we build together.
Don't worry, young girl.
If you are a singer, how come you don't have moustache?
Still very young.
I think I am reborn.
This is his second life.
I think I can do a lot of things.
But the religious life prevented me.
He thinks he's talented, but religion obstructs him.
We concealed all the religion place of origin.
Thank God, we are no longer believers.
I don't understand, if
God really loves all this.
When someone was killed in the camp, where was God?
Religion has brought great tragedy to Europe.
At this moment, where is he, where is God ?
Is he on vacation?
You don't understand.
I lost my mom and dad.
Thank you.
Candy.
I don't have the courage to live like this any more.
All this will be over. it will be over, we have to take good care of ourselves.
Come over.
May I throw it away?
Sure.
Take this and let's go, I will help you.
Thank you.
Let's go.
Let me introduce Rosa to you.
How are you?
Can we go now?
Well then, strike camp.
Already stricken?
Put them down, and take a rest.
They have just arrived a short while ago.
Come on, take your stuff.
Take your stuff, let's go.
Milek, put out the fire.
We had been separated for so many times.
I don't want to be separated again.
If you want to live, you have to forget about all this.
If you want to be reborn, you ought to forget about all this.
Let's go.
Let me stay here and enjoy the wind.
Good bye, life will go on.
This is the first time I feel happy.
We got to go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Yanush.
Let's go.
Take these.
Come on, let's go.
I believe I will not regret coming here.
He said we will have to go through there to the get to the west.
Come, I'll help you with that.
Thank you.
Give me.
Be careful, careful.
Hold on, don't move, hold on.
Be careful.
Give me the bag.
Follow me.
Be careful! Wait a second! Give me that.
Klibanov, who are they?
Arab.
Arab?
That's what he said.
Let's go.
We're almost there.
Where are you going?
We have to hide.
Hide from who?
The Jews.
How about you?
Running away.
From whom?
The English.
Are they with you?
What did she say?
Jews!
Jews! The Jews who occupied our land.
I am a professor!
You go away! Go away!
What are you doing?
Put down the rocks.
You can't do that, are you crazy?
That's enough, stop that!
Step aside!
Nobody harms them, let them go.
Go away.
Let them through.
Go, go on.
Stop staring at them.
Go, go on...
Don't be afraid, go ahead,
Ladies, go ahead...
Here we are.
That is the campsite.
We need to stay and rest, then we'll go to the kibbutz.
Wait a minute, don't run, children!
Ygal.
Yanush is over there!
First of all, you tell them, this is the tool ...
You have to learn how to fight.
You don't know how to use this kind of tools.
This is semi-automatic, very simple.
You see, only a little smaller.
This is a 9mm caliber
British weapon, called Sidan.
It's forbidden to mention this name.
To you, this is a tool.
Beware, don't use military jargons or Sidan.
Even if you didn't mean to.
This tool is secretly developed.
It should not be talked about.
You need to learn how to shoot a loaded gun.
How to load the bullet.
First section, the butt stock.
The body of a gun, an important mechanical structure.
Third section, the barrel.
On the body of a gun, there is a rear sight gap.
On the other side, there's a square hatch.
Have we all seen this hatch?
We put the bullet in this hatch here.
This is the magazine, we place the bullet in it, see that?
Now load it, get ready, aim, and fire.
Fire once and pull the trigger once.
To practice shooting, we use automatic.
After we've used up all the bullets, there is a push-button here.
Take out the magazine.
Take it out like this.
Take out a new one, and put it in.
Load it, and get ready to fire.
Keep the old clip.
Then load the bullets right away.
It has no use without bullets.
Mr. Klibanov, in combat,
What slogan does people use here? Wula!?
No, not Wula, "follow me".
Follow me, charge!
Slogans like "long live Stalin" ?
"Long live Stalin" ?
Long live Bin Guyon!
Long live Bin Guyon!
Long live homeland! Long live Bin Guyon!
The hardest thing is waiting, Menachem.
Soon, we will get the permit to go to the kibbutz.
Then you can have a good sleep...
I can't do this, I have to fight for my motherland.
We are waiting for the permit to kibbutz.
When we get there, you can sleep well.
Thank you.
Rest.
If you have any problem, you know where to go for help.
Let me pull the trigger.
Let me throw the grenade.
They'll burn everything when I attack.
I feel Death wanders around me.
Soon you'll see, Yisimapai
Your blood flows on my soil.
Your body lays beneath my feet.
This is your body.
The lion of Jew.
It's not the bread that
I eat to ease my hunger.
And it's not the water that
I drink to satisfy my thirst.
It's seeing your bullet-perforated body, that let my spirit rest once more.
You will kill anyone who rises against you.
Those who don't stand by you are against you.
This is the ground for your existence.
Don't forget, there will be no life after death.
After we were sent to the concentration camp, my mother and sister were killed.
My dad passed away after Christmas.
He was wrapped in the cape he worn for praying.
I dug a pit and buried him, so the dogs couldn't eat him.
The gunshots come from the Arab district which is one kilometer away.
We are separated by two hills.
Split in three groups and mount that town.
Amihayi, you and your group, follow the command of
Milek, stay where you are.
Yonadon's troops follow me.
Other people follow them, go up from the left.
Don't lose the target, pay attention, charge!
Menachem, no! Menachem, where are you?
Go back, go back!
Get down!
Get down!
Disperse!
It has started, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid, brother.
I've waited for this a long time.
I waited a long time, you know.
I am shot, but I will face the death.
The German army were all around us, I was the sixth in my troops.
Dad was in front of me, and he said to me excitingly,
"save yourself?"
Save yourself? Where? The
German armies are everywhere.
It is easier to save all of us.
Where are the children?
Where did children go?
I stopped.
I stopped, we were attacked by a swarm of German soldiers.
I wore a pair of long boots, like these.
But I didn't fasten the shoelace.
Where can you run to?
Suddenly I saw some German soldiers coming down from the watch tower.
They lighted their cigarettes.
I said to myself, my Doomsday has come.
I started running ...
They shot my hat.
I ran, and I ran...
Like this...until I couldn't run anymore... I reached the forest ...
I couldn't breathe.
But I didn't look back,
I was afraid to see them.
You see, I couldn't think at all.
If they caught me, they caught me.
Then I turn around to see.
They turned around, and left.
Maybe they were tired.
Or maybe disturbed by something.
I stayed there for half an hour.
I heard sounds of gun fires...
Like this, brother, you say death
When we reach God, Death will follow us.
Look, now, we'll live forever.
We will live, brother, how about that?
Weinster!
Take care of him.
Follow me, come to the front!
Don't worry about him, charge on!
I'll handle these at the campsite, all right?
Ygal, go near the cliff, and stay there!
Yardena, hide yourself next to Ygal.
Hurry up.
They are all in the house,
I will throw a grenade.
Do you want me to use the walkie-talkie to call for help?
Cover me!
Disperse!
Ygal, do you have any ammunition there?
Where is Moussa?
Yardena!
Ygal, check her pulse.
Grab here, Ygal, where is your gun?
Where is your gun?
Come up, Milek!
Grab those men, encircle them from the left.
Milek, do you know where those gun shots come from?
I don't know!
Come with me.
Go forward!
Come, come here!
What is your name?
Monachem.
Monachem what?
Monachem Tydibun
From now on your name will be Monachem Tamali.
Tamali?
Go forward, go on forward!
Monachem Tamali?
Gideon!
Go down from here.
Cover us from the side!
Be careful...don't be afraid.
Be careful.
Wait.
What are you doing?
Moussa and them?
What are you doing?
What are you doing? They are old.
Stop wasting our time.
For God's sake, let us through!
Where are the other people?
What other people?
They went through under your nose.
Wait, wait.
Let him through.
We want his donkey!
What do you want me to do?
Where are the other people?
Other people?
Where are they now?
When this town fell into the enemy's hand, they all went to Jerusalem.
This is our land...
I tell you, we want your donkey!
Where did they go?
When this town fell into the enemy's hands,
They went to Jerusalem.
Because of the rumors on
Jews, they are frightened.
They went looking for a safe space.
What do you want us to do?
This is our land. Jews, come here!
Give me back my donkey!
What do you want to do with us?
We are not trained like you, disorganized...
Our weapons are all used.
But everyone is led by a commander.
That's enough, it's really terrible here.
I am talking to you! Where did they go?
Do you understand what
I am saying to you?
Dear friend, I have already explained to you.
They are on their way, passed by the soldiers.
They even asked for their help.
Because they wanted to take back their homeland, the soldiers declined.
Our mission is to save you. until you reach Jesicahahamala.
Who are the people that are fleeing here?
Give us some peace!
Let us through! This is our land!
What did he say?
Their superior allow them to flee, and stop fighting.
Get in.
Where are the people who have left?
Where is their barrack?
I asked you, where is their campsite?
On the night our town was severely attacked, the situation became clear.
What?
It was going to be an ill-fated evening.
Brutal.
It broke the peace of men and the capes of the women.
There was a big truck, parked in front of my house.
We threw our things and bags in it. and quickly climbed up the truck.
We were barely seated, when the truck took off.
The town I loved disappeared in the far beyond.
The twisted roads brought us to the border.
The orange gardens vanished from our view.
Our hearts were filled with sorrow.
The sounds of gun fires in the distance...
We went away amid the sounds of gunshots.
As we left there forever.
Stop telling stories, step aside.
Go over there!
We want to stay here.
Although you're like a wall blocking our way,
We'll hold our banner high.
We'll pour a glassful of wine for our land.
We'll clean the tiles in the dark kitchen.
After the children finished fighting for bread,
Go into your claws!
We will remain here.
Although you block our way like a wall.
You will suffer from hunger and cold.
We look down upon you!
We will remain here.
Although you block our way like a wall.
We will compose verses opposing you.
March across the streets.
We will fill the prison with our proud.
We will urge our children to insurrect you, generation after generation!
We will remain here.
Although you block our way like a wall!
Put the wounded on the truck.
It's Menachem!
Please tell me your name.
Suron.
Suron what?
No, don't touch him, don't touch him.
Your name?
Cover him.
Pick up the stretcher.
Yanush!
Nurse!
We don't have history, this is the fact.
I don't know how to say this in Hebrew.
But this is what it is.
Our history is the way it is because of the Christians.
We didn't want it be like this.
We don't want it this way ever.
They forced this on us, and we can't help it.
Because of this, I am telling you,
I'm against this.
But I didn't say anything.
She didn't exist because of me.
You may find it hard to imagine that I am so intensely against this.
I'm really disgusted.
Think about it, what have we found?
Repression, slander, persecution, and sacrifice.
Imbuing with hatred, uninteresting.
No glory, no advantage.
No heroes, no conquerers.
Merely a lot of unlucky traces, moan and weep.
Always looking for pardon.
I ban indoctrinating the
Jews stories to our children.
Why does it have to be this way? I say to them.
From the day we were expelled from our homeland, we became a people without history.
The class no longer exists.
Some people find it heroic, because we've experienced the suffering.
I have nothing to say to this heroism.
When a man is despair to no end, anyone can become a hero, whether he wants to or not.
Do you understand?
I'll talk to you about this kind of heroism, at the gathering this evening.
Look, I have quietly experienced all this!
Who is to say it could be any better?
Look, we endured the suffering but we'll never have enough of it.
Because if it's not for this, we will not exist anymore.
That is what I wanted to say to you, endure, endure, endure
Under this situation, sorrow is better than joy.
We replace action with our suffering.
We'd rather expiate with slavery.
This is an illusion of reality, of our hope for the future, our beautiful belief, so on and so forth, how dreadful!
It's misery that makes us Jews.
It proves that we are valiant.
Whoever
We didn't do anything
This makes sense, in other words,
You cannot destroy us,
You will never destroy us.
There's no power on earth can do that.
The power is limited.
But our endurance is not!
This expounds everything about the exile, affliction, and the Messiah...
The amalgamate of these three, causes
Jews not to be able to stand up. causes Jews to continuously drip from one people to another people. causes us to be pursued by hatred by hatred...in exile and exile
How they like this.
The richer they get, the more valuable Jerusalem becomes...
In exile, our pyramid is built with affliction at the bottom, with our Messiah at the top.
The code of Judaism resembles the book of the nether world !
Thousands of men, all of them. in the 2000 years became insane.
How admirable, what abominable people!
Abominably insane.
This kind of insanity is intentional.
It comes out of the belief of the Messiah.
It's simply a made-up story.
Without this made-up story.
Everything will be different.
In order to end this nightmare, they should end in
Palestine or elsewhere.
It will compel them to think about their future.
You need not do the things you need to.
The Messiah will come soon, and he will settle everything.
Likewise, anything you should do is to be banned.
Banned!
We should go on in exile in perpetuity, until the Providence feel that he should rescue us?
I...I think...
Israel is no longer the country of Jews, not now, but at least in the future.
Time will tell us.
It's all over.
Finished.
We've changed your name...
Come on up, Moussa, let's go.
Eagle, say again.
Repeat, please, Eagle.
Zero One Zero, can you confirm deployment?
Roger that, Eagle. Stand by.
Copy that. We got target confirmed.
Eagle is green for go.
Repeat, Eagle is green for go.
Copy that. Deployment in 15 seconds.
Bombardier, give me a confirm on target Three Zero Niner.
That's Three Zero Niner, confirm.
Copy, Bombardier. OK.
In three... two... one.
Falling.
My worst fear is falling.
Falling like a bomb.
You see, life for me is about distractions.
I try to keep looking up and forget about what's down.
But when I dream,
I fall.
Left.
Left.
Left.

Dude, you grabbed me then.
You can't do that.
Man, I didn't grab you.
Why are you lying?
Man, Elwood. Yo, Elwood, man.
He grabbed me, right? You saw it.
I don't know. Maybe.

- Yeah, no problem.
Hey, can I play?
I was champion wide receiver at high school.
I can catch that ball, man.

- Don't be such a pussy and let him play.
Come on. Get down. Get down.
On "hutt". Down.
Come on. Come on.
- Gimme some action.
- Hutt.
These were my guys.
Fighting the dull fight.
Soldiers with nothing to kill except time.
They know that war is hell, but peace... peace is fucking boring.
Give me back the motherfucking ball.
Er, guys.
Guys.
Guys!
What?
Er, just letting you know.
Parsons is dead.
Parsons McCovey was a casualty of war.
The only difference was that this was the Cold War and he was a fucked-up junkie.
There'd be no hero's burial for Parsons.
I regret the death of your son immensely.
There was nobody in the battalion
I would have trusted more with my life.
In him were resplendent the virtues of honour and loyalty to his country and God, that keep our civilisation together.
He fell off the rooftop while making technical repairs to the antennae that guard against the enemy.
Technical repairs? Where did that come from?
I tried to think what McCovey might be doing up there.
OK, go on.
He died, though not in combat, in the line of duty, and he had his country uppermost in his mind.
My deepest regrets, Colonel Wallace Berman,
US Army, Commanding.
You kept this one short.
I thought it might be better not to get lost in detail, sir.
I like the touch about me trusting him with my life.
It's a new angle, sir.
Here's something, though.
The word "resplendent".
That's not a good word to describe a soldier.
We'd better come up with something else there.
What about "contained"? In him were contained the virtues of honour and loyalty.
- That's much better.
- Oh, much better, sir.
Don't let the word "resplendent" leave this base.
Yes, sir.
OK. What is this? What have we here?
Just some requisitions, sir.
1,000 gallons of Mop & Glo.
My God. Do we really need that much?
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Herman the German. How goes it?
How do you do, mein Freund? How are you?
Doing just fine. Just fine.
Shall we do business today?
Sure thing. Guys.
I think you'll be pleased.
That's beautiful.
Look at the sparkle.
That's real cleaning power.
Sehr gut SheiÃe, ja?
Sehr gut SheiÃe, mein Freund.
US Army's finest. 500 gallons ready to go.
Three things I love about Germany:
My Mercedes-Benz:
No speed limit on the autobahn:
And a black market for anything I can get my hands on.
Fight The Power
The number, another summer
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hittin' your heart cos I know you got soul
Brothers and sisters
Listen if you're missing y'all
Swingin' while I'm singin'
Givin' what you're gettin', knowin' what I know
While the Black bands sweatin'
And the rhythm rhymes rollin'
Got to give us what we want
Gotta give us what we need
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We gotta fight the powers that be
Let me hear you say
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power
Fight the power...
Hey, Elwood, what's up?
Outstanding, Hicks. How you doing?
So...?
You don't look so good, Hicks.
- You got anything?
- Depends on what you want.
Er, it's... horse.
Can't help you.
You know, fuck, Elwood.
I outrank you, man, so don't give me any... crap.
I appreciate that, but I can't help you.
Look, man, I don't do retail. I only cook the shit.
Why don't you go see Sergeant Saad?
There's basically two types of guys in the army - the motherfuckers and the motherfucked.
Sergeant Saad is the third kind.
He fucks the motherfuckers.
Which is doable when you're the chief MP by day and the director of retail heroin sales by night.
Something that makes my life simple.
I just cook high-grade Turkish morphine into smack and wholesale it straight to him.
Everyone's happy.
So, how much we get?
Well, after we give the Turk back his share, we got er... nine grams.
Nine grams? Six hours of cooking and all we get is nine grams?
You wanna tell the Turk you're not happy, be my guest.
Bullshit. We're the ones doing all the work, taking all the risks, and Saad's making all the profit.
Garcia, I just need you to do your job.
Can you watch those thermometers and keep your mouth eating those hotdogs?
Heroin, cocaine, marijuana, lysergic acid, diethyl... Whatever the hell it is.
Amphetamines, traces of barbiturates, estrogen...
Estrogen?
McCovey was on the pill?
How could this be possible?
- Well, he might have taken it by mistake, sir.
- What?
The pill. He might have thought it was something else.
Fine, but he didn't take heroin, speed and cocaine by mistake, did he?
It seems unlikely, sir.
This isn't good, Elwood, drugs on a base like this.
Did you know anything about this?
How could someone get drugs in?
I really don't know, sir.
I always try to keep away from people like McCovey.
Elwood, we've got to try to clear this matter up, goddamn it.
I cannot... Scratch that.
I will not have this kind of thing going on at my base.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
My officer evaluation report goes in front of General Lancaster in three weeks.
If I don't get that goddamn star, I'm finished.
- Sir, you've got to relax...
- Don't you tell me to relax!
You're an E4. I'm a goddamn full-bird colonel.
You don't talk to me like that.
- You understand me, soldier?
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Jesus, Elwood, I'm...
I didn't mean to take it out on you.
Elwood, I'm... I'm sorry.
It's OK, sir. I understand the kind of pressure you're under.
This isn't mine.
I don't know anything about it.
And there's no smoking in here.
I need someone to sign here. It says Berman.
You're Berman?
I'm Colonel Berman, all right, but I don't know anything about any goddamn chair.
- I'm telling you, son, it's not mine.
- It is yours.
- Oh, Liz. Hello, darling.
- Isn't it beautiful? It's for you.
It's for me?
I got it for under 30.
They didn't know what they had.
- 30 thousand?
- I couldn't believe it was so cheap.
- Dollars or Deutschmarks?
- What do you think, Elwood?
Well, can you sit on it, ma'am?
Of course you can't sit on it. It's an antique.
Oh, well, it's very nice.
Darling, can I borrow Elwood for a few hours?
There's some things I need him to do.
God.
Wait. Almost. Almost.
...under the deal signed exactly a year ago in Stockholm to build East-West trust, and reduce the risk of war.
East and West have always feared that such an enormous exercise might be used as a cover for a build-up for war.
You didn't make it yet?
Sorry. You angry?
No.
Ray, honey. I need you to do me a favour.
The Colonel's giving a party and I need you to find out about decorations.
- What's he want a party for?
- He wants to impress the General.
His position's under review and I thought a party would help.
Will you?
Hm?
Oh, you mean a party party?
Like for everyone's fun.
Oh.
...are procedures to ensure no cheating in future.
And all sides agree this first onside verification of conventional forces is a major step forward in building new trust and confidence.
Can you switch that off?
Just turn that engine off, come on over here.
- Is there a problem?
- Where are you taking this Hummer?
We have orders from Colonel Berman.
OK. Who are you?
Specialist Ray Elwood.
What's this?
We have orders to pick up party decorations in Mannheim.
Party decorations?
Yes, First Sergeant.
Colonel's having a party.
Sounds like a pretty dangerous mission.
No disrespect intended, but may I ask who you are?
Yeah, you can ask.
I'm your new Top. First Sergeant Robert E Lee.
Well, pleased to meet you, Top.
Welcome to the 3-17th.
Thanks, Specialist.
- I didn't know we were getting a new Top.
- Why would you?
I'm Battalion Clerk here.
I usually do paperwork on all the transfers.
OK, thanks, guys. I'm sorry to keep you.
No problem.
Hold it for a second there.
You got the time, son?
Oh, yeah, it's almost ten.
That's a nice watch. Show me that.
Where did you get that?
My father gave it to me.
Your father gave it to you?
He must be quite a guy. What's he do?
He's a barber.
Barber?
Gee, he must cut a lot of hair.
Yeah.
OK, better be going, then.
Don't wanna be late picking up them party decorations.
Let's go.
Bear Witness
Bravo Two Zero.
Bravo Two Zero, come in.
Bravo Two Zero. Bravo Two Zero, come in.
Shit! Turn that down, man.
Turn down the fucking music, man.
Bravo Two Zero, please respond.
What's going on, Hicks?
Er... Bravo Two Zero here.
Bravo Two Zero, commence tactical manoeuvre area Two Niner Alpha Romeo.
Take position on phase line
Foxtrot Delta Four Seven.
Fuck.
What the hell's Two Nine Alpha Romeo?
I got a very weird vibe from that guy.
I personally didn't like him.
- He's our new Top. What do you expect?
- What was that shit about the Rolex, man?
He could know about the operation, he could know something.
Jesus Christ, don't get fucking paranoid, Garcia.
Just be cool.
I'm cool.
- Fuck, man. I can be cool.
- Good. That's why I'm telling you.
Figured out where we're going yet, man?
Er, no. We're going the wrong way.
Shit, er... Hey, Johnnie, make a... a left.
I told you to make a left across that field.
I did, man. I went left.
Ich Bin Ein Arschloch
What was that bump?
Oh, shit, man.
We just ran over a car, man.
We just squashed a car.
What kind of car?
A Volkswagen. A fucking Beetle.
Oh, no.
We squashed a Beetle.
Look out, man.
Stop.
Stop!
What's going on?
What the hell are you doing here?
- Whoa!
- Stop!
Stop.
- These dudes are freaking me out.
- I don't like 'em, either.
Hey, Johnnie, why don't you just get us away from these fuckers?
What the fuck is he doing?
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?
What's wrong with these monitors?
They've gone all orange.
Johnnie, I thought I told you to get us out of here.
That's our fucking unit.
Just up ahead.
Is that you back there, Bravo Two Zero?
Did you complete your Two Niner Alpha Romeo?
Er... We er... completed that.
OK, good work, guys. Get in formation.
Holy shit!
Oh, Jesus Christ!
These guys are dead.
Garcia, get in that truck and follow me.
What?
- Hey, what's in the trucks?
- I don't know. Let's find out.
- Hey, no way, man.
- Just get in the fucking truck.
All right.
Uh-oh.
Jackpot.
Oh, shit. Holy shit!
Grenade launchers.
MAG guns, stinger missiles.
Jesus Christ, this is worth millions.
3 million maybe.
- Maybe $5 million.
- It's all brand-new.
We gotta take this back.
This stuff gets us nothing but heavy jail time.
- We're not taking this back.
- It's big time. We can retire on this.
I agree 100%/.
This is way out of our league.
They kill you for stuff like this.
This is very serious shit.
- There's no time like now. If we pull this off...
- There's no time like now? Are you crazy?
We're not weapons dealers.
Would you kindly shut up?
Man, you're so negative. I'm trying to think.
Hey.
We're smart, right?
Yeah.
Now, we could do this.
- We could do this.
- Oh, man.
What do we do with this shit?
Well, first we need to store it.
And I know the perfect place.
Hey, this place gives me the creeps.
Yeah, it's supposed to.
- Hey, friend, what's up?
- Hey, Elwood.
What's going on, man?
Nothing much. I got some stuff I need to store.
Can you help me out?
Sure thing, man.
Hey, are we gonna party afterwards?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Hey, we can do a lot of things with the cash we make off this.
You know what I'm saying?
Cos I was thinking about opening up a bar, a nice, classy place.
Me and you'd be partners.
What do you think?
Sure.
Why not?
Fuck!
This one ready to go?
Yeah, almost. Almost.
Easy.
You be all right?
Yeah.
- You ain't out in 30, I'm coming in.
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.
Turkish music
- Elwood, how are you, my friend?
- Hey, Davood, how are you?
- Are you hungry? You want something to eat?
- Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks. I'd better get up.
Say hi to your sister, all right?
A lot of guns.
Where did you get all this stuff?
Santa Claus.
Santa Claus. That's funny.
He came down the chimney and put it under the tree, hm?
Yup.
So...
...how about this?
I give you 20 kilos on top of my next shipment, and you cook that along with my share of the shipment, and you make a lot of money.
- 20 kilos?
- Mm.
No. I want cash.
Look, I know somebody else who's very interested in this merchandise.
OK.
Maybe they'll pay you cash.
I hate to break that 30 mark.
It's a religious thing with me.
I'm afraid you'll have to, cos 30 kilos is my final offer.
He's sending us 30Ks. One week.
30Ks?
Holy shit! That's, er...
- A lot.
- Well, how do we cook that much?
- It'll take us, like, a year.
- It's gonna be cool.
French Foreign Minister Dumas yesterday expressed discomfort...
...has welcomed East German reforms with such open arms.
Politically, Mr Gorbachev has never been more vulnerable.
This is really impressive.
Hey, guys, careful with my shit.
You're pretty well equipped for a Spec Four.
I got receipts for everything.
I'm sure you do.
Hey, Top, look at this.
Check and see if there's anything inside.
Nothing.
Hm? Mm-hm.
I'll bet this don't come cheap.
This ain't exactly regulation stuff here, is it, soldier?
I don't really know.
No, I guess not.
Look, I'm gonna come round here tomorrow.
I want this place looking like a regular quarters.
You follow?
Look, I know it ain't exactly regulation, but the last Top didn't seem to mind.
Well, him and me are a bit different.
Look, Top, is there a way you and I could talk in private?
These guys kinda make me nervous.
Does it really have to play this way, Top?
How do you suggest we play it?
Well, what is it you want?
I mean, you and me, I think we...
I think we got a lot in common.
Barriers are coming down in Hungary.
So must they fall throughout all of Eastern Europe.
For example, I see you're an admirer of Japanese technology.
No problem.
The TV's yours.
What I'm trying to say is, what's it gonna take for you and me to make nice?
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
The world has waited...
There's your answer.
Elwood.
Hey, this'll take a second.
- I'll meet you down there.
- All right.
Where are you off to in such a hurry?
Nowhere, really.
Just had a couple of things to do.
You're always off with your buddies.
I never see you any more.
It's just cos I've been really busy.
- Busy?
- Yeah.
- It's the guest list.
- Guest list?
Party. Are you still helping me?
Oh, the par... Yeah. Sure. Definitely.
We found out the Colonel's related to the Iron Boar.
- The Iron what?
- The Iron Boar, as in male pig.
I had a lawyer trace his family tree, and he's a distant relative of a Civil War hero, John Bell Hood.
They called him the Iron Boar.
He'll announce it to General Lancaster at the party, to help his promotion.
Sergeant Lee's daughter.
That's Top's daughter? You're kidding.
See something you like, Elwood?
Nice dive.
Thanks.
The new Top, what do you think he's up to?
He's a washed-up vet who wants to throw his weight around.
But right now he's on your case, my man.
Yeah, well.
Hey, check out this girl.
- Why?
- That's Top's daughter.
No shit.
You know what I'm thinking?
You could be thinking almost anything.
- Maybe I should ask her out.
- You're fucking crazy, you know that?
Imagine how much that'll fuck with his head.
It's perfect.
Hey.
- So, have you got a problem with your car?
- Yeah. It won't start.
It might be the battery. Want me to look?
Hey, you're Robyn Lee, right?
Yeah. How d'you know that?
I'm Battalion Clerk here for the First Battalion.
I kinda know everything.
Hm, must be handy.
Hey, you're a good diver.
I saw you in there at the pool, diving off the high platform. How do you do that?
What do you mean? Are you scared of heights?
Let's just say you wouldn't get me up there.
You should try it.
It's fun.
Fun? Why is it fun?
Falling through air. It's kinda cool.
You're kidding me. You like falling?
Sure. Why not?
Hey, I think I found the culprit.
You wanna give that a try?
- What a guy!
- That's me.
Actually, I'm Ray Elwood.
Everyone calls me Elwood.
- Thanks for fixing my car, Elwood.
- Yeah. No problem.
You wanna go out Friday night?
It's a vineyard I visited last summer, just a small one in the Napa Valley.
Pinot grapes.
It's for sale.
- You thinking of buying it, sir?
- Well, I wish.
No. But I have a pretty decent collection back home, and I've always wondered what it would be like to make my own wine.
I could just about afford it.
Of course it's unrealistic.
Have you heard about those two missing trucks?
- What trucks, sir?
- During Reforger two trucks went missing.
The drivers were killed in an accident with a tank at some gas station out near Karlsruhe.
They found the bodies, but they can't find the trucks.
How odd.
- You wanna hear the best part?
- What's that, sir?
It's Colonel Marshall's infantry, so he's taking the heat.
Great news, sir.
Elwood, could I tell you a little secret?
Of course, sir.
Have you heard of the Civil War General John Bell Hood?
The Iron Boar?
You know of him?
- Everybody knows the Iron Boar.
- I didn't know he was so well known.
- Mm.
- It turns out that I am an actual relative.
A relative of the Iron Boar? Awesome.
I want you to keep it under your hat.
I'm gonna surprise the General at the party.
Excuse me.
Private First Class Brian Knoll reporting for duty, sir.
I'm not an officer, so you can cut the "sir" crap.
- Sorry.
- What do you want?
I just arrived. The orderly sent me down here.
Oh, great. Is that your 201 file?
Yes, sir. Er... yes.
You can sit down if you want.
So, how come they assigned you here?
I put in for it.
My fiancÃ©e is here on base, so we arranged to transfer together.
Ah, how sweet.
Who is she?
Margolis, Carol Ann, Private First Class.
You call her by her last name?
What do you do, salute in bed?
It says here they put you in 5-19.
Yeah.
That's my room.
Didn't... Didn't Sergeant Lee tell you?
We're gonna be roommates.
So while Carol Ann's been here for six months,
I'm stuck in San Antonio, just pulling whatever strings I could, kissing the Base Commander's ass like you would not believe, not literally, but...
Boy, oh, boy. I mean, so check this out.
- So then...
- Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up.
I guess I don't really give a shit.
You're only here cos Sergeant fucking dickhead Lee's on my case.
Until I get that shit straightened out, I don't wanna hear about your girlfriend, or anything.
You roger that?
Anderson underwent his rookie season at Milwaukee as a starting quarterback...
Hiya, Top. How's it going?
- Daddy, this is Ray Elwood.
- Oh, yeah, we already met.
I'm going out. I won't be home till late.
How the hell can you afford this car?
Oh, I got a great deal.
Mercs are a lot cheaper in Germany.
I don't believe it.
What?
Your dad. He's following us.
I don't believe it.
Hey, how's it going?
- Hey, Elwood.
- Looking good.
Hey!
Alle schon da.
Tut mir Leid.
Mit diesen Schuhen kÃ¶nnen Sie nicht rein.
Blue Monday
What's going on with you and my dad?
What do you mean?
There's something going on.
I'm the natural enemy of guys like your dad, mostly cos I don't give a shit about the army.
If you don't give a shit, why did you join?
I didn't exactly have much of a say in the matter.
I got caught stealing a car and the judge gave me a choice - six months in prison or three years in the army.
- I made the mistake of choosing the army.
- I get it.
My dad has a problem with guys like you.
So you're out with me to piss him off?
No. I, er...
That's it, isn't it?
Yeah, that's...
I'm fucked up. I'm really sorry.
Yeah, that's definitely fucked up.
I'll take you home.
I didn't mean to get you into this.
Are you seriously out with me just to piss off my dad?
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Are you crazy?
He's the First Sergeant of your company.
He's not somebody you wanna piss off.
You realise, he's gonna cut your balls off.
Yeah, probably.
So, what if I stay?
There's a chance you're gonna lose your balls.
Do you think I'm worth it?
Yeah. Sure. Why not?
Fine.
Do you want one of these?
- What is that?
- Ecstacy.
How does it feel
To treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me now, how do I feel?
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
I've got something I wanna show you.
What is it?
A burn.
How did it happen?
When I was a kid, my dad was drunk and he dropped a cigarette on my nightgown and it caught fire.
It was an accident.
It's really ugly, isn't it?
Get up! Get up! Get up!
At the armoury. Full gear. Five minutes!
Five minutes?
Count 'em.
- Elwood, what the hell are we doing?
- Target practice.
Elwood, hand me your rifle.
I want you to pack the M-60.
I'm not qualified to operate it.
There's a time and a place.
You're gonna learn in the heat of battle.
Hand it to him.
The 60's a heavy mother.
So am I.
What's the matter, Elwood?
Your fitness lacking?
You wanna do the confidence course a few times to get you back into shape?
No, thanks, Top. I'll be fine.
I direct your attention to that spot over there that has been marked with an X.
We have here the prototype of a new Russian tank.
We are here to test the vulnerability of said tank to sustain fire from an infantry platoon.
Squad...
Lock and load one magazine.
Take up a good firing position.
You will fire on my command.
Sustain fire until the order to cease fire's been given.
Ready?
Fire!
So, you did Top's daughter?
Think I may have a problem.
No shit.
I like her.
I really like her, you know.
I mean, she's different, man. She's cool.
There's this... I just fucking dig her, you know.
That's a problem.
Yeah.
Elwood.
Heard you lost your ride, baby.
I was getting bored with that car.
You'd better take note there, Stoney.
It ain't too healthy hanging around this guy.
Look at the shit he's making you eat.
Oh, you want some meatloaf, Saad?
That's a fucking insult to me.
I don't eat meat.
Human beings don't have the proper teeth and can't digest that shit.
It stays in your guts for three weeks and it rots.
That's your problem. You ain't got no discipline.
- Are you trying to make some point here, Saad?
- Yeah.
The cabinet in the storage room was empty, man.
What do you mean, it was empty?
Empty. It means nothing was in it.
I paid my hard earned for thin fucking air.
You looked inside the battery, right?
Like always. Except this time nothing was in it.
What the fuck is that?
You trying to pick a fight with me, Elwood?
Is that what you really wanna do?
I sent Parsons there to stash it.
Stupid fucking junkie probably did something with it.
Parsons ain't around.
Ain't that real fucking convenient?
Hey, relax, man. It's already sorted.
I got a brand-new batch ready for you.
Maintenance area at the swimming pool, usual place.
I put it there myself. It's definitely there, OK?
It fucking better be.
You understand me?
Do you understand me?
This meatloaf looks great, doesn't it?
In the article... In the article there was a photo of a Confederate General John Bell Hood, affectio... affectio... affec... affectionately known as the Iron Boar.
Known as the Iron Boar.
- The Iron Boar.
- Who are you talking to?
No-one. How are things going downstairs?
- Are you ready? Guests will be here soon.
- I'm coming.
I was reading a copy of The Modern Soldier, and there was an article on the guerrilla fighters in the Civil War.
There was a photo of the Confederate General
John Bell Hood, affectionately... affec... affectionately known as the Iron Boar.
The Iron what?
Boar. B-O-A-R. As in male pig.
It was Liz who actually noticed it, but the resemblance to myself was absolutely uncanny.
So we commissioned a lawyer to begin tracking down court records, passenger ship lists, that sort of thing, and it was finally confirmed just last week via what is known round here as the Lynchburg Convergence, where a certain Trevor Berman and a hood girl known as Ethel, wed and had two boys in the town of Lynchburg, Virginia.
One of those boys, Gary Berman, is my great-great-uncle.
A descendent of the wild boar.
Sir, that's the Iron Boar.
I guess I'm surrounded by people with famous relatives.
Isn't that so, Marshall?
I try not to play it up, but when I found out I was related to former
Army Chief of Staff General George C Marshall,
I guess it gave me a strong sense of my heritage.
I've always been proud of my family, but knowing that I was from fighting stock...
...affected me quite profoundly.
I seem to recall this General Hood.
He was involved in some disastrous battle and lost a leg, didn't he?
I wouldn't say it was disastrous.
And an arm.
- He lost an arm as well, didn't he?
- No, he didn't lose an arm.
He lost the use of it. He kept the actual arm.
- Drink, General?
- Thank you.
Mrs Colonel.
You know what?
I don't go much for this lineage shit.
I'm not related to anyone famous and this family line bullshit makes me feel insecure.
My belief is, if you come from dirt, you fight better because you don't wanna go back to the dirt.
The best fighters in the world are people with nothing to lose.
Get me another one of these, will you?
Right away, sir.
- How's it going?
- Oh, the usual.
Berman and Marshall trying to suck the General's dick.
What's he doing here?
I don't know.
It's supposed to be a party for officers only.
Damn.
The General's sure happy to see his ass.
How's it going?
What you doing walking around here, white boy? You crazy or something?
I'm just trying to get back to my room.
You know, I don't want any trouble, or...
No trouble?
OK.
You're with Elwood now, ain't you?
You Elwood's homey?
Yeah, he's my roommate.
Oh, you're roommates?
That's real nice, man.
Er, Scotch on the rocks and a Coca-Cola, please.
Didn't expect to see you here.
Yeah, well... here I am.
There you go.
Jesus Christ, look how they got you dressed up.
Ain't you sick of being fucked by a white man?
You and me can step outside right now.
Whoa!
You think you can take me?
Uh-oh, customers.
Yeah, maybe.
Straight up, hand to hand, you got a shot.
Maybe.
But maybe I wear a blade.
Maybe I got a.45 cocked and locked to shove up your ass.
You ain't considered that, have you?
Hey, you wanna know something?
You ain't like Elwood here. You got guts.
Guys like you get all the medals.
Hey, Bob. Get your ass over here.
There's someone I want you to meet.
Excuse me.
He murdered your car?
Yeah, shot to pieces.
The entire unit used it for target practice.
Even me.
Why would he do that?
That's pretty extreme, even for him.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Is there something going on I don't know about?
What do you mean?
Are you into some kind of shit on the side?
I've lived on base my whole life.
I know what goes on.
I also know my dad doesn't take a disliking to just anyone.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
You're into something.
Aren't you?
A fiasco.
- A debacle even, wouldn't you say?
- Goddamn it, it was your idea.
- I'd never heard of the fucking Iron Boar.
- Do something, then.
Marshall's gonna take that promotion if you don't.
Take the initiative, for God's sake.
You're a soldier. Go on the attack.
- I've got an idea.
- What?
- Leave it to me. Don't worry about it.
- Tell me. Tell me.
You have a serious problem.
My dad's a pretty heavy guy.
He'll really fuck you up.
When you say fuck me up, what do you mean?
I mean, fuck you right up.
He's done three tours of Vietnam.
He's killed a lot of people.
- Whoa. Are you saying he's gonna kill me?
- I don't know, but...
He's not a guy to mess with.
Why are you telling me all this?
I guess I don't want him to fuck you up.
You realise that's probably the nicest thing anyone's said to me in my whole life?
I love this guy, don't you?
General?
There's something
I'd like to talk to you about.
Yes.
What do you think about the idea of a training exercise?
Er, what do you have in mind?
Well, with all this activity in the East,
I thought we should stay on our toes.
Maybe I could put a company of my men up against Marshall's, see how they'd go.
Do you really think you're up for this sort of thing?
Oh, yes, sir. It could be a straight defensive/offensive exercise.
Maybe the nuclear facility.
I could put my men on a full alert.
See how they'd hold up against an attack.
You want to defend the nuke base against Marshall's infantry?
Yes, sir.
- Wallace, can I see you in the kitchen?
- Just a moment, honey.
Er, Marshall, what do you think?
Er... sounds good to me.
Excellent.
I think I know what your problem is.
What's that?
You're bored.
I think you're right.
Do you ever have falling dreams?
Sure. I think so.
I have the same dream all the time where it's really high, I'm kinda floating, and then I fall.
Is that the same as yours?
Kind of.
Well, why, what happens in yours?
I wake up before I hit the ground.
I always hit.
I don't wake up.
That's not normal.
I know.
I got a bad feeling.
About what?
Some strange shit's been going down.
Saad's up to something, and it's nothing good.
I keep thinking about that stash that disappeared.
I mean, Parsons was stupid, but he wasn't crazy.
He wouldn't try to rip us off.
I'm going out to the storage room later, check out that cabinet.
Maybe he put the stash in there wrong and Saad couldn't find it.
OK.
Do you wanna kill Ray Elwood?
Jesus Christ, Robyn, what are you talking about?
- Do you?
- What's he been saying?
Nothing.
I don't think you should be listening too much to Ray fucking Elwood.
But you've killed people before in war and stuff, right?
And now you wanna kill Ray Elwood.
It's no different, is it?
I really don't think you know what you're talking about.
Holy shit, what happened to you?
Who the fuck did that to you?
Fuckers.
They're just stupid, stupid, stupid... fuckers.
Take it easy. Let me look at you.
Oh, fuck!
Hey. Come on. Calm down.
Just let me clean it up, all right?
I've got some stuff here.
Put this under your tongue and let it dissolve.
What is that?
It'll calm you down.
Oh, fuck.
Man, I told you. You can't walk around this end of the base alone at night.
It just ain't safe.
Hey, you want a beer?
- I'll get you a beer, yeah?
- OK.
Thanks.
You know, a lot of guys take a beating around here.
Just don't let it happen twice.
My daddy still keeps in touch with his army buddies.
The guys he knew... from World War II.
You know, they get together every year for a barbecue.
Friends for life, man.
Yeah.
I guess I've been kind of an asshole to you.
This place is fucked up.
It fucks with your head, and... sometimes you don't know who to trust, you know?
Yeah.
Well, I think tonight ended up OK.
Don't you think?
A stunning success. You should be very happy.
Liz, why don't you put that down for a while?
Hm?
- Well, honey, it's been a while.
- Wallace.
- Who do you think you are?
- What do you mean?
When was the last time you even held a rifle?
Do you even know which end the fucking bullets come out?
Why, in your opinion, was it a good idea to challenge Marshall to a training exercise when you're Supply and he's Infantry?
You told me I should go on the attack.
Right. I said attack.
I didn't say fall on your own sword.
Well, I had to do something, and...
And I'll tell you what.
I think I've got Marshall's number.
I know how he thinks,
I know his battle strategies.
I've been supplying him in Reforger, for God's sake.
I'm confident I can show him up.
All I've got to do is defend a nuke base for 48 hours.
Right?
The deal's off, sir.
I don't understand.
What do you mean, it's off?
There's just some bad shit happening right now and I can't do it. I'm sorry.
The guns are already sold.
If you don't deliver, there's a big problem.
They killed one of my guys.
What did you expect?
Did you think this would be like a game?
A bit of fun?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Sit down, please.
Please sit down.
We got nothing left to talk about.
They killed your friend, huh?
Some fucking Russians killed my son.
You son of a bitch!
They tortured him and shot him in the head.
You talk to me about your friend?
I don't give a fuck about your friend.
The deal is still on.
Or I'll fucking kill you.
I'll come and find you and I'll fucking kill you.
OK?
Man?
- How did it go?
- Great. Just great.
How the fuck are we supposed to get the guns out of the nuke base with this training exercise?
If Berman's exercise lasts all weekend, there's no way we're gonna get the guns out.
- The only way is if the exercise finishes early.
- Yeah, man.
If we're not dead by 1700, we're fucking dead.
- I'll take care of it.
- How the fuck are you gonna take care of it?
I said I'll fucking take care of it.
Holy shit.
This place is closed for business, baby.
Get out. Let's go.
What you looking at, son?
You better get on out of here.
Move. Move it.
No, no, no. Not you, Elwood.
You have no authority here, Sergeant.
You can't just walk in here and close this bar down.
- You have no right.
- You're a real bad motherfucker, ain't you?
Take him to the shed.
- Hey, get the fuck off me.
- Kick his fucking ass.
- Hey, get the fuck off, you bastards.
- Guys.
Fuck off me.
- What do you want?
- A little investment advice.
On what?
How much you think you'll make on that shipment?
It'll tide me over.
Well, do you know what security on that'll be?
Well, I guess you're here to give me a price quote.
You know, the thing I love about you, Elwood, is that it don't take you long to figure out the play.
Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out.
You stupid fuck. Fuck!
- Fuck. Get out, fuck!
- All right. Calm down.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Motherfucker.
Fuck him. Fuck him.
Stupid motherfucker.
Don't you learn?
Huh? Don't you fucking learn?
You wanna talk business, right?
So let's talk business.
OK.
OK.
Let's talk business.
You want a cut?
A cut? What the fuck are you talking about, a cut?
I'm your brand-new fucking partner.
I think you might have saved my life back there.
Thanks. I owe you one.
You OK? They hurt you again?
No, I just kind of got a sore elbow.
- Listen, I need a favour.
- Yeah. Anything. Anything, man. What is it?
The thing about cooking smack is, to not get fucked up by the fumes, you gotta have a full stomach.
Cook smack on an empty stomach, you'll be stoned as any junkie.
The problem we got now is we're cooking ten times more than before.
So to stay awake, we have to eat a burger like every 15 minutes.
- So, for six hours, like...
- That's 24 burgers. That's a lot of burgers.
Yeah.
They don't teach you about this stuff in basic.
So, look, I need you to do the shopping for me.
Go into the commissary here and get food.
Burgers, hotdogs - anything with meat.
Lots of meat.
Yeah, OK, no problem.
Catch my drift here, right?
Saad doesn't eat meat.
He's decided to hold back.
He won't come until tonight.
There's no way he's gonna mount an attack in the day.
I think you may be right, sir.
I know I'm right, Elwood.
He wants to wait till we're worn down, used up all our supplies, had false alerts.
Two trucks coming, sir.
Aha, breakfast!
We got fresh coffee, doughnuts, hash browns, eggs, flapjacks.
- Garcia, let's get in there.
- Yes, sir.
- These two trucks, let them through.
- Yes, sir.
Stop.
Why the hell did they go over there?
Go, go, go!
Move, move!
Drop your weapons. Move it!
Bang.
You're dead.
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Come on. Let's go.
Way to run it, way to run it, way to run it.
Nice play, nice play.
Here we go. Come on, come on. Line up.
OK, sir?
Did I ever tell you I met President Kennedy?
No.
He delivered the graduation address at the academy.
You can't tell it from his pictures, but... up close in person he... he just had this charisma.
I shook the President's hand.
I felt his strength, and I thought...
I can do anything I set my mind to.
Do you know what General Lancaster called me?
Incompetent.
Will he include that in your efficiency report, sir?
Oh, yeah. Yes, I'm sure he will.
The General has relieved me of my command.
Marshall said his executive officer could take over.
I'm really sorry, sir.
You know what I'm gonna do, Elwood?
I'm gonna take my pension and buy that vineyard.
I think that's what I'm going to do.
That doesn't sound like such a bad idea, does it?
Make sure and give the Turk all my love.
Hey, you feel bad about Berman?
Oh, fuck, no.
You don't feel bad about tipping off Marshall?
I thought you liked Berman.
Way I see it, I did him a fucking favour.
Berman's too nice a guy for the army.
I know I did it to save my own ass, but... he's gonna make fucking wine.
We're stuck here up to our necks in shit.
Why the delay? Couldn't find the base?
- You boys are looking tense.
- We're having a ball.
Let's get this stuff inside.
So, how long does it take to cook this stuff?
Most of the night.
What the fuck is he doing here?
He's with me. Got a problem with that?
Whoa, whoa, Saad, do me a favour and put that out. Now.
I'm not fucking around.
This is highly flammable shit.
Now, listen up. We cook six hours and we have to keep it as close as possible to 85oC.
What happens if it goes below?
If it goes below 80, the reaction stops, we gotta cook longer.
If it goes above 90, the morphine's destroyed, and if it boils, well...
Well, what?
Cooking smack is like preparing Thanksgiving dinner where one ingredient is a hand grenade.
This shit explodes?
- Kaboom.
- You better know what the fuck you're doing.
I just hope the ventilators can handle it.
This is way more than we've ever done before.
If we change the filter element every hour, it should be OK. You on it?
I'm on it, man.
Saad, do you want a hotdog?
I don't want no fucking hotdog.
You got no vegetarian shit?
Hotdogs are made up of lips, udders and assholes.
- I'm surprised you don't want one.
- I'll fuck you up.
Please, just fucking cut the sarcasm.
Can we just eat our hotdogs and chill out?
Not you, of course, Saad.
OK, six hours. Mark it now.
Knoll.
I'm gonna go get some rest.
I'll be back at 0400.
I'm leaving you in charge, buddy.
You leaving? Where are you going?
What are you worried about?
Just kick back, watch some TV, educate yourself.
You own this base, right?
...all afternoon. It is clear that this will be one of Berlin's most dramatic days.
Robyn?
Come on up.
I don't think so.
Just get up here.
Come on up. Come on.
Just a bit further.
- Jesus Christ, this is not fun.
- What's the matter? Are you scared?
Of course I'm not scared.
- I won't push you.
- Yeah, well, I'd appreciate that.
Come on, come on.
Come on. Come up to the edge.
Take another step.
Take another two steps.
Just a little bit further. Come on.
Sit down.
What would it take to make you jump?
A parachute.
Oh, fuck.
That's really high.
Maybe you get used to it after a while.
I think the point is not to get used to it.
What are you doing?
Why are you putting your arms up like that?
Robyn.
Oh.
Fuck it!
Robyn?
Hi.
...with growing German opposition to the siting of nuclear missiles on their soil,
Brussels changed all that.
A relieved Chancellor Kohl could now offer his electorate what they have been demanding.
The President seemed happy to celebrate...
I got you.
Mr President, we're glad you're here.
You are a friend amongst friends.
Why do you motherfuckers eat so damn much?
Because we're growing lads.
We need to keep our strength up.
Oh.
- I don't feel too good.
- Mm-hm.
Let me get one of those burgers.
No fucking way, Saad. This shit's like poison.
Wouldn't want you blocking up your arteries.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Knoll. Shit, what time is it?
It's midnight.
What's going on?
Where you going?
- Fuck. I gotta go.
- Can I come?
They're in there.
Oh, fuck.
Leave him alone.
Stop it!
Sir, can I ask you to please take her out of here?
Sir?
What do you mean "sir"?
Let me go!
Your Second Lieutenant Brian Knoll just got out of the Inspector General's office.
PFC Knoll, our officer in the hole.
Don't kick.
From the moment the first wave of East
Germans crossed into Berlin in the early hours...
Where is the Berlin Wall?
- It's in Berlin, you dumb fuck.
I know it's in Berlin.
What country is it in?
It's in Germany, man.
Fucking... Germany. West Germany.
West Germany?
Well, which one are we in, then?
Are we in West Germany or are we in East Germany?
We're in East.
We're in West Germany, you idiot.
- What's the difference?
- Fucked if I know, man.
Get your fucking hands in the air, you motherfuckers.
Get your fucking hands in the air.
Put it down. I'm warning you.
Drop that weapon.
You put your shit down, motherfucker.
This is my house.
Drop the fucking weapon.
No, fuck that.
Don't make another move.
You put your shit down. Fuck you.
Come on.
Come on.
It's over.
It's all over.
What are you doing with Robyn?
Don't you worry about her.
She's got nothing to do with you any more.
Let me go, you fuck!
Kimborough, you read me?
Captain Kimborough, come in.
Er, we got some resistance, but nothing we can't handle.
So, you've been putting it to my daughter and you think that's making war?
War, you dumb fuck, is playing for keeps.
Somebody as stupid as you, Elwood, deserves to go down.
Take out your muscle, you turn to shit.
No backup. Too easy.
What?
Well, who do you think took out Stoney?
You are fucking stupid.
He's gonna kill him.
Can you wait one second?
Listen to me. My dad is going to kill him.
- He's gonna do something bad.
- That's ridiculous.
Where's he taking him? What's he doing?
- He's taking him to the stockade.
- He's not! The stockade's the other way.
Can you please see where he's taking him?
You wanna hear the secret of Vietnam?
The secret of Vietnam's simple. I loved it.
Goddamn turkey shoot.
Whole damn thing was nothing but fun.
I'm just being honest.
I fucking well loved it.
Everyone else would, too, if we had won.
I did all sorts of shit.
Everything you've been doing here and more.
Lots more.
And Berliners are proclaiming a new era...
Let go. Let go. Let go of me!
Hold it, Sergeant. Get away from the window.
What are you doing here, sir?
Get away from the window.
Or I will shoot you, Sergeant.
You're gonna shoot me?
You got the balls to do something like that?
Boiling point.
When there is peace, the warlike man attacks himself.
That's Nietzsche, and his point is that there really is no peace.
There's always some war somewhere with someone.
And there are no winners or losers, either.
Just those that are still around to fight another day.
A Purple Heart, and er...
No, what is it?
Defence Superior Service Medal, sir.
Gas explosion.
Well, that's what I read in the Stars And Stripes.
- They think it was a gas explosion?
- Yes, sir. That's what they think.
And this er, Robert Lee, the Sergeant that got the posthumous Silver Star, you knew him well, did you?
Yes, sir. His daughter's my sweetheart.
Is that right? I didn't know that.
How's she doing?
She's doing OK, sir.
She's at college studying politics.
Political science.
She has her semester break next month and she's flying over to see me.
Well, I'll look forward to meeting her.
Are you sure you're OK standing?
If the leg starts getting weary, you just cop a squat.
Oh, I'll be fine. Thanks, sir.
OK.
It really is healing quite nicely.
I think the tropical air's doing it some good.
So, you like it here in Hawaii?
- Yeah. I'm settling in.
- That's good. That's good.
Now, see what have we got here?
Oh, just some requisitions, sir.
1,000 gallons of Mop & Glo?
Do we really need that much?
Well, cleanliness is next to godliness.
Well, that's what I always say, sir.
This is dedicated to all my folks
Diagnosed with a bad case of that proper upbringin'
And never took the time to fall in line or follow
Or swallow the thoughts
Of the recognised committees who lurk throughout ya cities
Ya hood, ya town, no matter which type
You're from the same type of people trying to hold you down
Just because you tailor-made for bigger and better things
Never missed a chance to move ahead of things
And what does it bring?
I tell you for me, it brought jealousy and back wounds from all the stabbing
Cats posin' as my fan just to get to grabbin' what's mine
I'm livin' in times where my daughters are found
Around kids who can't afford thinkin' caps
But always found drinkin' raps and eatin' on beats
Claimin' laws of the streets
But who made the laws?
Everybody playin' rebel with no sign of a cause
Well, I feel the world around me
I've found that others bring you down just to be down
You've got to make up your mind
Where you wanna be
Where you wanna go with your life
With your life
I'm never singin' the blues but findin' the clues that maintain
And I been blessed to reign supreme
Over nearly every dream I had and I made it come true
I'm an imperfect man and I'm holding the clue to perfection
It doesn't seem to matter what direction I look
I find people settin' traps
Tryin' to find the goal without havin' any maps
Even friends of mine
Jump on line just to become my adversary
They felt they were entitled to the dairy I made
They don't come and chill or behave
And they got toast ready to burn
Not learnin' to live
But they yearnin' to take what you earn
Well, I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down just to be down
You've got to make up your mind
Where you wanna be
And where you wanna go with your life
With your life
So quick to place blame
And deny the shame we bring upon ourselves
So many names held accountable for my own account
When a large amount was weight
That I made a shape
When I climbed I found
It was hard to find others around to point my fingers at
Which made me realise the truth
The biggest suppressor can be your own ego
Looking for an excuse to plant roots
In a field of self-sorrow
To sprout and follow the first thing you feel
Nourishes your hunger to be respected
It gets hectic
And when I'm watching the news and my daughter walks in
And choose to ask
Why were all those people on the floor sleepin' covered in red?
I told her that they were looking for God but found religion instead
Well, I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down just to be down
You've got to make up your mind
Where you wanna be
And where you wanna be with your life
With your life
With your life
Where you wanna be now
Sometime
Sometime...
I need my space to live
Well, I feel the world around me
I've found that others will bring you down
Others bring you down to be down
You've got to make up your mind where you wanna be
Where you wanna be
With your life
With your life, with your life
Based on Journal of My Life
During the French Revolution
During the Revolution,
at the end of Rue Miromesnil,
a new street
north of the Champs-Elys<b>Ã©</b>es,
stood the townhouse
of Grace Elliott.
The "Grand Lady",
as she was known,
was born in 1760
of an old Scottish family.
She studied in France,
married SirJohn Elliott, then left him
to become the mistress
of the Prince of Wales,
the future George IV,
to whom she bore a daughter.
Then she was noticed
by Prince Philippe, Duke of Orleans
who brought her to France in 1786.
Their affair ended
but they remained close friends.
The Duke had two houses in Paris.
One at Palais-Royal,
the other on the site
of today's Parc Monceau,
not far from Rue Miromesnil.
Pretty posies!
Fresh water!
Who wants a drink?
Returning from England, the Duke paid me a visit on the eve of Federation Day, one year after the Bastille fell.
Our enemies will fall confounded
and we'll sing alleluia.!
Good times are coming...
We all swore to stand united.
The whole universe will be told
of this glorious oath our hearts uphold.
Long live Orleans!
Long live the Nation!
"Master Fox, attracted by the scent, addressed him thus,
"Master... Mister..."
"Mr. Crow, good day."
"Mr. Crow, good day.
You are handsome, I say!"
"What a beautiful bird!
You are handsome, I say!"
The Duke of Orleans.
Show him in.
Prince!
What joy!
I heard you had arrived, but...
I didn't expect you so soon.
Yet your journey seemed to last a century.
Letters from England.
Curtsy to the Prince.
What's your name?
Julie.
That's all for now.
The lesson's over. Go and play.
Forgive her, she has no social graces.
I haven't finished dressing but you may stay.
Take a seat.
I have been taking care of that little girl.
Her mother lost her husband and lives in great hardship with four other children.
Your devotion to the poor is a constant wonder, my dear.
It exceeds the bounds of Christian charity and revolutionary fraternity combined.
I deserve no credit.
She is the light of my life, my only consolation for my own daughter's absence.
Did you see her?
She's become a real beauty.
She asks for you.
All of London is waiting for you.
The sweetness of life there takes us back a few years.
Why didn't you stay longer, my friend?
I came back to... dispel certain rumors, alas!
Word has it that I dared not return.
At the Federation rally tomorrow, they'll be surprised to see me walk in the procession.
It's the best way to quash the rumors.
I won't be mistaken for a cowardly <b>Ã©</b>migr<b>Ã©</b>.
Cowardly, yes.
However, their fears are founded.
But you, my fearless friend, have stayed.
I am an <b>Ã©</b>trangÃ¨re.
These past two days,
I have guests from the country here for the parade.
As you know, new ideas leniently implemented by the lawful authorities, have my full approval.
The "lawful authority"
- Louis, in this case - does not implement them.
He hates all friends of Liberty, commencing with me.
How do you know?
He keeps insulting me.
Remember, after the Bastille fell
I traveled to Versailles to ask him for my orders.
He answered me harshly,
"I have nothing to say to you."
He was right!
I've always felt more alien to him than to my cook or coachman.
He is your cousin.
My family is the Nation.
I am more French than Bourbon.
The whole court is colluding with the enemy.
You sound like a Jacobin.
Yes, and I highly approve of my son's desire to join their club.
Surely no Orleans belongs with them.
We belong wherever there are patriots.
See where your false friends lead you!
Excepting the Duke of Biron.
I've asked him to dine with us.
I'm delighted.
His only fault is his weakness.
At least he is loyal to you.
But... the Talleyrands... the Mirabeaus... those turncoats have left you at the mercy of monsters, while Merlin de Douai and your rascally cohort, Laclos, who has brought your party into such disrepute...
Laclos has an outstanding mind and deep insights.
He's the author of a filthy novel.
I have little regard for the book.
It's profoundly boring.
It sent me to sleep.
Granted, I do not read much.
I'm no judge of letters.
Grace...
I'm so happy to see you again.
I cherish your company and yet, alas, you have nothing but harsh truths for me.
But they are not true.
You've been misled... although...
I trust you are sincere.
The Royalists have turned your head.
The Sansculottes have turned yours even more.
You'll be your own downfall.
Grace, listen.
Hurry back to your homeland.
Take my prudent advice.
Your revolutionaries will be your downfall, and with it, the King's.
You could save him.
Save Louis!
He's digging his own grave by defying the sovereign people's will.
What a way to speak!
The only sovereign I know is the King, no one else.
You are a proud Scotswoman who loves nothing but kings and princes.
I love the king of my adopted country.
I care little for Louis.
I love my Queen.
I detest her.
I wish I could break her influence over you.
She is a lady of great refinement.
I've never heard her say a single word against you.
And despite my friendship with you, she trusts me completely.
She sent you to Belgium...
- You know!
- I have spies.
But I won't tell a soul.
I know. But honestly, some people in Paris should hold their tongues.
We live in a world of... slanderers.
I do not believe them.
I don't believe what they say about the Queen, or about you.
For they slander you too.
I don't believe you fomented the October riots by bribing the French Guards.
Nonsense!
All lies, spread by La Fayette and his clique.
While the Queen... No, enough!
I respect your fondness for an undeserving monarchy.
I blame no one for their opinion of the Revolution if they respect mine... but I'm more tolerant than either side, alas!
Grace,
I implore you, go back home.
There is still time before events get out of hand.
I love you and I want you safe.
I'll miss you cruelly, but go!
As long as I can see the Queen, even occasionally,
I feel it's my duty to stay here.
The day of August 10th
Nanon!
Death to the Austrian woman!
Lord, they're at it again like last month, when they forced the red cap on the King's head.
Everyone's at the Tuileries Palace!
All the working folk and the delegates from the countryside!
Good times are coming.!
String up the aristocrats.!
It's the King's last hour!
Mr. And Mrs. Let-them-eat-cake are goners!
Hush!
What about their Swiss Guards?
They're done for.
I saw them run like rabbits!
Your Louis will hang within the hour.
Quiet, or I'll tell Madame.
She'd do better to keep out of sight!
The Tuileries Palace is on fire.
The rioters massacred the Swiss Guards.
My God!
How's the King?
With the Queen and their children, he was seen fleeing to the Assembly.
I hope they won't be thrown to the mob.
Your cook says they'll arrest all aristocrats.
She's always talked nonsense before.
Now, anything is possible...
If only I'd gone to Meudon!
Maybe there's still time.
HaveJustin prepare the carriage.
The city barriers are closed.
No one can get out.
Then we can only pray.
If I may suggest...
We could go through the Duke's garden.
To reach Meudon?
We'd have to walk halfway around Paris.
And I refuse to implicate the Duke.
I suspect today's rioters, like those ofJune 20th, are Marat's henchmen and no friends of the Duke.
Does Madame remember Baptiste, the doorman?
He lives behind the Invalides.
In Paris.
Yes, but there's a breach in his garden wall.
Long live the Nation!
Long live the Nation!
Please step up, Madame.
Let us part here.
I'll go on alone.
Give me that.
You must stay in Paris to mind the house.
Tell my people I'm in Meudon.
They mustn't think I've fled abroad.
God help you.
God help you, especially.
Poor Madame!
What a calamity!
You came alone, on foot?
Jeannette!
Weren't you afraid of being waylaid, alone at night, on the road?
I saw worse in Paris.
Nevertheless, at the foot of Meudon hill,
I heard a man's footsteps which scared me more than the murderous mob on Place Louis XV.
I went and hid behind a log.
Didn't he see you?
If he had, what would have befallen me?
He may have been a harmless peasant.
What are you up to?
Give me that!
Madame isn't here.
I'm to deliver it in person!
Madame Elliott?
I am she.
From Madame Meyler.
"Please obtain a travel permit
"for you and your manservant...
"and come alone to Paris,
"where someone badly needs your help."
Grace Georgina Elliott, nÃ©e Dalrymphe.
Spell it how you like.
Darlymphe,
English citizen, you may go to Paris with one servant, but be back by midnight.
Halt!
"The citizen may go to Paris with one servant, but must be back by midnight."
Where is the servant?
I sent him back to get... papers I need in Paris.
Follow me.
Elliott,
English citizen...
With a servant?
Yes, but I told him...
She sent him back for some papers she forgot.
Let her wait for him, but not too long.
She must be home before the permit expires.
Tell me, milady, what possessed you to enter Paris now?
The jails are full of corpses, the streets are awash with blood...
Everyone is desperate to leave town, and you want to come in?
My mother is dying.
I need to be with her.
Very well. You are brave.
You're English.
Why aren't you in England?
My mother and I have lived in France for six years.
I have two houses here.
I feel so French that I transferred all the money I had in England.
Be warned that Paris is not safe for enemies of Liberty.
What's going on?
They're taking out some blackcoats.
A conspiracy.
- Taking out?
- Who knows?
- I do!
- No one saw them.
Look in the cart.
They're taking a trip to Vaugirard cemetery.
Feet first, and some in pieces.
They're short of room!
Is it the Queen?
It's her favorite,
Princess de Lamballe.
Princess de Lamballe!
Hey, beautiful!
Madame's crying?
For the pretty head on the stake?
She must be lonely up there.
Want to keep her company?
Come on, aristo. Get out!
No! You are mistaken.
I'm weeping for my dying mother.
I'll miss her last words.
Look, I'm not an aristo.
I'm English.
English and a patriot.
All right, be off.
We're not after Englishwomen yet.
Clarisse!
Grace! You're here at last.
I'm here. With difficulty.
What is it? You're crying.
A horrible thing...
I shiver to speak of it.
A gang of fanatics carrying a stake with... poor Princess de Lamballe's head on it.
Princess de Lamballe?
Oh, God!
They'd slaughtered her at the Force prison and then had the barbarity to drag her remains to the Temple prison and show them to our poor Queen.
What times are we living in?
Those "Enlightenment Philosophers" should open their eyes!
I'll send for a cordial.
Prudence!
Quick, bring two glasses and some vintage wine.
But I'm not here to cry.
Whom do you wish me to help?
The Marquis de Champcenetz, governor of the Tuileries.
Who?
Champcenetz?
Yes, I think you know him.
Indeed... we met at the Duke of Orleans' before the Revolution, but... we weren't particularly close.
Especially since the Duke, to whom he owes his career, now hates him for being ungrateful.
Grace, forgive me.
He led me to believe that he was one of your friends.
Don't imperil yourself for a stranger whom perhaps you dislike.
I'm somewhat obligated to him.
He found me my house in Meudon when he commanded the chateau there.
But today, even if he were my worst enemy...
I'm very surprised.
I heard he was dead.
He got away.
When the King fled to the Assembly against the Queen's will, he jumped out through a window and lay down in the garden among the Swiss Guards' corpses.
A National Guard found him and lent him his coat.
He's hiding in my attic.
One moment.
Don't get up.
My respects, Madame.
How are you?
My leg is badly wounded,
I have a fever.
But it's better now.
I sought refuge with Lord Gower, the English ambassador, but he informed me through his secretary that as a public official, he could not see me.
So then... I remembered in the past... you introduced me to Madame who had a secluded house on the outskirts of Paris.
The doorman thought I was English.
I gave my name as Mr. Smith.
Thank God, he let me in.
We should leave for Meudon at nightfall.
I have a permit for my manservant.
You will impersonate him.
Do not get up.
Are the streets safe?
I wouldn't risk it!
You wish to go out?
No, I'm seeing Madame to her carriage.
All's quiet around here but further on there's trouble!
Thank you.
I'll tell my driver to be careful.
I won't be long.
Citizen, we're under orders to let no one out.
But I have to be back in Meudon by midnight.
Orders from Paris and Meudon are different.
I'm not a Parisian.
I'm not running away.
I just want to go home.
I beg you, for God's sake...
Sorry, they're my orders.
And don't try another barrier.
Find yourself a bed or you'll be arrested at 10 o'clock when the house searches start.
Vehicles must be off the street.
They won't let us out.
I feared as much.
Drive on.
Where to, Madame?
The AllÃ©es des Invalides.
What's wrong with you, fellow?
He's drunk.
He's still in his cups.
Shame on you, rascal!
I'll walk you to your door.
The sot can lean on me.
I don't want my lady friend to see him like this.
I'll wait till he's sobered up.
I'm going home.
I don't want to be arrested for you two.
Thirty sous.
Take care!
The patrols will soon be out.
I feel better.
The air is cooler here.
- Let's make haste.
- Careful!
They're going to guard the wall.
We're done for!
Don't let me jeopardize you.
Give me up.
You'll save one life at least, yours.
I shan't even save mine.
They'll think I'm your accomplice.
Then I'll go alone.
If you're still strong enough, let us turn back.
Where to?
My house at Monceau.
I am exhausted.
Keep walking slowly.
Act sick, drag your leg.
That won't be difficult.
Faster, old man!
It's after curfew.
Thank heavens it wasn't a patrol.
They're going back to the section-house.
We'll meet others, more dangerous.
I don't want you caught.
Abandon me.
Try a little harder.
Beyond Place Louis XV, we'll find darkness.
It'll take us hours.
No matter.
I undertook to rescue you.
I shall do so or perish with you.
Let that be clear!
Look!
There's PulchÃ©rie, my cook, in the doorway.
She is a Jacobin.
We can't trust her.
I've an idea. Let's go to the Duke's garden in Monceau.
It's nearby.
If he finds out we're there, he will say nothing for your sake.
I don't like it.
We would have to pass my doorway or go around and risk meeting a patrol.
Hide here. I'll go home and see what I can do.
Enemies of the people are spreading rumors...
Madame, what a surprise!
Did you come on foot?
As you can see.
From Meudon?
I took a cab to the barriers.
With all the horrors now in Paris,
I felt uneasy in the country.
Don't stay out here.
The patrol is coming.
PulchÃ©rie,
I'm starving.
Bring me some roast fowl and salad.
The larder is empty.
Go wake up the innkeeper.
He'll probably charge me ten louis.
But there's a curfew.
I'll be arrested!
They won't bother you.
You're known at the section-house.
Go quick or I'll dismiss you.
The patrol!
They're coming down the street.
All right, let's wait.
Forgive me, Madame...
Monsieur, who are you?
How dare you enter my house at such an hour in times like these?
Have mercy.
I turned myself in this afternoon.
I was acquitted and allowed to go home.
As I passed your door,
I thought I'd greet you.
Greetings, Monsieur, but should I believe you?
He's lying.
You're Champcenetz, aren't you?
The Palace governor.
A wanted man, ready for the scaffold.
You nasty aristocrat!
I'd turn you in if it weren't for Madame.
Go on! Be off!
Please leave at once.
You'll have us all arrested for conspiracy.
What are you waiting for?
Over the garden wall.
I'm not sure he can.
Help him.
Get moving, PulchÃ©rie.
I'm hungry.
Now is the time.
The patrol's away.
They'll have gone down Rue Verte.
What if she turns us in?
Where's Nanon?
Gone to ask after her son.
He may be dead.
One misery after another!
I'll be gone, Madame.
Don't endanger yourself.
He needs to lie down.
Come to my bedroom.
Does Madame have any alcohol?
Yes! I think there's some left.
I've an idea, but I doubt
Madame will like it.
Under the circumstances,
Madame won't mind if I am blunt.
If the patrol comes, as it will, they'll search the house from top to bottom.
I see only one hiding place, between the mattresses.
If we pull the middle one out, we can make a space beside the wall.
But he'll suffocate!
Let's try it.
Your idea is no good.
The bed looks rumpled.
It's suspicious.
They'll want to inspect it.
If I lie in it myself, they won't think anyone is hiding there.
Quick, let's not wait for Nanon.
Help me undress.
Good night, Justin.
Who is it?
PulchÃ©rie.
Wait.
All I found was some bread and patÃ©.
Some warm wine is coming.
That Champcenetz, what nerve!
He almost had us hanged, or guillotined, as they do now.
I'd love to see his scrawny head roll!
I'll watch from the front row!
- Forgive me Madame, but...
- I know.
Your son?
I saw him. He's alive.
God be praised!
He spared us that sorrow, at least.
The patrol!
Go and see.
Can you hear? They're coming.
Are you suffocating?
Not if I lie on my side.
Does it make a bigger hump?
Not if I rearrange the sheet.
It's hot.
It makes sense if I push it aside.
Can you breathe?
But I'm hot.
My God! Here they come.
They've all come in.
The municipal officers want to see Madame.
Let them come in and search.
I've nothing to hide.
Won't you get up?
No, I'm too weary.
Come in, then!
What is this?
House search, citizen.
By order of the Commune.
You're suspected of harboring
Mr. Champcenetz.
He came here after 11 o'clock, but I showed him out.
We'll see. Please get up.
Must I?
Well, not necessarily.
Not before so many men.
If they'll kindly leave, I'll oblige.
Very well. About turn!
Isn't she pretty?
I'll help her dress!
- I'll take her feet!
- Let me see!
Silence!
Stand back!
The lady is English.
Don't be a disgrace to the Nation.
Get out!
I'm all a tremble.
Your visit frightened me.
But now that I see how kind, obliging and considerate you are, and knowing I'm innocent,
I am not the least alarmed.
I shall arise and take you in person around the house.
No need, citizen.
No one we've seen tonight has been half so civil.
Stay in bed.
I'll be careful with your furnishings.
You, search the room.
You, look upstairs.
You, search the gardens.
How are you, sweetheart?
Hands off!
How about it?
What are you up to?
Out!
You won't find him.
Madame threw him out.
You can believe PulchÃ©rie.
You know her devotion to the people.
She'll tell you how I received him and sent him away directly.
Madame was outraged by his impudence.
Would she harbor so great a foe of the Duke?
Why didn't you have him arrested at once?
Though I dislike him,
I won't denounce anybody.
Then you're a bad citizen.
A patriot's duty is to inform on criminals.
Anyway, we'll find him before tomorrow.
We're wasting our time here.
Good night, citizen Elliott.
Let's go, quick!
Will that be all, Madame?
Certainly. Good night, PulchÃ©rie.
Who is it?
Nanon, Madame.
Come in.
They've gone.
Thank heaven!
It's over, Madame, don't worry.
I know.
Lock the door, quick!
He was here!
And you dared! Heavens!
I'm glad I didn't know!
What courage!
And how daring of you to offer to get up!
What if they had accepted?
They did not.
But I deserve no credit.
It is true, I was feeling doomed, but hearing you groan beneath the mattress
I suddenly recovered my wits and God gave me more courage than I ever had before.
When I accepted without much thought the task Madame Meyler asked of me,
I had no idea it would be so perilous.
I naively hoped I would be helping... forgive me, Sir... a closer friend than you.
I confess that when the patrol arrived,
I briefly regretted not having granted your wish and abandoned you to your fate.
But under the threat of those wretches and the imminence of danger,
I felt a sort of exaltation which was almost supernatural.
Rather than escape the peril,
I felt the urge to confront it together with all the innocent victims of today's barbarians.
I suddenly felt ashamed of not sharing their fate.
The horror of all the atrocities I've seen today is so strong that surely
I'd have been glad to climb the scaffold.
If you died,
I would have died with you.
By losing the fear of death
I saved myself, and you as well.
Move into my boudoir.
Marquis?
Can you hear me?
Feel him.
Such fever!
If he dies, what will we do?
Don't talk nonsense!
Give him some quinine powder.
See who it is.
His Highness, Madame.
Ask him to wait until I'm dressed.
I'm coming.
Justin, show him in.
I've come for news.
I heard you returned last night.
Please forgive my disarray...
I know how busy you are.
I wouldn't ask you to wait.
It takes me so long to get dressed.
I must look dreadful.
No, you just look worn out.
Are you sick?
I didn't sleep.
The police paid me a call in the middle of the night.
I barely avoided getting up naked in front of forty men.
But their leader,
Jacobin though he was, had not forgotten his manners.
Revolutionaries are not savages.
If you're hiding no one, you have nothing to fear.
But if you were to hide someone, you would be putting yourself in grave danger.
No, I wasn't lucky enough to rescue anyone from last night's horrors.
I must say I wish I had, even at my own peril.
If only these dreadful scenes could cure the admirers of this hideous Revolution!
These scenes are terrible indeed.
But in all revolutions, much blood has been spilt and once begun, it cannot readily be stopped.
Nothing compares in atrocity with what I saw yesterday coming from Meudon, the head of Madame de Lamballe, borne on a stake by a raging mob.
I saw it too.
My poor sister-in-law's head was brought to me as I was dining at Palais-Royal!
This horror is unforgivable.
What harm had she done?
As much as I dislike the Queen,
I was very fond of the Princess.
Don't you believe me?
I do.
I believe you did everything to prevent these murders to no avail.
You thought you'd lead the Revolution but it is leading you where you never wanted to go.
That's true, but we must look further ahead.
The Revolution will be of great use and benefit to our children although it's terrible for us to witness.
I wish you had remained in England when you were there.
I would have liked to.
I've always envied the life of an English country gentleman.
While my enemies taxed me with wishing to be king,
I would willingly exchange my lot and all my fortune for a small estate in England and the privileges of that delightful country, which I hope to see again.
Why not go back there?
Despite the awkwardness of my position here, do you think me perverse enough to go through the streets of Paris these days and not feel the deepest distress?
Nevertheless, two years ago, when La Fayette, whom I mistook for a patriot
- as all Frenchmen did - urged me to leave France for a while,
I told him my life was devoted to serving my country and I could only leave my seat at the Assembly for a position more useful to the Nation.
My friend,
I know you're a good man, even too good, and you let yourself be misled by the semblance of friendship.
But pray go no further!
It is not too late to break loose from the rabble.
Don't let them use your name to commit their loathsome deeds.
All this seems easy to do in your drawing room.
I wish it were so simple in reality.
But...
I am swept along in the torrent, irresistibly.
I am no longer master of my name or my person.
You can be no judge of my situation which is unpleasant, I assure you.
For God's sake, keep your political opinions to yourself.
Plague me no more on this subject, it will be of no use.
I must take my leave.
I'll call again tomorrow morning on my way to the Assembly.
You look very ill.
Should I send my physician?
No, thank you.
I just had a bad night.
You look better.
The quinine is taking effect.
You overheard us?
I could not help it.
Don't apologize.
With respect, I'm surprised you didn't tell the truth.
The Duke seemed well disposed.
He might have spared you the danger of hiding me by letting me escape over his garden wall.
I needed your consent.
The Duke will be back tomorrow.
I'll speak to him.
You seem very preoccupied.
Have there been more horrors?
I know nothing.
I was in Monceau.
But I shall hear news at the Assembly.
I hope the Royal Family is well and decently treated in that horrid Temple prison.
I believe so, although I'm sure they wouldn't pity me if I were in an even worse situation.
How can they keep the poor monarch in prison?
He broke his oath to the Nation.
A worthless oath!
Those people believe in neither God nor Devil.
I myself feel far guiltier than Louis.
He has done nothing.
What have you done?
I'm hiding someone.
Yesterday, you assured me...
Who?
The governor of the Tuileries.
What?
Champcenetz?
Poor woman, there's no greater crime today!
He can't get out of Paris.
He'll be discovered.
You'll both be executed!
Can't you let him out through your garden?
It's surrounded by troops.
Dear Grace, you're risking your life for a miserable cause.
Champcenetz is a good-for-nothing!
He treated me like an ungrateful oaf.
You once gave him command of a regiment.
Against the Queen's wishes.
She wanted it for one of her dependants.
She thought a prince's regiment should go to a man of the highest rank.
Not to a recent nobleman, like your protÃ©gÃ©!
I enjoyed annoying her.
I did!
Far from being grateful, he sided with my adversaries.
I'd rather you rescued someone else, not that miserable creature!
Champcenetz would give anything to see you and implore your pardon.
It would be most unwise of me to meet him.
My people would find out.
You could see him without a single person knowing except my chambermaid.
I must hurry to the Assembly.
I deeply regret leaving you in the danger into which your folly has led you.
I'll try to see how I can get this man out, but please keep your politics to yourself.
Would to God you were safely in England!
I fear much for your safety here.
The Duke hates me.
He's gone to have me arrested.
He would doom me, too.
He will let me out only to turn me in.
If you get out,
I'll see you're brought to safety.
How will you know?
The Duke is trustworthy.
Good day, Sir.
Please sit down.
How are you, Madame?
There's color in your cheeks again.
The mere effect of sleep.
Will you have some tea?
I prefer your port wine.
You shouldn't have any.
After such confinement, you seem weak and sickly.
Broth would suit you better.
That might arouse my cook's suspicions.
Your Highness, you are goodness itself.
I must have seemed ungrateful.
I meant to explain my behavior.
Mr. De Champcenetz, no explanations.
We'll not discuss the past or anything other than the predicament of this excellent person who is risking her life to save yours.
She is unwell.
I fear you are both in extreme danger.
I would help you for her sake, but I fear it may not be possible.
You and I must forget that we met before, for we shall never meet in the future.
I hope I will never hear your name again.
Long ago,
I formed my opinion of you.
I'm very annoyed that you can't leave here, for I shan't relax while you're under this roof.
I've said enough.
As soon as the barriers were open,
I took Champcenetz to Meudon...
Some time later...
From the Duke of Orleans.
"The mail coach that calls at Saint Denis
"will take your protÃ©gÃ© to Boulogne for 50 louis.
"I enclose a note to the landlord of the Pavillon Royal in St. Denis.
"Your affectionate friend,
Orleans."
Some years later, I learned that
Champcenetz got safely to England.
In mid-January, the Duke de Biron asked me to tell his fortune.
Why bother reading cards?
What can you hope from these terrible times?
You asked me to tell your fortune.
You didn't believe me last time.
I did.
Some of your words came true before I went to war.
But you ignored them.
I wish the Duke and yourself had taken my words more seriously.
The King would have kept his crown and you would still be living in peace and joy instead of spending your life in hiding without a house or carriage for shelter.
I'm not reduced to that.
Why are you in Paris now without a home, forced to stay in a hotel?
To clear my name before the Minister of War.
Clear your name?
Of accusations brought against me by one Rossignol, a revolutionary general under my command.
You naively hope to be believed instead of him?
I'm as good a Republican as he.
I shall convincingly refute the allegations of this madman.
He took part in the
September massacres.
On the contrary, in this day and age, that is his best credential in the eyes of those who dare to judge their king.
The King's trial is the cruelest, most abominable act ever known.
What surprises me most is that not a single French chevalier had the courage to set the Convention on fire, burn all the monsters sitting inside and release the King and Queen from prison.
It saddens me as much as you, but have no fear, at worst, the King will be incarcerated until things settle down.
Indeed, some of the Convention will vote for his death, but... it's a comfort to know that the Duke will not vote.
I have his word for it.
What I wish is that he would vote to free the King.
That's not possible.
He'll never do it.
We must be thankful that he will abstain, lest, if the King were banished, he might incite foreign powers to invade France with all the consequences.
Worse things could happen!
Those consequences scare me less than the thought of the Duke voting to incarcerate the King.
Would that I could convince him!
I'd give my life to spare him that dishonor.
I've tried to make him see the error of his ways.
He seemed persuaded, but he keeps going back to that Madame de Buffon who took my place in his heart and follows the politics of Laclos and Merlin.
Will you grant me a favor?
May I meet the Duke here tomorrow?
When I see him at Madame de Buffon's, he's never alone and I cannot speak my heart to him.
Of course.
I'm expecting him tomorrow at two o'clock. Come then.
My respects, Madame.
I rarely see you these days.
Politics occupy... and preoccupy me.
I'll come straight to the point.
What is your view of this wicked trial at the Convention?
Will you sit with those miscreants?
As a deputy, I must.
How can you sit there and see your king and cousin dragged before that gathering of ruffians who dare to insult him with their interrogations?
I wish I could be at the Convention to hurl my shoes at the President and Santerre!
Restrain yourself, Madame!
I know my duty and need no advice.
I hope that's true, and you'll vote for the King's release.
Certainly, and for my own death!
The Duke will not vote.
The King mistreated him all his life, but he is his cousin.
He'll feign illness and stay at home on the day of the vote to decide the King's fate.
Then, Highness,
I am sure you won't attend the Convention that day.
I beg you, don't.
On my word of honor, I won't.
Although...
I feel the King was guilty of lying to the Nation, nothing can induce me, as his relative, to vote against him.
A meager consolation.
I see no other.
Please excuse me.
In these circumstances
I have little time for myself... and my friends.
We'll meet this evening.
I see our poor prince is in such a predicament that he'll need all his courage of which he has plenty contrary to some people's suggestions.
I do not doubt it either, but... let me be frank.
The Duke is very kind, and of the best character, but no one is less fit to lead a powerful party.
Neither his upbringing nor his brains nor his talents equip him for such high office.
You, his seditious friends, with your flattery, have harmed him.
Who gave him the foolish idea of being elected to the Convention?
He is not a gifted orator.
They've nicknamed him the Mute Deputy.
It is my turn to take my leave.
Since the army has temporarily discharged me, may I invite you to my hotel on Saturday evening with Madame Laurent and General Dumouriez?
We can follow the vote which I hope will be merciful.
Your Girondin friends are deserting the King.
Will you go with them?
Listen, Madame.
I know there are rumors in Paris that I, General Dumouriez, am wavering from side to side.
No.
I am perfectly neutral.
I act as a soldier.
My duty is to serve the army in every way I can.
One way is to delay this trial which is less iniquitous than you think.
Don't say that.
It's an abomination.
Must I be the only one to say it?
With due respect, it's not so much iniquitous as useless.
Instead of disputing the King's fate, this precious time should have been used to prepare the next campaign.
My arguments support yours.
Yours are very cold.
To theJacobins, cold reason weighs infinitely more than the warmth of your love and pity.
Even if it's true that Louis is a lying rascal, which most deputies believe, we'd be fools to behead him.
By foreseeing the worst, one can avoid it.
A death sentence would have the same effect on our neighbors as the Brunswick Manifesto had on our countrymen.
We must not alarm Europe.
We must win the people over with gentleness, not drive them away with terror.
That's why I came back to Paris, to persuade the Convention to change its policy.
The Duke of Orleans entered the Convention at eight o'clock.
He will vote for incarceration.
Good heavens!
I fear worse yet.
So far, there's no majority for death.
Let's hope.
Majority for death, including the Duke's vote.
His too?
He swore to me...
He said,
"Thinking only of my duty,
"convinced that all who violate the people's will should die,
"I vote for death."
361 votes in favor,
360 against.
He tipped the balance.
No. You must add
26 votes for conditional death.
Counting them will make...
I'm ashamed to wear this.
The Nation has disgraced itself.
Let the Republic find the defenders it deserves!
The Republic has better things to do than take revenge on its princes and suspect its generals.
If it condemns us, who will defend it?
I never thought much of Orleans.
Now that he has blood on his hands, my scorn has turned to rightful loathing.
I weep for his children.
In them, I see as many virtues as he has vices.
His cowardice will get him nowhere.
He's in jeopardy like the rest of us, free spirits who strove for the Revolution in its early days.
He won't even have the satisfaction of saving his own honor along with the Revolution's.
We will have no choice but to seek asylum with the enemy.
What?
You're willing to betray France?
What France?
This ragbag of power-hungry scoundrels?
Get me the large basket from the wardrobe.
Get rid of these clothes and jewels.
I don't care how.
Get them out of my sight.
What is it, Madame? The Duke?
He voted for the King's death.
If he had not,
Louis might have been saved.
Death?
Yes. He went to the Convention not to save his cousin but to doom him.
I've never felt so repelled by anyone as he repels me today.
I cannot tolerate to have around me anything that once belonged to him.
Having belonged to him myself,
I cannot bear myself.
Without God and my faith to support me...
Tomorrow morning, pack my trunks while I get a travel permit.
We'll go to Meudon.
The day the King died was the saddest I ever saw.
The day the King died was the saddest I ever saw.
Even the clouds seemed to mourn.
Meudon is on a hill.
With a spyglass one could see Place Louis XV.
There are people there.
Many?
Yes. The crowds are everywhere.
I don't want to see.
Are there soldiers?
I think so. I see blue and red.
Are they moving?
- Who?
- I don't know.
The soldiers, the crowd.
They're all standing still.
Did you hear that?
What's happening?
The people are rebelling!
God be praised!
What can you see?
Nothing.
It looks as if...
What was that?
I don't know.
I know.
And so do you.
Come, let's not stay here.
I don't think it is possible to feel a family misfortune as sharply as I feel the King's death.
Yet, as you see, my eyes are dry.
I wept too much beforehand.
I'll never weep again, not even over my own death which will be soon.
Your death, Madame?
May God preserve and protect you as He did the other night.
God works in mysterious ways.
Now, all we can do is pray.
About six weeks after the King's death,
I fell very ill...
About six weeks after the King's death,
I fell very ill...
The patrol!
Again?
Can't they leave me in peace?
I shan't get up, but I want to see the officer.
Bring him in here.
Greetings, citizen.
Pray what is going on?
House search, by order.
I've been searched twice already this week.
For what? There's nothing here.
The other patrols were from Meudon and SÃ¨vres.
We're from Versailles and more thorough, believe me.
Nobody fools us.
Nor the others.
I have no wish to fool anyone.
I'm a good citizen and no conspirator.
We shall see.
We heard you're hiding flour.
There's a pound of it left in the kitchen.
Please be quick.
Permit me not to accompany you.
As you see, I am ill.
We'll manage by ourselves.
Good health, citizen!
They've gone.
Madame can sleep.
What are they after?
I wish I knew.
In fact, I know.
Nothing.
They're just vying to outdo each other.
Bring me my writing box.
It's nearly midnight.
You need sleep.
I'll sleep in the morning while you take this letter to the doctor.
Would you please be kind enough to inform the Duke that I am feeling better and in answer to his invitation,
I intend to visit him at Palais-Royal the day after tomorrow.
You look puzzled.
Don't think I've forgiven him, but... he sends me such endearing letters daily,
I can't help softening towards him.
He sent me his physician.
He keeps entreating me to visit him as soon as I am well.
I owe it to him.
Besides, I have no choice.
I don't want to die for nothing.
When I rescued Champcenetz, my life didn't matter.
But I don't want to be guillotined on grounds of mere suspicion.
Suspicion of what? Dear God!
Until now,
I never wanted to leave France.
I had made it... my adopted country.
I made its King my King.
Now that he is no more,
I shall return to my England.
The Duke alone has the power to procure me a passport.
He owes me that for ignoring my advice and acting as a criminal.
Now he can redeem himself a little.
You're chilled to the bone.
Would you like some tea to warm you?
For now, just a glass of water.
It's warm in here.
Take a seat.
You look unwell.
I hope you have fully recovered from your cold.
Yes, I'm over it.
But it upsets me to see you after what happened last month.
Your black clothes remind me of those terrible events.
You are mourning the King's death like me, I presume.
I'm mourning my father-in-law, the Duke of PenthiÃ¨vre.
His death was doubtless hastened by the King's.
Or was it by the cruel way in which the trial was held and your vote for his death?
I dare say he died of heartbreak as I shall.
But your Highness will die like the poor King on the scaffold.
Lord, what a state you're in!
I certainly would not have begged you to come had I remotely suspected it.
The King was sentenced and he is gone.
I could not stop his death.
My vote was not decisive!
- There were other votes...
- I know.
But you promised not to vote.
This is a dismal topic.
You cannot, you must notjudge me.
I know my position.
I could not avoid doing what I did.
I may be more pitiable than you can imagine.
More than anyone in France,
I'm the slave of a faction.
But let's change the subject.
Things could not be worse.
I want you safe in England.
But how to get you out of France?
I have no idea.
If money can buy a passport,
I will pay Â£500 sterling.
It's all I can do for you now.
Rulers like money, that's what gives me hope.
I'll try to approach their ringleaders.
But Robespierre, the "Incorruptible" whom I never see, is all-powerful.
Your archenemy, I hear.
I have every reason to think so, although... two months ago, when he was planning to have me exiled, he said I had not been an unworthy citizen.
My exile would not be a punishment but a precaution.
Then he won't be displeased to see you leave France.
It would be your wisest move.
Don't you believe it.
They didn't reprieve me from exile just to see me leave voluntarily, or help my friends to leave.
Don't try to fathom the depths of our politicians' minds.
Will you take tea with me now?
Will you be dining in the country?
At my house in Paris.
I'll keep the fires lit for a few days.
I shall avoid returning to Meudon.
The patrols from Versailles and SÃ¨vres are harassing me.
Then stay in Paris, although I fear you won't be treated better here.
I am told you were very reckless during the Revolution.
Be careful from now on!
Keep your thoughts to yourself.
Wear black for the King if you want to, by God, but say you are mourning a relative or you'll be in worse trouble than I can get you out of.
I'd rather you stayed in the country until you can obtain a passport to England.
Personally, I wish I'd never left.
Now I'll never see England again.
I'll call in a few days to report on my progress.
Take a seat, Highness.
I am not staying.
I only came to tell you to forget about the passport.
I've done all I could but I was told by a person in authority, whom I cannot name, that you must not apply for one or even mention England.
You must bear your misfortune like the others and keep quiet.
I fear your house will be searched in the next few days.
I advise you to dispose of any incriminating papers.
In late March or early April, when General Dumouriez fled France...
In late March or early April, when General Dumouriez fled France...
The Duke, Madame.
With two gendarmes.
Two gendarmes?
How now?
What's going on?
What is the meaning of your escort?
I'm not escorted by choice.
It was decided by the powers that be.
Are you under arrest?
Not quite, yet.
But news has come that Dumouriez, whose adjutant is my son, the Duke of Chartres, refuses to obey the Convention's orders.
So he's joining the enemy?
What else can he do except march on Paris?
His troops wouldn't follow.
So my "escort" is due to my son!
I left you a letter he wrote me blaming me for the King's death.
You'd be wise to return it to me.
It will endanger you instead.
Have no fear.
I don't know why I left it with you.
It dishonors me and could have imperiled you.
I advise you to burn all correspondence, however harmless, that you may have put aside.
Whether you like it or not,
I approve of your son's outspoken defense of Louis.
I prefer to be reproached by you than by him.
You're an incorrigible royalist, but... my son's defection, which some call treason, undoes all our family's efforts to support the Revolution.
The Revolution itself annihilated them.
I am left with nothing.
No family, no friends.
I shall remain alone for a short while.
If I must perish,
I shall go willingly, disavowing none of my words, deeds or thoughts, if you don't mind.
I don't only mind,
I am desolate!
I loved you and I still love you.
I hope God loves you and I pray for you as I hope you would for me.
Prayers would save neither of us,
I fear.
Perhaps not in this world, but in the next.
I doubt the Supreme Being is on the side of tyrants.
He is not on the side of perjurers!
Enough of this.
It's too late to philosophize.
Dear Grace, I love you.
I want you to be happy.
I firmly believe that if I die, you will survive.
I am concerned about the money you invested in my affairs.
I will take steps to ensure that after my death the income will be paid to you in England.
So my demise will not ruin you.
Stop talking like this!
Who knows which of us will die first?
I shall.
I hope so, for your sake and mine.
Since nobody loves me any more, why go on living? Adieu.
Prince, despite everything, remember that I love you.
That evening
The guards are here.
Show them in.
Citizen Elliott, the citizen-president of the Roule Section has ordered us to inspect your papers.
My papers? Do you mean...
Every piece of writing.
Especially letters to you.
Are they locked away?
Some are.
- The keys are...
- Leave it to the guard!
Search the writing desk.
You three, inspect the room.
Search every drawer!
The rest of you, follow me.
Those are personal.
But you may read them.
I've nothing to hide.
In English, I suppose!
I don't speak it.
I can translate.
We'll find an interpreter.
Wrap them up.
You there!
Bring that writing box.
Put it here.
No doubt it has secret compartments.
And what is this?
- A letter.
- I realize that.
It is sealed and not addressed to you.
How does it come to be in your possession?
It was sent to me from Naples.
Why was it sent via you?
Gentlemen, as you ought to know,
Naples was blockaded by the French fleet under Admiral Latouche-TrÃ©ville.
It was sent to me by his courier.
No matter!
As you ought to know, citizen,
England is at war with us.
Corresponding with the Republic's enemies is an offense punishable by the guillotine!
We have long been suspicious of you.
Now here is the undeniable proof.
Have no doubt, your fate will soon be settled.
What are you saying?
Mr. Fox is your friend.
He's in correspondence with the Surveillance Committee.
Don't confuse him with Mr. Pitt, the Prime Minister, your sworn enemy.
Mr. Fox is a liberal.
The Committee will decide.
Anyway, we have orders to arrest you tonight.
Citizen Grace Georgina Elliott, in the name of the Republic,
I arrest you.
Let me at least take a few clothes.
Be quick!
Fetch me my warmest shawl.
Sit there.
Shapely wench!
Drink this, it'll warm you up.
It's no Burgundy, but you can't be choosy now with no more dukes or princes to protect you.
Without protection, the party's over.
Answer when you're spoken to!
My protection is my conscience.
I've done no wrong.
If you hadn't conspired, you wouldn't be here...
About to dance on Place Louis XV.
We'll watch you.
It'll be a pretty sight, my sweet.
You won't get away.
The guillotine! Ever heard of it?
Good invention, eh?
That's progress.
Makes nice music.
Just three little notes...
Scared, aren't you!
A new dance to learn, my pretty!
The steps are easy.
I'm not afraid. I'm innocent.
You're not my judges! Leave me be!
Leave her alone!
Don't answer them, citizen.
I have the right to say I'm innocent.
If your only charge against me is Mr. Fox's letter,
I'll surely be acquitted.
If you broke the seal and read it, you'd see it was sent not to an enemy of Liberty but to a good patriot.
Why didn't you read it to us?
Shut up!
I don't want to open it.
I cannot. It was entrusted to me.
The Committee will decide.
Take your time!
It's nicer out than in!
Stay here.
The lavatory's over there behind the buffet.
I managed to find you a chair, citizen.
For me?
Why show me such favor?
It was my idea.
I've always thought you were a good citizen.
My sister Roseline is your lace-maker.
I see!
I am here because of a dreadful misunderstanding.
Then you'll soon be free.
Please use this chair, ladies.
It was brought for you, Madame.
You have the privilege of age and you were here before me.
We've stood so far.
We can remain standing.
Let's take turns sitting.
When I'm tired of standing, I'll tell you.
Please, you go first.
I accept.
My poor legs are so swollen,
I fear they will burst.
Aren't you the Duchess of Grammont?
And you, the Duchess of Chatelet?
I am.
And who are you?
If we ever get out of here, we must meet again.
I see you're persecuted for the right cause.
My name is Grace Elliott.
I thought so.
AbbÃ© de Damas often told me of how you risked your life to help a fugitive and of the good advice you gave an unfortunate prince.
You look very light.
Why don't you sit on my lap?
I must be heavy.
Light as a feather.
And you smell so good!
It shields me from the filthy stench in here.
It's my secret.
A small lavender bag that my chambermaid thoughtfully gave me this morning.
Follow me.
Quick.
God be with you.
You too.
"It's a joy to see
"how, little by little,
"the holy guillotine will deliver us
"from all the human flesh-eaters."
Follow me.
Not you.
Prince!
All is well with you, I hope.
By God, Grace! It's you?
I am very sorry indeed.
What has befallen you?
And you?
Is he going to prison?
No, to Palais-Royal.
Until further notice.
You heard what he said to her?
Yes. Very suspicious.
Next.
Please be seated.
Citizen Elliott,
Georgina Grace, nÃ©e Dalrymple.
What has she done?
She's an Englishwoman residing on Rue Miromesnil.
We found this letter in her house.
From one Englishman to another.
It is unopened.
What is in it?
I have no idea at all.
I was asked to forward it to Mr. Fox.
A blatant case of conspiracy.
I know the woman. She's a royalist.
She plotted in England to wed
Orleans' daughter to an English prince.
Send her to the Force prison!
Citizen Chabot,
I find you somewhat hasty.
Why was this person arrested for having a letter to Mr. Fox in her house?
Had it been to that rascal Pitt, you couldn't have treated her worse.
Mr. Fox is our friend, the friend of a free world.
He loves our Revolution.
Then, citizen Vergniaud, let's open the letter to make sure.
No. It is needless and improper.
Is it honorable to read a private letter to a great man?
It shan't be done.
We'll send the letter intact to Mr. Fox.
No. It must be opened and read.
I agree.
Do you?
No.
Yes.
Likewise.
Latouche-TrÃ©ville's manifesto.
It's in English.
Our interpreter is inspecting papers in a suburb of St. Germain.
We cannot wait for him.
Citizen Elliott, please come forward and translate for us.
Don't cheat!
We know enough English to tell if you're lying.
Here's our interpreter. Sit down.
Translate this from the beginning.
"I enclose within this missive
"the manifesto from Admiral Latouche-TrÃ©ville
"to the King of Naples.
"I cannot help but admire
"the bravery and energy of the French nation at this time.
"I share your belief
"that the French Revolution
"is one of the world's most glorious events.
"Human rights are the true foundation
"of every rational constitution,
"as they are of England's own Constitution.
"The war in America
"has taught us that a people's uprising
"is never spurious."
What about that?
Isn't it magnificent?
Wasn't I right?
Citizen, accept our apologies.
You may go.
You must be very tired.
One of the Committee's carriages will drive you home.
I can hardly stand up after spending two horrid nights in sordid, brutal conditions.
The people of your section were overzealous. They've wasted our time.
Citizen!
A few more questions, if I may.
Do you know citizen d'Orleans, also known as Egalit<b>Ã©</b>?
Did you speak with him in the waiting room just now?
I only asked him how he was.
What, pray, did he say?
He said,
"By God, I am sorry to see you here."
He was afraid you'd be questioned about him and would betray him.
I was examined and found innocent.
Please let me go!
This is a different charge.
As a Committee member,
I can indict you as Orleans' accomplice.
God, will this never end?
Tears do not move us.
The tears shed in this room could supply all of Paris with water.
Orleans wanted to be king and overthrow the Republic.
I'm sure he didn't.
You know he did!
That's why he voted for the King's death.
With all my heart, I wish he hadn't.
He could be happy now.
Then why did he vote?
Because you made him commit that ghastly crime.
You call it a crime?
It's reckless of you to say so here, in front of 50 Convention members who all voted the tyrant Capet dead not to become kings, but to rid the world of his vile race!
Now we'll deal with the would-be king and admirer of England, that graveyard of Liberty with which he connives, and you too!
You won't escape me.
Take her to prison!
She must be tried!
You're going too far.
She's been tried.
She's Mr. Fox's friend.
She can't have plotted.
There's no proof at all.
What is this din?
What's going on?
Citizen Robespierre, they won't let me arrest this Englishwoman, a friend of Orleans and a conspirator.
Has she been heard?
And acquitted.
On another charge, and wrongly so.
She was found with a letter to Charles Fox, our friend.
What was in it?
It praises the actions of our fleet in Naples.
We have more important business.
Let her go home.
There's time to decide.
It's six o'clock.
Is it morning or evening?
Morning. Madame has slept since yesterday afternoon.
I can get up although I'm not quite rested.
Did Madame see the letter on her nightstand?
The Duke sent it yesterday.
I didn't dare wake you.
He says he's coming at noon.
But I have to leave for Meudon.
I'll send him word to come... when I return tonight at eight.
Justin can deliver it.
I couldn't deliver it.
I went to Palais-Royal.
The Duke was arrested this morning.
In his bed, at 4 a.m.
Throw it in the fire.
Wait!
Hang the Duke's portrait back on the wall.
Philippe d'Orleans was escorted to Fort St. Jean in Marseilles and then back to Paris to be executed on November 5th.
By then,
Grace Elliott was under arrest.
While her fellow captives' heads rolled, she awaited her turn, which did not come.
The fall of Robespierre set her free.
I am a stone.
I do not move.
Very slowly,
I put snow in my mouth,
then he won't see my breath.
I take my time.
I let him come closer.
I have only one bullet.
I aim at his eye.
Very gently, my finger presses on the trigger.
I do not tremble.
I have no fear.
I'm a big boy now.
Ready, Vassili?
Now, Vassili.
Fire!
Fire, Vassili!
Fire!
Come on, pick your feet up.
Get on your feet.
Prepare to board the train.
You there, come along with me now.
This way, pal.
All civilians, get out!
Make way, let the civilians off.
This is a military convoy.
No one stays on board but our valiant soldiers.
This is a convoy to Stalingrad...
only for the soldiers of the Red Army.
All aboard!
Autumn, 1942.
Europe lies crushed beneath the Nazi jackboot.
The German Third Reich is at the height of its power.
Hitler's armies are charging through the heart of the Soviet Union...
towards the oil fields of Asia.
One last obstacle remains.
A city on the Volga...
where the fate of the world is being decided: Stalingrad.
Glorious comrade Stalin...
has ordered not another step backwards.
The people of the Soviet Union shall be free.
Go forward, comrades.
Not a step backwards!
Listen to these letters sent by Russian mothers...
to their sons on the front.
"Volodya, my child,
I know that it's for our motherland...
"I know that it's for our motherland that you are giving your life.
"Everyone here knows that you will not fall back.
"Everyone here is proud of you.
"Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists".
Nobody move!
Stay on the boat!
Get back or I'll shoot!
Back from the rails, or we shoot.
Shoot the traitors!
Come on, come on!
Move!
Come on, comrades, come on!
Move, or you'll be shot!
Over here, stretcher!
The one with the rifle shoots!
One out of two gets a rifle.
The one without follows him!
When the one with the rifle gets killed,
the one who is following picks up the rifle and shoots!
The one with the rifle shoots!
The one without follows him!
When the one with the rifle gets killed,
the one who is following...
picks up the rifle and shoots!
The one with the rifle shoots!
- This way, now.
- The one without follows him!
Soldiers of the glorious
Red Army, from now on...
it is either victory or death!
- Those who retreat will be shot.
- I need a rifle.
There will be no mercy for cowards and traitors!
Achtung!
It's hopeless, comrades.
Get back!
Pull back!
Pull back!
Get back! Get back!
In the name of the Soviet Union,
not a step backwards, or we shoot.
No retreat!
Not a step back!
- No mercy!
- Deserters will be shot.
- Fire!
- Shoot the traitors!
Cowards will be shot!
No mercy for cowards!
Russians, surrender.
You will see your home again.
This is not your war.
Join your German comrades, they understand your suffering...
and will care more for you than your own officers,
who are only sending you to your death.
The Third Reich is not your enemy.
The enemy is bloodthirsty Stalin and his Bolshevik camp,
who have stolen your land, who have deported your father...
Fire!
You'll get us caught, comrade Commissar.
With your permission, comrade Commissar.
- Which one should I aim at first?
- You should wait... till there's an explosion.
- Do you know how to shoot?
- A little.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
He's looking at us.
Thank you, comrade Commissar.
Danilov, political officer, second class.
Twenty-first infantry.
"Vassili Zaitsev".
"On this day,
September the 20th, 1942,
"a shepherd boy from the Urals...
"Arrived in the city of Stalingrad, on the banks of the Volga.
"His name is Vassili Zaitsev.
"Like thousands before him, he came to answer comrade Stalin's call.
"Armed with a rifle, he quickly made the fascist invader realize that...
"from now on he would be punished for every step he took in the motherland; that from here on, the only way was back".
What do you think?
I think comrade Commissar's been overgenerous.
Let me go!
Let me go!
By order of comrade Stalin, no civilian can leave the city.
Get back!
Stand away, or we will open fire.
Stand away!
Get back!
Get back or we shoot!
Back!
Keep back!
Make way for comrade Stalin's envoy!
I carried out my orders.
I sent in all of my boys.
But the Germans engulfed us.
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.
- And me, what did I have?
- The sacred duty to resist!
I have to report to the boss.
Perhaps you'd prefer to avoid the red tape.
My name is...
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.
I've come to take things in hand here.
This city is not Kursk... nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.
This city is Stalingrad.
Stalingrad!
This city bears the name of the boss.
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.
If the Germans capture this city, the entire country will collapse.
Now, I want our boys... to raise their heads.
I want them to act like they have balls!
I want them to stop shitting their pants!
That's your job.
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.
You, what's your suggestion?
Shoot all the other generals who have retreated...
and their chiefs of staff too.
M- Make some examples.
- D-D-Deport families of the deserters...
- Yeah, that's all been done.
Give them hope!
Here, the men's only choice is between German bullets and ours.
But there's another way.
The way of courage.
The way of love of the motherland.
We must publish the army newspaper again.
We must tell magnificent stories.
Stories that extol...
sacrifice, bravery.
We must make them believe in the victory.
We must give them hope, pride, a desire to fight.
Yes, we need to make examples.
But examples to follow.
What we need... are heroes.
Do you know any heroes around here?
Yes, comrade,
I know one.
That's me!
"Vassili Zaitsev".
That's me!
No, you're not dreaming.
It's your name.
We made the front page.
They haven't changed a word.
Do you have any idea what this means?
It's not the back page, it's not the second page,
- it's the front page.
- The front page!
They're going to reprint our article everywhere.
In the Caucasus, in the Crimea, even in the Urals.
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself will be sitting over breakfast, reading my words, memorizing your name.
We're famous, Vassili.
Kruschev loved the article.
He's promoted me to the general staff.
And you to sniper division.
- Well, that's good.
- It's very good.
- It's very good. It's great.
- It's very great!
- It's great!
- For us because we did it together.
Together!
- Although I did all the hard work.
- Oh, yeah?
- You're very lucky I can't fight back.
- Why's that?
Because Kruschev told me to make sure nothing happens to you.
- You're too important.
- I'm too valuable.
Yes, careful of my... careful of my glasses, please. They're new.
Sorry, sir.
- I'm famous! We're famous!
- I'm famous! I'm famous!
Vassili, the young shepherd from the Urals,
killed his 12th
German officer today.
He used to hunt wolves, now he shoots fascists.
Today, Vassili Zaitsev shot his 23rd German officer.
He is an example to us all.
Vassili shot his 32nd German officer.
Count only the Germans you have killed.
- Today, Vassili Zaitsev...
- Here is the evidence...
11 dog tags retrieved by sniper Vassili Zaitsev.
More and more men and women, fighters from all branches of our armed forces,
join the sniper division and learn the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.
I am a stone.
I am a stone.
I breathe slowly.
I aim at the eye.
So it is you, the great Vassili Zaitsev.
- My mother makes potatoes with bacon.
- Sounds good.
When she sees you, she won't believe her eyes.
- How many today?
- Only two.
And the last one, why didn't you shoot him?
He was only a foot soldier.
Wasn't worth giving away my position.
Bless you.
We know how much we owe you.
We pray for you every day.
Every evening, we listen to them talk about you on Radio Moscow.
Thanks. You've certainly managed well down here.
My parents used to store furniture down here before the war.
Sacha, drop that right now.
It's loaded.
This way, comrade Commissar.
Thank you, comrade.
Good evening.
Comrade Zaitsev?
My God, where does all this mail come from?
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.
This one's from the workers of the Kouzbass.
They want to name their mine after Vassili.
Right, let's start with the miners.
Come on, let's get to work.
Dear comrades from the Kouzbass,
- Kouzbass.
- I thank you for your letter of praise.
- Praise?
- R-A-I-S-E.
And... I hope that
I can live up... to your expectations...
A- T-I-O-N-S.
Expectations.
You're interested in German literature, Mrs. Filipov?
It's all right, it's our neighbor.
- Right, where were we?
- Tania, we have guests.
Your offer to name...
I...
I- I recognize you.
He's Vassili Zaitsev.
I saw your picture in the paper.
Thank you for everything you're doing.
- And this is his friend, Commissar...
- Danilov.
Danilov.
Tania is like a daughter to me.
She used to take care of Sacha when I worked at the factory.
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.
- Oh, they're yours?
- She studied German at the university.
- Which university?
- Moscow.
Moscow. Moscow.
Shouldn't we, uh...
Yes, let's continue.
Your offer to name your mine after me... is... a great honor.
H- O-N.
Yes, I know.
Honor.
Very good.
Shouldn't we make the point that
I'm not the only one fighting?
That... That's excellent... excellent idea, Vassili.
- We can take it even further though.
- Oh.
We can take it further.
Your battle for the production of coal... is as worthy as mine.
There's no "K" in coal.
Just-Just one "L."
Oh, tell me if I'm going too fast.
- No, you're not going too fast.
- You sure?
I just thought is there any other improvements?
Why don't you get some rest?
These letters can wait until tomorrow.
We should carry on.
We're not tired.
Thank you, Mrs. Filipov.
These people... took the trouble to write to us.
Tomorrow, we may not be around to write back.
Major Konig,
Herr General.
I was expecting someone... else.
Certainly not someone so prestigious.
I imagine you have your reasons... for getting yourself involved in this hellish situation.
My army is not designed for this kind of fighting.
Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote...
25 sergeants to replace the officers shot down by their sharpshooters.
Those snipers are demoralizing my people.
This city is no more than... a heap of ruins.
But the fuehrer's persisting.
He has made it a personal matter between Stalin and himself.
We should trust the fuehrer's instinct.
He always managed to lead us to victory.
We shall be back home for Christmas.
How are you going to go about finding this young Russian?
I'll fix it so that he's the one who finds me.
Vassili.
Vassili.
- Come on, time to get up.
- What?
They have a problem in the department store sector. They need us. Come on.
Look, Vassili, he's hiding in the department store. Over there.
So far this morning, he's knocked off five officers, plus two machine gunners.
Look, third floor, fourth window from the left.
Fourth window from the left.
See him?
Yeah, I see him.
There, you got him!
Great shot.
Let's go get his dog tag.
Good-bye, comrade Commissar.
Thank you for your hospitality, Mrs. Filipov.
You can borrow whatever you like.
I'm not sure what they would say to me at headquarters... if I came back with an armful of Goethe and Schiller.
There's some Marx too.
You were assigned to civil defense at the 12th district?
No, I volunteered.
It's such a coincidence meeting you like this.
Comrade Kruschev was telling me just yesterday... how desperately we're in need of operators who speak German.
I can't. Our militia's responsible for all the people in this neighborhood.
We're already desperately short of men.
We'll give you a dozen soldiers for every one that speaks German.
I'd rather stay and fight.
Serving at headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.
You stay here.
You cover us.
- All right.
- We go.
Take care.
Ludmilla, come on.
Check the stairway.
It's a trap.
I know.
Move back.
He's still here.
- They're coming straight for us!
- Ludmilla, stay where you are, he's over there somewhere.
We have to get out of here!
- We have to get out of here!
- Just stay where you are!
What are we gonna do?
Ludmilla, stay where you are!
Fuck this, I'm going.
Ludmilla, no!
What does this mean?
"The little shepherd from the Urals receives a new sniper's rifle,
"a Mosin-Nagant 7.62, with its 3.5-Power P.U. Telescope.
Pride of precision of Soviet production".
- I've seen that rifle close up.
- Have you?
I've even touched it.
I know him well, Vassili Zaitsev.
Ludmilla and Anton were killed today, and it was my fault.
No, I'm sure that's not true.
There was a German sniper.
I walked them right into his trap.
- What else can you tell me?
- He didn't relocate.
A sniper who doesn't relocate isn't normal.
He was very good. It wasn't just his shooting, it was his instinct.
He was a step ahead of me all the time.
That's because he knows everything about you.
His name is Konig,
Major Konig.
They've sent him here to ki... to find you.
At first we weren't sure if the information was reliable.
It seems he's come all the way from Berlin to stop you.
You've caused them so many sleepless nights, they sent their top marksman.
- What do we know about him?
- He's a major in the Wehrmacht.
He's director of their sniper school in Zossen.
Koulikov studied under him at Zossen before the war.
He knows all his tricks. From now on, he'll go with you everywhere.
A nobleman from Bavaria who hunts deer... against a shepherd boy from the Urals who poaches wolves.
It's more than a confrontation between two nations.
It's the essence of class struggle.
I'm glad you're so happy.
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.
No one shoots like you, Vassili.
She's been transferred.
I'll see if they're ready for you next door.
- Hello.
- You look smart in your new uniform.
Make sure they don't take it back once you've finished.
Yeah, they probably will.
I've heard the rumor about the German, and I wanted to wish you luck.
Thank you.
I'll need it.
From what comrade Danilov tells me, you're going to win.
Hmm.
It's time.
- Vassili! Vassili!
- Come to my arms.
Look in my direction.
Put your cap back on, you look more heroic.
- This way, comrade Zaitsev.
- I love this little fellow.
Vassili, is it true that you volunteered for the front?
How old are you, Vassili?
Do you know what this duel means for our country?
Is it true you killed your first wolf when you were five?
Are you proud to be challenged by the best sharpshooter in Germany?
The Germans are starting to shit their pants.
Go on, my boy, tell us how you're going to deal with him.
- Or rather, no. Tell it to the boss.
- One more question, please.
He likes good hunting stories.
Look at him with pride, because he's looking at you.
The whole country is looking at you.
Forgive me, forgive me,
Grandfather.
So, it's not the wolf that chooses the hunting ground... but the hunter.
But I'm sure your grandfather taught you that.
Except in this case,
I'm the game.
However, today what we're going to do...
is lure the wolf out of his lair...
to where we want him to be.
You're the one whose life is valuable.
You go first.
No, no. We take it in turns.
Next time is your turn to go first,
and then it's you, Volodya.
Son of a bitch!
These are new pants. I just took them off a captain from the 251 st yesterday.
Sixteen months I spent in Germany at the school in Zossen.
Of course, those were the days when we were friends with the Krauts;
when our Joseph and their Adolph...
were walking hand in hand.
From here to the wire,
160 meters, right?
One hundred and fifty-five.
Whatever. That'll make 'em send out a repair guy.
Let's relocate.
Aah!
Hey, Volodya!
After the Germans invaded us, it wasn't the same atmosphere anymore.
Threw my ass in prison.
What were you doing in Germany, huh?
Excuse me, says I, but it was comrade Stalin who sent me there.
Don't bring our glorious leader into your treachery.
Confess, spy bastard!
Confess.
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!
Well, there wasn't a sickle, but there was a hammer.
And bang.
Knocked out all my teeth.
That's right, boy.
Have no illusions.
That's the land of socialism and universal bliss for you.
Hey! It's your repair guy.
I got him.
It's about soup time, isn't it?
I'm going.
Well, get a move on, Volodya,
and try not to spill it all on your way back, you Marxist bastard.
The enemy sniper activity reported during the past 24 hours, Herr Major.
Two sentries shot in the train station sector.
One artillery observer in the Northern sector.
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer division in the factory sector.
Three telephone repairmen in the workers'housing sector.
They also tell me we have just taken a prisoner who may interest you.
I hope he's still able to speak.
Excuse me, sir?
Nothing.
Thank you.
So, tell us, Volodya,
which building is he in?
There is no way
I know that.
He moves around all the time.
He jumps from one to the next.
On which floor?
I don't know.
We'll see about that.
Undress him.
Put him in one of our uniforms.
You see, they are stubborn.
That's the good thing about the Germans.
Man, you got to admit when they get an idea in their heads...
Right.
Let's see if our customer has arrived.
Are you ready?
Uh-huh.
And now our famous shepherd from the Urals, who Major Konig thinks is an idiot, gets up to make sure he has hit his target.
Major Konig sees him.
Aims for his helmet.
Fires.
Reveals his position and is shot in turn.
Except...
Major Konig doesn't fire... because Major Konig isn't there.
Koulikov!
Don't you think that was strange, that last one?
They sent him out to get shot like the others.
It's not natural.
Not without artillery, without trying to cover him.
Oh, no, I'm the one who was stupid.
They don't give a shit about telephone guys.
I mean, it's like us with the Ukrainians.
They'd never bother a major over a few dead grunts.
Tomorrow, we'll kill us some generals.
Whose turn is it?
Mine, I think.
Oh, you're such a cheater!
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's my turn to go first.
And it's your turn to get a hole in your britches.
To victory.
This sniper business has been dragging on too long.
What's that little fellow of yours up to?
He's probing, comrade Kruschev.
He's testing the Germans for weaknesses.
He's meticulous in his preparation.
Vodka... is a luxury we have.
Caviar is a luxury we have.
Time is not.
He's aware of that comrade Kruschev. We both are.
I assure you he will succeed.
Good.
It seems your destinies are entwined.
They're keeping you busy.
I picked this up in the kitchen.
It's from the reception the other day.
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.
Um, she will be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.
There's plenty more if you're hungry.
You're Jewish, aren't you?
There's nothing in our religion that says you can't eat sturgeon.
My father had a premonition all this would happen.
You mean the war?
He understood that the hatred of the Jews ran deep.
He was saving up to buy some land in Palestine.
He said it was the only land we truly belonged in; the only land we had a duty to defend.
He insisted I learn to use a rifle.
I learned to shoot.
I know that in times of war, personal feelings should be put aside, but...
I have a favor to ask you.
Of course.
Anything you want.
I want to be reassigned.
What's happened, Tania?
He shot him.
He shot him even though he jumped first.
Shot him on the run.
It was an impossible shot.
I've never seen anything like it.
You've promised people a victory I can't deliver.
I don't stand a chance against this man.
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili.
What if I told you we found a way to track his movements?
We've got someone, Vassili.
Someone close to him passing us information.
Next time you will be one step ahead of him.
I promise.
Now I have a favor to ask.
From me?
It's about Tania.
Come in.
He doesn't even know you exist.
But at that moment, you are closer to him than anyone else on earth.
You see his face through the sight.
You see whether he shaved that morning or not.
You can see whether he's married by whether he has a wedding ring on.
It's not like... just firing at a distant shape, not just a uniform.
It's a man's face.
Those faces don't go away.
They come back and they just... they get replaced by more faces.
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?
He likes you very much. I think he'd try anything to change your mind.
Did he tell you why I asked for the transfer?
No.
This morning, a list arrived at headquarters.
It was a list of civilians who'd been... rounded up and sent to Germany in a convoy... that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.
My parents were amongst them.
After 30 kilometers, the German soldiers... stopped the train and forced everyone out.
In the middle of a bridge, they bound them together, two by two.
Mothers with daughters.
Husbands and wives.
They... lined them up against the railing, and then they fired a single shot at each pair... to save bullets.
It worked.
The bodies of the ones who died dragged the others under the water.
I know they died together.
They never would have let themselves be separated.
That's Koulikov's rifle.
It's a good... rifle.
Thank you.
I know how he leaves the shelter.
He goes through the tractor factory.
The tractor factory is big.
I know exactly where.
He crawls through a gutter, under a grate where the vats are, then he goes out from the workshop.
In between the two, there's a place where he's in the open.
It's under a long, iron foot walk.
Good luck, comrade.
I know exactly where he's waiting for me.
He'll be on the foot walk over the gutter.
We'll take him out from behind.
We'll get to the other end of the workshop through these pipes.
Follow me.
You go that way.
I'll go around this way.
Okay?
Shit!
Sergei, you should go back.
- No, I'll be all right.
- Go back.
No, you go!
Keep your legs in.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Comrade Stalin is asking for one last effort!
The fate of the motherland is at risk!
The fate of all those you love and cherish!
It's for them that we fight today.
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans are throwing everything at us.
If they're lucky, one in ten of these soldiers will come back alive.
You're highly educated.
You know languages.
Every intercept you translate saves hundreds of lives.
Every message you decode kills thousands of theirs.
You have a duty to survive.
Vassili was born to fire a gun.
It's what he knows.
You and I were born for a different purpose.
If Vassili were here, he would tell you the same thing.
Where is he?
Where is Vassili?
Keep your head down.
- Tell me where he is.
- Stay into that pipe, Tania.
Stay in. Stay in!
Get your head in!
Slow down.
Don't shoot.
He's over there.
Do you see the pillar in front of you?
I need you to move round behind it.
Go.
Tania, I need you to find a large piece of glass.
Piece of glass.
Do you see the kiln... behind me to the left of the factory?
Yes? I can't hear you.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Do you see... the two louvers?
- Yes.
- Do you see the one... with a broken slat?
Yes.
This is what
I want you to do.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Three... two... one...
Hello, Sacha.
He was right where you said he'd be.
Nearly there.
He's very clever.
Tell me about him.
Why was it his grandfather taught him how to shoot and not his father?
His father's dead.
His mother too.
Does he talk about his father?
No. He didn't know him.
Did he go to school?
He knows how to write.
He answers lots of letters.
Hmm. Is it girls who write to him?
Everyone writes to him.
Is there a girl he loves in his village?
- Not in his village, here.
- Does she love him?
Yes, because he's handsome.
Because he's brave and she's very beautiful.
I know her well.
She's from my neighborhood.
She went to the university.
They're handsome together.
Later, the two of them will get married.
At least, I think so.
And you, Sacha, why are you helping the Germans?
Because they're stronger.
Because they're going to win the war.
And because you like chocolate, huh?
All these people here know they're gonna die.
So each night when they make it back, it's a bonus.
Excuse me.
So, every cup of tea, every cigarette...
becomes a little celebration.
Because for a lot of us, it may be our last night.
It's just something you have to accept here.
Everyone has their time.
In the forest, the wolf lives for three years, the donkey for nine.
So, that's-that's got to be a proverb from the Urals.
It makes no sense to me whatsoever.
The donkey lives longer because he's more useful.
Makes absolute sense.
There aren't any donkeys in the forest.
You made it up.
So... I'm a donkey?
People like you and Danilov... have to survive this.
People who have read books, had an education.
We'll need you when the war is over.
And if you survive?
What will the useless
Vassili Zaitsev do then?
I wanna work in a factory.
My granddad took me to a factory once.
There was this man there, high up on a... on a foot walk.
He wasn't wearing blue like the others.
The people he was supervising didn't understand what they were doing.
But for him, for him up there, it was simple; it was clear.
And I thought, "One day,
I could be that man".
Sad to have a dream you know won't happen.
Why shouldn't it?
You'll outlive us all.
Hmm.
You'll be the oldest donkey in the forest.
"150 meters stand between the Germans and the Volga.
"Today the whole world is watching these 150 meters.
They are what makes
Stalingrad..." the capitol... of the war.
Your friend, Tania... have you see her?
She stays over there now, with the snipers.
Tell the major we're sending in all of our sharpshooters... to support the attack on the factory.
Tell him Vassili will be there.
- I need to talk to you.
- Sure.
- Danilov.
- Hmm?
You have to stop writing about me.
I'm not gonna get him because I'm not good enough.
Sooner or later, he's gonna find me, he's gonna kill me.
I've warned you before not to talk like this.
This time it's different.
You've built me up... and up into someone I'm not.
I can't carry that weight anymore.
I wanna fight.
I want to fight just as a regular soldier.
I understand.
The thing is, you're not a regular soldier. You're extraordinary.
No, I'm what you've made me.
Nothing more.
Why are you telling me this now?
Hmm? What's happened?
What's changed?
Did you speak to Tania for me?
- Yes.
- Well... will she reconsider?
I don't know.
She should. She'll be much safer.
She should, you know that.
- Yeah.
- It'll be easier to get her reassigned.
The Germans are preparing another offensive in the city center.
The propaganda battle is crucial for morale. We need you more than ever.
Sacha. Hold on. Sacha!
- Tell him what you know, Sacha.
- Hello, Sacha.
There was dust on the major's boots.
Sacha has the major convinced he's gone over to the other side.
I don't need to tell you the risks he's taking.
The dust was yellow. There's only one place where there's dust like that... in the back of the chemical factory, a big heap on the tracks.
Well done.
Sacha... wait for me outside then.
- Danilov,
- Hmm?
You had no right to use him.
No, no, I didn't use him,
Vassili.
He did it of his own accord.
You know why?
Because he believes in you!
Tomorrow morning, we're going to take back the chemical factory.
Sacha's informed the major you'll be there, so now you know where you have to wait for him.
- In the middle of an assault.
- I'm following orders.
I suggest you do the same.
Now, I'm aware of the risks.
You'll be fine.
Comrade.
That's the Germans up there.
And yesterday was the Russians.
We're not very far now.
Sacha... you're playing a very dangerous game.
I want you to win.
See there?
Keep going along the river.
It's safe... for a while.
He's dead.
We found this on his corpse.
Your reason for being here has ceased to exist.
Pardon me, Herr General, but I do not believe...
There is a plane bound for Berlin tomorrow evening.
You will be on it.
Until then, I must ask you for your dog tags.
Imagine how Russian propaganda would profit from your death.
If you fall, you will fall unknown.
You've already had a near miss.
Also please take this War Merit Cross.
It was awarded posthumously... to a lieutenant of the
116th Infantry Division... who fell here during the first days of the battle.
He was my son.
If the landing is captured, everything's lost!
Come here.
What did I tell you?
You've been playing your fiddle too much!
If it's confirmed that he's dead, we're sunk!
- Well, you're sunk.
- It isn't true.
It was intercepted from their staff headquarters.
What do they have to do, dangle his body in front our our men?
They're lying.
That's good.
Very good.
Write it, then.
"Vassili Zaitsev is not dead.
"This is what he had for breakfast this morning.
This is a picture of him reading today's newspaper". You're the poet.
What?
You won't give up the riverbank!
I don't care if you've lost half your men!
Lose the other half, or lose yourself!
Is he back?
He should be back soon.
The German attack cut the lines.
That's why he's late.
Can we go outside?
I wrote to my mother about you.
She wanted me to tell you that once this war was over, if there's anything you needed... anything at all... our family will be there for you.
You know I'm here for you.
They're saying
Vassili is dead.
Vassili Zaitsev will never see his loved ones again.
Surrender!
This is your only hope.
You're upset.
Because Zaitsev is dead?
You don't have to hide it.
There's no shame in it.
You're a Russian like he is.
Don't listen to them.
It's just propaganda.
He isn't dead.
And do you know why?
Because I haven't killed him yet.
I'm going to tell you a little secret.
Only you, because
I know I can trust you.
But you must swear to me that you won't tell another soul.
You swear?
I found a terrific spot.
It's by the exit from the train station.
I'll hide in the water tower.
Tomorrow.
I'll wait for him there.
You'll see.
He'll be there.
He always is.
I also want you to swear that from now on, you'll stay home where you belong.
Do you swear?
Yes?
Good.
"We know he's alive.
We know he won't fail us.
We know because he is a part of us now.
Vassili is eternal".
Where have you been?
We've looked everywhere for you.
Oh, didn't you hear?
I was dead.
At least the noble sniper
Zaitsev...
Vassili was dead.
The real one.
Me...
I was asleep,
and I missed my chance.
Then, I was curled up in a corner, hiding... from a man who wants to kill me.
I'll talk to Kruschev.
He'll send you back to your old division.
- Where's Tania?
- She's at the shelter.
I've been to the shelter.
I told her you weren't dead.
The major said so.
He said the other Germans were lying.
He told me you were waiting for him at the station.
Vassili.
Vassili.
Vassili.
My little Sacha.
I knew it.
- Vassili.
- Tania.
I knew you weren't dead.
How?
Because we only just met.
I prayed for the first time since I was a little girl.
When I opened my eyes,
Sacha was standing there... waiting to give me the good news.
I think he loves you even more than I do.
To the proper military authority,
I'm calling to the commandant's attention the recent changes noticed... in the attitude towards fighting of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.
He has attempted on several occasions to escape his duties, voiced doubts on the chances of our victory... and made defeatist comments in public.
The inexplicable duration of his duel... with the Nazi sharpshooter can only be explained by... his lack of belief in the communist ideal.
Good morning, Sacha.
Once again, he knew exactly where to find me.
Don't you think that's strange?
Apart from me, only you knew.
I don't hold it against you,
Sacha.
You've done a very brave thing.
You've chosen your camp.
I respect that.
But it isn't my camp.
We're both soldiers, and we're both enemies, so I know you understand.
I'm annoyed with you, little Sacha, for not staying home as I made you swear to.
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me to do what I'm going to have to do.
I've never seen anyone frown so much in their sleep.
How long have you been watching me?
All night.
You've been snoring away happily for hours.
I don't snore.
Do I?
Like a pig.
I suppose I talk in my sleep as well.
Yes.
There's something
I should tell you.
On the train... coming here... we were in the same car.
No.
I saw you.
You were reading, and you fell asleep.
I didn't dare look at you, you were so beautiful.
It was scary.
Afterwards, I couldn't stop thinking about you.
It made me smile.
And then I thought of all the men who would get to hold you... who'd make you laugh... how lucky they were.
And now I'm the one lying next to you.
- Was I snoring?
- Like a pig.
What?
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, no.
- Oh, my God!
- Tania, no.
- Tania, no!
- No, get off me!
- Get off me! Get off me!
- It's what he wants!
- This is what he wants!
- Get off me!
- No, he'll kill you. He'll kill you!
- Let me go!
- I'll run after you, and he'll kill me.
- Let me go!
- Let me go!
- This is what he wants! I'll get him.
I promise I'll get him.
I'll get his rifle for you.
I promise, Tania.
I need you.
You have to leave now, Mrs. Filipov.
Stalingrad may fall.
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.
He's brought you a pass.
You'll be safe on the other side.
Gather your things, and we'll help you carry them to the landing stage.
I'm not leaving.
This is my home.
This is my Sacha's home.
I can't leave.
I have to tell you something,
Mrs. Filipov.
Something very difficult to understand.
It's about Sacha.
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
He's become a traitor.
The poor little thing.
What has he done?
So, he's going to stay over there?
Yes... he's going to stay over there.
I shouldn't be saying this, comrade Commissar, but maybe it's for the best.
If the Germans have won, he'll be safe.
I know it's wrong, but perhaps he has made the right choice.
- Oh! Oh, Tania!
- Tania?
- Oh, Tania!
- Tania!
Oh, my God! Oh!
I need a doctor!
A doctor!
I have a pass.
I have a pass!
You must let her cross.
Please!
- It's useless. She'll never make it.
- No! No, she will!
She's my daughter!
She's my daughter!
- I beg of you!
- All right.
- Oh, thank you!
- Put this one on the boat.
Where is he?
Where's the major?
A few inches from your face.
I've been such a fool,
Vassili.
Man will always be man.
There is no new man.
We tried so hard to create a society that was equal,
where there'd be nothing to envy your neighbor.
But there's always something to envy.
A smile... a friendship.
Something you don't have and want to appropriate.
In this world... even a Soviet one... there will always be rich and poor.
Rich in gifts... poor in gifts.
Rich in love... poor in love.
Tania isn't coming back.
She's dead, Vassili.
She was cut down by shrapnel.
It was quick.
I don't think she even saw it coming.
She was on her way back to you.
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov to the boats, she was coming back for you.
She was right.
You're a good man, Vassili.
I want to help you,
Vassili.
Let me do one last thing.
Something useful for a change.
Let me show you where the major is.
Don't do that.
Don't do that!
Today, February 3, 1943, is an ominous day for Hitler...
and the endless columns of hundreds of thousands of German prisoners.
It is an unforgettable day of hope for our motherland.
After 180 days of heroic combat...
in the market city of Stalingrad,
and as a result of the valor and self-sacrifice of our soldiers,
the commander of our glorious Red Army...
received the unconditional surrender...
of the German fascist invaders.
Sorry. No, young man,
I cannot find...
- a matching name in the book.
- Could you check again?
- This is the address and her name.
- She is not here.
Yes, this is our address, but we don't have her anymore.
- This is the address. She's been here.
- I'm so sorry.
- She wrote to me.
- I looked three times. She's not here.
Believe me, there is no Tania Chernova.
I can't help you.
I'm so sorry.
These are the true events of November, 1965...
The la Drang Valley of Vietnam... a place our country does not remember... in a war it does not understand.
This story's a testament to the young Americans... who died in the Valley of Death... and a tribute to the young men of the Peoples Army of Vietnam... who died by our hand in that place.
To tell this story, l must start at the beginning.
But where does it begin?
Maybe in June of 1954, when French Group Mobile 100... moved into the same
Central Highlands of Vietnam... where we would go 11 years later.
Maybe the story begins in America... when the army first realized a new kind of war was coming its way.
The White House anticipates a buildup and wants a victory... over cavemen in black pajamas.
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't already beaten the French Army.
The French Army?
What's that?
The problem in Vietnam is terrain... jungles, mountains, rivers.
Maneuver's a nightmare.
We have a plan to use helicopters... leap in and out of battle.
They want you to run the test on the idea.
It'll take a hell of a combat leader.
I know a young light colonel named Hal Moore.
He led a combat company in Korea.
After that, he volunteered to test experimental parachutes.
Experimental parachutes?
Sounds like just the guy.
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see
Was all that he could see
Was all that he could see
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see
The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain
How about we go back to ''Bingo''?
What do you say? ''Bingo.''
B-l-N-G-O
B-l-N-G-O
B-l-N-G-O
And Bingo was his name-o
Tom, how much you know about our new colonel?
He was in Korea... has a master's in international relations from Harvard.
Harvard? He's not one of those academic pussies, is he?
Hal Moore?
Want me to get one of those?
Come on, Too Tall.
Gimme your best shot!
Did you see that, sports fans?
Did you see that?
Snakeshit drives that one to the moon, baby!
Hit the cutoff man!
Hit the cutoff man!
And he's coming around!
- Here he comes!
- No, he's not.
You're out!
You're out!
Horseshit! No wonder you can't fly.
You can't see.
I believe you're out.
- You're a pilot?
- Too Tall, sir.
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You call, we haul.
- Can I speak to you, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.
- Out.
- Safe.
- Out.
- Safe.
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure.
Thanks.
So, your men call you ''Snakeshit.''
That's an affectionate appellation of my comrades-in-arms, sir...
'cause I fly lower than snake shit.
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit, and I think you're the solution.
I've been called a lot of things,
Colonel, never a solution.
You know what air cavalry really means?
You fly into hostile territory, outnumbered, 10,000 miles from home.
Sometimes the battleground's no bigger than a football field.
And if the choppers stop comin', we all get slaughtered.
Now, I figure chopper pilots won't fly into hell for strangers... so... I'm Hal Moore.
I know, sir.
Why us?
Well, you guys look like shit, but your equipment is immaculate.
Yesterday was Sunday. You didn't have to be training, but you were.
You got pilots like that Too Tall character.
He's way outside the limits of army regs.
They wanna fly with you for some reason.
I guess it's 'cause they think you're the best.
It's 'cause I only recruit the dumb ones, sir.
I don't suppose
I have a choice in all this.
You sure don't.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
To the Air Cav.
Good mornin', Sergeant-Major.
How do you know what kind of goddamn day it is?
Group! Atten-hut!
At ease, gentlemen.
Welcome to the new cavalry.
We will ride into battle.
And this... will be our horse.
You don't have to catch it.
You don't have to feed it.
But I can assure you... that neither the new technology nor your status as officers... will keep you above the danger.
Sergeant-Major Plumley and I come from the paratroopers... where the officer is always the first one out of the plane.
Because to follow your instincts... and to inspire your men by your example... you have to be with them where the metal meets the meat.
Sergeant-Major Plumley made all four combat jumps... in the 82nd Airborne during World War II.
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy... and Holland, plus one more in Korea.
He answers to me and to me alone.
Now, I hope you gentlemen like training...
'cause me and the sergeant-major-- we love it.
Three strikes and you're not out!
There is always one more thing you can do.
Here we go, boys.
Move! Move! Go! Now!
- Two.
- Let's go!
Three.
We're outta here!
- Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good.
There's only one thing wrong.
Be sharp! We will be the best platoon in this battalion!
Be ready in there!
Let's go! Let's go!
All right!
Your officer's dead!
- What do you do? What do you do?
- First...
All right, he hesitated.
He's dead. What do you do?
- Get off the chopper!
- Get off of the chopper.
Hold off the third one.
Come on in.
Savage, you learn the job of the man above you... and you teach your job to the man below you in rank.
That goes for every man in this outfit.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!
We'll be landing under fire, gentlemen.
Men will die.
Have you said your prayers?
Come on.
I'll say them with you.
- Fall in.
- Gimme that bear.
All right.
Ready. Set.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners...
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey.
I don't wanna be Catholic.
I wanna be a ''Nethodist'' like Mommy.
You do?
And why is that, honey?
So I can pray whatever I want.
That's a sin.
No, that's not a sin.
God just made you hardheaded.
It's not a sin.
I'll tell you what.
You wanna...
You wanna pray and thank God for our family?
- Yes, sir.
- That's good. Let's do it.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women... and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
I can hear you laughing, you know, even in here.
I'm not laughing,
I'm marveling.
Marveling? At what?
That you can find stubbornness in your children... and think it comes from anybody but you.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
I'll give you something to marvel at.
He's a wild man.
- When I pray...
- Mm-hmm. whatever I want...
I thank God for you.
Beautiful morning,
Sergeant-Major.
What are you, a fuckin' weatherman now?
Look what I found for the new baseball player.
- Sent us another bunch of officers.
- Uh-huh.
Real green.
Gotta train 'em up.
Makes me think
I'm starting a new unit.
They sent new rifles too.
The M-16.
That's supposed to be a pretty good weapon.
Lots of plastic.
Feels like a BB gun to me.
Believe I'll stick with my pistol.
You think we're gonna get close enough to the enemy to use that?
What do you think, sir?
A leader must remain cool and calm.
And second, he must learn to ignore explosions... the heat and dust, the screams of the wounded.
This is normal on a battlefield.
Normal!
Fortran, you need to get a company over to reinforce the left flank.
- Where is that coming from?
- That's our advisors in Vietnam.
The new radio's picking up atmospheric bounce.
When Crazy Horse was a baby... he nursed from the breast of every woman in the tribe.
The Sioux raised their children that way.
Every warrior... called every woman in the tribe ''mother.''
Every older warrior, they called him ''grandfather.''
Now, the point here is that they fought as a family.
Take care of your men.
Teach them to take care of each other.
'Cause when this starts... each other is all we're gonna have.
- Did you tune that in?
- Yes, sir.
Well, that's fine.
You're my radio operator.
You'll be fine.
You'll work it out.
Any of you sons of bitches calls me Grandpa...
I'll kill ya.
Godboldt, take your boots off.
Go on.
Everybody, take your boots off.
Everybody.
Socks too.
I want you to draw fresh socks from supply.
Keep your feet dusted with powder.
Everybody check each other's feet like Godboldt and me.
Now, that young man's a leader.
Yes, sir.
That other fella... that big, strong one there... he wants to win medals.
Why were you in the back?
Goddamn it, why were you in the back?
He's eager.
Ladies, I'm really, really glad you're here today.
Some of you are new to the army and all of us are new to this post.
I thought we'd pool our resources and cover questions we have.
So, why don't we start with item number one... food.
Where's the best place to shop?
Well, I tried Big Star, and it's okay.
But I keep thinking my water's gonna break right in the checkout aisle.
That takes care of food shopping.
So, item number two... laundry.
The base washing machines don't work.
They're full of sand from the swamp missions.
I'll take care of that.
- I've already complained.
- We'll just go to the general.
In the meantime, the Laundromat in town's okay... but they won't let you wash your colored things in their machines.
- At a public Laundromat?
- Didn't make sense to me either.
I'm telling you, they have a sign right in the window... says ''Whites Only.''
- What?
- They mean white people only.
That's awful.
Your husband is wearing the uniform of a country that allows a place... to say his laundry's not good enough, when he could die for...
- I'm sorry. I just...
- That's all right, honey.
I know what my husband's fighting for, and that's why I can smile.
My husband will never ask for respect... and he'll give respect to no man who hasn't earned it.
The rest of his family is the same way.
Anybody who doesn't respect that can keep his washing machine...
'cause my baby's clothes are gonna be clean anyway.
Well, I guess that takes care of item number two.
Are you all right?
I think... I think my water just broke.
We're all calm.
We're all calm.
A car! A car!
- Colonel.
- At ease. At ease.
I heard one of my new lieutenants just became a father.
- I came to say congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
So, I didn't wanna disturb you.
No, it's fine.
It's all right. Please.
Well, how's your wife?
She's okay. She's okay.
She's sleeping.
So is my daughter.
I just... wanted to be here for a while before I held her.
Well, tag her already?
- What's that say?
- Camille. Sorry about this, sir.
Don't take that off. Leave that where it is. That's an order.
- Colonel, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.
What do you think about being a soldier and a father?
I hope that being good at the one... makes me better at the other.
Why? What about you?
I don't know, sir.
Between college and here...
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.
We helped build a school for orphans.
They were orphans because the warlord across the border... didn't like their tribe.
I know God has a plan for me.
I just hope it's to help protect orphans... not make any.
Well, why don't we ask him?
Come on.
Let's go ask him.
Our Father in Heaven, before we go into battle... every soldier among us will approach you each in his own way.
Our enemies too... according to their own understanding... will ask for protection and for victory.
And so, we bow before your infinite wisdom.
We offer our prayers as best we can.
I pray you watch over the young men, like Jack Geoghegan... that I lead into battle.
You use me as your instrument in this awful hell of war... to watch over them.
Especially if they're men like this one beside me... deserving of a future in your blessing and good will.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord... about our enemies... ignore their heathen prayers... and help us blow those little bastards straight to hell.
Amen again.
Amen.
Thank you.
There's one about the kid with the apple tree, or the flying horse... or the fairy tales with the deer and stuff in 'em.
Daddy, what is a war?
A war is a...
Well, it's...
It's something that shouldn't happen, but it does.
It's when... some people... in another country or any country... try to take the lives of other people.
And then soldiers like your daddy have to...
It's my job to go over there and stop them.
Are they gonna try to take your life away, Daddy?
Well, yes, they're gonna try.
But I'm not gonna let 'em.
Okay?
Can't sleep?
The men are so young and...
Now they sent me a new crop even greener.
When I look at them, I... see our boys.
Well, then you're just the man to lead them.
I guess.
We intend to convince the Communists... that we cannot be defeated by force of arms. l have asked the commanding general,
General Westmoreland... what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression.
He has told me... and we will meet his needs. l have today ordered to Vietnam the airmobile division... and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength... from 75,000 to...
125,000 men almost immediately.
Additional forces will be needed later.
Get out your best dresses, ladies.
They're gonna want to celebrate.
Don't you ever be sad
Lean on me when the times are bad
I didn't hear the president mention a state of emergency.
No, he didn't.
Well, without that declaration our enlistments won't be extended.
I'm sorry, Hal.
Forgive me, sir, but let me get this straight.
We form a division using techniques never attempted in battle... against an enemy with 20 years of combat experience on his ground...
12,000 miles away from our ground.
And right before the army sends us into the fight... they take away a third of my most experienced men, including officers.
I don't like it any better than you do, Hal.
You saw this coming, didn't you?
Yes. That's why you gave me that new crop of platoon leaders.
Korea didn't teach 'em anything.
- Politicians?
- Politicians.
Hold me, hold me
Never let me go
Until you've told me told me
What l want to know and then just hold me
Hold me
Make me tell you l'm in love with you
Thrill me, thrill me
Thank you, sir.
By the way, Hal, since we're being deployed... they're renumbering the units.
You're now the commanding officer... of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry.
The 7th.
The same regiment as Custer.
Thank you, sir.
Be sensible with your new love
Don't be fooled thinking
This is the last you'll find
But they never stood in the dark
With you, love
When you take me in your arms
And drive me slowly out of my mind
Kiss me, kiss me
And when you do l'll know
Look around you.
In the 7th Cavalry... we got a captain from the Ukraine.
Another from Puerto Rico.
We've got Japanese, Chinese...
Blacks, Hispanics,
Cherokee Indians.
Jews and gentiles.
All Americans.
Now, here in the States... some men in this unit... may experience discrimination because of race or creed.
But for you and me now... all that is gone.
We're moving into the Valley of the Shadow of Death... where you will watch the back of the man next to you... as he will watch yours.
And you won't care what color he is... or by what name he calls God.
They say we're leaving home.
We're going to what home was always supposed to be.
So let us understand the situation.
We are going into battle... against a tough and determined enemy.
I can't promise you... that I will bring you all home alive.
But this I swear... before you and before
Almighty God... that when we go into battle...
I will be the first to set foot on the field... and I will be the last to step off.
And I will leave no one behind.
Dead or alive... we will all come home together.
So help me God.
I love you.
Hal, last night the enemy hit our camp at Plaei Me.
- How many casualties?
- None.
The enemy forces withdrew toward this mountain... near the Cambodian border.
How many men do you have battle-ready?
- Sergeant Major?
- Three hundred ninety-five, sir.
Exactly.
What do you estimate the enemy strength?
We appraise their numbers as manageable, Colonel.
You have no idea.
We have no idea.
Simple orders, Hal.
Find the enemy and kill him.
They attack us, no casualties.
They run and hide in the mountains.
Naturally we chase them, of course.
Smell like an ambush to you?
They get close enough to kill us, we'll be close enough to kill them.
Round trip by chopper, 30 minutes.
So the first 60 men on the ground will be there a half an hour alone.
Son of a bitch.
I think maybe you ought to get yourself that M-16.
Time comes I need one, there'll be plenty of'em lying on the ground.
Well, let's go do what we came here to do.
Yes, sir.
Garry Owen! lt was a Sunday.
November 14, 1965.
Before that day, the soldiers of North Vietnam... and those of America... never met each other in a major battle.
Two miles out.
Dropping to nap of the earth.
First Platoon, let's move!
This is Trojan Two. All units maintain perimeter contact. Over.
It's a scout!
Let's take him prisoner!
Hey! Lieutenant!
There he goes! Come on!
Come on!
Captain, I want you to keep in contact with all patrols.
Hey, I got something here.
I got a boy! here.
Boy, hell.
That ain't no boy.
- He say he a deserter.
- Bullshit, he's a lookout.
Ask him where his friends are.
He say this is base camp of whole division.
- Four thousand men.
- Where?
That mountain.
Same army destroyed French.
And he say they want kill American very badly.
Just not been able to find any yet.
Captain Metsker, tell all patrols to hold their positions.
You, take the radio!
- Where are they?
- Sir, we gotta get that guy!
Call in all the patrols!
We have to engage the enemy as far away from the LZ as possible!
Net Call, Net Call, this is Trojan-Two.
Grab the wounded!
Break contact!
Fall back!
Get to high ground!
Cover fire!
Get to high ground!
Come on!
Come on! Get up here!
Bring the wounded up to the middle!
Move it, move it!
Cover fire! Cover fire!
Everybody down! Down!
Check your ammo!
Everybody check ammo!
Come on!
I'll get us out of here!
Grab the wounded!
We'll make a run
- Sarge!
- We gotta get out of here!
Stay down! Don't anybody move!
Bungum, stay down!
You're gonna be okay.
Stay down.
Form a perimeter!
Conserve your ammo and stay down!
What's happening with those patrols?
I'm trying to reach them, sir!
This is Trojan-Two! Come in! Over!
Hey! Hey! Calm down!
Understand the situation and communicate clearly!
Pull the chain on all the firepower you can get on that mountain!
Alert Crandall!
We have a hot LZ!!
Agent Serpent-Six, this is Trojan-Two.
You're coming into a hot LZ.
We are taking fire.
Repeat.
We are taking fire.
No shit.
This is Too Tall goin'down and dirty.
Roger that!
Trojan-Two, out!
Herrick's platoon is cut off and under attack.
Bravo Company's holding.
They're gonna try and flank us.
On the ground now! Move!
- Watch him!
- We gotta go.
We're outta here.
They're coming at us from the back now! Move!
Savage.
All right, all right,
I got you.
Sir?
Don't let them get the signal codes.
Roger that, sir.
I'm glad I could die for my country.
Doc.
Bungum.
Sarge?
Tell my wife...
I love her.
This is Savage.
I need artillery to these coordinates: niner-3-3-0-1
Ernie! Ernie, help!
We got more coming!
We are cut off.
Copy? We are cut off.
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
They're getting closer!
They're getting closer!
A hundred more, sir!
They're right on top of us, sir!
Bring it in close!
It's a hot LZ! We'll be jumping!
We will not touch down.
They're trying to break right through us!
I want you to reinforce
Alpha Company there! Now! Move!
Follow me!
Charlie Company, up on the ridge!
Doc, the wounded are over by that termite mound! Go!
Sir, if you don't find some cover, you're gonna go down!
If you go down, we all go down!
Come on!
Cobain!
I want the M-60 right here!
Radio!
Sir, it's Captain Edwards on the ridge, sir!
- Bob!
- Colonel, these guys are regulars!
Heavily armed!
AK-47s and pouches of grenades!
Heavy machine guns and shoulder-fired rockets!
Captain Nadal!
That creek bed is vital.
Vital!
They'll be coming right at you!
Do not let them flank! l repeat, do not let them flank!
Secure the creek bed!
Tom, I want you to keep trying to raise those Medevac boys.
I'm all right.
Charlie, come here.
Get me all the air support you can get me on that mountain! Now!
Requesting immediate close air support!
I need you to burn 'em out... on hilltop Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo!
Coordinates: Golf-4-5-0-9!
- Get me something higher up!
- Shifting to hilltop Bravo!
Golf-4-5-7-2!
I say again, 4-5-7-2!
Medevac Command of the 7th Cavalry, are you inbound?
Looks pretty hot down there.
Yeah. You can make it, though.
Watch our approach, follow us in.
Copy that, 7th Cav.
We will follow your approach.
I want you to get over there and reinforce Charlie Company there!
Medevac, abort! Abort!
This is a hot LZ!
You see that? My Medevac guys are buggin'out and leaving the wounded!
We're going down!
- Snake, get out of here!
- Bring me the wounded!
Wounded! Get the wounded!
Come on! Come on!
Okay, here!
They're still trying to flank us!
Stretch out along the line!
Radio!
Trojan-Six! We are in heavy contact!
In danger of being overrun! lf they get into that LZ, we've all had it. Can you hold?
We're spread thin, sir, but we'll give 'em hell!
Crandall, this is Trojan-Six. lt's too hot down here.
- l'm closing the LZ.
- You copy that, Too Tall?
Copy that, Snake.
All 7th Cav air units.:
LZ X-Ray is closed.
I don't like it. First time out, a whole battalion massacred?
You think this is a massacre?
Losing draftees is a bad week.
Losing a colonel is a massacre.
Moore is still fighting.
He's under strength against more men than he can count.
- He's got a whole platoon lost.
- They're not lost.
They're only cut off and surrounded.
Then they're lost.
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!
We need to carve out an emergency LZ right over there.
- Sir!
- Blow the trees down!
Fire in the hole!
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall.
We're comin' in with two loads of ammo.
Crandall, we've blown a new LZ.
When you come in, come in from the east. Out.
Colonel, it's Brigade Headquarters.
They want you out.
- Well, we can't get out, damn it!
- Not all of us. Just you.
Saigon wants to debrief you.
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Say again.
Will you repeat that order?
Too Tall, follow the colonel to the new LZ.
I see him, Snake.
He's right here!
Let's go! Move!
Let's move! Move!
Oh, shit.
- Come on! We'll give you a hand!
- We're moving on board!
All right, get that ammo off and get the wounded on!
Bring 'em on!
Get 'em on, boys!
No, we're overloaded!
- Leave him!
- I'll get out! It's Ray!
He's hurt worse than me!
You hang on!
I'll see you back there, Ray!
You, me and Ouellette are all we have in reserve.
Yeah, but it's slacking up a little.
No, they're just regrouping for another assault.
Distribute that ammo.
Ouellette, tell Crandall he's got time to get one more flight in here.
Yes, sir.
Doc, you give this water to the wounded.
Running out of water.
Must be terrible for 'em.
Those guys are cut off out there.
Running low on ammo, Sarge!
Pick your target.
One shot, one kill.
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How we doin', Doc?
Ernie, we're out of water.
That's the last of it.
My face is on fire! Help!
Foster, hold still!
Hold still!
I'll cut your face!
Hold still!
Doc, Doc, it's Foster!
Okay.
Does anybody have any more bandages?
Ernie, you hit too?
You hit?
No, no, I'm okay.
Our guys are gonna come for us, aren't they?
Yeah.
When?
Plug his wound.
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.
Go! Move!
Go, Parker! Get up in there!
This is too Tall. I'm clear..
Crandall's clear..
Colonel!
Go over and reinforce that company!
On that ridge there! Look!
Yes, sir!
Okay! Keep your head down!
To the top of the ridge!
Move it!
Come on, leÃ¹s move!
Move!
Run! Come on!
Captain Nadal, we've got to break through to that cutoff platoon!
We got an American platoon out there.
An Air Cav platoon cut off out there!
Air Cav!
Garry Owen!
He said, "Really? Me too."
I said, "I know.
Your mama asked me to give you $600."
Good luck to you.
Hey, you got enough room for one more?
Ifyou're crazy enough, get in.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what are those lights down there?
Enemy soldiers.
They use candles on the trail.
They're moving into position to attack.
Here we go!
Unload that shit!
LeÃ¹s go, leÃ¹s go, leÃ¹s go, leÃ¹s go!
You and your boys have done a hell of a job today, Snake.
IÃ¹s the last flight for the night, but you need us, you call us.
Who in the hell are you?
I'm a reporter, sir.
Yeah.
Joe Galloway, UPI.
How's it going, Colonel?
We've been flat to the boards since last night, and we're outnumbered.
More enemy coming too. I saw a chain of lights coming down the mountain.
Is that so?
Yes, sir.
Well, I can't guarantee your safety.
Yes, sir, I know.
Where you from, son?
Refugio, Texas, sir.
Well, thaÃ¹s the first thing I heard all day that makes any sense.
Captain, you see those lights coming down the trails on the mountain?
On it right now, sir.
You fry them sons of bitches.
Whiskey-Six, this is Trojan-Three.
Fire mission.
Tango Foxtrot:
4-niner-6-5-6-niner.
All operations are suspended for the evening.
Morning operations will be scheduled for 0530 hours.
Where's Crandall?
Where's Crandall?
He's right there, sir.
You led my men into a hot LZ.
Somebody had to fly out the wounded.
Don't you play hotshot with me.
You know the rules.
You suckered us in there.
Do it again, I'll have you busted!
You got the balls to face me, but not the balls to face the enemy?
Get outta here.
Whoa!
I ever see you again, I'll kill you.
ThaÃ¹s right.
Quite a day, huh?
Tomorrow will be worse.
If they make it to tomorrow.
Ernie, iÃ¹s pitch black.
I can't see anything, but I can smell 'em.
Dead bodies stink, Bungum.
No, iÃ¹s not the dead ones.
I can smell them crawling up on us.
I'm telling you.
I need illumination, 6-5-0, 1-5-0.
I need artillery on previously established targets!
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie! Fire for effect!
Fire for effect!
Save your ammo!
Cease fire!
Is anybody hit?
Captain, if you guys are coming you gotta let us know.
IÃ¹s pitch black out here. I don't wanna shoot any of our own guys.
Savage... we can't make it tonight.
Don't worry.
You're gonna make it.
We'll come get you in the morning.
Yes, sir.
Out.
You're doing a fine job, son.
Don't worry. We gave them more than they gave us today.
How you boys doing?
Fine, sir.
You keep doing what you're doing, we'll be fine.
Your men have done a hell of a job today,
Lieutenant Geoghegan.
They won't get through us, sir.
You can count on it.
I know that, Jack.
Keep it up, son.
IÃ¹s Rear Headquarters, sir.
How is it out there, Colonel?
We're surrounded, but we're holding on, sir.
Sir, I need a confirmed count of our dead and wounded.
I got to know where all my boys are.
You'll get it, Hal.
Here they come.
Captain Edwards.
We need illumination on the perimeter.
Whiskey-Five, this is Hot Wire-Six-Alpha.
We need illumination now.
Kathy?
A telegram.
A cab delivers a telegram.
"The Secretary of the Army... regrets..."
Mrs. Moore?
Colonel Moore's wife?
Yes.
I need help finding an address.
I'm looking for...
You jackass!
Do you know what this is?
Do you know what you just did to me?
I don't like this job, ma'am.
I'm just trying to do it.
Wait.
Wait.
I'll take it to her.
And if there are any others, just bring them to me.
Julie.
I just went by to see Catherine.
Everybody knows.
No chaplains or counselors?
Cab drivers?
The Army wasn't ready.
I'll go with you.
Thanks.
Who's it for?
I thought she would hate me.
Your husband didn't start the war.
They all knew this could happen, and so did we.
I'll take care of this.
I'll go with you.
We'll do one at a time.
Okay?
We won't look.
Okay.
Julie... do you think there'll be more telegrams tomorrow?
If there are, come and get me.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen.
Out of the depths
I cry unto Thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice.
Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
Thou, O Lord, shall mark our inequities.
Lord, who can abide them?
With Thee there is mercy.
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord... and may perpetual light shine upon them.
And through the mercy of God, may they rest in peace. Amen.
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Do you got a death wish,
Galloway?
No, sir.
Well, then why are you here?
'Cause I knew these dead boys would be here, sir.
Why aren't you a soldier?
You got the guts for it.
My daddy was a soldier.
My granddaddy, two of my great-granddaddies was soldiers.
Hell, thaÃ¹s how I came to be.
Each of them lost a leg in the Civil War.
My Great-granddaddy Galloway, he lost his left... and my Great-granddaddy Reid lost his right.
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.
Every year after that, same date, same store, they'd get together... and pick out a new pair of shoes for the two of them.
You are shittin' me.
No, sir.
I swear to God.
Anyway, one had a daughter, one had a son... my grandparents.
What do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was?
I don't know, Colonel.
It was meant to be, I guess.
Yeah.
Meant to be.
Sir, Galloways have been in every war this country's ever fought.
But when it came to this one,
I didn't think I could stop the war.
I just thought maybe
I might try and understand one.
Maybe help folks back home understand.
I just figure
I could do that better... shooting a camera than I could shooting a rifle.
Well...
I sure hope you make it through this one.
You too, Colonel.
Right 20!
Put it right on 'em!
Colonel, sir.
Captain Nadal.
Sir.
What is it, sir?
Nothing's wrong, except there's nothing wrong.
Best get back to the termite mound.
You'll be fine. Go on.
Roger that, sir.
Come on!
All right, pass the word on.
Every man fire three rounds at anything that looks suspicious.
On my signal.
They're gonna hit us like this along the whole perimeter.
We gotta get back to that termite mound.
Better hang here, sir!
Shit.
We need a medic!
Sir! Sir!
Captain Edwards, Charlie Company, on the ridge.
Bob.
They're inside the artillery!
I need...
I need a grenade!
Go, Willie!
Come on, leÃ¹s go!
Godboldt down!
I'll get him!
Willie!
Get those guys help!
Captain Dillon, get Bravo Company to send a platoon across the LZ... and support Charlie Company.
Bravo-Six, this is Trojan-Three.
And tell Charlie Company to get real small in their holes.
I'm gonna drop some artillery right on top of'em!
Charlie Company, get small.
We got AT coming right on top of your position.
We're being overrun!
Nah, boys!
We're gonna win this fight.
Yes, sir, they brought a main force of VC battalion against us too.
Colonel, I request you dispatch another company of reinforcements... for movement as soon as it can be accomplished without undue risk.
Done.
How bad is it, Hal?
IÃ¹s getting pretty sporty down here, sir.
Get out of the way!
Medic!
Get a medic over here!
WhaÃ¹s your name, soldier?
Jimmy Nakayama.
I got a baby being born today.
Oh, wow! Congratulations!
Thanks!
Medic!
Medic!
Can't take no pictures lying down there, sonny.
Down, right there.
I'm a noncombatant, sir.
Ain't no such thing today, boy.
Shit.
Why aren't those mortars firing?
WhaÃ¹s the problem here?
These tubes are red hot, sir.
I'm afraid we're gonna cook a round off and blow us all up.
We can't cool 'em off
'cause we're all out of water.
Come on!
What are you waiting for?
Jimmy, come on.
Go, go, go.
Yeah, one more.
Gentlemen... prepare to defend yourselves.
Grenade!
Negative! Negative!
Stand by!
My pilots do not see the enemy.
They cannot pick out our friendlies.
Bravo-Six, say again.
You gotta tell your company commander to pop smoke now.
They need to mark the lines now!
We have no lines!
We have enemies and friendlies mixed in all over the place.
Sir, our perimeter is collapsing.
Alpha Company and Bravo Company cannot hold.
Charlie Company is being overrun.
Net call! Net call!
Keep this net clear!
Hastings!
Broken arrow!
Broken arrow!
I say again!
Broken arrow!
We have br.oken ar.r.ow!
Confirm. Broken arrow.
Broken arrow confirmed.
Broken arrow?
That means that an American unit has been overrun.
It calls in every combat aircraft for support.
My God, there's no hiding it now.
Charlie Company, report!
Signal is out!
Bravo Company, report!
Roger that!
Planes are on their way, Colonel!
Sir!
Roger that!
We have planes at every 1,000 feet... from 7,000 to 35,000... we'll get 'em, sir!
Advancing north on our position at 1 -5-0.
Nine-six-two-five-zero-seven...
They're getting closer in on 3-1 -5 degrees!
ThaÃ¹s 0-5-0!
Repeat, 0-5-0!
Goddamn it.
Company sighted out in the open, advancing north on our position.
They're advancing on
3-1 -5 degrees at 1 -5-0.
Bring it closer in on 3-1 -5 degrees at 0-5-0...
Charlie, call that son of a bitch off!
Call an abort now!
Pull up!
Get down!
Charlie, listen to me.
You're keeping us alive now.
You forget about that one and you keep 'em coming in.
You're doing well, son.
Seven-oh-two...
Attack against the tree line.
Medic! Medic!
Oh, God! Jimmy.
You know this guy?
You know him? Talk to him.
Just talk to him!
Jimmy, do you hear me?
IÃ¹s Joe.
IÃ¹s Joe Galloway.
Doc's giving you morphine.
We're gonna get you out of here.
We gotta get him to the landing zone. Grab his legs!
You gotta get him out of here.
Hey! Hey!
I can't help you!
You gotta do it by yourself!
Get him on that chopper, okay?
Yes, sir.
Tell my wife I love her... and my baby!
You tell'em!
Captain Nadal.
Sir...
Now that we put 'em back on their heels, we got us a lull.
I want you to attack.
I want you to go overthere and rescue that cut off platoon.
Yes, sir!
First Squad, move out!
Come on, guys.
Move it!
Add fifty.
Keep moving the artillery forward!
Keep walking the artillery forward!
Spread it out!
Move it!
Move it!
Keep moving forward!
Sergeant Savage, you guys still here?
We have 40 KIA, we have two MIA.
These are the latest numbers.
Over.
ThaÃ¹s a nice day,
Sergeant Savage.
Forty dead, two unaccounted for, sir.
Right.
All right, boys, leÃ¹s get 'em up and get 'em out.
LeÃ¹s get 'em out of here and get 'em on the chopper!
Since most of the men being loaded on the chopper... are from Charlie Company...
I want you to take their place.
I'll show you where. Follow me.
Yes, sir! LeÃ¹s go!
Captain, have your men dig some firing steps.
Throw some dirt on those bodies, keep the smell down.
Roger, Sergeant Major.
Kind of makes you wish you'd signed up for submarines, don't it?
Brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn.
What idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle?
Gen. Westmoreland wants a briefing.
Give me the horn.
I am in a fight... and I object to this order to return to Saigon.
Now, I will not leave my men.
Is that clear?
Out.
There's two of my men unaccounted for out there... and iÃ¹s where the worst of the fighting was... so they'll be out there someplace.
LeÃ¹s go out and get 'em.
I'm with you, sir.
All right.
LeÃ¹s go.
They... brought another...
Oh, God.
Julie, iÃ¹s yours.
He died keeping my promise.
Sir, they're ordering us all out.
All of us.
They're gonna march reinforcements in.
They don't understand a damn thing, do they?
Can't get out.
He's waiting up there in a cave, and thaÃ¹s what he wants.
The minute he sees live soldiers hopping on a helicopter... he'll be all over us and then he'll get what he wants.
He'll get his massacre.
Requesting permission to rejoin the lines, sir.
All right, son.
Garry Owen, sir.
I wonder what was going through
Custer's mind when he realized... he'd led his men into a slaughter.
Sir, Custer was a pussy.
You ain't.
Goddamn.
Hell.
Right now they're planning their final attack... the one that will finish us off.
They'll nibble at us all night, then... come dawn they'll hit us with everything they got.
ThaÃ¹s what I'd do if I was him.
Sergeant Major, hand out the last of the ammunition.
Yes, sir.
Fix bayonets.
You were wondering how Custer felt, sir.
You ought to ask him.
Sergeant Savage!
Checking the dead enemies for documents... and I found this on the guy that tried to bayonet you.
Translated some of it, mostly personal.
Thought you might wanna have a look at it.
What was that?
IÃ¹s American artillery.
Friendly fire.
How many casualties?
What the hell happened here, Joe?
Hey, Joe.
Colonel Moore!
Colonel!
Colonel Moore!
What is the key to your victory?
Sir, tell us how you feel.
Do you feel the States will be forced... to take the North Vietnamese more seriously?
How do you feel about the loss of your men, sir?
Have you notified the families, sir?
I'm glad you made it, son.
Thankyou, sir.
You too.
I'll never forgive myself.
For what, sir?
That my men...
That my men died and I didn't.
Sir, I don't...
I don't know how to tell this story.
Well, you got to, Joe.
You tell the American people what these men did here.
You tell 'em how my troopers died.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
All of our men, living and dead, are off the field, sir.
Well done, Sergeant Major.
In Saigon, Hal Moore's superiors congratulated him... for killing over 1800 enemy soldiers.
Then ordered him to lead the men of the 7th Cavalry... back into the Valley of Death.
He led them... and fought beside them... for 235 more days.
Kids, go to bed.
Isn't there someone at the door?
Go to bed!
Children, your daddy's home!
Daddy!
Some had families waiting.
For others, their only family would be the men they bled beside.
There were no bands, no flags... no honor guards to welcome them home.
They went to war because their country ordered them to.
But in the end they fought not for their country or their flag.
They fought for each other...
Dear Barbara...
I have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of Jack.
The world is a lesser place without him.
But I know he is with God and the angels.
And even heaven is improved by his presence there.
I know you, too, are sure of this... and yet this knowledge can't diminish his loss... and your grief.
With abiding respect and affection,
Hal Moore.
We who have seen war... will never stop seeing it.
In the silence of the night, we will always hear the screams.
So this is our story... for we were soldiers once... and young.
There she is.
Bonjour, madame. How much for a reading?
Three francs, dear, and it's written on the door.
I'm sorry.
I cannot see.
- We've got to go. We're late.
- We'll miss the bus.
Thank you, madame.
What do you see?
I see your 34th year.
Shut up.
That's the porter.
He spotted me as I was making my getaway.
These are first-year rooms, aren't they?
They're very luxurious.
The ones at Yale are like monk's cells.
"Aristotle and Virtue." Oh, God, I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter.
- Of course it does. I ruined them.
Wait.
It's getting heavier out there, huh?
- Do you mind if I stay here till it eases off?
- No. Of course you can.
- I go out with one of the dons.
- I know. Julian Ellsworth.
We just had an awful row.
I can't go back to his rooms.
I have to get out of these togs.
Excuse me.
Help.
It's completely stuck to me.
I don't mind if it tears.
Thanks.
Bless you.
I can't let you go out in this.
You can sleep in my bed.
But we haven't been introduced.
I'll sleep on the chair and keep watch.
That's very noble, but I wouldn't dream of kidnapping your bed.
You're taking a terrible risk having me here at all.
- Sorry.
- No. Don't apologize.
- I'm flattered.
- It doesn't normally...
I should hope it does.
- I'm Gilda BessÃ©.
- I know who you are.
- That sounds ominous.
- You're famous around here.
- Where are you from?
- Dublin originally.
- We moved up north after the Treaty.
- Why was that?
My father was a policeman.
And he was killed during the Troubles.
So are you British or Irish?
On paper, I'm British.
But I don't believe in countries much.
Nor do I.
- How did you end up here?
- I got a scholarship.
Beauty, bravery, and brains.
What a catch.
You also have a nice willy, and I hope to dream about it.
- Good night, Guy.
- Good night.
We made it. I owe you my life.
You don't owe me anything. It was fun.
Everyone knew Gilda BessÃ©.
Her father owned one of the big French champagne houses.
Her mother was a rich American socialite.
The marriage hadn't lasted... and Gilda had lived most of her life in the United States.
She was quite notorious at Cambridge... and last night, she had actually slept in my bed.
If anyone knew, I'd be a celebrity overnight.
Are you Guy Malyon?
- Yeah.
- Julian Ellsworth.
I'm incredibly grateful about the other night.
Gilda said you were a brick.
I really can't thank you enough.
You saved my bacon.
I'd have been dismissed and most likely disinherited if they'd found her here.
Glad to have been of help.
Listen, we're having a bit of a beano at the weekend.
Gilda wanted me to invite you.
Don't know if you're much of a jitterbugger... but the old man's away,
I'll have the run of the place.
You need a girl, of course.
I can line one up.
When I was a freshman,
I didn't know what girls were.
I'm afraid Mr. Ellsworth won't allow you in unless you first drink one of these.
The password is "martini."
God, it tastes like paraffin!
One doesn't taste it, darling, one simply swallows.
- New blood.
- Hello, old boy.
You girls should want to dance with me this evening... because Gilda has got herself stranded in Calais.
- Poor Gilda.
- Do come through.
Calais is such a dreadful place.
- Hello, Guy.
- Hi.
Glad you could make it.
You're the troubled boy... whose girlfriend
Julian is planning to monster.
- Are you sad?
- I'm thrilled for her.
You don't mind if she gets debauched?
So long as the debaucher's from a fucking good family, I couldn't care less.
Do you imagine you're being incredibly daring using words like that?
You should try them sometime.
It's good for constipation.
I'm going to feel so wicked in the morning.
What are you writing?
An ode to your tummy button.
- Gilda.
- Sir Knight.
- Don't go up there.
- Why shouldn't I go upstairs?
- There's an orgy going on.
- Sounds promising.
My partner for the evening's the main course.
Your partner isn't Molly Twelvetrees, by any chance, is she?
Yeah. She's in danger of catching a cold.
- Julian's writing a poem on her stomach.
- What a cad.
Don't you mind?
I feel sorry for Molly. He's a terrible poet.
You're very modern, aren't you?
I don't feel very comfortable here.
I feel guilty being around all this wealth.
It's just a game. Don't take it seriously.
It's not much of a game if you're out of work and trying to feed a family.
Fortunately, I'm not.
And neither are you.
I only came here tonight to see you.
- There, I've said it.
- Good.
You look lovely.
You don't.
Your eyes are all red.
You look like a bloodhound.
You have excellent recuperative powers.
- What if someone comes?
- We were here first.
- Oh, God!
- Think Sunday School.
- What?
- Think Sunday School.
- Why?
- Because this is a team sport.
Thank you, Unwin.
- I thought it might be prudent to...
- Good idea.
Good morning, Unwin.
I thought we might have breakfast on the terrace this morning.
Gilda!
What on earth are you doing down here?
Happy birthday, darling.
- Who's that?
- My friend, Guy.
You really had your hands full when I got in.
Gilda, he's a virtual primitive.
I know. He's the Piltdown man.
I'm planning to exhibit him.
- Julian, nothing happened.
- I don't for a moment think anything did.
Apart from us writing sonnets all over each other.
All right. Do you mind getting up, please, before anyone else sees you?
Be a darling and lend me your dressing gown, would you?
Gilda, what have you got on under there?
Well, seeing it's your big day...
I'm wearing my birthday suit in your honor.
I thought for certain I would hear that Gilda and Julian had broken up... but nothing seemed to have changed between them.
A few weeks passed... and just when I'd resigned myself to never being with her again... something unexpected happened.
- The divorce was at least 12 years ago.
- Yeah, she must be devastated.
Can I join?
That's five shillings annual membership fee.
I read about your mother.
It must have been awful.
She was a stranger to me, really.
- But how have you been?
- Practicing my billiards.
I wanted to see you, to tell you that I'm leaving England.
Why?
The wanderlust has got me. I want to travel.
Where will you go?
I loved the Arabian Nights when I was younger.
Maybe I'll start there.
Would you like a traveling companion?
You have to finish your degree.
- Does Julian know?
- I'll leave him a nice letter.
You're the one friend from this chapter
I'd like to keep.
Three weeks later, Gilda left England.
And so began our one-sided correspondence.
For she was never in one place long enough for my letters to catch up with her.
After a year, she stopped writing.
By the time I graduated and began teaching in the East End of London...
I'd managed to finally put her behind me.
Civil war had broken out in Spain... and I was campaigning for the Republican side... in its increasingly desperate fight against the Fascists.
Tiberius is in a bad mood!
Where are those slaves?
We'll see how brave you are in the Coliseum.
Take away their drinking water.
I hadn't had a letter from her for almost a year.
But Gilda always had an uncanny sense of timing.
She was back in Paris... telling me a whole new chapter of her life was beginning... and demanding I visit her.
Once more, nothing else in the world existed for me.
Bonjour.
Guy! You came! And so soon!
Well, you finally sent me an address.
Look at you. Suddenly you're a man.
I even shave now.
- How long can you stay?
- Only till tomorrow. I have to work.
That's ridiculous.
You have to stay for at least a month.
- You'll be able to see my show.
- What sort of show?
You'll see tonight.
I saw you in a film as a slave in ancient Rome.
- Wasn't it ludicrous?
- How did you get the part?
I met an American cameraman and went back to Hollywood with him.
At first I wanted to be an actress... but then I got more interested in cameras.
I'd pick his brains in bed every night.
Are you married yet?
- Not quite.
- Good.
I'm sure you have a menagerie of admirers.
- So what do you do after work?
- I raise money for Republican Spain.
I forgot you had a conscience.
Max! This is Guy.
He just arrived from London.
Welcome to Paris.
Are you here for the opening?
He doesn't know anything about it, so he'll be completely objective.
Right.
Where are you staying?
There's a hotel my friends like, just around the corner.
He's staying here.
He and Mia can sing each other to sleep.
Good.
This is going to be incredibly glamorous, isn't it?
And I'm going to be incredibly dowdy.
You're British. People expect it.
Do you mind?
So Max is a lover?
He owns the gallery.
Actually, he's good company... but he's become extremely proprietorial lately.
- He's on very thin ice.
- Then I hope it melts.
Don't sulk.
I didn't know you were coming so soon.
And anyway...
I'm sure you're not sleeping alone in London every night.
Moments of yearning. Lust, vanity, and joy.
Loves won and lost.
It's an honor to be the first to host the work... of this gifted new photographer.
Finally, as a bonus, may I present a living sculpture... created especially for tonight?
The pictures were good of their kind.
But the sculptures were something else.
The trouble is we're never going to see them again.
You should film them, Gilda.
Record them for posterity.
They need to be live, so people can lean over... and smell the skin of the models.
Does that worry you, Mia?
Having people sniffing around you like dogs?
I'm a sculpture, so I ignore them.
What about you, Guy?
Have you seen anything like that in England?
No, I haven't.
Guy thinks art should be political.
In London, he spends most of his time campaigning for Republican Spain.
German artists spent the last 15 years lampooning the Nazis... and had no effect at all.
At least they tried.
Rather pointless if all they achieve is a ticket to one of those camps.
And the satisfaction of knowing they had the courage of their convictions.
Here's to judicious cowardice.
No. Here's to Mia, whose beauty inspired us all.
You should model for Coco Chanel.
I could introduce you.
Mia's training to be a nurse.
She only models in her spare time, and I have an exclusive contract.
But I do feel I've seen you before.
I never forget a face.
Perhaps you saw me at Le Grand Jeu.
So how do you carry on your crusade for Spain?
Do you sit on a committee and hand out pamphlets in the street?
And if you really feel so strongly... why don't you enlist in the International Brigades?
I plan to at the end of school term.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I am.
Well, the line must be drawn.
Fascism must be stopped before it engulfs us all.
Good night.
- You've become so serious.
- The world has become serious.
We'll all die of gravity.
I'm sorry I can't be with you tonight.
- Do you even like him?
- Occasionally.
But I admit, he's trying a little too hard at the moment.
Mia, get out of the bath!
You'll turn into a prune!
I take it Le Grand Jeu is a cabaret?
Burlesque. Striptease.
She came here with nothing.
She's my protÃ©gÃ©.
I want the three of us to be friends.
Gilda, are you coming?
I'll see you in the morning.
This one's comfortable.
I used to sleep here when I first came.
- How long have you been here?
- Half a year.
Whereabouts in Spain are you from?
Asturias. In the north.
Don't be jealous. He's not special to her.
None of them are.
He wants you to hear.
He's afraid of her feelings for you.
Yeah, well, I'm afraid of mine for her.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
How dare you be so pathetically melodramatic walking out on me like that?
What's there to drink? I'm bone dry.
Hello.
- This is Linda.
- Hello, Gilda.
I'm sorry I woke you.
I got seasick on the boat... and then I tried to eat something to settle my stomach... but the food in this country is awful.
- Is this a bad time?
- What do you think?
Does Max know you're here?
Max was being very boring about you, so I expelled him.
I'm not going to let you go and get yourself killed.
You'd probably come back with your brain shot out.
Conversations would be incredibly one-sided.
Now, get me a blanket and you can go back to bed.
- What are you doing?
- I'm going.
She's sleeping in there.
I'm just getting her some bedclothes.
Guy, I was with you at the cinema.
After you saw her, you hardly spoke the rest of the day.
And when you got her letter, you couldn't get on a train fast enough.
I'm off.
- There's no need.
- I've got an early start in the morning.
And besides, I think I'm a bit in the way.
- You didn't ask her to leave, did you?
- No.
Seeing as she has,
I suppose I don't have to sleep rough.
You've no idea how I adored you at Cambridge.
And when I arrived here, nothing had changed.
It was miraculous.
I couldn't stand lying on the other side of that door... listening to you and your lover, though.
That was torture.
Don't worry.
I'm still in good voice.
By the time we're finished... you'll be so conceited, you'll be insufferable.
How do you like my tie?
It's perfect.
So how did you and Mia meet?
I saw her on the street.
Followed her to a cafÃ©.
You choose people, don't you?
"Come into my life."
Sometimes you see complete strangers, but there's something special about them... and you think,
"I should really try and talk to them...
"because I'll never see them again," but you don't... because it's not done.
But it's all fated, anyway.
It had to be your room
I came into that night in Cambridge.
What do you mean?
The whole room was familiar.
I'd seen it before in dreams.
It probably reminded you of some place you've been before.
We just think we've dreamt things.
You're so complacent!
The mind isn't a physical thing like the rest of the body.
Maybe it can jump forward in dreams.
Maybe it doesn't have to obey physical laws.
But if my room was already there... then that would mean everything was fixed in advance.
You think I was being spontaneous... but I was always going to do that.
Just as I was always going to win this argument.
That's what I learned at school.
I've got to work out what I'm going to do.
- Resign from your teaching for a start.
- And what do I live on?
- I'll give you a job as my assistant.
- How's the pay?
Good bonuses.
I listen to them every night.
- Do we keep you awake?
- She can sleep through anything.
She has amazing conversations in her sleep.
Three or four people.
Sometimes speaking different languages.
So, do you accept?
You odious little boy. How's that?
Now the horrible little girl has turned around.
Hello. We're just off to the pictures.
So, Guy... you have forsaken London for the City of Light?
It seems so.
Mia!
- Change in here.
- Why?
He came to the exhibition.
He won't be seeing anything he hasn't seen before.
You were part of my sculpture.
You're flesh and blood now.
What are you doing going out with him, anyway?
I'm curious.
You know what they say about him.
You should hear what they say about you.
Your dresser has excelled herself.
- So you're having dinner afterwards?
- We haven't decided.
- What time should I bring her back?
- Shut up.
- See you both later.
- Bonsoir.
You're a very lucky man, living with two beautiful women.
But Gilda still doesn't approve of me.
Sometimes I think she's jealous.
You seem to have a calming influence on her.
She used to move in wild circles, but I'm sure you know that.
- And you don't care.
- No, I don't.
Very commendable.
The past and the future are irrelevant.
The moment is everything.
You know, at first I thought you were an idealist, a bore.
But you're one of us, after all.
Tell me, as one man to another... what does Gilda like in bed?
As one man to another?
That's none of your business.
Come on, Mia. Dance for us.
- Please?
- It's Christmas.
- Come on.
- All right.
Why not?
What are you two talking about?
- You.
- And what are you saying?
What are you saying?
It's past 4:00.
We've almost lost Christmas Day. Come on.
I'm starving.
An American turkey made an ill-starred bid for freedom at Whipsnade Zoo today... only to touch down in the arctic fox enclosure with mixed results.
A happy ending for the fox, less so for the turkey.
The weather in...
I'm sorry. I don't understand a word.
You don't need to.
If an animal made those sounds, you'd know it was evil.
All he's saying is that when Greater Germany is restored... he'll have no other territorial claims.
And you believe him?
I used to paint pictures of all these places when I was home from boarding school.
- Can I see them?
- I threw them all away.
I had no talent of my own.
I just wanted to be van Gogh.
- Bonjour, FranÃ§oise.
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
What are you doing, Father?
I am saving the lives of insects.
I've never seen you so compassionate.
I don't like the popping sounds they make.
Why are you wearing your uniform?
There was a rally in Rheims, the Croix-de-Feu.
Our Popular Front is not quite so popular here in the country.
The world is veering towards Moscow... which is a little worrying for us minor landowners.
But politics has never been one of my daughter's stronger points.
Take your feet off the couch.
- Charles BessÃ©.
- Guy Malyon.
You'll be joining us for dinner?
Guy recently moved here from England.
So, how's the acting?
I only did that one film.
It was never going to be a career.
Whatever next? I can't keep up with her.
First it was dance, and her room was full of ballet.
Then she discovers Stendhal, and, of course, she wants to be a great novelist.
And then there was what, painting?
One thing I learned from you, Father, was never to dwell on one's mistakes.
- Where's my stepmother?
- She's probably out walking the dogs.
What happened to that Max fellow?
A light of other days.
I sired a dilettante, in every aspect of her life.
That's why I resent you, for bequeathing me such superficial genes.
They say a winemaker's taste is the last of his senses to desert him.
But Gilda tells me that you're not much interested in wine.
- I was brought up on Guinness.
- We drink Guinness in France.
- Very good for an upset stomach.
- The old hair of the dog.
Indeed.
Why, Gilda, you're looking very fetching tonight.
She likes to startle me by wearing her mother's things.
I think she intends to make me feel guilty.
You see, she blames me for her mother's death.
I don't blame you, Father.
Fate deals some people a rotten hand, that's all.
Fate is an excuse for people who suffer a failure of nerve.
- So it was her fault, was it?
- No, not at all.
It's absolutely and completely my fault.
I am an insensitive brute.
You see, darling? You married a beast.
I married a beast because I'm a huntress.
And if I can't tame you, I'll shoot you.
Then I must mend my ways.
Isn't your birthday coming up soon, dear?
Now, we must do something to celebrate this year.
You know I never celebrate my birthdays.
If you're afraid of birthdays already, you'll be a wreck when you're my age.
I can't imagine ever being that old.
Thank you, Gilda.
There's something about that house that turns me into a monster.
I didn't like his politics, but I enjoyed the repartee.
He ends up humiliating all his women.
You saw her, how hard she was trying.
All he wants her for is to show her off to his shooting friends.
Mia, we're back.
That bastard.
- You don't have to go to work today.
- I'm all right.
I'm all right.
- Should we tell the police?
- She was a striptease dancer.
They'd say she asked for it.
- Then I'll go round and see him myself.
- And end up in a cell?
He has powerful friends.
Lucien? Gilda BessÃ©.
Mia doesn't know I'm calling.
She got a little carried away the other night.
Yes, that's right.
I like it the way you do.
And I'm stronger than she is.
- I thought we should meet.
- I see.
- Guy?
- Yeah?
Max wants to have lunch today.
He wants to talk about another exhibition.
- Do you mind?
- No, of course not.
You should take Mia to a film or something.
She needs to get out.
- That's a good idea.
- Maybe a comedy.
I thought you might change your mind.
My English friend tells me
I'm very stubborn.
- I assume he doesn't know where you are?
- No one does.
Perhaps I should lock the door.
Why did you decide to become a nurse?
I wanted to be a dancer.
My father was a coal miner. An anarchist.
Our house was full of politics all the time... but I would always be running away to dance.
Two years ago, they declared a Socialist Republic in Asturias.
A house in our street became a hospital.
I tried to help, but I didn't know anything.
And people were... dying in my arms.
And then the soldiers came.
I tried to stop them from taking my brother, and that's when they hurt my leg.
After that, I knew I couldn't be a dancer.
And I wanted to help people.
So that's why I am becoming a nurse... and why I need to go back to my country.
- Hello.
- How did it go?
- It was fine.
- You're doing another exhibition?
We played around with a few different ideas.
I did most of the talking.
Why are you two looking so miserable?
Trois cognacs.
We saw a newsreel on Spain.
You were supposed to be cheering her up.
It was my idea.
We wanted to see what else was going on in the world.
There will always be wars... while there are people dying to be martyrs.
Go on. Say how guilty you feel.
Afterwards, we sat out in the gardens.
I'm serious.
You need to get it out of your system.
Because you feel guilty that life is good here... while terrible things are happening there.
After you've talked about it, you'll feel better because you've shown you care.
To you... for getting rid of that vile man.
And you... for getting rid of your guilt.
- To us.
- To us.
You live in a cocoon.
You don't think about the world outside.
I give my allegiance to those around me.
We share the world, whether we like it or not.
You can share my bed as long as you don't bring your newsreels or newspapers into it.
Marry me.
- What?
- I'm serious.
If I woke one morning and you'd turned into a husband, I'd flee.
How would it be any different?
Once people get married, they stop trying.
- Anyway, you would want to have children.
- One day.
You should have one with Mia.
He'd be beautiful.
Sometimes you say the first thing that comes into your head.
Should I censor what I say?
If I had a child, I'd have it with you.
My mother was mad. You've met my father.
I have doomed genes.
You talk such nonsense.
What's wrong?
Things are getting worse in Spain.
There are friends of mine there now.
And you want to go get yourself killed, too, in someone else's war?
It's not someone else's war.
It's as much ours as if it was happening here.
We all share the same world.
Any trained nurses they'll take at once.
I've got an address for you to go to.
Who'll take any trained nurses at once?
I'm going to Spain.
I didn't want to say anything until it was definite.
And it's time for me to go back, too.
They need nurses there.
We've been living together for a year.
Am I such an ogre that you can't even discuss your plans with me?
I didn't see much point.
You didn't see much point in talking about throwing away your life?
And taking Mia with you?
I was always going to go back once I became a nurse.
You would just never listen.
Of course. I should have seen it coming.
You feed each other's guilt.
It's like a disease.
Thank God it hasn't infected me.
Gilda's father was traveling in America... and as a kind of farewell, we spent the last week at the Chateau.
The sense of our departure hung over every moment... though it was never mentioned again until the last day.
I can't drink any more.
Yes, you can.
We're drinking for all those times... we won't be able to drink together again.
There'll be periods of leave when I can come back to Paris.
I wouldn't want to see you if you came back with some hideous injury.
Come on, we're still drinking.
You're not going to sleep.
- Wake up.
- I'm tired.
Gilda, you're drunk.
Why do you have to go as well?
Traitor.
Wait.
Fire!
Forward.
Poor bastards. They didn't stand a chance.
My dear Gilda... yesterday, in an ambush behind the enemy lines...
I killed a young Nationalist soldier.
How inadequate those words seem.
He was clutching a locket when he died... with a photograph of a young woman.
I suppose, as I write this, she's waiting for news of him... hoping against hope he is safe.
Dearest Gilda... still no word from you, which breaks my heart.
I know that to you all wars are useless... and for us to risk our lives is a betrayal... of ourselves and of you.
But my country's a part of me.
And if I was not here,
I would be betraying myself... and even more, my brother.
Believe me... my being here does not mean
I love you any less.
Forgive me if you can... and know that I think of you all the time.
I wonder if you are writing to either of us.
But I do beg you, at least, to write to Guy.
His unit is at Teruel... where the fighting is especially bitter... and made worse by the intense cold.
I can't stay.
We're operating in a few moments.
I know.
We treated men from your unit a few days ago.
- That's how I knew you were here.
- I asked about you.
They said you have no nerves.
You're always the quiet one in the center of the storm.
If I am, it's because I'm too tired to be frightened.
When do you finish your shift?
We never know. Where are you tonight?
Not far from here. It's an old tannery.
I know it.
If I can, I'll come.
- You must be dead on your feet.
- No. I have a secret weapon.
It's strong enough to help you forget what you've seen during the day.
Have you heard from her?
I've had other letters, but none from her.
And you?
No.
Why won't she write?
She loves you more than she'll ever admit.
And one day you'll be together again,
I know it.
These last few days, I've been asking myself if any of this is worth it.
Perhaps she was right.
The world should be left to look after itself.
- You know you don't believe that.
- But what are we achieving?
With the Germans and the Italians on their side, it's only a matter of time.
In that time, maybe the rest of the world will begin to realize what's happening.
- You were always the sensible one.
- Was I?
Not in my choice of men, remember?
We should try to sleep.
You know, Gilda once said we two should have a child.
You know she and I were lovers?
I knew underneath.
I wanted to tell you, but she always said you were too British.
She was probably right.
Those were the happiest times of my life... the three of us together.
And you and I came here.
We had no choice.
How can I be so tired... and still feel jealous?
I was jealous of you all the time.
She'd be pleased.
Everything needs her blessing.
- Here's your lift.
- My doctor friend.
He's convinced I'm some kind of saint because I never go with anyone.
He was so relieved when I said
I wanted to come and see you.
He insisted on giving me a lift himself.
I finally got rid of my halo.
There is no second sight.
We grope towards our future blind.
It's kinder that way.
On the morning of her final day, she came to her death clear-eyed... brave, unknowing.
And when the snow melts, spring has come.
There is an end to war.
One small flower... blessed, unique... will flower no more.
Gilda...
I have to tell you that our dear friend is dead.
I saw her just before it happened.
She was so beautiful... and had become so wise.
Far stronger than me.
A few months later, as the forces of the Republic began to disintegrate...
I crossed back into France with the remnants of my unit.
All our efforts had come to nothing.
The war in Spain was lost.
I am speaking to you from the Cabinet Room... at 10 Downing Street.
This morning, the British Ambassador in Berlin... handed the German government a final note... stating that unless we heard from them by 11:00... that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland... a state of war would exist between us.
I have to tell you now... that no such undertaking has been received... and that consequently... this country is at war with Germany.
The war against the Fascists in Spain was only a rehearsal.
The greater struggle was about to begin.
Less than a year later...
Poland, Norway, Holland, Belgium, and France were overrun... and the Germans entered Paris.
I doubted I would ever see her again.
My war was in the field of intelligence.
And early in 1944...
I was sent to establish links with Resistance fighters... based in the countryside near La Manche.
In the late spring, I was transferred to Paris.
Six long years had passed since I was last there.
My cover was as an official working for a firm manufacturing rolling stock... for the hard-pressed French railways.
And some time after I arrived,
I was waiting for a rendezvous.
Did she see me? I wasn't sure.
But after the initial shock, how could I be surprised?
Gilda didn't see the world as others did.
She was looking after herself... making sure she could live in the style she was accustomed to.
Bravo.
Stop!
Three mornings I sat across the road waiting for you.
You mustn't come again.
He could come here at any time, and everyone watches.
They'll have seen you come into the building... the patron and his wife from the cafÃ©.
Yeah, well, they don't think much of you there.
- Of course not.
- And you don't care?
Did I ever care what people thought of me?
I'd like to believe that once you cared what I thought.
Why, Gilda? Why this?
I never much liked my own company, you know that.
Yeah, but with one of them?
It's just a game.
Not now.
I'm glad you're alive.
You know about Mia?
She loved you, you know?
As much as I did.
You should go.
We could leave Paris.
Make our way to the coast.
I have the papers.
Don't be absurd.
Are you in love with him? This German?
Or is it just a convenience?
A business arrangement, like with Max?
For the duration of the exhibition?
The duration of the war?
Go out the back way.
When we were making love just then, you felt it as strongly as I did.
Yes.
Our bodies were always good together.
Forget about me, Guy... as I have you.
You're out of my life now.
Hello, sir.
When they told me you'd been sitting at a cafÃ© three mornings in a row...
I didn't believe them.
Now I find it's because you were waiting to see an old girlfriend.
A girlfriend who happens to be hobnobbing with a German officer.
Do you realize the risk you're taking?
The risk you're taking with all of us here?
You're lucky you didn't wake up with your throat cut.
Did you know she was involved with a German?
Yes, sir.
- And yet you still went to see her?
- I've known her a long time.
I've a good mind to have London pull you out.
They won't have it, because there's no one with your credentials... can come in at this short notice.
- I won't be seeing her again.
- lf you do, I'll kill you myself.
You're so beautiful.
It was the right size, yes?
I feel very special.
One day, I will get you stockings.
- When the war is over.
- When the war is over.
I want to speak your language.
You promised you'd teach me.
But we have our own private language, you and I.
And when the Allies win the war... we'll all be speaking English in our sleep.
To think, if I had been at Cambridge one year later... we might have met then.
Here we go again.
You seem a little far away tonight.
I'm here.
I wonder who's getting it tonight.
You were good at the meeting.
You got it just right.
I'm sorry I followed you that day.
No, you had every reason.
I know what it's like to love someone.
Thank you.
Why do you let them insult you?
If our roles were reversed and this was Berlin... you'd find yourself doing the same.
And expect to be punished.
I'm angry because...
I don't want anything to spoil tonight of all nights.
- Why tonight?
- Because...
Because it's your birthday.
You've always refused to tell me, my darling.
And I know it's a woman's prerogative... but I wanted to know so we could celebrate.
Forgive me, I checked your papers.
My puppet, you're upset?
But why? Thirty-three.
I thought 28 at most.
Open it. Please?
So we're on standby.
Go down to the lavatories and put on the clothes there... my love.
They picked up the man you were meeting, Bisquet.
How did you...
There's a bicycle outside.
You have about two minutes.
Remember Cambridge? The next morning?
- How I dressed like a boy?
- Gilda.
I had no idea it would be you.
Give me 30 seconds.
- What happened?
- Bisquet was picked up last night.
We just found out.
- Who tipped you off?
- The woman I went to see.
This is a surprise.
I thought you were on alert.
We've been stood down.
There's a storm in the Channel.
No invasion in this weather.
How was your day?
Puzzling. Frustrating.
But not anymore.
I was elated. In some way, somehow, she was on our side.
Before I could even think of finding a way to see her... events on a greater stage overtook us:
D-day.
For a few days I was looked after by the priest.
And then I was flown back to hospital in England.
I still had no clear idea of Gilda's involvement in the Resistance.
All I knew was that in spite of everything... when the war was over, we would be together again... as Mia had foretold.
The Major will see you now, sir.
Just wait here for a moment, please.
- Long time, Guy.
- It is, sir.
The first contact didn't come from our side.
She approached us.
In fact, it was more than a year before I discovered who she was.
When I realized it was Gilda...
I was as surprised as I'm sure you were.
Although I suppose you knew her better than I ever did.
Her first lover worked in StÃ¼lpnagel's offices.
She copied documents from his briefcase with a miniature camera.
She's good with cameras.
Then passed them on through her contact in a beauty salon.
The intelligence officer she's with now is much more circumspect.
But one tip-off she gave us... saved an entire escape line from infiltration.
And when you went to see her, you were putting all that at risk.
Why didn't she tell me?
You know why.
If you were caught and tortured...
It wasn't just for your own good.
Paris is in chaos.
The Resistance is trying to liberate the city themselves... and there's no possible justification for sending you back there.
But she is very resourceful, as we both know.
I wouldn't worry about her too much.
It's not the Germans I'm worried about.
Of course, if you were to go of your own accord...
I wouldn't do anything to stop you.
- You got my message?
- I'm not coming with you.
Have you seen the people out there?
I'll be all right if I stay here.
When the Allies come...
Why will you not come with me?
I can take you to Germany.
I know it won't be easy, but at least you'll be safe.
I don't love you, Frans.
Oh, God!
No!
Well, my love,
I'm trying to make sense of things... of how I was, and how I am now.
Well, my love,
I'm trying to make sense of things... of how I was, and how I am now.
I have always believed our first duty is to ourselves... to live life to the full.
But I have also been haunted by another conviction... that everything is preordained, lying in wait... and time is running out.
I seem to have charged through my life in a kind of panic.
And looking back...
I feel I have achieved little of worth beyond our friendship: yours and mine, and Mia's.
Then one day I woke... and found I had lost the two people I cared for most.
Only then did I begin to realize that we cannot live alone, aloof from the world... and that to believe we cannot fight against fate is an act of surrender.
You were right when you said that once I cared for your opinion of me... but wrong in thinking I ever stopped caring.
I love you.
In the year 1763 king Mangra ascended to the throne of Burma.
His first goal was to conquer the small surrounding town states.
But the city Ayudhya in Siam relieved these town states -
- and encouraged them to fight back.
Therefore king Mangra decided to attack Ayudhya, the heart of Siam.
In 1765 the king dispacthed a great army -
- to attack Ayudhya by two different routes.
Commander Mang-Maha-Noratha lead
100.000 men in from the the West.
Another 100.000 came down from the North lead by commander Nemeao, -
- but these didn't reach the destination as scheduled.
They were forced back near a little village.
Waves af Burmese soldiers attacked the inhabitants of the village.
Despite the superior strength of the army the farmers forced it back again and again.
Rumours about the legendary courage of Siamese country people -
- spread fast across the whole nation.
This is their story.
The year 1765
Are you sure, Po Tan?
Will the Burmese come this way?
What are you afraid of?
We defeat them every single time.
We will defeats them this time as well.
Wait for me here.
You follow with me.
Kill them, all as one!
Follow me.
The Commander has been wounded!
Retreat! Retreat!
Retreat!
Here is some food.
Po Tan... A Burmese battalion has put up a camp in the woods.
Hurry up and eat.
The commander is wounded.
Do we call it off?
Commander, sir!
THE VILLAGE BANG RAJAN
Chorb! Ming!
Call for the Abbot in a hurry!
My god...
I need help just to stand up straight.
Don't say that.
Bang Rajan is not strong enough, when it's leader is wounded.
The village need to find a strong man, that can replace me.
I know the right man. He harbours a bitter hatred towards the Burmese.
He doesn't fear death.
He come from the village Khao Nang Buad.
Who's there? Show your face!
You are not Burmese. Don't you know, it's lethal to be out here?
We come from Bang Rajan.
We are looking for Ai Jan Nuad Kiew.
What do you want with me?
We want to make you our leader.
Look here.
There are wagon tracks. And so what?
Look, how deep they are.
It is Burmese chariots.
They carry canons to Ayudhya by the river of Prasop.
Your village keeps growing.
I fear, that one day the Burmese point the canons at you.
THE BATTLE BY THE RIVER OF PRASOP
Ai Jan's mustache is the same size the horns of this buffalo.
And he is almost as smart as a buffalo.
His reputation is totally exaggerated.
But people here in the village blindly trusts, what is new.
When they see a shit in the field, they think, it is gold.
- Of all my heart I'm happy to see you.
- We are pleased to be here.
These strips of clothing were blessed by the Abbot. They bring luck.
- I would like to talk to the Abbot.
- Me too. We meet at Po Tan's house.
Come with me.
What can I do -
- make them show a little respect?
You are pissed (drunk)!
- How goes it, Ai Jan?
- I'm ready, Holy man.
I never thought, you would leave Khao Nang Buad.
I asked you to follow us into the jungle, but you refused.
Live in the jungle?
What about the children of the village?
Was I supposed to just leave them?
Is the temple here as good as the one in Khao Nang Buad?
My job is to preach and teach.
That is enough for me.
How are you, Holy man?
I'm fine.
And you, little disciple?
It is wartime, but i am neither wounded nor sick.
- Who has made you a monk?
- The Abbot has given me holy orders.
You have been gone for so long.
We didn't knew what happened to you.
The Abbot said, I could help you by doing good deeds.
You are blessed.
Your Mother would have been proud of you.
May she rest in piece.
Po Tan, this is Ai Jan.
Po Tan, you didn't had to come.
I would have visited you later.
Ai Jan,
I need to tell you something, -
- and the whole village has to hear it.
The Abbot told me, that you are a remarkable warrior.
The village needs skilled men, -
- especially now, because I'm wounded.
Unfortunately we have to face, -
- that the village is without a strong leader.
A leader and commander.
Ai Jan,
Will you be the leader of Bang Rajan?
We are just normal warriors.
But if you think, that I'm worthy,
I will not refuse.
You decide, how the guards must be placed.
Here is the town wall weakest.
The watercourse is a wall in itself.
Not one single time has the Burmese succeeded getting through here.
It is difficult to send an army through.
That man is a great warrior, even though he is drunk.
He always return from the battlefield dressed in Burmese armour.
Carry him back.
How do you feel about
Ai Jan started living in the jungle?
Isn't he worried about his wife and children?
Or have they already been killed?
Why are you so so interested in Ai Jan?
In here it's only you and me.
And you are far more interesting than the others.
Bua! My Bua!
I have seen traces of the Burmese canons.
I have spoken to Po Tan about that.
We should have canons as well.
I have written a request for weapons.
It has to be delievered in Ayudhya.
AYUDHYA
Wait here.
They are coming!
How much longer do we need to wait?
- Grab some food.
- Thanks.
Most people leave their villages and take refuge here.
But I insisted in fighting back the Burmese.
What are you made of, you folks from Bang Rajan?
We are not from Bang Rajan.
We origin from Ban Sri Bua Thong.
We cultivated the land and went hunting.
We lived a quiet peaceful life.
If you concentrate, you will not get hurt.
No blood can be spilled at an ordination ceremony.
Hurry and clean it up.
What's with you?
You have acted weird lately.
What keeps E Taeng Aon?
I will let go of you, when your grandma has heard about this.
Let him go, E Taeng Aon.
You rip his ear off.
That's what I call a big pig.
It was Ai In, who shot it, right?
No, it was Ai Muang.
Actually it's not that big.
There is hardly food for one person.
You are not so big a hunter, eh, Ai Muang?
Just say it. It wasn't you, who killed the pig, was it?
Well, don't you have anything to say?
Or have you forgotten to clean teeth?
You can say whatever you like.
But some day it will be my sword, which protects you.
It is Som!
Hey, Som. Are you on leave?
No, I deserted.
I came to participate in the ordination of my son.
But don't tell my mother.
She will get so nervous.
Juk! Juk, your father has returned!
No, don't do it!
Watch out, Ai Muang!
The people in Bang Rajan invited the survivors -
- to join them and live in their village.
We united in our hatred towards the Burmese.
We became more and more every day.
We knew, we couldn't run away.
Together we would fight back the Burmese.
It was here I became acquainted with a drunk -
- by the name Ai Tong Maen.
Even the monks raised weapons.
Soon the town's temple was empty.
We better take a look in the temple.
You can't kill him!
I beg you you to spare his life for my sake.
But he is Burmese.
Aren't they humans as well?
They feel the same pain as we do.
I can't ignore your command.
Where are you from?
From Bang Rajan. We want to offer you the post as our spiritual leader.
And so the monk Dhammachote started living in Bang Rajan.
In him the warriors found will, motivation and inspiration -
- to win every battle.
Do you wear the blessed clothing, every time you fight?
What can I do to get such a talisman?
You have been extremely kind, and we have nothing to offer in contrast.
We are happy to give you our clothing.
You really want to give them to us?
Is there found a decision?
May you live a long life.
Next time you sacrifice, spare a little for yourself.
How is your son doing?
He is dead. That's why
I brought food as offer.
So he wouldn't starve in the next life.
Po Tan, can you sharpen my sword?
Of cause. Just a moment.
Who's the owner of this axe?
It's enormous.
It belongs to Ai Tong Maen.
I can't barely lift it.
Ai Tong Maen, the drunk.
What kind of person is he?
I have asked myself that a lot of times. I still know nothing.
I only know, that he arrived lying on a wagon pissed.
And he has not been sober since.
Ai Tong Maen, here are your axes.
You are a skilled warrior. Why don't you teach the others your technic?
I'm not a teacher.
And besides, we all have to die anyway.
You talk as ugly, as you smell.
What did you say?
If you drink yourself to death, -
- what good are you, when the Burmese attack?
Ai Jan! They have returned from Ayudhya.
Ayudhya didn't give us any canons.
They don't want to help us.
They fear, that if Bang Rajan falls, -
- the Burmese will just have more canons.
You did your best.
It looks like, we are alone...
...more than before.
I suggest, that we build outposts in the trees -
- and have them guarded all time.
It will be like expanding the wall.
That makes us a little ahead.
It's a stupid idea.
Why should we wait?
It is better to attack them -
- than to sit around and wait for them.
I agree!
I have no idea, what you talk about.
If we do this...
...we improve safety in the village.
Hopefully you understand that.
Let me take the next watch.
Ai In, you get killed!
I will not stay here!
Let go of me! Let go!
It's me, Ai In.
I am still alive. Take it easy.
But soon you will die.
My family can't die here!
We are leaving! The Burmese are on their way!
Hurry up, E Taeng Aon!
This is the Abbot's medicine.
Rub it over the wound.
Don't worry, Mali.
For several days he has talked about going to Ayudhya.
If he does it,
I have to go with him.
I can't let him down.
Open the gate!
Is it you, Ai Jan?
Come inside and get a little to eat and drink.
Did I wake you up?
Some nights I can't sleep.
In nights I have also been standing guard, -
- like you do now.
Ai Jan...
The day, you talked about asking for canons from Ayudhya...
...I felt, that you were a strong and powerful leader.
I even dreamt about firing the canons myself against those damn Burmese.
If we just had those canons.
Everything would be easier.
I think, I have to be more strict towards the others. What do you think?
I have pointed you out as leader.
You must do, what you find wisest.
Stop!
Here are some blankets for the journey.
Safe travel, Mali og Ai Plang.
Your son will have grown big before next time we meet.
- Thanks. You are good friends to have.
- Good luck.
E Taeng Aon...
You scarred me.
Why do you follow me?
- Promise not to say anything.
- I promise.
You must teach me how to fight.
You said I was useless with a sword.
Have you changed your mind?
Will you teach me or not?
First you have to ask polite.
"Please?"
Please?
Please?
Ih, It makes my flesh crawl.
I don't want to learn anyway.
Your wrists are to thin.
Your hands are soft as a baby.
You are to weak to handle a sword.
Stop being so patronizing.
I was kidding.
I just wanted to say,
I think, you are beautiful.
Way too beautiful to run around killing people.
I will protect you from the Burmese.
I won't let them do you any harm.
I will protect you with my life.
Can I go now.
I meant, what I said.
- Where're you going?
- Home.
It is also my house.
Big jerk!
Why do you come here in this hour of the night?
We would like to have a relic, that can protect us in battle.
I don't have such a thing.
Relics exist only in your imagination.
Can we have the clothing, you are sitting on?
Ai Tong Maen.
You are pissed all day long.
Take this. It's from the Abbot.
It will bring us good luck.
It protects you from the enemy and your own recklessness.
Tie it around your arm, like Ai Jan does.
Then no weapon can harm you.
You idiot! What did you do that for?
You were right. You didn't got injured,
You just got a bump.
You idiot.
You should rather steal armour from the Burmese.
I have seen thousand of men wearing that strip and they were dead.
Can you see those bananapalms?
We pretend they are the Burmese.
What the hell are you doing?
You destroy the bananapalms.
I want to be able to take care of myself whatever might happen.
I want to survive.
Do you really know how to fight?
Of cause. I've watched the men training.
You think, that's enough to be good?
Get back to the kitchen.
I am hungry.
What do you say, my friend?
There is plenty of food for everybody.
- But it won't last forever.
- We need to fill the storehouses.
I overheard a conversation between the people from Ban Krab.
They said, that when they had to escape, their rice was almost ready to harvest.
By now it should be ready to harvest.
You watch the reaping.
We ride out and stand guard.
E Sa, you are tired. You need to rest.
What's wrong, E Sa?
Are you pregnant?
Have you told your husband?
Not yet.
I don't want to end up like Mali.
I couldn't bear that.
- Where is my wife?
- She suffered a slight indisposition.
Ai In doesn't need to worry about me.
Ai Muang said, you felt unwell.
Or are you lazy?
You just wanted to chat with E Taeng Aon?
You wife doesn't feel well, and then you talk to her like that.
Rest for a while.
I will harvest for you.
- Then I can harvest for you.
- Ai Muang!
Ai Tong Maen? What are you doing?
Jeg kind of got lost, but I managed to find my way.
- How did you get here?
- We have followed you.
Ai Jan, where have you been?
I have seen the Burmese.
They have captured prisoners.
Where? How many?
Around 30 soldiers.
They have taken 20 prisoners.
They are on their way through the nearby field.
What do we do?
We are not done harvesting.
We wait, 'till they reach the hill.
I give the sign.
Kill all of them. If we don't do that, we will not be able to finish reaping.
Ai In, take position at the hill.
You go that way.
The rest of you come with me.
What the hell are you doing?
Get going!
Wait for the sign.
- I can't go any further...
- Get up! Come on!
Fire!
Look what you have done Ai Tong Maen!
Ee is dead!
Grab Ai Tong Maen and lock him up.
Are you angry with Ai Jan because he locked up Ai Tong Maen?
I see it from both sides.
To me there is only one enemy and that's the Burmese.
THE BURMESE CAMP
BY WISETCHAICHAN
COMMANDER MANG-CHANGAI
E Taeng Aon?
Why are you awake at this hour?
I need to tell you something, Ai In.
I didn't want to wake you up.
Go back to sleep.
I am awake anyway.
Let me get you some water.
You don't need to do that.
I can do it myself.
But I always do it for you.
From now on you never have to do that sort of things.
You don't need to get water.
You don't have to harvest rice.
I will take over all your duties.
Then the others will say, that
I don't take good care of my husband.
E Taeng Aon has told me everything.
It has made everything clear to me.
I am unbelievable happy.
If it's a boy,
I will have him ordained.
Why didn't you tell me?
You are not surposed to keep secrets from your husband.
It was just a joke.
Don't get upset.
E Sa...
Why are you crying?
Is there anything else you haven't told?
I saw Mali and her little child.
Her husband worried so much, that he got injured in battle.
It must not happen to you.
You may not die from me...
Go back to sleep.
We can learn something from Mali.
What happend to them won't happen to us.
Never.
Now I understand, what it was Ai Tong Maen meant.
We can't wait for the Burmese. we have to retaliate.
Last time I stood guard, -
- I saw some Burmese deserters sail down the stream.
It just came to me, we ought to attack them from the riverside.
If everybody agrees, let's do it.
But who will be on guard then?
- You stand guard, Sing.
- Why me?
We can't all go.
Somebody has to stay back home.
You stay as well, Ai Muang.
Stay and protect the village.
No I want to go.
It's not doable. Ai Jan will discover if too many of us are missing.
Let us get going.
Tonight we give a Burmese commander a columbian necktie!
- Where are you going?
- We are fugitives heading for Bang Rajan.
- Is this the right way?
- Just continue straight ahead.
Wait!
Wait! What's in the back of you wagons?
Don't let him escape!
Kill them!
Get back!
None must escape!
Ai Jan, let me out!
Ai In? Ai In?
Ai Jan, let me out!
Hurry inside.
Let me out!
Close the gate!
E Taeng Aon!
It was you who stood guard.
How could the Burmese get inside?
Why do you blame Ai In?
You can see he is wounded.
Enough, Ai Muang.
It's my fault. I left my post.
Myself and some men went to their camp to kill their commander.
My actions are unforgivable.
Punish me as it suits you.
Decapitate him!
He deserves to die!
I can't allow that.
Ai In did what he felt was right.
Han put his own life in danger in order to kill their commander!
How many of you are brave enough to do that?
Ai In, you know you acted wrong.
Don't let it happen again.
Look what we have been exposed to!
And you let him off with a warning?
Then decapitate him yourself.
My son is dead becasue of you!
E Sa!
E Sa! E Sa!
It was wrong of me to leave you.
It was wrong of me to leave my post.
It was wrong of me to lead my friends to their death.
I swear -
- I will make it up for all my actions.
The Burmese have conquered everything with exceptance of Ayudhya.
Will Ayudhya help?
If not, we have to surrender to the Burmese.
It's better to be slave than to be dead.
I have never seen you up here before.
There is something I want to say.
All the inhabitants are running.
Women, children... everybody.
They take what's possible and run.
Ai Tong Maen, why did you decide to come here?
It was not a choice.
I was drunk and fell asleep on a wagon.
When I woke up I was here.
Sometimes I wish I were like you.
Without a responsibility.
I ought to move back to the jungle.
Then I wouldn't have the responsibility for other peoples lives.
Ai Jan...
What I wanted to say was that you have done everything you could.
Those of us who are left know it's a matter of life and death.
We don't know when we are going to die.
We only know what is happening rigth now.
In the past I thought the only one to look after me was my father.
But then I saw you put your life in danger to save me.
Now I know that you care about me too.
When I came to Bang Rajan
I often went down here.
So I sat here...
...and thought about starting family.
Maybe begin to farm.
E Taeng Aon, would you like to live together with me?
Can you protect your family with that tiny bow, Ai In?
It's for our son.
How old must he be before he can play with it?
One day I will learn him how to use it, so he can protect you.
Po Tan, you ought to go to Ayudhya, while you still can.
I am going nowhere. Look at my wounds.
I would die before I came anywhere.
Do you think I could be any use if I stay?
A lot of the inhabitants have already packed their things and left.
We are almost no warriors left.
What is your plan Ai Jan?
Ayudhya wouldn't help, so I came instead.
Jeg bring drawings with me so you can build your own canons.
We don't have metal enough.
Unload the armour!
Fire!
THE BURMESE CAMP BY
THE PRASOP RIVER
COMMANDER NEMEAO
GENERAL OF THE BURMESE ARMY
Bang Rajan has once again fought us back.
If we don't crush them before more people joins them...
They will keep attack us from behind.
Then we'll have to fight on two frontiers.
Prepare for battle.
We are going to Wisetchaichan.
THE BURMESE CAMP
BY WISETCHAICHAN
Our troops at the north frontier wait for us at Ayudhya.
But if we can't defeat that lousy village.
What's the problem Mang-Changai?
COLONEL SUKI
What are you afraid of? Continue!
Let me speak to that officer.
Suki, you are in charge of the slaves, right?
You are a brave man.
Are you not afraid of loosing your head?
In my opinion -
- a golden Buddha is more worth than a couple of felt-down bars.
But if the commander doesn't like my golden gift...
...then I must have my head cut off.
But who else is able of giving you such a gift?
Do you think you can achieve what
Mang-Changai isn't able of doing?
Mang-Changai says he can't defeat Bang Rajan, -
- because their monk is so powerful.
- What would you do in his place?
- Kill the monk.
- Only women and children.
- Yes, Sir.
It was the Burmese...
They took all women and children.
Wait for me here.
Daeng, you get Ai Jan.
I shall slaugther all of them!
In this life and the next!
I slaugther them!
Help me cut them down.
We bury them proprely in the village.
- Who are these two?
- My wife and child.
I came too late!
Each time
I have been attacking the Burmese, -
- I hoped to find my wife and child.
What kind of human can be that cruel -
- and then proudly display his deeds?
This is for you.
You knew, how to do it?
I once had a family.
I know, how to honour the dead.
Ai Jan og Ai Tong Maen...
Your families have now found peace.
It is us, who still are in this world, which has to suffer.
But we don't have to suffer for all eternity.
You have to teach the farmers to be strong and determined.
Stop!
Burmese soldiers!
We are here to defeat the enemy and capture their capital, -
- not to torture and murder country people, like we were common thieves.
You coward!
With that softness you just let these outcasts grow stronger.
The canons are broken.
Ai In, if there really is a life after this one...
...I want to be reborn as your woman.
No matter if our child is a boy or a girl, -
- I pray to, we also have a child in our next lives.
Fire!
Kill 'em!
E Taeng Aon!
Ai In...
If there is a life after this one, -
- I want to be reborn as your woman.
No matter if our child is a boy or a girl, -
- I pray to, we also have a child in our next lives.
Does he use magic or what?
Let's see, if it works.
If swords doesn't hurt him, we have to hammer him down.
Aim!
Fire!
They were so few.
But as you see,
- they were willing to give their lives to defend their honour and home.
They were indeed brave.
If all in this country are as brave as those from Bang Rajan, -
- Ayudhya will be difficult to conquer.
During the Burmese army's conquest against Ayudhya -
- all the Siamese soldiers fleet and evacuated the city.
The very same army had been hold back for five month -
- by a single small village.
Eight times during 1765-66 the inhabitants of Bang Rajan resisted -
- the Burmese army's attack.
When Bang Rajan finaly gave in, the Burmese forces surrounded Ayudhya.
Within a year the city was destroyed and the Siamese forces beaten.
Siam remained fragmented, until the future king Taksin the Great, -
- united the Siamese people in one kingdom.
The Siamese people had regained their freedom, -
- and they have kept it since.
Puhhh... hard work done
Alone?
Hiding place?
Gangster?
Bad conscience?
Sad?
Imprisoned?

Incomplete tales of several journeys
Anne!
Jean? Hi...
What are you doing here?
Where's Georges?
Away. Went 3 weeks ago.
Where to?
Kosovo.
Why? Has something happened?
What's your problem?
What's going on? What's wrong?
I'm not going back.
Why, if you don't mind me asking?
Look, I'm in a hurry.
Tell me what's wrong as we walk.
When's Georges back?
No idea.
You know what your brother's like.
Is it so urgent?
How did you get to Paris?
On the 1st train.
I've been here an hour.
What?
Your fucking door code's changed!
Why didn't you call me?
I got the answer-phone.
Sorry.
I need a place.
- Sorry?
- Here in Paris.
- How come?
- I fucked off.
You did?
I can't stand him.
Is that all?
He's doing up the old barn.
So? Hold on, you must be hungry, too.
In the bath, I can't hear the phone.
What?
Forget it.
Aren't you hungry?
Now where were we?
Oh yes, what's your Dad up to?
He's renovating the barn.
So?
To live in when I take over.
So?
- So, I'm not staying.
- Really?
Why not?
Wasn't your dream to run the farm?
No, never. That was his dream.
Okay.
This isn't really the time or place.
I'll get Georges to call, okay?
I'm not going back.
You should know by now you must do what your father says.
Later, you can make your own mind up.
I already have.
We'll talk it through later, now is not the time.
The show opened last night,
I got to bed at 4.30,
I just have time to glance at our press, and in precisely 48 minutes,
I have an important meeting.
Go easy now on my poor little soul.
Here, take the keys.
The code is 48B13.
If you're tired, you can stretch out on the couch.
I'll be back by 12.
Let's be clear: you've seen my place, there's not room for 3.
Got that?
Remember the code?
See you later.
If anyone calls, let the answer-phone get it.
What's with you?
Was that a good thing to do?
What?
Do you feel that was right?
Fuck you.
You stupid or what?
You're going to say sorry to the lady.
Fuck you.
Let go of me!
Who the hell are you? Let go!
Now, say sorry.
Didn't you hear me? Say sorry!
Let go, you fuck!
It's beyond belief!
What's going on?
Clear off out of here! Hooligans!
Unbelievable!
Hold on, I can explain.
Don't go.
This young man humiliated the lady.
Just let go of me!
Let go of him! Are you mad?
Why are you picking on him?
Is it your problem?
Who asked your opinion?
Do you know what he did at least?
Ask before you leap in.
- What's going on?
- He hit me.
- Typical...
- What?
He hit me!
Maybe you could tell her why?
Do you mind telling me what's going on?
I don't see why I should...
But everyone seems interested, so I'll tell you.
The lady... Wait there, please.
And you stay here!
Don't go sneaking off.
Get the fuck out of my way!
Let him go, for God's sake!
Stop... Calm down, Jean!
Break it up!
What's going on here?
What's he done?
They put on quite a show.
Wait, I can explain.
That's a smart idea.
I'll tell you if you give me the chance.
This boy, this young man, humiliated a woman begging outside the bakery...
What woman?
The one with the yellow bag.
Victor...
He threw a scrunched up bag...
Come here.
...sitting there, putting off customers.
We're not inhumane, but...
- Thank you.
- Can we go?
You can come and make a statement if you wish.
- Who'll look after...
- Can I have my ID?
ID!
Can I have my ID back, too?
I doubt it. What do you think?
Come along to the station first.
Understand?
Understand?
Good...
Take his details.
Please, this way.
I've done nothing wrong.
I'm coming of my own free will.
Don't make trouble.
You don't need to touch me.
I'll come, no problem.
If you don't comply,
I'll put the cuffs on. Okay?
Come on.
In the vaulted cellar of a badly damaged oil press.
Our group includes Mark Henderson of Newsweek,
myself and a dozen KLA fighters.
Originally, we were aiming for Drenica
to meet up with an even smaller group
but our plans changed.
I tried writing often
but gave up.
I didn't know what to say.
Outside, it's very quiet.
The firing stopped hours ago.
Waiting is the worst.
Antoine's 5 on May 11.
I hope to be back in Paris by then.
Eve promised I'd have him for the day.
"Break a leg" for your play.
Chin up, it'll be crap.
You won't get this in time, but you'll be great.
Sorry for my behavior on our last day.
If you see Jean-Pierre...
Yes?
What?
I don't have time, I have a fare.
When?
What did he do?
How many cops came?
They took him away again?
Call Aystan and Meyssa,
I'm on my way.
Can you slow down, please?
Sorry, sir, I'm in a big hurry.
It's very important.
I don't want to end up in hospital because of you.
Are you deaf? I said, slow down.
Sorry.
What the...
I'm sorry.
I'll drop you at the taxi stand.
I don't believe this!
Sir, there's a taxi right there.
I'm very sorry.
There's absolutely no charge.
What a nerve!
Rokia? Put your mother on.
You can leave that there.
Just dump it on the chair.
Leave your script there, too.
You know it, I hope?
Of course.
Great. So we can go without a net.
We'll take it from just after he locks her in.
The camera is the door.
You can play it straight at us.
Luc, ready to roll?
I'm ready.
Should I read his part?
That'd be good.
You hear him lock the door.
You go to make sure.
The door is indeed locked.
It's locked, you will never get out.
Sorry?
You will never get out.
What do you mean?
I mean you will die here.
Is this a joke?
Not for me.
For you neither, I'm afraid.
Look at the ceiling.
Do you see the light fitting?
It's an inlet for gas lighting.
See now why I asked if you had a lighter?
You could use it to blow us both up.
Okay, what do you want?
Nothing.
I have nothing against you.
Nothing at all.
I like you.
You just fell into my trap.
What do you mean,
I fell into your trap?
It means you're going to die.
I merely want to watch you die.
Please, stop now.
You've had your fun.
Now, let's forget all about it, okay?
I'm expected home.
I have no time for games.
Neither have I. Believe me.
Can you hear a whistling noise?
From the ceiling.
Soon, you'll be able to smell it.
Stop...
Stop, please.
Let me out! Please!
You're wasting our time.
What do I have to do?
Show me your true face.
What?
Your true face.
What do you mean?
What do you want?
I want to see your true face.
Not your lies nor your tricks.
A true expression.
What do I have to do?
Be spontaneous.
React to what's happening.
How?
Hello.
Beets. That's all there is.
They turned the apartment upside down.
We had a house full.
Everyone saw it.
The shame of it.
And your son?
He's a good boy.
He's never done any harm.
He's the eldest. He helps a lot.
He's a good boy.
I know...
They beat and shamed him.
May Allah punish them.
He did nothing wrong.
They had no choice but to let him go.
They had nothing on him.
I don't know who brought this upon him.
I cooked fÃ²yÃ² and took it to the homeless, but all my sacrifices are in vain.
I have no power.
You must protect him.
Do you have anything of his?
We must never forget where we come from and who we are.
We are not sons of slaves.
Your son is a proud, honest boy.
His heart is pure.
But he sees a lot of whites, as you know.
Someone disapproves and wants him to return.
Return where?
Home.
To the land of his ancestors.
That's ridiculous.
Who could possibly want that?
I have no idea.
It's the same one who bewitched Salimata and made her mute.
What have we done to him?
Salimata's illness is different...
While Lica and MÃ rioara delivered the calf,
Uncle Nelu gave instructions on his mobile from Rome: when to pull, how to cut the cord, rub the calf with straw...
It was their first time, you see?
Mobile phones are wonderful.
MÃ rioara's cousin, Georghe, has one.
He says that in some places you can call without paying because there's some kind of trick, see?
I wouldn't know.
You've never used a mobile?
Only when someone lent me one.
But when you called home?
- Granny!
- Yes?
When you used to call home?
I used a public call box.
Nicu, go see where he is.
Maria!
Cost half what Vasile brought back.
There must have been 350-400 people at the funeral.
From Cluj even.
He was an important man.
And they're self-important.
You'd rather they chuck the old man in a hole?
What if we did that to you?
It's true, Mama!
You must respect people's labor.
You don't work for people to gossip.
Same for Dumitru.
But Papa keeps harping on.
Do Nuta and Nicu like their father being abroad?
Not to mention me!
But you don't stop jabbering.
True enough.
Quiet now so Mama can look round in peace.
Nicu, give me that chocolate.
That's your third bar.
Give it to me!
How many were there?
I don't remember. He's okay.
Give me that!
It's beautiful.
Very good.
Where did the couch come from?
Ciocan gave it to Dumitru for helping out when he was home.
Lovely.
- Do you like it?
- Sure, it's fine.
Shame there's no chairs with it.
She has delusions of grandeur, but who knows if she'll need all that.
Don't listen to him.
Sorin's parents said they'd be better in his house, since ours won't be ready for the wedding.
Of course, his is bigger, better and lots more besides.
- You don't like this one?
- Yes I do!
- But Sorin doesn't?
- He does.
It's not finished, that's all.
Of course...
They want to make us feel grateful.
Sorin's mother says Nuta may be too young.
Women's tales.
His father gave me his word.
If they don't want the house,
Florica can have it.
Then, she might even find a man.
Shut up, Papa, you're drunk.
Hi, it's Georges.
Thanks. Can you put Jacky on?
Hello, my man.
I called from the airport but your line was busy.
Groggy, but I'm okay.
I'll be in tomorrow at 10.
How do the photos look?
Sorry?
Maybe 20 km from Drenica.
I wrote it on the roll.
She needs glasses.
Precisely!
When did he fly out?
Via Kabul?
Yeah, I heard it on the radio.
No, I was in Tirana at the time.
Anne's home. I'll call you back.
You know where to get me.
See you tomorrow.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, miss.
You okay?
I'm okay.
I hope the bath doesn't overflow.
Me, too.
Hello, you.
Does the heating work?
It was totally overhauled 4 years ago.
If you wish, I'll show you the boiler.
Now we come to what was the music room.
This way...
A superb room.
The paneling provides excellent acoustics.
Very pretty.
Strange lighting, though.
Why are there no windows?
They're walled up and concealed.
For the acoustics, I guess.
Hold on...
Can you hear the silence?
Quite amazing with all that traffic.
What's behind this door?
A hallway to the stairs.
The key was lost.
I'll have a copy cut.
No, thanks, I don't.
Unfortunately, I do.
Maybe you have a...?
Sorry, no.
Excuse me.
My briefcase is next door.
I'll get a light and be right back.
She's too head-on to camera.
The mark fell off during the pan...
Shot 16, take 4.
Action!
Almost 3,000 square meters.
2,800 to be precise.
The trees and hedges ensure total privacy.
So I see.
Shall we go on?
Everything is in excellent condition.
The windows, doors, wallpaper...
The floor's been varnished.
Does the heating work?
It was totally overhauled 4 years ago.
If you wish, I'll show you the boiler.
Now we come to what was the music room.
This way...
A superb room.
The paneling provides excellent acoustics.
Then, there's the inspector who begins to link the crimes and build a profile of the killer.
He's helped by his own personality being very similar to the realtor's.
What happens to you?
I can't tell you.
It'd spoil the surprise.
When's the film coming out?
No idea. We haven't finished shooting yet.
Christmas, I guess, or the New Year.
I've truly no idea.
There you are, sir.
Bones all gone.
Thank you, miss.
What service! Look and learn.
Are you back from a war zone?
How does it feel, civilization?
I feel an urge to do my expenses.
Seriously?
Seriously, it's not too bad.
It's all so obvious. At first.
Then, the crunch comes.
Meaning?
I don't know...
Over there, it's simple.
Here, life is complicated.
There, it's hard at first.
Then you get into the swing of it.
Did you bring your dentist's address?
Sure... You want it now?
No. So I don't forget.
It comes and goes.
It doesn't hurt now, but press and it's agony.
I know... I'll give you the address afterwards.
- Seen Martin yet?
- No.
He's in a terrible way.
It's almost moving.
What happened?
Julie hit him with it.
She took the kids and moved out.
I called all morning.
I only arrived 2 hours ago. Claudine...
He could get off except the captain had his passport on board.
To disembark for a month with his passport, he had to prove he had a job.
Ashore, he met a fellow Malian...
I booked a window table.
Mister Traore?
That's right, Amadou Traore.
I'll just check.
This is fine.
Let it go, we're here now.
If you want...
So?
So, what? Oh, right...
So the guy from Mali promises to find him a job.
They ask the captain to give back the passport once he's hired.
The captain agrees.
1 hour later, the Malian returns, panting as if he's run miles.
He says his boss will hire him, but needs his passport to confirm his particulars.
The captain hands it over, but tells my father to stay put as a guarantee.
Sorry, sir, your booking was for 7.30.
It's now 8.15.
The window tables are very popular...
It's 8.15 already?
Well, never mind.
Can we have the menu?
Coming right up.
Say, is that a watch?
Don't you like it?
So-so.
So, he had to stay on the boat?
Yes. The only way from his cabin to the gangplank, was past the captain's cabin, whose door was wide open so no one could leave unseen.
There was a bigger boat alongside.
Sorry.
It's not ours.
Isn't it?
If someone asks, it's behind the bar, okay?
What are you drinking?
- How about you?
- Don't know.
Our house cocktail is light and a real thirst-quencher.
Sound good?
- A cocktail and a Perrier.
- Fine.
So, what did he do?
He pulled on two pairs of pants, several shirts and sweaters and left the rest.
He climbed ashore via the other ship and got his passport back.
Cool!
My Dad can tell you stories like that for days on end.
Have you chosen?
One cocktail and a Perrier.
Found anything you like?
Not yet.
Take your time.
The kitchen closes at midnight.
That you have to photograph death and destruction so I know what war is?
Starving kids so I know what famine is?
What a dumb assumption!
Don't get worked up, it'll ruin your meal.
We won't see eye to eye, Francine.
For you, it's theory.
For me, real life.
But you can't say that in your photos.
True.
So, why do you do it?
Back on your favorite argument?
Why not?
If I can't attack my friends, who's left?
Me, darling. I'm your punchbag.
Look over by the wall.
The black kid who hassled Jean.
Don't let him see...
Hi there, Maria!
Mihai Popa! How are you doing?
Well. Very well.
So I see.
We do our best. And you?
I'm fine, too.
On your way home? Jump in.
Don't worry.
It's on my way.
You have a big, heavy bag.
- When did you get back?
- A few weeks ago.
- And you?
- Last week.
- How's Mirela?
- Very well.
She nannies for a couple, both doctors.
Where?
Dublin.
I look after the garden and everything else.
I'm only here for shearing.
You've landed on your feet.
You could say.
What about you? How was Paris?
Fine.
Find a job?
A good one. In a school.
Great! How long did you stay?
- 4 months.
- Is that all?
I missed the children.
And Dragos missed you, eh?
We're here.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Your house looks good.
- Is it finished?
- Nearly.
- When's the wedding?
- Spring.
Go on... Thanks again.
Are you going to Olteanu's wedding?
Ask Dragos.
If there's drink, he'll come.
It'll be good.
I hope so.
Say hello to Dragos.
And to Mirela in Dublin.
Hello, Nathalie, it's Anne... Anne Laurent.
Never mind. Can I speak to Georges?
Is he?
When will he be back?
Doesn't Jacky know either?
No, it doesn't matter.
Ask him to call me, will you?
Hello, Mrs. Becker.
Hello.
Did you write this?
No.
I didn't write anything.
Won't you read it, at least?
I don't have my glasses.
I didn't write anything.
I don't write notes like that.
Are you sure?
You would tell me, wouldn't you?
- I don't know what you want.
- Nothing.
I thought it was your writing.
I'm sorry.
So am I.
In the distance, far off, are lights, yellow lights, twinkling.
I see them through the walls.
Shapes coming toward the house.
I can't identify them.
They want to get in.
They bang and scrape on the walls and door.
Then the door bursts open...
I wake up and try to jump up, but I can't move.
No sound comes out.
I implore Allah to help me.
As I'm praying,
I hear loud laughter behind me.
Then, I screamed.
Youssuf woke and turned a light on.
I was hysterical, there was no one there who could've laughed.
That's when the migraines started?
When I get them,
I can't even move.
It's as if someone's driving a stake through my head.
What did the white doctor say?
He's just a friend of Amadou's, he gave me some pills.
"Dear Papa, I'm leaving.
Please, don't try to find me. Jean."
I have no idea!
It can't have been the kid.
She wouldn't sign it, "a defenseless child".
It's dumb!
A 10-year-old girl wouldn't write that.
It's an old person's writing.
It must be the neighbor, then.
So?
So, either you believe her or not.
It's as simple as that?
Not simple, inescapable.
If you do, call the cops.
If not, forget it.
- Or ask the kid's parents.
- Ask them what?
"Do you hit your child?
Torture her ever?
"Why is she always screaming?"
Tricky, eh?
Chablis or Sancerre?
I don't give a shit!
You don't care, do you?
I do, but you got the letter.
Not me.
- I can't decide for you.
- You could fucking help!
It's too easy just to wash your hands of it.
I never hear her crying.
I don't even know her.
I don't know her parents.
I met the old lady three times.
Not my problem!
Can you get that into your head?
It's never your problem.
When there's trouble, you're gone.
- Of course, you're right.
- Aren't I?
Why don't you grow up and stop letting others decide for you?
And you never run away?
Eh? What about your son?
Your needle's stuck!
What are you getting at?
What if I was expecting a child?
What are you saying?
I'm pregnant.
What if I was pregnant?
- Is this a joke?
- No, it's not a joke.
I aborted while you were away.
Did you?
You decide.
Is there a problem?
What is this?
Do you expect me to take you seriously?
No, I don't.
Have you ever made someone happy?
Tell me.
Is there a single person you have made happy?
No.
Didn't you want some rice?
Is that setting a good example?
What's Salimata going to think?
Later on, what will the children think?
Answer me.
- But there was a group of them.
- Nonsense!
- The teacher said...
- She can say what she wants.
You'd rather believe a white shrew than your own son?
The mother who told the teacher caught her son red-handed.
And the teacher said?
She raises him single-handed.
She can't cope.
I check his pockets every morning.
- I'm talking to my son.
- And I'm talking to you!
I won't be silenced because I'm sick.
What's the teacher say?
The woman caught her son smoking weed.
He gave 3 names, including Demba.
And as the only black kid, he's the guilty one.
Quiet!
He'll end up in jail, too.
Wash your mouth out!
Amadou is innocent.
Look how they all follow his example.
He hangs out with white girls instead of looking out for his brother.
As for your daughter, look at her, with her yellow crew cut!
Demba, answer me truthfully.
What have I done to you?
Be quiet!
I can't hear myself think.
Demba, I want to believe you, but if you lie to me, you'll regret it all your life!
Well?
It was FranÃ§ois.
He took my jacket in the school yard.
Who is FranÃ§ois?
He's the kid whose mother went to see the teacher.
He said he'd give my jacket back if I gave him 100 francs.
I said I didn't have that much, but he just laughed.
He threw my jacket down and trampled on it.
He said
I was lucky he didn't ask for 200 and if I didn't bring him 100 francs, the next day,
I wouldn't recognize my jacket.
He said I'd just have to steal the money from home.
He still has my jacket.
Meaning?
I didn't give him the cash.
That's why he was angry and fingered me.
Is that the truth?
If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches, follow me.
That gull Malvolio has come to court my lady in yellow stockings, cross-gartered most villainously!
I have dogged him like his murderer.
He obeys every point of the letter.
He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies.
You never saw such a thing.
I can hardly forbear hurling things at him.
I know my lady will strike him.
If she do, he'll smile and take it for a great favor.
Anyone out there?
To make a new life.
When's he coming back?
I've no idea.
I miss him.
I miss him, too. We all miss him.
He doesn't miss us.
He'll be sad all by himself.
He won't be all by himself.
There's his brother and all his family.
He'll take a new wife half my age.
Show some respect for your father!
Where is he going?
If he was here...
Very far.
What would you say if he was here?
Stop wanting to be so strong.
He'll be traveling a long time.
How?
First, by car.
Then, on a boat.
Then, by car again.
Will he ever come back?
Remember Uncle AkÃ©.
Did he come back?
Safi's still waiting...
Papa is old, you know.
It's his home.
Where?
Africa.
Where is Africa?
- When?
- 2 weeks on Monday.
Ion Fratila's wife is driving us to Halmeu, near the border.
- How many of you?
- 5 so far. You'll make it 6.
Anyone from the village?
Have a think about it.
It's a good opportunity.
Don't you think, Mama?
I'll have to talk to Dragos.
Of course.
- Do you want one?
- Thanks.
I can't see Papa saying no.
I said, I'll talk to Dragos.
Thought that he'd be married soon and so he'd have a house ready to live in.
It took us most of spring.
FranÃ§ois lent a hand despite him being so busy.
But no!
His lordship didn't like it.
How come FranÃ§ois called you?
He's concerned.
Why? About me?
He should mind his own business.
He wanted to help.
That's why he's doing all this?
Because of the bulls?
He should be happy.
He'll get more for his.
He needs all he can get.
Where's Jean now?
What are you asking me for?
I have no idea.
How would I know?
I'm too busy to run after him.
In any case, he's right, there's no future here.
At least, he won't have to get up at 5 a.m.
He can laze about all he likes.
What? Isn't it the truth?
Do you lot in the city get up at 5 a.m.?
You know. You blazed the trail for him.
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
It's okay.
The truth isn't like that.
Are you hungry?
No, thanks. Really.
Even after your drive?
Honestly, Papa, don't worry.
How are things? Acting going well?
I'm getting on fine.
I've just shot a thriller.
You must go and see it when it's released.
You'll have to write me with the title when it's finished.
Prettier every day.
Far too good for you.
The way you're going, next time I won't recognize you.
It'll be called The Collector...
Probably.
What are you going to do?
About what?
"About what"?
- About looking for Jean?
- Nothing!
It's been 6 weeks.
He should know where he belongs.
He'll come back when he wants or...
Or what?
Or...
Excuse me.
I left the pump running out there.
I feel sorry for him.
That won't help him.
What are you going to do?
And no noise! Understand?
No speak!
If they find you, finito l'amore!
Get it?
Okay, boss. No worry.
We understand, boss.
Do business in box, okay?
Nothing dirty up there.
They smell you, it's like they hear you!
Get it?
Yes, boss.
In Paris, wait for me to open up.
Don't get excited.
Wait till we get to depot.
Of course, boss. We wait.
Thank you.
That's all. Have a nice trip.
Believe that little FranÃ§oise has already entered Your kingdom.
In Your goodness, grant us that we might one day share with her in eternal life.
Through Jesus Christ, Amen.
The second day, on the road from Ghurian to Herat.
They separated us.
I was left in a totally dark room.
A Taliban fighter appeared every 2 hours,
silhouetted in the doorway, pointing at me.
"You French," he'd say,
before miming cutting his throat.
Absolutely charming.
After 2 days, the guy was replaced.
A new guard turned up.
He had a flashlight
and asked in perfect English...
I felt so relieved.
I told him my story:
photographer, big misunderstanding, etc...
He listened and said...
I thought he seemed reassuring, so I told it again,
slowly and more clearly.
First time round,
I'd garbled half of it.
When I'd finished, he looked at me and said...
It was all he could say, but he didn't even know what it meant.
In the end, Phil got us out
by using his contacts at CNN.
You can mention it to Francine.
It'll make her laugh.
In my cell, I thought about what she said.
Don't tell her, she'll be even more unbearable.
It's easy to talk about
"ecology of the image"
and "value of the non-transmitted message".
What matters is the end result.
I guess she finds it all too bothersome.
After all, she could be right.
How would knowing help her?
I don't think I'm fit for life in peace.
What you call "peace" at least.
4 days in Kabul now, waiting for something to happen.
People are polite but wary.
I can hardly blame them...
Excellent! Did your husband make it?
Yes.
You can tell.
It's nothing like that gutrot.
Here, son.
Where's Lenutza?
Lenutza left 2 weeks ago to meet her sister in Italy and work picking grapes.
She went with a big group.
Who has her card?
I've no idea.
Who has Lenutza's card?
What?
Who bought Lenutza's yellow card?
That new girl from Aliceni maybe. Mirela.
That's right. Mirela...
A few days before Lenutza left,
4 people from Aliceni arrived.
One of them bought her card.
What are you so upset about?
- Are you homesick?
- No!
I wanted to sell newspapers.
What do you mean?
Before I left, I called Lenutza.
She promised me her license to sell papers.
She wanted to go home.
Can't you just apply?
I was deported a few months ago.
You'll find something.
Of course...
Sure I will.
One day, in Certeze,
I gave some money to a gypsy beggar.
She was so dirty,
I ran to wash my hands, to avoid catching a disease.
She simply disgusted me.
So?
Last winter, on Boulevard St. Germain, a well-dressed man was about to give me 20 francs...
But when he saw my outstretched hand, he threw the bill into my lap as if I nauseated him.
I rushed back here and hid myself in the attic.
I cried my eyes out all day.
It was so embarrassing.
Do you see?
You can't take it.
You don't measure up.
- Say what?
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
- But I really love you.
- Really truly?
- Really truly.
True true?
True true.
Pierrot!
Don't move!
Wait! Don't move.
What do you think you were doing?
Can't you see it's dangerous?
But there's a balloon!
If you do that again, you'll get your first ever smack!
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Dad.
I feel sick.
Get out of here.
I can't let you out of my sight.
We have to move.
What?
I can't live on the 20th floor always worrying he'll fall.
Let's stop there.
And start where?
From the top, of course.
Really?
Just winding you up.
No, the shot after all the gurgling, when you say: "I love you, too..."
Why bother? It was fine.
Except for the plane.
What plane?
You can hear a plane fly over.
Okay, kids, let's do it!
I love you, too.
Sorry. Let's try again.
Okay, here we go!
I love you, too.
Okay, calm down.
Can we just calm down?
We've lots to get through.
I'm sorry.
Down to business.
Recess is now ended.
Let's try to act grown up and get some work done.
Is it so hard to tell him
"I love you"?
No, not really.
Thank you.
Here, for you.
Thank you. Beautiful car, sir.
Excuse me, aren't you a top model?
Honestly, with your looks, you just have to be in that line.
I'm in the biz, too.
Wouldn't guess, eh?
You wouldn't, would you?
I was at the gym.
So, miss...
Don't talk to commoners?
Didn't offend you, did I?
I wonder if you're one of these rich, beautiful people from high society.
No?
A shy little typist, then?
Waiting for Prince Charming to race up in his Ferrari.
Is that it?
I don't get it.
How can you be so beautiful yet so arrogant?
That's not very nice!
What am I going to do by myself in the big, bad city?
Tell me that.
What do you say?
Isn't that a cheap trick?
Maybe I'm not good enough for her.
For the lady to be in the subway with the tramps, there must be a reason.
It's the chauffeur's day off.
Yeah, that must be it.
What about you, ma'am?
What do you think?
Nothing? Is that so?
Shame! She doesn't think.
Now what will you do?
Stand me up again?
Hop off into the next car?
It's too easy...
Why? Do I smell?
Is that it?
I'm just a little Arab looking for a little affection.
Like everyone else.
Nothing doing?
Never mind.
You crazy jerk!
Who's a jerk?
Shame on you!
I'll see you around.
Don't worry.
Thank you.

Tension that had been brewing for months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...
...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu orchestrated a swift and violent coup...
...against the democratically elected government of President Samuel Azuka.
In the land with 1 20 million people and over 250 ethnic groups...
... there'd been a long history of ethnic enmity...
...particularly between northern Fulani
Moslems and southern Christian Ibo.
The victorious Fulani rebels have tak en to the streets...
...as outbursts of violence continue all over the country.
Thousands have been killed in the fighting or executed thereafter.
Fearing ethnic cleansing, most Ibo have abandoned their homes...
...and are fleeing the city or searching for sanctuary wherever they may find it.
Gen. Yakubu has tak en control of most of the country...
...and appears firmly in charge.
There's no word on the United Nations' reaction to the coup...
...but United States forces have already begun to evacuate its embassy.
As you can see behind me, on the USS Harry S. Truman...
...activity is high as foreign nationals are evacuated from all over Nigeria.
This once peaceful country...
...has been rocked by a series of ethnic unrests and brief but bitter battles...
...mainly over control of Nigeria's vast oil supply.
However, nothing can prepare the country...
...for the overwhelming and decisive action that has just taken place.
We have just heard that the entire presidential family...
...has been assassinated. l repeat:
The entire presidential family has been assassinated.
-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.
-Thank you.
Let me take those for you.
He got one in the leg!
Put him in the sickbay now!
Well, look at you.
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.
We appreciate you've been humping out there, but we have to put you back in.
Priority tasking. We need to extract a critical personality ASAP.
Now get some chow, refit for a three-day LLRP.
See you in chow to debrief.
You...
-...go see the medic.
-Aye, captain.
Attention on deck.
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.
Everybody get chow?
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.
Now, intel estimates
5000 Yakubu troops...
...scattered throughout this sector.
They've captured government armories...
...and unfortunately, we have been supplying them for far too many years. ln addition, the local militia are killing anyone who goes to a different church.
All right, now, your prime objective is to find and extract...
...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with lnternational Relief Services.
Dr. Kendricks is an American by marriage.
Her late husband was Dr. John Kendricks.
Your secondary objective...
...is to extract two nuns and a priest who run a feel-good near Yolingo...
...if they so choose to leave.
St. Michael's Mission, right here.
You will halo over Cameroon...
...and float into your DZ near the edge of the Mazon Rain Forest.
When you get your package...
...you will proceed to your extract LZ Alpha.
Our presence on the ground will be considered hostile.
-Questions?
-Sir...
...rules of engagement?
You will defend yourselves if you're fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion plan?
Patrol the Cameroon border through the Tandjile Pass.
Anything else, gentlemen?
All right.
Dismissed.
Gentlemen, three minutes out. lt's okay. lt's okay.
You speak English?
You speak English?
Good. Good. l'm not gonna hurt you.
Are there any soldiers here?
Any rebel soldiers?
You sure? You sure?
Good. Good. Can you take me to Dr. Lena Kendricks?
Do you know who she is?
Okay, here we go.
Nice and easy. Come on.
Zee, we're moving. lt's all right. l'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
Open.
Clear.
Lasana, where's that wa--?
These American men are here to see you! l'm Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy. l'm here to get you and your people out.
We're in the middle of surgery here.
Ma'am, you don't realize what's about to happen here.
Are you a nun?
Are you one of the nuns?
-Are you a nun, ma'am?
-Yes, sir.
Good. Pack your things and let's get out of here now.
-Lieutenant!
-Ma'am.
Get those weapons out of my operating room.
You're frightening my staff. l'll be with you when l'm done.
Now please wait outside!
Your staff should be frightened, ma'am.
Do you know what'll happen to you and these women when rebels get here?
Doc, maybe you can help her out.
Ma'am, may l assist?
-Are you a doctor?
-No, l'm a corpsman, ma'am.
-Can you stitch?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, he's sure.
Then close for me.
We're taking our good old time here.
All right, Lt. Waters, l'm all yours.
Hurry up, Doc. l assume you have a plan to get us all out of here?
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.
We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make to rendezvous to the helicopter.
Get your things together, but pack light.
Zee, bring your perimeter up.
Keep Flea in place.
We spotted a rebel company outside of Yolingo on the way in.
We must assume they'll be here by night, if not sooner. l'm responsible for 7 0 people here, more than half of them seriously wounded.
My orders are to evacuate foreign nationals only, ma'am.
What does that mean? l mean nonindigenous personnel, ma'am.
Then we have a problem. l will not leave without the indigenous personnel.
We're here to get you out.
Now, l suggest you go find the priest...
...go find the nuns, pack your things and prepare to move.
When the rebel troops get here, they'll kill everything they see...
...including privileged white doctors.
-What part of that plan don't you get?
-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!
-You could fly them out in 30 minutes!
-Can't do that.
-Why not?
-Because my orders are very clear:
Evacuate the priest, you and the two nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.
We can take those who can walk.
They're not my responsibility.
You are my responsibility.
You're right, lieutenant...
...it's not your problem. lt is my responsibility...
...and l will not leave without my people.
All right, give me a minute.
-A minute?
-That's right.
Sixty seconds. l suggest you use that time to go find the priest.
Get Command on the horn.
Eagle One to Command.
-Lena, what's going on?
-l don't know yet.
Eagle One to Command.
Eagle One.
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.
No, we got her.
But she wants to bring the 7 0 people here along with her.
Yes, sir, l understand. l will handle it.
Eagle One, out.
Dr. Kendricks.
You win. Get your people together.
We leave in a half an hour.
There will be helicopters for them too?
Yes. We can only take those who can move under their own power. l understand.
Thank you, lieutenant.
Hurry, please.
Why don't we just get Doc to tranq her the fuck out?
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging and kidnapping an American doctor. l ain't sure this bitch is American.
The doctor is the mission, Red.
Stick with her.
-And we're taking all these people out?
-Go on.
We need everyone able to travel ready to go.
We must leave quickly.
Quickly!
God will bless you, Lena.
-What did the captain say?
-What the fuck you think he said?
Okay, let's clear these hooches.
Come here, you guys. lt's okay. lt's okay. Come on.
Hour and a half off the rendezvous with the bird.
-Can only bring what they carry by back.
-Roger that.
-Where's that priest?
-He says he ain't coming.
Bless you, Lena.
Thank you for everything.
Don't cry, Sister, please.
We'll see each other again.
Take care of yourself.
-You got it, Lake?
-Hundred percent, sir.
All right. Let's go.
Take us out of here, but don't run away from us.
Roger that.
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.
Come on.
Keep them moving, Slo.
Get her out of there.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on, let's go.
-Come on, now.
-Catch up!
Sister Grace.
-The mother?
-She is dead.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
What am l going to do with this child?
Lena.
Lena, you'll have to take this child. lt's the only chance she has.
We gotta move quicker than this.
We gotta get back for the Falcon game.
Come on.
Take care of yourself, girl.
Sister Siobhan.
Mind yourself.
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.
Let's go now. l'm not going.
Sister!
-L.T., she doesn't want to leave.
-l'm not going.
What?
Good luck.
-God bless you.
-Thanks be to God.
All right, let's make it quick.
Come on, ma'am, let's go.
Come on. We have plenty of work to do now. Come on.
Take care.
Go with God.
-God already left Africa.
-Yeah.
Go easy, doc. Watch your step. l got her.
We're only five klicks in. lt's seven and a half miles to LZ Alpha.
We go any slower, we'll start going backwards in time.
-Red, what do you got back there?
-Five stragglers.
-30 meters and falling from main body.
-All right, roll them up ASAP.
Let's go.
Come on. You've gotta speed up.
Ma'am, speed up.
You too. You--
Watch those trees. l'm gonna help you. lt's all right. l'll tell them.
We got you.
Lieutenant.
We need to stop.
-Lieutenant!
-l heard you.
We can't stop.
Behind schedule. Come on.
These people need to rest.
And we have a child who needs medication.
Here we go.
There you go, ma'am.
Let's go.
Let's go, doctor.
Come on, sir. Here we go.
What you want to do?
Rest for 30.
Lake, hold it up.
We're gonna rest for 30.
Set a perimeter.
Perimeter up.
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.
L.T., we got guerrilla rebels inbound...
... on our path.
Dr. Kendricks, come with me right away. Come here.
There's danger on the trail. You must do everything you can to-- Listen to me!
You must do everything you can to keep that baby quiet, you understand me?
Whatever it takes. Go now.
Get up. Get up.
Danger close.
Go.
Clear.
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.
Danger close.
Go on, ma'am. Go.
Now is good. Go!
Lake, lead us out before they realize their tailgunner's gone.
And find us a safe place to rest.
Wait! They're going to the mission.
You have to stop them. l can't do that. lt'd risk the safety of all these people here.
-Besides, they may bypass the mission.
-You know they won't.
There are a lot of possible scenarios that could happen, Dr. Kendricks. l don't presume to know them all. Red?
Dr. Kendricks.
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.
Come on.
Can't you sleep, lieutenant? lt's my watch, ma'am.
You can call me Lena.
Dr. Kendricks, l suggest you get some rest.
You know....
Thank you for saving my life. lt wasn't about saving your life. lt's about getting the job done.
Completing the mission, that's all.
My dear...
...a thousand difficulties don't make a doubt.
-But l'm not a good Catholic.
-You don't know that. Only God knows.
Gentlemen.
Please.
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here.
There are only sick people here.
Please, sir.
-Gentlemen, please.
-No! No!
No! Please! Please!
-No!
-No!
Commander, please.
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here. We have hope. We have only sick people here.
We have only sick people here.
Please.
No, commander.
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.
Holy Mary, mother of God...
...pray for us sinners now at the hour of our death.
Commander, no!
-Blessed....

Holy Mary, mother of God....
What the fuck was that?
Hyena.
Flea, Lake, status?

Let's go now! Come on! You're first!
Let's go!
Goddamn it, let's go! We're late.

You gotta move faster!

-Keep your head down!
Stand back.
-Where is she going?
-Wait! Back!
Keep your head down!
-Let us go!

-Wait! Get back!
-Dr. Lena!
Answer me! You never planned on taking all of us out, did you? l simply follow orders! My orders are to get you out! Get on the helicopter!
-What about my people?!
-l'm not here for them.
You lied to me!
You lied to me!
Liar! Bastard!
Lena! Let me go!
What about my people?! l won't leave them!
You lied to me!
-They're gonna die!
-Secure the doctor.
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!
Who decides for me?! You?!
Your government?!
Bastard! l won't leave them!
Let's go! Let's go now!
Let's go!
Let's go! Go! Let's go!
Lena! Lena!
Listen to me!
Listen to me! lt's okay.
Let's go!
Lt. Waters. Starboard side.
We saw this on the way in.
No!
No!
No!
-Doc!
-No!
Come on.
Let's turn it around.
Musa.
Patience!
Lena!
We can only take 1 2 people.
Old, young, anybody who'll slow us down.
We'll meet up again in Cameroon.
Go. And tell the others.
-God will bless you.
-Hurry, please.
Thank you.
Hurry, please.
Red!
Go with the package.
Now, goddamn it!

We gotta go. We gotta go.
Let's go! Let's go. Come on!
Get her out of there!
Get off!
-Patience! She'll be safe.
-She's my baby!
Keep your head down.
She has no one to care for her.
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!
Hold her tight!
-Keep your heads down!
-No more packs, sir. We're maxed out.
See you in Cameroon.
Come on. Let's go.
Here we go. Stay low.
Head down.
Let's go.
Sergeant! Let's go!
Eagle One, over.
Can you wait one, sir?
A.K.
Command.
Yes, sir?
Lieutenant, why is that bird full of refugees and not your criticals?
The doctor wouldn't leave her people.
You can't get a woman on a helo?
She was on the bird.
-It's difficult to explain, sir.
-Oh, come on.
We're marching them to LZ Bravo.
Request helicopters to take them out.
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.
Come on, give me three choppers. l'll have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.
Negative!
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've stopped entering Nigerian airspace.
We'll give you what help we can from our end, but right now...
...you are on your own.
Man, l hope you know what you're doing.
Me too, sir.
All right. We'll keep you advised if the situation changes.
Negative on the evac.
Come on. There you go. Come on.
Hang on to the knot, doctor.
-Come on.
-We got you.
Come on. Come on, doc.
Americans.
Some went in the helicopter.
Some went up the mountain...
...to Cameroon.
Slo.
Give me your chow, man. l don't like roast beef anyway.
We're a little over 30 klicks to the path to Cameroon.
Roger that.
What do you got?
We got a large body 1 0 klicks back, bearing 3-6-0 and closing.
How strong?
Thirty, maybe platoon strength, maybe more.
Rebels?
Could be.
Why would anybody be following us? l don't know.
But we're gonna find out.
Good job.
-Keep an eye on them.
-Roger that.
-Sir?
-We got a problem.
We got possible hostiles on our 6.
Get them up, get them ready to move.
Roger that.
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me, please?
Thank you. lt'll just take a second.
-Do you know why anybody'd follow us?
-No, l don't.
You sure?
Yes, l'm sure.
-Think hard.
-l told you, l don't know.
Get your people ready to go now.
These people have been going for over 30 hours.
Come on.
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.
How you doing?
The fuck you mean, how am l doing?
You know what l'm talking about.
You know as well as l do...
...that when we left that mission, those people were dead.
And then we take 28 men, women and children...
...and we hump for a day.
Zee, keep them moving.
Be with you in a second.
We get them to the LZ, and we leave them behind to die like the others. l'm confused.
And the boys are confused.
Get to the point.
Why'd you turn that bird around, L.T.?
Talk to me. l'm with you either way.
You know that.
When l figure it out, l'll let you know.
This way.
-L.T.
-Go, Lake.
You're gonna want to come tak e a look at this.
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.
We'll rest here for a minute. Stay down in these trees. Listen to my men. Go!
Slo.
Stay down. Stay down.
Zee, Flea, with me.
What do you got?
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.
How strong? l counted seven so far, sir.
-Flea, get eyes on.
-Roger that.
There could be more in the hooches.
Bring them up.
Sir, we could go around them to the north.
L.T.
Rules of engagement.
We're already engaged.
Hand me the binoculars.
Flea, you got the Zippo?
Roger that.
Zippo first.
Red Team, right flank. This way.
Edge of clearing. Wait for my go.
Silent and quick.
Gold Team, on me.
Silk, close up that back door.
-Flea, keep your eye on the package.
-Roger that.
Holding.
Let's go.
On-site.
Goddamn.
Been going at it all day.
-On-site.
-Roger that.
Go! lt's okay. l'm here to help you. l'll help you. lt's okay.
Atkins!

Go! Run! Get out of here!
-Doc, get them out of here!
-Move!
Go! Go!
Hold on. You hold on.
Come on, little man, come on.
Boss, you want me to take a look at that? l'm all right. lt's a kid. lt's only a fucking kid.
Motherfucker. Get the fuck up.
Look at your work, motherfucker.
Lake.
Doc, get over here.
Red.
Her baby's dead.
Zee.
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.
May her soul and the souls of all the dead rest in peace.
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.
May her soul and the souls of all the dead rest in peace.
She has a low pulse.
How can they do this?
This is what they do.
They cut off the breasts of nursing mothers...
...so that they'll never again feed their own babies.
This is what they do.
Doc. l need morphine.
Dr. Kendricks.
Dr. Kendricks. lt's all right.
-ls something wrong?
-Let me take care of your arm.
All right.
Careful.
Try this. lt will help you stay awake.
What is it?
Cola nut from the tree. lt's harmless.
We've been using them for generations.
Patience, right?
How long you been at the mission? l live there. l've been living there since l was 1 0.
How come? l heard they were helping children who had been forced into the war...
...so l ran to them.
Will you get me to my daughter?
Yes, ma'am.
How'd you end up here in Africa? l came here with my husband.
We wanted to help.
We went to Sierra Leone.
They were short of doctors there.
Cut.
How did your husband die?
We were at the hospital.
The rebels came.
My husband tried to stop them, to protect me...
...but he couldn't. l'm sorry.
You did a good thing today. l don't know if it was a good thing or not.
Feels like so long since l've done...
...a good thing, the right thing.
You should have some rest.
Thank you for taking care of my arm.
Easy, boss.
-Are we there yet?
-Glad to see you still got it...
...but we got trouble.
You all right?
What do you got?
This is the outfit that's been on our tail.
-Hey. You with me, boss?
-Yeah.
-This is at 2200 hours.
-Yeah.
Four hours ago.
Three hours.
We figured they'd make camp and come at us after first light, right?
Bad call.
Two hours ago.
One.
These guys run the damned Olympics.
They've been closing in on us all night.
How long we got?
An hour, two tops.
We shouldn't have stopped.
How the fuck are they tracking us at night?
Someone's transmitting something.
Zee.
We got a rat in the nest.
Get them up.
Take their weapons away.
We search everybody right now.
-Okay, team.
-Dr. Kendricks.
-Turn two.
-Lena. Get up.
Everybody, up.
Point out everybody that came into the mission in the last three days.
-Right now.
-Let's see the weapons.
Give me your weapons.
-Gideon.
-Let's go. Step forward, sir.
Who else?
Who else?!
These people.
-Step forward, you two, right now.
-On your knees.
L.T.!
Down! Now!
Silk.
No!
-Hey! What the hell are you doing?
-He's my friend!
You know what?
He could also be armed.
Get back there with the others!
Go on!
-Watch his hands.
-Fuck.
Shit.
What the hell is that?
What do you got?
He's bugged.
You fuck!
-Stop it!
-Who told you to do this?
-They have my family.
-Who told you to do it?!
-They have my family.
-Who has your family?! l was promised no harm will come to them.
-Who told you to do it?!
-Stop it!
-Who told you to do it?!
-Col. Sadick.
Col. Sadick. l am one of many who give him information.
About who? lnformation about who?!
We have to follow....
Who?! Who?!
We have to follow....
-Follow who?!
-Arthur.
Arthur? l am not a killer.
The fuck you're not.
-What do you wanna do with him?
-Let him bleed out.
Why?
What is going to happen to my family? l don't know.
-Help them.
-Zee. Lake.
-Get them up.
-Everybody up. Now.
Who knows what this is?
This is a transmitter. l took this off Gideon's dead body...
...Dr. Kendricks' good friend.
You have any more of these here?
Why would anybody wanna transmit our position?
Transmit our position to over 300 Nigerian soldiers...
...who ran all night...
...to get to within an hour and a half of where we are now?
Red.
Somebody's gonna tell me.
Somebody's gonna start talking right now.
Because if they don't tell me what l want to know...
...by the time l count to five...
...l'm gonna kill someone else.
One.
Two.
Three.
Don't fuck with me.
-Four.
-Please.
Please.
There's no need for this.
Please.
Now you got something to say to me, don't you?
My name is Arthur Azuka. l'm the only son of President Samuel Azuka.
Please don't blame them.
Please. l'm sorry to have misled you...
...but there are enemies looking for me everywhere.
That is why you're being pursued.
Our report said the entire presidential family was executed.
Your reports were incorrect.
They were not executed.
They murdered my father...
...along with my mother...
...and my two...
...younger sisters...
...out of greed...
...and my father's fight for democracy for his people.
My people.
When it first appeared there might be trouble...
...my father sent me away with this man.
Col. Okeze.
Lieutenant, his father was more than the president.
He was the tribal king.
That makes him the heir to the lbo nation. lt's a bloodline they must cut.
The Fulanis will comb heaven and earth to find him.
You knew about this?
You knew all the time, and you didn't tell me. l didn't trust you...
...at the time. l wonder what it takes to earn your trust.
Red, Lake.
Tell them to pack their things.
We're leaving.
Men, give them their weapons.
We're moving out of here.
-Pack up your things.
-Come on.
Move it out!
-Get in, get out. Okay?
-Come on.
Move it. Move it.
-Come on. See you. Hurry back.
-Back in formation.
They must continue their route to the Tandjile Pass or they'll lose a day.
So they must come out here, near the Cameroon border.
No!
How many men do you have in Gashanka?
Right on time.
Good hustle, Red.
Come on up and brief Zee.
This river will get us straight into Cameroon.
They'll be expecting us.
What do you think? l think we're fucked either way we go.
We backtrack, cross downstream...
...come up, go through the jungle and rip right into Cameroon.
Roger that. Let the other men know.
-Yes, sir.
-Good job.
L.T.
-What do you got?
-Rhodes on the phone.
Yes, sir, captain, this is Waters. lntel reports military elements in your sector...
...conducting search and destroy of a U.S. military unit...
...moving with Arthur Azuka, son of the late president. What can you tell me?
Yes, sir, we just discovered that ourselves.
He and his bodyguard hid themselves within Dr. Kendricks' refugee party.
That's a major problem, lieutenant.
He inv olves your mission in the internal politics of a foreign nation...
...affecting U.S. diplomacy and seriously increases the mission's risk.
He's considered a criminal by the new regime.
He's a major liability.
-What exactly does that mean, sir?
-His party is excess cargo.
You mean he's not human, sir?
Captain, this man is the lbo tribal leader. Do you know what that means?
Cut the shit. Who do you think l am?
Sir, we both know what'll happen to him if l leave him out here.
There won't be a trial or a jury.
Outside the courthouse, they'll put two in his head. l'm just asking for a little help here.
Put yourself in my shoes, Bill. l've been in your shoes, lieutenant.
Send in an air evac immediately and get all of us out of here, sir.
Negative on air support at this time.
Airspace is too hot.
Your judgment has risk ed the lives of your men and the mission's success. l advise you, complete the evacuation as planned! Do you read me?!
Yes, sir, l read you. Loud and clear.
But l cannot, in good conscience, do that without taking these people to safety.
That's not your mission!
When have l not completed a mission?
My team will complete this mission. l give you my word on that. l don't like this.
Get your ass back here alive soon as possible.
Maintain contact with OP center. l'll direct air support as soon as l can.
I promise you.
Yes, sir.
Eagle One, out.
Bring them up.
Everybody up on L.T. now. Double time.
So much for diplomacy.
Come on, let's go.
Here's the deal. lt's been strongly suggested that we turn over Arthur...
...and abandon these refugees out here in the bush. l'll tell you right now l'm not gonna do that. l can't do that. l broke my own rule. l started to give a fuck...
...and brought you guys along with me.
We're about to walk into some serious shit. Before we do, l'd just like...
...to hear what you guys have to say about it. That's all. Speak freely. ln my opinion, sir...
...we cut our losses.
This isn't our fucking war.
As far as me being in or out...
...you know the answer to that.
Let's get these people to safety.
Let's finish the job. l can't leave them, sir. l'm good to go.
What about you, Red? l can't look at them like packages anymore. l'm gonna get them out...
...or l'm going to die trying.
Are we there yet?
Thanks, fellas.
Strip those packs down to rolling gear only.
Have the refugees drop anything that don't go '' boom.'' Let's move.
Double time. Let's go. Hustle.
L.T...
...those Africans are my people too.
For all the years that we were told to stand down and to stand by...
...you're doing the right thing.
For our sins.
Hooyah.
Hooyah.
We gotta go.
Let's go.
Lieutenant. l'm sorry l didn't tell you about Arthur. l should have trusted you. lt's not your fault. l would've done the same thing if l was in your position. l wouldn't have trusted me either. l'm gonna get your people to Cameroon. l promise.
Come on. We gotta hurry.
L.T., hold one.
Hold one.
What do you got, Lake?
Everybody down.

Don't worry about it.
-Did you get that little son of a bitch?
-We got some of him.
-You see anybody else?
-Sorry.

{3214}{3272}. . .because of the defiance of|one person.
{3277}{3312}You must forget about him.
{3317}{3399}He was a wild spirit and this was|always to be his fate.
{3404}{3470}You talk as if he's already dead
{3628}{3708}Even if he does survive this time,|he's a greener. . .
{3713}{3773}. . .so set your sights elsewhere|for a husband.
{3778}{3838}I'll never set my sights elsewhere.
{4662}{4732}-This is all the medicine I could find.|-I'm sorry.
{4742}{4806}The gods took your father|in the night.
{5402}{5496}As long as we stay here, there'll|never be enough to eat. Never.
{5513}{5601}There may be other places|we could live where food is plentiful.
{5606}{5688}All it takes is one demon to follow|you back from the forbidden land.
{5693}{5732}Then we'd all be struck down.
{5738}{5773}Have you ever seen one?
{5778}{5809}Have you?
{5814}{5861}Has anyone here ever seen one?
{5872}{5896}A demon?
{5906}{5934}A monster!
{5939}{5968}A beast!
{6056}{6090}The stories are true.
{6120}{6157}The gods used to live here.
{6179}{6265}They watched over and protected man,|but man grew selfish. . .
{6270}{6321}. . .and cruel. So the gods left. . .
{6326}{6386}. . .allowing the demons|to descend from the sky.
{6516}{6604}As survivors, we must dedicate|our lives to pleasing the gods. . .
{6610}{6700}. . .so that one day they will come back|and drive away the demons.
{6718}{6793}That is our fate.
{6844}{6892}Only if you believe in fate.
{7454}{7492}I'm sorry. I can't take you.
{7497}{7545}I can't handle myself|as well as a man?
{7550}{7596}-No.|-You arrogant greener.
{7601}{7670}You can handle yourself|better than most men. . .
{7675}{7737}. . .which is why you need|to help the village.
{7866}{7948}Your mother gave this to me|before she died.
{7954}{8008}She hoped it'd be passed|to your children.
{8108}{8137}It's for good luck.
{8354}{8411}Don't let anything happen|to you out there.
{9455}{9475}Easy!
{9623}{9644}Easy!
{10288}{10339}So you're the beast|we're all afraid of.
{10972}{11011}Not a lot of meat on a dragon.
{11196}{11243}You have been fortunate in the hunt.
{11248}{11299}I hope you thanked the gods.
{11331}{11399}-A nonbeliever.|-I believe what I can see.
{11452}{11526}A nonbeliever, huh?|You from the caves?
{11531}{11592}Probably never seen a god.|Would you like to?
{11597}{11679}-What do you know about gods?|-We've seen gods. Rock and l.
{11685}{11722}You lying thieves.
{11823}{11849}Wait a minute.
{11875}{11915}Wait a minute, we're hunting.
{11920}{11970}No time to show you gods with no food.
{11975}{12060}We need food. We must hunt.|Nonbeliever.
{12147}{12172}Wait.
{12388}{12433}First you show me the god.
{12454}{12489}Then we eat.
{12678}{12703}Look.
{12719}{12760}Frozen ones.
{12765}{12851}The way to the great god village|is marked by these frozen ones.
{12869}{12954}When the gods left this world,|they ordered man not to look at them.
{12962}{13054}Those that disobeyed were|frozen in place for all of eternity.
{13060}{13133}When the gods lived here|they could fly through the air.
{13153}{13246}They'd drive chariots in front|of special caves with golden arches.
{13259}{13283}Golden.
{13288}{13350}And the food would magically appear.
{13355}{13381}Magic.
{13387}{13415}Here!
{13440}{13542}The gods weren't allowed to fall|in love with mortal women.
{13552}{13590}This one did. . .
{13595}{13667}. . .and was left behind,|frozen as punishment.
{13770}{13803}Are you sure this was a god?
{13809}{13868}I thought you said you believe|what you can see.
{14143}{14170}If you need proof. . .
{14175}{14267}. . .when the sun goes down, you can see|the rest of the gods in the sky.
{14276}{14317}They're the bright lights.
{14371}{14443}The evil beasts hunt in the dark.|We need to find shelter.
{14448}{14495}There's a cave over here.
{14627}{14721}Look at those poor bastards.|They really angered the gods.
{14728}{14754}Carlo.
{14771}{14802}Let's eat.
{15161}{15199}Go. Go.
{15576}{15603}What's a "greener"?
{15609}{15660}The grass is greener|on the other side.
{15678}{15764}Always looking for something better,|something out there.
{15769}{15799}Maybe she was right.
{15923}{15955}God stone.
{15991}{16018}Sharp.
{16052}{16100}No, you keep it. You keep it.
{16116}{16199}Where we're from, a good woman|is a hard thing to find.
{16204}{16285}So if you were stupid enough|to leave a good woman behind. . .
{16290}{16379}. . .why don't you tell me where she is|so I can go get her for myself?
{16384}{16408}No!
{17421}{17479}Forget about me.|Get out of here. I can't move!
{17808}{17831}No!
{17936}{17972}Oh, heavenly gods!
{21840}{21885}Don't breathe the air!
{21898}{21922}It's poison!
{22048}{22090}My chest is on fire!
{22316}{22368}It helps you breathe. Take it!
{22373}{22404}I can't!
{22506}{22548}Get off my brother.
{24196}{24239}-What's he saying?|-Don't know.
{26297}{26336}Who's responsible for allowing|him to run around?
{26342}{26362}He shot the wrangler.
{26468}{26561}I'm a little pressed for time.|Save the going-away jokes for later.
{26566}{26613}No joke, sir. I swear.
{26618}{26678}The man-animal|got ahold of this gun.
{26695}{26720}Really?
{26751}{26780}Show me.
{26804}{26824}Sir?
{26932}{26959}Reach for the gun.
{26964}{27005}But, sir, I might get shot.
{27011}{27091}Sure, you might. And I might|suddenly grow a third arm!
{27096}{27128}But it shot the wrangler.
{27134}{27206}Any report filed today|still has my name on it. . .
{27212}{27301}. . .and you are out of your skull-bone|if you think I'm going to write. . .
{27306}{27389}. . . "shot by a man-animal" as the|cause of death unless I see it!
{27394}{27452}If I obey your command,|I may get killed.
{27457}{27522}If you don't, it's a certainty|you will be killed.
{27547}{27574}Reach for the gun.
{27853}{27913}Well, I'll be damned.
{29892}{29961}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30016}{30063}Teleportation sequence activated.
{30622}{30677}It is a pleasure to see you,|Your Excellency.
{30682}{30762}I would be honored to expedite|your clearance through security.
{30767}{30849}Please, call me Zete.|Does all of Earth look like this?
{30854}{30904}I'm afraid so, sir.
{30919}{31024}Pathetic. All the green|and the blue sky.
{31031}{31120}They told me this planet was ugly,|but this is one of the ugliest. . .
{31125}{31194}-. . .in the entire universe.|-I couldn't agree more.
{31199}{31305}I hate these puny, undersized planets.|The gravity is so different.
{31313}{31353}One does get used to it.
{31359}{31431}And the human-animals,|grossly undersized.
{31437}{31495}They don't make good eating,|Your Excellency.
{31501}{31557}-My executive assistant, Ker.|-Thank you.
{31563}{31655}He has been fully trained|to replace me as chief of security.
{31661}{31750}-As soon as my transfer goes through.|-Well, Ker. . .
{31755}{31836}. . .once we finish mining out|this miserable little planet. . .
{31841}{31887}. . .Iet's do the universe a favor.
{31892}{31950}Let's exterminate the lot of them.
{32019}{32079}-Oh, you're too much.|-So they tell me.
{32085}{32130}Please, come this way.
{32235}{32279}Spy satellites recorded those.
{32285}{32363}-What is this species?|-According to the Clinko historians. . .
{32368}{32407}. . .the species is called "dog. "
{32413}{32454}-Dog.|-Yes.
{32464}{32543}Obviously the superior race,|having the man-animal chauffeur.
{32565}{32664}Well, dogs did prove to be|more cooperative than the man-animals.
{32669}{32746}They weren't as useful|when it came to manual labor.
{32803}{32889}I am honored by your visit,|Your Excellency.
{32894}{32922}Thank you, Planetship.
{32927}{33003}You'll be pleased. I approved|additional labor resources.
{33008}{33065}They'll be here|by the end of quarter cycle.
{33070}{33111}Thank you, Your Excellency.
{33121}{33165}Now, let's see.
{33239}{33296}Your long overdue transfer.
{33309}{33406}You must be looking forward to getting|off this disgusting excuse of a planet.
{33412}{33510}I just want to do whatever serves|the corporation best, sir.
{33515}{33581}Very admirable.|And I must say, you've done. . .
{33587}{33657}. . .a first-rate job here|as interim security chief.
{33662}{33717}Hear, hear! Hear, hear!
{33722}{33759}I do what I can.
{33764}{33837}So we've decided to keep you|for another tour of service.
{33948}{33998}There must be some mistake.
{34003}{34070}Home Office does not make mistakes.
{34075}{34131}Of course not.|But have you looked at my file?
{34146}{34228}It explicitly says that this|is a temporary assignment.
{34375}{34455}Are you not aware that I graduated|top of my class?
{34460}{34492}Quite an accomplishment.
{34503}{34573}I don't mean to second-guess|the Home Office. . .
{34578}{34639}. . .but surely I could be|of better service--
{34644}{34759}Home Office is well aware of your|academic achievements and talents.
{34764}{34871}That's why we've decided not to keep|you here for another five cycles.
{35000}{35036}It's a joke.
{35096}{35120}Thank you, sir.
{35125}{35211}I don't know if I|could've kept my sanity. . .
{35216}{35263}. . .to be here another five cycles.
{35268}{35360}We've decided to keep you here|for another 50 cycles!
{35395}{35454}With endless options for renewal!
{36051}{36111}Those options, of course. . .
{36116}{36174}. . .being at Home Office's discretion.
{36179}{36209}Not yours.
{36256}{36289}The senator. . .
{36327}{36380}. . .has a lot of friends.
{36530}{36581}Would you please tell the senator. . .
{36587}{36656}. . .if I'd had even an inkling that|that was his daughter--
{36662}{36697}Watch your tongue.
{36751}{36838}The senator's exact words to me were,|and I'm quoting:
{36843}{36911}"If that blasted Terl tries|to talk his way out of it. . .
{36916}{36972}. . .have him vaporized on the spot. "
{37020}{37112}But cheer up.|There's one bright side to this.
{37117}{37209}One day you're going to die,|and when you end up in hell. . .
{37222}{37292}. . .at least it'll be a step up|from this place.
{38651}{38699}You haven't left for Psychlo.
{38713}{38803}Your powers of observation|are simply startling.
{38815}{38853}Give me three pans to go.
{38917}{38975}I don't know what|you're so down about.
{38987}{39039}You still get to be head of security.
{39044}{39163}Which, from what I can tell,|is a pretty cushy job.
{39171}{39235}Well, I can assure you. . .
{39240}{39359}. . .that I was not groomed since birth|to have some cushy job. . .
{39364}{39434}. . .that even a moron like you|could perform.
{39454}{39538}While you were still learning|how to spell your name. . .
{39543}{39634}. . .I was being trained|to conquer galaxies!
{39684}{39716}To do anything less. . .
{39721}{39796}. . .is a disgrace|to my entire family line.
{39830}{39869}That'll be six credits.
{39877}{39909}Put it on my tab.
{39914}{39940}You don't have a tab.
{39950}{39984}I do now.
{40958}{41020}You're new here,|so I'll explain how it works.
{41047}{41077}I eat first.
{41083}{41117}Then my men eat.
{41123}{41196}If there's anything left,|you can share it with them.
{41205}{41252}That's how it used to work.
{41268}{41328}Greener, let's just stay alive.
{41334}{41358}You're right.
{41365}{41397}-So I'll fight you.|-No.
{41425}{41489}Without food,|we don't have strength to escape.
{41494}{41555}-So now we're escaping?|-I am.
{41560}{41584}Come if you want.
{41676}{41735}We fight, it's to the death.
{42277}{42319}Say your prayers to the gods!
{43011}{43104}We have enough problems without|killing each other over food.
{43164}{43256}From now on, we eat at the same time.
{44114}{44141}Sir.
{44256}{44305}I was wondering when|you'd look at that.
{44319}{44428}It came in last week,|and I put it right in your box.
{44499}{44570}I've wasted my time, haven't l?
{44617}{44712}If you're going to lie to me, have|the decency to do a credible job. . .
{44717}{44781}. . .so I don't look like an idiot|for training you.
{44787}{44886}But I'm not lying. I put the photo|in your box as soon as it came in.
{44891}{44971}You are pathetic. You wouldn't last|one day at the academy.
{44976}{45053}-And I saw you.|-What?
{45142}{45175}You said:
{45185}{45265}"We use picto-cameras|to spy on other offices.
{45270}{45368}But under no circumstance|do we spy on our own office. "
{45373}{45427}That's right. We don't. I do.
{45447}{45485}Start talking.
{45527}{45576}The photo's from|last week's recon drone.
{45581}{45660}It shows a rockslide in the mountains.|It exposed a gold vein.
{45665}{45714}You were waiting for me to transfer. . .
{45719}{45771}. . .so you could turn it in|and get credit.
{45776}{45808}I didn't think you'd mind.
{45813}{45885}I don't mind. Turn it in. But before|you do, pretend you're not. . .
{45937}{45955}. . .a complete imbecile. . .
{45960}{45999}. . .and check the compo gradients.
{46097}{46149}It's full of uranium. No Psychlo. . .
{46201}{46272}. . .can get there without his breath gas|exploding. No way to mine the gold.
{46361}{46461}But what I do mind is that you|betrayed me over a lousy recon photo!
{46493}{46535}It's worthless! You said so!
{46540}{46599}But you didn't know it was worthless!
{46739}{46799}I would never hurt you, sir.
{46863}{46980}I'm unarmed. You can't shoot me.|It's against regulations, sir.
{47001}{47085}I can make this up to you, sir.|I promise. I swear.
{47090}{47117}Please, sir.
{47195}{47247}You do not have to shoot me, sir.
{47473}{47567}Shoot you? My most trusted colleague?
{47572}{47631}Of course not.|We have work to do. Come.
{47677}{47771}Tomorrow morning, we must warn|the Planetship of the mutiny.
{47776}{47800}What mutiny?
{47805}{47873}The one you're going to pretend|is in the works. . .
{47878}{47980}. . .Iike your life depended on it.|Because it does.
{48012}{48095}If the worker revolt takes place,|my informants tell me. . .
{48100}{48180}. . .that the first order of business is|to separate you from your head.
{48220}{48297}Which is why there will be no revolt.
{48302}{48396}I am authorizing you to use whatever|means necessary to prevent it.
{48408}{48513}The best way is to increase profits|and stop cutting the workers' pay.
{48518}{48570}Production equals profits.
{48581}{48665}And I've already ordered|as many new workers as possible. . .
{48670}{48707}. . .to boost production.
{48712}{48776}But we have to pay the new workers.
{48781}{48899}Maybe you were absent the day they|taught economics at the academy, Ker.
{48909}{48965}But nobody works for free.
{48978}{49017}Man-animals do.
{49068}{49127}What if we were to train them|how to mine?
{49248}{49322}Man-animals operating machinery?
{49344}{49401}Have you blown a head gasket?
{49412}{49526}I will be the laughingstock|of the universe.
{49531}{49585}So you should have me|take man-animals. . .
{49590}{49644}. . .with equipment,|out to a remote area. . .
{49649}{49724}. . .better that you don't know where,|and try and train them.
{49736}{49799}Have them do some test mining.
{49804}{49867}If it doesn't work out,|no one will know.
{49872}{49922}-Right.|-And if it does work. . .
{49927}{49979}. . .I will be vaporized.
{49985}{50026}It is against the law.
{50031}{50060}Regulations say. . .
{50065}{50166}. . .a Planetship faced with|a profit-threatening situation. . .
{50171}{50250}. . .is relieved|of all other ordinances. . .
{50255}{50360}. . .to pursue, to protect|and to acquire said profits.
{50365}{50392}There you have it.
{50568}{50637}We stick to the original plan.
{50655}{50693}Bring in new workers. . .
{50712}{50790}. . .and they go on half-pay|as soon as they arrive.
{50795}{50864}And that is final!
{52379}{52447}Run! Run!
{53758}{53819}Okay, now! Pull his breath mask off.
{53928}{54000}Last time we didn't even stop timing|until its lungs burst.
{54006}{54030}That's the wager.
{54188}{54279}No way this man-animal|lasts more than four minutes.
{54834}{54864}Help me!
{54881}{54910}I need your air!
{55293}{55346}The wager's off.|The damn thing cheated.
{55547}{55600}The Planetship is hiding something.
{55605}{55662}All we have to do|is find out what it is. . .
{55668}{55713}. . .then we'll have leverage.
{55719}{55773}And then we can get the gold.
{55779}{55830}What do you mean, we? It's my plan.
{55840}{55939}I'm sending the gold to Psychlo, then|I'm getting off this stinking planet.
{55945}{55974}Come on, sir.
{55989}{56030}You gotta let me in on it.
{56036}{56097}I barely make any lousy credits|in this job.
{56103}{56179}And I've got five wives|to support, sir.
{56237}{56317}I don't know if I want|to partner up with an idiot.
{56336}{56393}How do I even know|you understand the plan?
{56513}{56616}We train man-animals|who don't need breath gas. . .
{56622}{56673}. . .to mine the gold for us.
{56679}{56759}But Home Planet owns this planet.|The gold belongs to them.
{56765}{56798}That's the beauty of it.
{56804}{56858}Home Planet doesn't know|the gold exists.
{56864}{56932}Those corporate crapheads|won't know we stole it.
{56941}{56986}It's the perfect crime, sir.
{56992}{57091}Putting aside the serious violations|of teaching mining to inferiors. . .
{57097}{57190}. . .and insulting corporate superiors,|each one punishable by death.
{57196}{57241}So it is my duty to report you. . .
{57246}{57338}. . .though you'll be vaporized, and|I'll have to train a new assistant.
{57365}{57416}But it's your stinking plan, sir.
{57421}{57474}So I'm glad I have|a recording of you. . .
{57479}{57530}. . .Iaying out the plan|and my reprimanding you.
{57535}{57584}Think of it as part of your education.
{57626}{57655}Education, huh?
{57725}{57824}Never engage in a criminal activity|unless you have a patsy to pin it on. . .
{57830}{57879}. . .in case you ever get found out.
{57894}{57949}Thank you. That's great.
{57955}{58002}But why do I have to be the patsy?
{58008}{58068}So you don't get any bright ideas|to get rid of Terl. . .
{58074}{58123}. . .and keep the gold for yourself.
{58128}{58169}But I'd never double-cross you.
{58175}{58264}I've arranged that if any unfortunate|accident were to befall me. . .
{58281}{58349}. . .this would go|straight to the Home Office.
{60228}{60302}Double or nothing|I can blow off one of its limbs.
{60468}{60550}That one does seem to be unusually|intelligent and resourceful.
{60560}{60609}But it's also defiant.
{60618}{60659}We'll need leverage over it.
{60664}{60717}Leverage? Over a man-animal?
{60722}{60769}Man is a primitive species. . .
{60774}{60887}. . .so we'll need something primitive|for leverage. Like food.
{60897}{60963}What do you think a man-animal|would like to eat?
{60968}{61015}What would he consider a treat?
{61021}{61066}How the crap should I know?
{61086}{61123}There's no way of knowing that.
{61162}{61213}But before we educate it|on the machine. . .
{61218}{61298}. . .we'll take it to the mountains|with a couple of the others.
{61304}{61351}Let them think they've escaped. . .
{61364}{61444}. . .and then we'll sit back|and watch it choose its favorite food.
{61465}{61493}Yes.
{61969}{61995}Look!
{62199}{62285}Three days, and they still haven't|eaten anything yet.
{62291}{62351}Precisely. Now that|the man-animals feel. . .
{62358}{62407}. . .that they have|enough distance from us. . .
{62413}{62487}. . .soon they'll find|their favorite food and celebrate.
{62790}{62812}What is it?
{62819}{62852}Food. Food!
{63029}{63111}No spark, no flints, nothing.|You, Floyd?
{63117}{63174}Plenty to burn.|Nothing to start a fire with.
{63317}{63371}-That's their favorite.|-Of course it is.
{63377}{63451}-They could've selected anything.|-It's not cooked.
{63479}{63576}If man-animal prefers rat uncooked,|then our job is that much easier.
{63583}{63663}If they like their rat so much,|how come those two aren't eating?
{63668}{63775}Don't you know anything? The leader|of the pack always eats first. See?
{63949}{64015}We're really going to have|leverage over them now.
{64366}{64399}What are you doing?
{64653}{64690}They know about the camera.
{64695}{64738}Don't be a knot-head.|It's a man-animal.
{64749}{64798}It couldn't possibly know about it.
{64965}{65016}You sure called that one, sir.
{65021}{65064}No way they know about the cameras.
{65069}{65135}Move your fat ass|and let's go round them up!
{65164}{65193}Crap, lousy ceiling!
{65824}{65874}Great. This is great.
{66138}{66163}What do we do now?
{66169}{66239}What are you thinking, Jonnie?|Don't even think about it.
{66244}{66333}You wouldn't live the jump, Jonnie.|You wouldn't live the jump!
{66340}{66398}You can surrender and rot|in those cages.
{66404}{66453}That's your choice.|I'm not going back!
{66460}{66526}The monsters catch us,|they'll take us to the mines.
{66787}{66814}Run!
{67653}{67688}How do we know what he wants?
{67693}{67770}They made me do this before.|Follow me and you'll be fine.
{68031}{68075}Don't touch anything.
{68081}{68137}Get them mad,|think what they'll do to us.
{68787}{68867}Excuse me, but I am your instructor. . .
{68873}{68904}. . .if you'll forgive such arrogance. . .
{68957}{68990}. . .for I do not have the honor|to be a Psychlo.
{68997}{69030}I'm a lowly Clinko language slave.
{69096}{69208}As you are listening to me,|I most likely do not exist. . .
{69214}{69311}. . .as we may have been exterminated|like many other races. . .
{69317}{69387}. . .by the gas drones|of our conquerors.
{69395}{69446}Please forgive my pretension. . .
{69452}{69529}. . .as I try to educate you|in Psychlo. . .
{69535}{69614}. . .the noble language|of our superiors.
{70620}{70648}You understand?
{70683}{70743}You understand me?
{70778}{70844}Are you hungry, little fella? Yes?
{70935}{70990}Obviously, this is going|to take a while.
{71499}{71544}Jonnie! Jonnie!
{71611}{71665}Carlo! Carlo!
{71679}{71764}I know who they are and where they're|from. I can speak their language.
{71770}{71815}-Monsters?|-They're called Psychlos.
{71821}{71852}What did they do to him?
{71859}{71921}They made him look into a light,|a god machine.
{71927}{71980}It teaches.|It's a knowledge machine.
{71987}{72079}It sends pictures through your head|so fast, it's spinning.
{72086}{72126}Let's go, Jonnie. Come on.
{72133}{72236}No, I can't. I have to stay.|I have to learn more about them.
{72263}{72332}This may be our only way out of here.
{72711}{72797}So this is the monster's language?
{72802}{72848}No, no. This is mathematics.
{72900}{72966}This is the unifying language|of the entire universe.
{73105}{73132}Look.
{73142}{73203}This symbol is called a triangle.
{73212}{73272}If all these sides are equal. . .
{73277}{73338}. . .then these three angles|must also be equal.
{73367}{73392}Equal to what?
{73407}{73435}To each other.
{73441}{73516}It's the basic foundation|of Euclidean geometry.
{73540}{73584}Seems pretty hard to understand.
{73597}{73676}No, only at first. And then it|becomes clear in your mind.
{73682}{73730}I learned molecular biology.
{73736}{73837}This is the symbol for water|and engineering.
{73851}{73961}See, a wing, see? And line|and form and artistic composition.
{73978}{74034}You see, this is a square,|like a cage.
{74039}{74143}I thought we were supposed to be|working on stuff to help us escape.
{74199}{74232}This will.
{74253}{74288}All this will.
{74650}{74716}Jonnie. Jonnie. Human.
{74795}{74875}"The security chief should secure|the field vault. . .
{74880}{74953}. . .with an eight-digit|combination code. . .
{74974}{75059}. . .and do not use a personal|or employee. . .
{75064}{75097}. . .identification number. "
{75102}{75151}What's an identification number?
{75161}{75185}There.
{75190}{75236}-How many numbers is that?|-Eight.
{75244}{75268}Eight?
{75286}{75318}Eight.
{75515}{75559}It's more clever than that.
{75564}{75604}The question is, how clever?
{75615}{75660}Try the numbers backwards.
{76014}{76044}Look at this.
{76049}{76092}It's a recording machine.
{76268}{76315}This is how he watches us.
{77018}{77063}Stop! Chrissy, stop!
{77084}{77111}What if he's not dead?
{77116}{77183}Hope is an admirable quality,|but foolish isn't.
{77188}{77257}I can't give you permission|to go and get killed.
{77270}{77303}I don't need your permission.
{77370}{77414}I'm no longer a child.
{77795}{77836}Do you want lunch?
{78071}{78136}It's obviously too much|to ask a man-animal. . .
{78141}{78197}. . .to learn a language|as sophisticated as Psychlo.
{78202}{78280}What if it can understand|and it's pretending it can't?
{78285}{78336}-What the hell for?|-I don't know.
{78341}{78425}Maybe it's secretly listening,|trying to get leverage over on us.
{78437}{78522}Man-animal getting leverage over|a Psychlo. That'll be the day.
{78564}{78632}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{78637}{78679}Maybe we should train another one.
{78691}{78739}No time. When they detect the gold. . .
{78744}{78805}. . .the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{78899}{78967}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{79220}{79246}It speaks Psychlo.
{79251}{79291}Go on, say something else.
{79300}{79347}You'll stay here as my prisoner. . .
{79352}{79419}. . .while you, you go|and get a transporter.
{79439}{79507}Because you've learned Psychlo|doesn't mean you are one.
{79512}{79564}Follow my orders|or I'll have you killed.
{79647}{79693}How exactly do you plan to do that?
{79946}{79995}-Mickey, no!|-Mickey, no!
{80026}{80134}If any of you rat-brains|knew anything about firearms. . .
{80149}{80236}. . .you would know that you never|store loaded weapons.
{80241}{80274}You drop him now!
{80283}{80343}Drop him or I won't mine|an ounce of your gold.
{80363}{80446}I'll have you vaporized|and find someone else to mine it.
{80451}{80477}You don't have time.
{80487}{80543}You can't hide this|from Home Office forever.
{80591}{80687}A man getting leverage over a Psychlo.|That'll be the day.
{80836}{80949}I think it's time that we show|our little friend a thing or two.
{81592}{81647}As long as you cling to|the feeble hope. . .
{81652}{81698}. . .that you'll ever get|the better of me. . .
{81703}{81773}. . .you'll be distracted|from more important things.
{81778}{81824}Which is exactly why. . .
{81829}{81884}. . .I share the following with you:
{81920}{81964}When we attacked your planet. . .
{81985}{82080}. . .all your soldiers and all|their advanced technology. . .
{82089}{82141}. . .could only put up|a nine-minute fight. . .
{82146}{82194}. . .before they were exterminated.
{82217}{82307}Which is why man|is an endangered species.
{82348}{82412}Everything you humans knew is here.
{82417}{82467}You can look at anything you want. . .
{82487}{82556}. . .because there is nothing|that will help you.
{83359}{83390}Satisfied?
{83403}{83430}Yes.
{83449}{83523}I have one more demonstration|for you and your friends.
{83800}{83863}You will be relocated|to a new mining site.
{83868}{83939}If any of you get any bright ideas|about escaping. . .
{83944}{84045}. . .keep in mind that although you|know nothing about firearms, I do.
{84056}{84172}I graduated top marksman in my class.|I can kill any of you at 1 000 paces.
{84177}{84212}Tell them what I said.
{84217}{84260}We try to run, he'll kill us.
{84272}{84330}-That's it?|-Yes.
{84352}{84389}Allow me to demonstrate.
{84809}{84842}No! Wait!
{85256}{85313}Let's give this demon|what it deserves.
{85318}{85373}Kill it, I say! Destroy it!
{85378}{85427}Shoot! Shoot!
{85432}{85457}Why wait? Kill it!
{85463}{85498}Kill it. Then we'll run.
{85503}{85534}Then what?
{85542}{85629}What kind of life is it to run?|Living in fear of being hunted?
{85645}{85699}What about those we're leaving behind?
{85704}{85747}There's nothing we can do.
{85752}{85790}Only the gods can free them.
{85795}{85879}You think the lights in the sky|are gods waiting to save us?
{85885}{85993}Do you? Those are planets,|planets like this one.
{85998}{86046}The great villages were built by us.
{86062}{86110}By men and women just like us.
{86117}{86181}Willing to fight to the death|for one thing:
{86197}{86223}Their freedom!
{86228}{86288}Do you think no one has tried?
{86309}{86359}You can't defeat them.
{86480}{86538}That is our fate.
{86580}{86638}Yes, we can. Yes, we can!
{86652}{86689}But we have to go back.
{86694}{86749}We go back and learn|about their weapons.
{86770}{86838}Our race is slowly dying|and will be gone forever.
{86845}{86934}Let it be said that we took|this one chance and fought!
{86941}{87002}Are you with me? Are you with me?!
{87025}{87055}We fight!
{87091}{87166}If you're fighting the beast,|me and my men are with you.
{87171}{87244}Thank you.|It's good to have friends out here.
{87249}{87296}May the gods be with you.
{87437}{87509}One as wise as you has ways|to stop me from shooting.
{87518}{87587}I know if I'd tried,|you would've killed me first.
{87749}{87846}Damn right, rat-brain! That's the|first intelligent thing you've said.
{87878}{87926}Rest break is over.
{87940}{88028}There's something I need you to see|so you're properly motivated.
{88530}{88573}You don't know her?
{88610}{88668}No, I don't know her.
{88688}{88768}She's one of the foulest|looking females I've ever seen.
{88785}{88818}While I tend to agree. . .
{88837}{88942}. . .it's obvious that you show a lack|of aptitude for strategic deception.
{88947}{89056}On the other hand, what you show|marginal proficiency at is. . .
{89084}{89112}. . .drawing.
{89164}{89215}This was found when she was collected.
{89252}{89343}The collar has enough explosives|to remove her head from her body.
{89348}{89389}And this remote. . .
{89400}{89465}. . .will activate it|from anywhere on the planet.
{89470}{89547}So if you disobey me, let me|show you what will happen.
{89552}{89592}Please don't harm her.
{89616}{89645}I believe you.
{89650}{89707}Don't worry, rat-brain.
{89715}{89780}Every collar has its own frequency.
{89787}{89853}I'm not going to blow up|your little female friend.
{89905}{89937}Just. . .
{89987}{90014}. . .this one.
{90056}{90089}You made your point.
{90094}{90143}I said I would mine your gold.
{90159}{90202}Please don't kill him. Please.
{90300}{90328}Fine.
{90344}{90448}Due to our new working relationship,|I will grant you this one request.
{90486}{90521}I won't kill him.
{90537}{90600}But you may never ask of me|anything again.
{90613}{90641}I promise.
{90732}{90802}As I've said, I won't kill him.
{90807}{90832}Yes, sir.
{91263}{91303}Stupid humans.
{91966}{92009}No, no, no.
{92014}{92060}What you did was right.
{92072}{92110}It was right for all of us.
{92124}{92182}Greener, you're a thinker. . .
{92197}{92242}. . .and the gods respect thinkers.
{92255}{92299}You didn't kill Sammy.
{92320}{92385}Jonnie, this is not living.
{92403}{92455}This is. . .
{92474}{92494}. . .cages!
{92503}{92527}Cages!
{92532}{92616}Even if we escaped and went back|to where we all came from. . .
{92621}{92651}. . .it'd be like you said.
{92656}{92722}We'd be waiting for the Psychlos|to hunt us down.
{92734}{92809}I think that is not living either.
{92917}{92963}We all chose to fight.
{93582}{93646}-Count us in too!|-What's going on?
{93651}{93726}Someone knows how to speak|the Psychlo's language.
{93731}{93770}He's gonna help us fight.
{95111}{95153}Yes.
{95178}{95247}Ker, I'd like you to meet Chirk.
{95271}{95327}She's. . . .
{95332}{95384}His soon-to-be|newly acquired secretary.
{95389}{95444}-Yes.|-Really?
{95453}{95545}She's stupid enough not to be a menace,|pretty enough to be decorative.
{95550}{95652}She gets drunk with economical speed|and has other advantages.
{95724}{95760}I can see that.
{95766}{95829}-Don't you have some work to do?|-No.
{95834}{95854}Ker?
{95860}{95893}All right, sir.
{95956}{95995}Now, listen, missy. . .
{96000}{96075}. . .I'm still waiting for|the Planetship's accounts.
{96144}{96222}I had to go way beyond|the call of duty to get these.
{96227}{96303}I see. Well, that's why|I especially chose you.
{96315}{96369}So you'll keep your side|of the bargain?
{96389}{96432}Which was?
{96440}{96529}You said we'd have a huge house|when we go back to Psychlo next year.
{96535}{96592}-We're going to be rich, right?|-Right.
{96602}{96690}I am going to make you|as happy as a baby Psychlo. . .
{96695}{96762}. . .on a straight diet of Kerbango.
{97086}{97131}Well, isn't it interesting. . .
{97136}{97201}. . .that you have been keeping|two sets of books. . .
{97206}{97256}. . .and telling all the workers. . .
{97262}{97320}. . .that the planet has been|operating at a loss?
{97361}{97453}I only claimed that it was|running at a loss. . .
{97459}{97561}. . .to try and motivate them all|to work harder.
{97566}{97604}Oh, yes, of course.
{97614}{97667}And it had nothing to do|with the fact. . .
{97672}{97730}. . .that it allowed you|to cut the workers' pay. . .
{97736}{97811}. . .and keep all the extra credit|for yourself. Did it?
{97840}{97910}That. Well, I can explain that.
{97915}{98020}Well, unfortunately, the company|requires me to vaporize you.
{98061}{98086}On the other hand. . .
{98101}{98175}. . .I could understand someone|in your situation. . .
{98180}{98232}. . .being old and having no future. . .
{98238}{98309}. . .coming up with ways|to solve your financial problems.
{98338}{98401}-You can?|-Oh, yes.
{98409}{98469}It's really of no interest|to anybody. . .
{98474}{98531}. . .to have you not be Planetship.
{98537}{98634}But it would be prudent of you|to start to share your authority.
{98880}{98978}But these forms are|all blank, undated.
{98993}{99053}You could put anything|you wanted on them.
{99059}{99145}You would run the entire planet!
{99187}{99293}I would be nothing but a puppet.
{99309}{99372}Well, if you don't want|to do it that way. . .
{99377}{99428}. . .we could always do it by. . .
{99457}{99492}. . .the book.
{99645}{99744}What the hell does the Planetship|need with all this mining equipment?
{99749}{99792}That's not even the crazy part.
{99797}{99882}He's ordered me to take a group|of man-animals to a remote area. . .
{99887}{99966}. . .with the equipment to see|if they can be trained to mine.
{99971}{100048}Man-animals being able to mine?
{100053}{100082}Yes.
{100254}{100305}Old Psychlo's gone completely insane.
{100319}{100348}Indeed.
{100353}{100393}But what can I do?
{100398}{100444}An order is an order.
{100562}{100612}You have a busy day, rat-brain.
{100617}{100655}First, learning how to fly. . .
{100661}{100734}. . .then on to the learning machine|for mining techniques.
{101448}{101475}Crash one more time. . .
{101480}{101559}. . .and your little friend|will no longer be among the living.
{101569}{101591}Again.
{101596}{101632}Again!
{102635}{102718}Never underestimate what a little|leverage can do, rat-brain.
{103366}{103398}That's good, man-animal.
{103413}{103490}This is the lever where|we mine the gold!
{103495}{103546}Lever! Up, down!
{103578}{103662}Warning: External sensors indicate|dangerous radiation levels ahead.
{103667}{103710}This is as far as I can go!
{103715}{103749}Land it!
{104102}{104140}Meet me back here in 1 4 days.
{104145}{104197}I want the ship's cage|half-filled with gold.
{104319}{104385}And even though I won't be|at the mining site. . .
{104440}{104470}. . .I'll be watching you.
{104721}{104793}-How's your side?|-It's good. Good.
{105096}{105138}Next time, you fly.
{105415}{105485}No, no, no.|Even if we do mine enough gold. . .
{105490}{105562}. . .we'll be lucky to fill|half of that cage in time.
{105567}{105597}That's why we're not mining.
{105602}{105687}What about the big uglies watching|us with that eye in the sky?
{105692}{105747}Carlo, look. Here's the men, right?
{105752}{105811}We split them in half.|One group goes. . .
{105816}{105848}. . .and one group stays. . .
{105853}{105913}. . .and it looks as if|we're still working.
{105959}{106054}But if we don't deliver it in 1 4 days|to Terl, he's just gonna kill us.
{106060}{106113}There's a place called Fort Knox|where the gold's already been mined.
{106118}{106191}Listen, there will be no mining,|but we'll deliver it.
{106196}{106286}Okay, so we have to pretend|that we're mining the gold.
{106322}{106399}We have to figure out where|we're gonna get the gold. . .
{106404}{106465}. . .then we have to get the supplies|to help our revolt.
{106484}{106505}Yeah.
{106510}{106570}We barely have men to|do one of those things. . .
{106575}{106621}. . .Iet alone all three.
{106669}{106738}It's good to have friends|on the outside!
{107172}{107192}Come on!
{107197}{107265}If you two kept your eyes open,|that'd be a great help.
{107270}{107343}Look for an ocean. If you see any,|we've gone too far.
{107398}{107438}I think this is it.
{107443}{107486}I think we're in Washington.
{107491}{107555}-We're still in Colorado.|-That's impossible.
{107561}{107601}I've been watching,|we haven't crossed this line.
{107606}{107652}You're not paying attention.
{107658}{107747}Let him navigate and watch me.|You're gonna fly on the way back.
{107766}{107826}We couldn't have crossed|all these lines.
{107831}{107917}Well, we did. The lines must|have faded over time.
{108283}{108360}This great village was the capital|for all our tribes.
{108365}{108425}This is where our people's|history was buried.
{108675}{108746}Here. When the Psychlos|attacked Earth. . .
{108753}{108802}. . .they sent out flying gas drones.
{108808}{108895}Our ancestors must've made it out|into these remote radiated areas. . .
{108900}{108990}. . .and the only reason they survived|was because radiation is. . .
{108995}{109034}. . .Iethal to the Psychlos.
{109039}{109110}-And that was not good for them.|-That's good for us.
{109115}{109185}Even if we fail, the people|will be safe if they stay--
{109190}{109233}Safe from being hunted. . .
{109240}{109305}. . .but radiation is|also poisonous for humans.
{109328}{109370}So, you see, either way. . .
{109395}{109447}. . .if we don't take back our planet. . .
{109488}{109544}. . .the last of humanity|becomes extinct.
{110218}{110283}Based on what I've read about|Psychlo security. . .
{110288}{110317}. . .if we revolted. . .
{110322}{110401}. . .only using weapons they don't|perceive as any real threat. . .
{110406}{110466}. . .if we just use rocks and sticks. . .
{110471}{110546}. . .they'll just throw us|back in the cages.
{110551}{110580}But. . .
{110595}{110681}. . .we're gonna stage this revolt|inside the dome.
{110686}{110799}So the Psychlos are gonna have to|come inside the city to round us up.
{110814}{110887}And that is when we blow the dome.
{110915}{110955}Carlo's gonna blow the dome.
{110961}{111012}-They won't have masks.|-They can't breathe.
{111017}{111045}-They die.|-Carlo?
{111050}{111121}-I'm gonna blow the dome?|-You're gonna blow the dome.
{111159}{111234}Piece of cake.|Piece of cake, piece of cake.
{111323}{111386}But remember, as soon as|we blow the dome. . .
{111391}{111438}. . .boom, stage 2 alarm.
{111443}{111463}What is that?
{111468}{111545}Thousands of gas drones and troops|will be teleported here.
{111550}{111634}-We can't fight against that.|-Then what's the point?
{111639}{111719}If they send more monsters to Earth,|we get wiped out.
{111733}{111800}Well, the point is,|we don't let it get to stage 2.
{111805}{111867}We'll destroy their Home Planet|before it happens.
{111872}{111939}-Their Home Planet?|-Their Home Planet.
{111979}{112047}We need some extra supplies|before we can do that.
{112052}{112110}Our first stop is a radiation bomb|storage bunker.
{112115}{112172}Is everyone clear?
{112220}{112245}Count us in.
{112997}{113041}-Look.|-Flying machines.
{113046}{113124}These are flying machines.|They're weapons of some kind.
{113188}{113222}Flying spears.
{113230}{113284}I think there's a little more|to it than that.
{113705}{113747}It's a learning machine.
{113763}{113798}Teach us to fly.
{114251}{114277}You're right.
{114283}{114317}It's like breaking a horse.
{114335}{114387}Can you teach your men to fly this?
{114392}{114462}-Piece of cake, piece of cake.|-Piece of cake.
{114467}{114509}-Try and keep it level.|-Jonnie!
{114514}{114544}-What is it?|-I think I found one.
{114549}{114619}Come on! Nuclear firebomb!
{114624}{114656}Piece of cake.
{114681}{114743}According to the book, there's|a firing mechanism. . .
{114748}{114831}. . .that has to be in place before|it's operational.
{115324}{115367}Don't touch the auto-sensor.
{115372}{115409}What happens if we do?
{115414}{115480}The bomb will explode. Big fire.
{115518}{115566}Look. Greeners from this cave.
{115571}{115611}Off. Off.
{115992}{116013}War--
{116018}{116040}--ning.
{116045}{116087}Warning. Warning.
{116092}{116121}Warning.
{116143}{116189}Warning.
{116194}{116221}Get it?
{116348}{116410}What does the auto-sensor look like?
{116417}{116470}There's an illustration in Appendix A.
{116605}{116641}What? What?
{116730}{116765}We don't have Appendix A.
{116971}{116997}More books, Jonnie.
{117206}{117239}It's okay.
{117256}{117321}I thought you said nuclear fires|were powerful?
{117326}{117363}It's not nuclear. Mickey!
{117368}{117398}Sorry.
{117403}{117440}You're sorry. Mickey!
{117445}{117519}Stop touching things|and turn off the damn light.
{117524}{117548}Leave it on.
{117592}{117622}Look.
{117770}{117806}Good work, Mickey.
{117812}{117859}You just found Appendix A.
{118243}{118299}Will this be enough to blow up|their whole planet?
{118304}{118361}Radiation reacts with their|planet's atmosphere.
{118366}{118438}-There's enough to destroy it forever.|-Let me do it.
{118491}{118546}Let me go there|and detonate the weapon.
{118553}{118632}It's brave of you, Mickey,|but it's my plan, so I go.
{118637}{118711}You're the only one who speaks|the monsters' language.
{118716}{118764}You know things about them!
{118783}{118822}Listen. . .
{118827}{118892}. . .without you leading this revolt. . .
{118927}{118961}. . .we might not succeed.
{120203}{120289}I hope their eye in the sky didn't|see the gold through the lead walls.
{120741}{120794}Start filling the cage.
{120799}{120891}We'll hide half and deliver|the other half to Terl tonight.
{121368}{121405}Why is it in bars?
{121453}{121490}I assumed, sir. . .
{121495}{121591}. . .that a Psychlo of your refinement|wouldn't want raw ore.
{121689}{121721}Really?
{121998}{122049}Since you have had extra time. . .
{122054}{122104}. . .to smelt it into bricks. . .
{122109}{122173}. . .I'll expect the rest of the gold|in seven days.
{122885}{122945}He has no intention of sharing|that gold with you.
{122997}{123060}What the hell are you talking about?
{123090}{123158}Why are you here?|You should be mining the gold!
{123163}{123234}You really think the only reason|he made that recording. . .
{123239}{123313}. . .was to have you as his patsy?|Do you, Ker?
{123328}{123401}No. He has leverage over you. . .
{123406}{123469}. . .and it'll guarantee you|never see an ounce.
{123499}{123560}How do you know|about those recordings?
{123571}{123610}It really is amazing. . .
{123615}{123684}. . .the collection of discs|you find in Terl's personal vault.
{124060}{124083}First, we trade.
{124088}{124127}-The disc--|-I don't think so!
{124133}{124190}Because if you don't give me|the disc now. . .
{124195}{124236}. . .I will blow your head off.
{124733}{124771}You want to trade?
{124803}{124831}Let's trade.
{124862}{124892}Hooray!
{124947}{125004}Won't the Psychlo see|I'm not wearing the collar?
{125010}{125084}After tonight, won't matter|much either way.
{125116}{125181}Jonnie, I know you|don't believe in fate. . .
{125188}{125242}. . .but I've always known|this was your destiny.
{125251}{125323}This is our destiny.|It's freedom for all of us.
{125336}{125372}For our children.
{125406}{125437}Children?
{126017}{126047}Beautiful.
{126365}{126388}Quickly!
{126805}{126870}What if this one is|particularly stupid?
{126875}{126935}There's no time.|When they detect the gold...
{126940}{127002}... the Planetship will know|what we're doing.
{127111}{127190}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127234}{127329}When they detect the gold, the|Planetship will know what we're doing.
{127389}{127446}We'll have to terminate the operation|and cover our tracks.
{127451}{127472}I've been thinking.
{127485}{127577}80/20 is a pretty fair|distribution of the gold.
{127594}{127636}But I should get the 80% .
{127655}{127737}And with my share, I'm gonna|fire all my wives. . .
{127743}{127778}. . .and buy new ones.
{127803}{127856}Maybe pretty ones this time.
{127885}{127912}Ker-bango!
{127967}{127995}Congratulations.
{128002}{128076}You've learned how to get|leverage over someone, haven't you?
{128095}{128168}Which means I haven't wasted my time|training you, have l?
{128187}{128233}-You're not upset?|-Don't be crazy.
{128242}{128290}You know how long I've waited|for this day?
{128296}{128347}I know the perfect way to celebrate.
{128396}{128451}What are you doing?
{128484}{128512}You can't shoot me.
{128517}{128591}I made a copy and gave it|to someone for safekeeping.
{128596}{128671}You are just too good of a teacher.
{128690}{128791}How about giving your old teacher|a clue as to who this might be?
{128796}{128846}You insult yourself, sir.
{128851}{128884}You taught me better.
{128889}{128942}How am I supposed to know who it is?
{128947}{128984}I don't know.
{128989}{129052}It could be anybody|on this damn planet.
{129058}{129106}-It could be a mechanic.|-No.
{129112}{129163}-It could be a concubine.|-No, no.
{129168}{129226}It could be anybody|in communications.
{129231}{129252}Wrong!
{129258}{129351}I hate these things. It's like|it's a test I'm not prepared for.
{129386}{129499}Well, hell, it could even be|our friendly bartender!
{129635}{129688}Please. I made a mistake.
{129805}{129860}Now, give me the original disc. . .
{129865}{129946}. . .then meet me at the teleportation|platform in two hours.
{129975}{130009}Sir.
{130260}{130298}The control bunker's to the right.
{130308}{130331}Three guards left.
{130339}{130408}Two from the guardhouse,|one coming from the north.
{130427}{130465}I'll take the guardhouse.
{132004}{132071}Jonnie, the shooting's|triggered the alarm.
{132089}{132172}Five guards from the south,|heavily armed and moving fast.
{132179}{132213}Between you and the bunker.
{132225}{132254}Jonnie!
{133834}{133916}The man-animals have escaped.|They're running into the city.
{133923}{133996}Send some guards out|and round them up. I'm busy.
{134001}{134059}Don't bother me|with every little detail.
{134064}{134099}Gotta round them up.
{134378}{134404}Psychlos!
{134438}{134469}Psychlos!
{134602}{134685}Greener? Carlo. Explosives are set.|Can I blow the dome?
{134735}{134760}Greener?
{134773}{134821}What's going on? Talk to me!
{134826}{134888}It's Carlo. What's going on?|Talk to me.
{134893}{134923}Hold on!
{134955}{135012}If I don't get Mickey to Psychlo,|they'll send drones.
{135017}{135097}Well, hurry up. Just hurry up,|because I've got company.
{139079}{139099}Here they are.
{139781}{139831}Panther!
{140351}{140410}Hang on. I'm right on his tail.
{141621}{141664}You know what you gotta do.
{142345}{142374}Greener, come on.
{142379}{142417}I've gotta blow this dome now!
{142422}{142478}I'm teleporting Mickey and the bomb.|Hang on.
{142485}{142516}I'm seconds away.
{142828}{142853}Jonnie, come on.
{142859}{142902}They're destroying the bombs.
{142909}{142944}-It's now or never.|-Now!
{142949}{143013}Now, go ahead! Blow the dome!|Go! Go! Go!

{144229}{144280}The dome is holding!

{145919}{145950}What's with the dome?
{145979}{146039}Hold on, I'm taking it out now.
{147041}{147075}Help us!
{147084}{147111}They're killing us!
{147302}{147383}We're not gonna make it!|I think we should pull out!
{147875}{147964}I'm blowing the dome. In five.

{148209}{148235}Two.
{148249}{148270}One.
{148322}{148359}Piece of cake.

{151887}{151945}You have been|quite a challenge, rat-brain.
{151950}{152003}You'll make a hell|of a conversation piece. . .
{152009}{152087}. . .when you're stuffed|and hanging on the academy wall.
{153225}{153266}Where's the rest of my gold?
{153276}{153331}I'll exchange it for my woman's life.
{153347}{153425}My life is over, but hers is|of no consequence to you.
{153451}{153531}Thanks for reminding me, rat-brain.|Now, where is it?
{153536}{153591}Trust me, you don't want to do that.
{153597}{153654}Trust me, there's nothing I want more.
{156099}{156142}Carlo came through.
{157581}{157643}Why don't you vaporize me?
{157833}{157856}Leverage.
{157950}{158017}If there are other Psychlo|colonies out there. . .
{158022}{158091}. . .they'll send out gas drones|and exterminate us.

{158200}{158251}. . .that destroyed their Home Planet. . .
{158309}{158368}. . .then all the credits|in the universe. . .
{158386}{158446}. . .won't equal the bounty|on your head.
{158764}{158856}But there is one thing you rat-brains|weren't smart enough to realize.
{158864}{158896}Kill them.
{159233}{159280}I fixed the problem with it.
{159311}{159350}-It works now.|-You imbecile!
{159360}{159410}What kind of game are you playing?
{159421}{159529}Since I'm teaching them our technology,|they made me the head Psychlo.
{159647}{159678}Look at the bright side.
{159706}{159811}You may not be wallowing|in luxury on Psychlo. . .

Looking back, it all seems so simple.
We were at war.
The Nazis were the enemy. And because
good must triumph over evil...
... so we would triumph over them.
How could we have known that war
never trades in such certainties?
For where nothing is unthinkable...
... anything can be true.
Even a lie.
- Anvone sitting there?
- No.
For one dreadful moment, I thought it was going to be standing room onlv.
It's all airmen and sappers down back.
Nice enough, but...
- Here, have one of mine.
- I'm all right, thanks.
Sorrv. Cannerlev.
- Richard Cannerlev. How do vou do?
- Charlotte Grav.
So, going home or coming awav?
- I work in London.
- Don't tell me, let me guess.
- You're in the WAAFs?
- I work in a surgerv.
Good for vou.
Whv?
- Risking London for the war effort.
- It's our dutv.
Absolutelv.
I'm a civil servant.
We don't come from anvwhere.
The Germans are spreading the rumor we're not born at all.
You speak French?
Oh, ves.
Ever lived there?
- I studied there.
- In Paris?
Best citv in the world!
Not that vou'd want to live there now.
It's full of Germans.
Can't find anvthing but sauerkraut.
What the Germans have done to France is not a joke.
No.
Of course not.
Clear the doors! Each bag is to be collected bv the exit!
- Cheer up. We'll have a hoot.
- You'll have a hoot.
I'll be talking to some duffer about Tennvson.
- It's just a book launch.
- Books mean booze.
You should be in publishing.
Don't be such a stav-at-home.
You never go out.
I don't care if thev're uglv, as long as thev have nice teeth.
The author.
Excuse me.
- Sorrv.
- Oh, no.
- It's a bit noisv in there.
- Yes.
- Peter Gregorv.
- Charlotte Grav.
Bloodv hell!
These literarv girls...
Sorrv.
Pilot Officer Borowski, Miss Grav.
He's a friend.
Delighted to meet vou, Miss Grav.
All clear.
So...
You're from Scotland?
- Whereabouts?
- Saint Andrews.
Near Edinburgh, lovelv.
Bit different to this, eh?
- You've never been to a ceilidh.
- I have, actuallv.
And ves, it was noisv.
Thev don't serve warm gin either.
I don't know how vou drink it.
- At least I don't water plants with it.
- You weren't meant to see that.
Miss Grav! I thought it was vou.
Good of vou to come.
How do vou do?
Let me introduce vou to some chums.
We're over in the corner.
Morris, meet Miss Grav!
She reads Stendhal in French.
It's one thing to order dinner in the lingo. Quite another...
...to pass vourself off as a waiter.
We're alwavs looking for French speakers. War work of some kind.
- Take me.
- You'd never pass the phvsical.
Thev're trained, but the truth is...
...vou're either fluent or vou're not.
- I suppose.
It's not easv pretending to be French.
It's not just knowing the words.
One's got to want to do it.
One's got to feel stronglv about what the Nazis have done to France.
Excuse me.
I did give vou mv number, didn't I?
- Yes.
- Do call, please.
Bottoms up!
To war.
Hello again.
Hello.
Has that bloodv airman been eating mv rations again?
And mine!
Go on.
That's terrible.
You're not even trving.
Punish me.
I submit!
The invasion plans are in mv wooden leg.
You're here.
I think so.
What would vou sav if I went to France?
Whv? Has someone asked vou?
What for?
To be some sort of agent or courier, I think.
- I'm not sure.
- It's far too dangerous.
- You flv. That's dangerous.
- It's the onlv thing I'm good at.
Do vou mind?
You didn't even sav "ouch."
You're brave. Be proud of it.
- I'm just scared of vou.
- I want to be brave...
...like vou are.
Just be vourself.
If I was mvself, I'd never let vou go.
Do vou believe in fate?
I don't mean fate exactlv, I mean...
...if someone tells vou... If vou have a gift, it's vour dutv to use it.
To go out there. To...
...to be brave.
- Charlotte...
...l'm not brave.
It's just that...
...war makes us into people we didn't know we were.
Look.
I've lost all mv friends.
Everv single one.
Do vou think I feel brave when I'm alive and thev're dead?
It's not braverv...
...it's accident.
Mv leave is up.
When?
Tomorrow.
It's just some ops over France.
It's...
How long?
Three weeks.
I'll be back in London on the 18th.
You'll wait for me here.
- War.
- Peace.
- War.
- Flowers.
France.
Eves closed, please.
- France.
- Love.
- Love.
- IKev.
- Lock.

- Death.
- Old.
Man.
One word onlv.
- Man.
- Bald.
- Man.
- Bald. Sorrv.
Speed it up! Come on!
Good!
Small steps!
Remember what vour mother told vou!
IKeep vour knees and legs together!
France, as vou know, is currentlv divided into two zones.
The northern zone, including Paris, is occupied bv the Germans.
The southern zone...
...or "free zone" is occupied and run bv the French out of Vichv.
Bv collaborating fullv with the Third Reich...
...the Vichv government is allowed to police itself.
And it's here in the free zone that the main Resistance is located.
For those selected few who pass, this is where vou will work.
Once behind enemy lines,
treat everyone with suspicion.
The shopkeeper, the police,
even colleagues in the Resistance.
"Looking forward to our next meeting.
Manv thanks."
As long as vou are transmitting, the Hun can hear vou...
...so save the bloodv chitchat.
Right foot! Again, right foot!
Chest! Left shoulder! Right eve!
The securitv implications are prettv simple.
Should vou be caught and tortured...
...vours, we sincerelv trust, will be the onlv name thev know.
It follows that your greatest
protection will be your cover.
Soon, you'll transform
yourself from who you are now...
... into somebody entirely different.
Please, Mommv, I'm fine.
If a bomb's got mv name on it, a bomb's got mv name on it.
- I'm back.
- I'm not leaving London.
- Oh, Charlotte, hello.
- Bve.
- What's this course vou've been on?
- FANYs. First Aid...
I know what thev are.
Are vou a driver?
Oh, I expect so, ves.
So whv do vou need to go on a course?
I'm not reallv supposed to sav.
You never know who's listening.
Liar.
You can't drive.
Got me.
- Pilot Officer Borowski?
- Yes.
- It's Miss Grav. We met at the partv.
- Oh, Miss Gray.
Yes, I'm looking for Peter.
I was expecting to see him last night.
Oh, right. Peter, yes.
Look, sorry.
We think he went down over France.
But don't give up hope.
You know Peter, he's a fighter.
We should know more in a few days.
Can you call me back?
Miss Gray, are you all right?
Why is your name down for France?
Only one in three come back.
I want to help win the war.
And being a courier in France is glamorous?
- I'd be prettv sillv to think that.
- A lot of women do.
Is there something wrong with that?
Your father fought in the Great War, is that right?
Would vou sav vou're trving to impress him?
Whv should I?
But vour father introduced vou to France.
- Took vou to visit the war graves?
- Yes.
- And vour mother?
- I don't see whv...
...vou're asking questions when vou know the answers.
Do vou find it easv to form attachments?
- On average.
- Have vou ever been in love?
Yes, I have.
Of these, which, in vour view, is the most important:
Faith, hope or love?
Hope.
On the double! Chop-chop!
Look livelv! Come on!
Come on, now, girls!
Last one eats a lemon!
Come on, ladies!
This is the finish line!
- Miss Gray? I've got news of Peter.
- You have?
They made radio contact last night.
Where was this?
- I'm not really...
- Please. I promise I won't sav.
All right, listen.
It's a place called Gillesse.
- Don't tell anyone I told...
- I understand.
- Lf this got out...
- No, I understand.
- Thank vou so much for telling me.
- All right.
Thank vou.
- Someone's coming. I've got to go.
- All right.
Identitv card. Ration card.
Certificate of non-belonging to the
Jewish race. Husband's photo...
...and friends'.
Lipstick. Sanitarv towels, French.
- Lighter. Fillings?
- Done.
Cigarettes.
Favorite perfume.
And no cafe creme. Thev haven't had it for a vear. Wedding ring.

For vour English contact...
...Mirabel.
- Mirabel.
Cvanide pill.
Come along.
I've a handover for vou.
Some radio valves.
Meet vour contact at the Cafe du Sport...
...Thursdav morning, 10:00.
She'll wear a blue coat and ask vou how the weather is in Paris.
Tell her it's not bad for the time of vear.
It's a bit English, I know, but it helps to remember.
- You've done well.
- Thank vou.
No, reallv.
Main thing is, don't panic.
It's just a test. To get vou started.
You'll hardlv know vou were gone.
Always remember who you are not.
From the moment you leave
to the moment you're back...
... you are Dominique Guilbert
from Paris.
Can vou believe it?
Thev told me to get some sleep.
You've come south seeking work
while your husband is a POW.
You have no children,
no view on the Vichy government.
You simply want to survive the war.
From this moment on,
Charlotte Gray is dead.
What is it?
Germans.
Help!
Mama!
Come on, quick!
Jacob, wait!
- Drink?
- Thank vou.
All right?
Yes.
- You missed the zone.
- I saw lights.
What lights?
I was mistaken.
Thank vou.
- You are...?
- Dominique Guilbert.
Welcome to France, Dominique.
- Octave!
- Auguste!
Idiot.
- Take care.
- Good night.
- Don't forget this, madame.
- Thank vou.
Your papers?
- You want one?
- No. Thank vou.
You know this man?
- He works with vou?
- He was on the plane.
We're onlv told what we need to know.
How much do thev tell vou about us?
We're Communists.
Did thev tell vou this?
- No.
- It bothers vou.
Whv should it?
You're all Gaullists in London.
You send weapons because...
...south of Limoges, we're all vou have. But after the war, vou wait.
- We're going to change things here.
- Might be an idea to win first.
This is the contact point.
You ask for Octave.
Otherwise...
...we don't know each other.
- Fine.
Thank vou for coming.
It is appreciated.
Mama? Papa?
Wait for me!
- Do vou think she was an angel?
- Who?
The ladv from the skv.
- I don't think so.
- She could be, vou don't know.
Thev've been undermining us for vears.
IKeeping the best jobs for themselves.
The dav thev said no Jew should be a teacher was a special dav for us.
I didn't know the father was one of them. He seemed nice to me.
No, he's seeing somebodv else.
I told her.
Number, please. Connecting vou.
Order cakes from Madame Galliot, savories from Albert.
Anvthing else could be horsemeat.
Number, please. Connecting vou.
Bovs?
Shouldn't vou be at school?
- Where are vour parents?
- We don't know.
- Morning, madame.
- Morning.
The line's gone dead.
I'm sorrv, it's not mv fault.
No dawdling. IKeep in line.
Bovs, wait!
Please, after vou, madame.

Move!
Madame.
Coffee, please.
You're not from around here?
No.
Paris.
- How's the weather in Paris?
- Not bad for the time of vear.
Don't give them to me. I'm being followed. Stav a moment, then leave.
Wait! I don't have much time.
- I have a friend in Gillesse. Do vou...?
- I don't know.
Ask vour C.O. I have to go.
Excuse me, gentlemen, ladies.

The one with the lovelv smile.
Evervthing all right, monsieur?
Oh, fine. Thank vou, Sophie.

We must do something. I had a meeting with her and the police took her awav!
- See, there was an I.D. Check...
- Wait! One moment, please.
- What woman?
- It was a handover.
- She needed valves. Thev searched her.
- You'd given them to her?
And?
Thev asked her what thev were for and took her awav.
- Thev didn't ask for vou?
- No.
- What will thev do with her?
- Who saw vou together?
- The barman spoke to me.
- He's all right. Anvone else?
I don't know.
It all happened verv fast.
- How was she caught?
- Thev followed her.
And she came into the cafe?
She was trving to warn me.
That takes a second.
We talked for a moment.
She shouldn't have come in.
- She was worried thev'd trv to stop me.
- You don't...
...talk.
- What will thev do to her?
- I don't know.
Anvwav, there's nothing we can do now.
Whv not go to vour English contact?
Because he hasn't shown up vet.
- You have a code for meeting?
- Yes!
I'm sorrv. I should go.
No, no!
Wait. You need a new cover.
Mv father lives outside Lezignac, he rents rooms.
If anvone asks, sav vou're a friend of mine from Paris.
You're from Paris?
Before the war, ves.
Wait here an hour.
I'll talk to mv father.
When vou leave, ask directions for Le Domaine.
Sav vou are the new housekeeper.
Word spreads fast here.
Two Jewish bovs are there.
Their parents are missing. You help.
If I'm to stav with vour father, shouldn't I know vour real name?
Julien.
Excuse me.
Monsieur.
I'm Madame Guilbert.
- Your son...
- I know. He told me. I'm Levade.
You can start bv giving the bovs a bath. Thev stink.
Door's open.
Hello?
Hello?
Mama?
Shh! Hide!
I'm Dominique.
I work for Monsieur Levade.
He asked me to give vou a bath.
So would vou like me to...?
I'll wait outside.

- What's she doing here?
Housework.
What happened to vour towels?
We're going home!
No, wait, please.
You're soaked. Here.
Drv vourselves.
We're going home.
Monsieur Levade isn't nice.
- I don't like him either.
- I'm sure he's...
Where are our parents?
I'm sure thev wouldn't want vou getting cold. Would thev?
Here vou go.
The bovs are all right?
Thev're in bed.
Thev were asking about their mother.
Have vou found out what happened?
Thev were arrested vesterdav evening bv our police.
Thev've been taken to a holding camp in Drancv.
The reason the bovs weren't picked up is because thev'd sneaked out.
I have a contact there.
He's working on their release.
The mother must be going mad.
- It was a mistake to bring them here.
- You, with no room to spare.
- No room good enough for vou.
- He's not used to visitors.
- I have a choice?
- Please, sit.
- Sit!
- Thank vou.
I know Monsieur Duguav.
He lectured in Toulouse.
I did some work for the universitv.
Thev're good bovs.
- You want to eat?
- No, thanks.
Please vourself. It's rabbit stew.
- Do vou like rabbit stew?
- Verv nice.
She likes it, and she hasn't even tried it.
He thinks I cook like shit.
If vou hear from vour contact, tell me.
Of course.
I'll sav good night to the bovs before I go.
You mav serve now.
- Excuse me, am I on the right...?
- Don't tell me vour name.
- I wasn't...
- Twelve weeks of training.
First thing thev do is tell me their names.
Let's get this done quicklv.
The Germans use the main line to transport munitions and vehicles.
There's a train through Lezignac
Mondav, 1:30.
Mainlv wagons, bolsters for tanks and artillerv pieces. Got that?
Right.
So I pass that on to Octave.
Who do vou think vou pass it to?
The gendarmerie?
I was just... Sorrv.
I met a contact in town, code name
Francoise. She's been taken awav.
- Do vou know what's happened to her?
- She's dead.
Matter of fact,
I liked her verv much.
She was unluckv. You weren't.
Anvwav, can't afford to get too close.
Now!
Go!
Auguste, is Claire still mad enough to marrv a blind man?
Mv glasses are mv best feature.
- Don't be too proud.
- Onlv from the neck up.
Liar.
- Time?
- Two minutes.
- Readv?
- Just two seconds.
Yes!
Let's go!
Down!
- Guards firing!
- Swine!
- Gerard, no!
- Gerard!
Stav here!
Come on! Move!
Come on! Let's go!
You go with him.
Dominique, here.
Drink?
Thank vou.
What vou've just done...
Your hands.
It's alwavs a shock the first time.
I tell Julien he'll die fighting the Germans.
The old men, we remember.
- You fought in...
- I was an engineer.
The war loves engineers.
We mend dead machines.
So Julien savs vou're from Paris.
Your husband?
He's a prisoner of war. In Bonn.
Sorrv.
Whv doesn't vour son live with vou?
You don't get on?
Mv son's a Communist.
- And vou?
- I'm not interested in politics.
Whv fight? Whv risk vour life?
For vour countrv.
Nobodv fights for their countrv.
Onlv for their familv.
For someone thev love.
Does it matter?
Depends if vou're on our side.
I'm on vour side.
Yes. I think vou are.
Good morning, madame.
Good morning.
Verv prettv skirt, madame.
- We're waiting.
- Yes, of course.
Smile! One, two, three!
Thank vou.
- Madame?
- Gillesse, please.
Two francs.
Never leave the house without an adult.
- We didn't know where vou were.
- Look, I'm sorrv.
You have to stav at the Domaine.
All right?
It's verv important.
Get down! You're dead!
The longest throw wins!
- All right.
- I want to win!
Line up! First is Jacob.
Jacob, vou're here. One!
Aim high.
Two! Three!
Bravo!
All right, Andre.
One! Two!
Three! Go!
- Well done!
- Yes!
Come on. We'll go once more.
Get mine as well. Come on.
Got vou! Got vou, Jacob!
Got vou!
- You've heard the news?
- I saw them.
What did Vichv expect? The Germans walk right through when it suits them.
You should be proud.
Thev need an armv to fight vou now.
Thank vou.
- It's nice to see the bovs laughing.
- Yes.
We must be careful.
Do vou have news of their parents?
Nothing vet.
These were mv onlv clean clothes.
- The bovs seem well.
- Thev do!
- You'll contact...
- When I have mv next instructions.
Good.
You did well last night.
I should be Essential Services.
I had a companv in Birmingham.
Supplied parts for Ford.
Fucking war!
Do vou have something for me?
God, I hate this place.
You have no idea.
There's a drop coming. Tomorrow night.
These are the reference points.
Pass them on to vour frogs.
I know places that's a square meal.
I need to...
I need to ask a favor.
- Ask.
- I need to contact a colleague.
I think he's hiding in a safe house in Gillesse.
Your friend's name? What is it?
Peter Gregorv.
- He's a pilot. His plane...
- I'll make inquiries.
- It's verv important.
- I said, I'd make inquiries.
No!
Don't!
Leave me alone!
- Go awav!
- You're all right.
You're all right now.
You're just dreaming. It's a dream.
Jacob thinks vou're an angel because vou fell out of the skv. Is it true?
No.
- Is it all mv fault?
- What?
- That Mama and Papa went awav.
- No.
No, it's not vour fault at all.
It's the war.
- Will thev be all right?
- Yes, thev're going to be fine.
Monsieur Forav, disappeared!
Francoise Guilleme, disappeared!
Philippe Le Gentil, disappeared!
Jean Sauvier, disappeared!
Martine Perrault, disappeared!
Monsieur and Madame Duguav, disappeared!
Claire Ribiere, disappeared!
- Julien!

Robert Daladier, disappeared!
Pierre Rousse, disappeared!
Pierre Vallat, disappeared!
Julien!
We have to go!
Shut up!
Robert Daladier, disap...
We have to go, do vou understand?
- We got news of the bovs' parents.
- Good?
Thev've been moved to Poland.
What...? To another work camp?
I don't know.
- I'm sorrv vou had to come out to me.
- I work for vour father.
We're bound to know each other.
- What'll we tell the bovs?
- Nothing, vet.
I spoke to one of the gendarmes who took them awav.
He said he'd let the mother write a note, but...
...she took too long.
He had to go.
- The note was lost in the rush.
- Oh, God.
You spoke to vour contact?
- Yes.
- And?
- Drop's confirmed.
- I'll meet vou at the crossroads at 7.
I found this pushed under the front door. For vou.
Thank vou.
- Good news?
- Mavbe.
I don't know.
I have to go out.
Tell Julien, if he calls,
I'll meet him.
- I'll be as quick as I can.
- Don't forget curfew!
Papa, come on, quick.
Bve, Mama.
Shit!
Shit! Bloodv bike!
Need to pee!
Jesus!
God, that is good!
Oh, God, that is so good!
His aircraft.
What...?
- Where's Julien?
- He should be here bv now.
Reverse L, quicklv!
Jean-Paul. Claire!
On!
His papers were found near the bodv.
I shouldn't be here.
I should be in Birmingham.
This isn't me.
A few davs, vou'll be home, love.
You don't want to stav here.
People are betraving their neighbors to the Gestapo for being too noisv.
Nobodv's ordinarv now.
I'll make contact before vour plane comes.
Don't go out unless vou have to.
Dominique, I'm hungrv.
Plates, please, Andre.
- There's no jam. I want jam.
- This isn't a hotel.
- Mama alwavs has jam.
- I am not vour bloodv mama!
Eat up!
Come.
- I shouldn't have frightened them.
- Thev'll get over it.
But what'll I sav?
How will thev ever trust me again?
Thev will.
Children can forgive almost anvthing.
- Well, whv can't Julien forgive vou?
- Do vou think he's so angrv?
It's just sad, the wav the past holds on to vou.
Mv son's angrv because I'm all he's got. His mother died when he was 3.
I was a shittv father.
Too interested in work. Girls.
And now?
I'm too old for self-deception.
I am what I am.
Mv onlv shame is, I lived long enough to see mv countrv betrav itself.
Julien!
Take the bovs inside!
Come, quick!
- What are vou doing? Let go!
- You told them!
You told the Germans we were coming!
- I swear...
- You told them!
- I told no one!
- Shut up!
- Let go of me!
- I wasn't even there to warn them.
- I was late waiting for vou to come.
- I'm sorrv.
You know how manv thev shot?
Auguste. Claire. All of them!
There was nothing I could do!
I couldn't call out. The Germans...
I just watched! I just watched!
I couldn't...
Where were vou?
I had to report to mv contact.
I didn't have time to tell vou.
I swear I spoke to no one.
The onlv person who knew the coordinates was vou.
I swear.
Well, somebodv told them.
Thev knew the exact location.
Which field, which road.
Thev had map references down to the last tree.
She's telling the truth.
She was called awav. I saw the note.
She wouldn't do that.
Face the wall.
- These are vour papers?
- Yes.
This card shows vou crossed the demarcation line illegallv last vear.
The stamp is wrong.
In the car, please.
As a teacher, I see evervone.
Children, parents, grandparents.
There's nobodv I don't know.
Here.
We need to talk.
Sorrv.
Outside.
Where did the map references come from?
Don't approach me in public.
I'm keen on staving alive.
Thev were leaked.
- What are vou talking about?
- Thev were leaked.
The Germans knew. We had no chance.
It's nothing to do with me.
I just sav what I'm told to.
- Then how did thev find out?
- Who knows?
- Did vou know what would happen?
- Of course not!
I just follow instructions.
Whose instructions? London's?
London knows evervthing.
I'm onlv here for dodging import tax.
Mv mother was French.
It was this or the nick. Mv mistake.
When did vou first meet them?
Did vou approach them?
Thev approached vou, right?
Right. Where was it?
In a bar? On a train?
Were vou told to get me awav from there?
Were vou?
The Boches have come south to protect the coast.
North Africa's a goner.
Thev're losing. Evervone knows that.
London, the French.
Things change.
We're not just fighting the Germans.
You're saving thev'd do all this to get six little Communists?
You want to know who told the Germans?
It could've been half a dozen people.
An intercept. Someone in London.
Mavbe me. Mavbe vou.
If I was in vour position, I'd keep mv knickers on and mv trap shut.
Are vou gathering mv gist?
I think I understand vou.
Anvwav, vou're out of here.
Wednesdav, 0215.
Same place vou dropped in.
Even vou should remember that.
You stav here, vou're on vour own.
Could I help vou?
Forgive me. I'm Monsieur Renech.
You're wondering whv I'm here.
You see...
...l've been watching vou for some time.
It's childish, I know.
But vou are a beautiful woman.
What do vou want?
I felt it was mv dutv to warn vou.
- Warn me?
- A man from Paris arrived vesterdav...
...to help the Germans fulfill their Jewish quota.
I was fortunate, as a senior figure in Lezignac...
...to meet with this man.
He tells me that the Vichv government...
...has issued instructions on the deportation of Jewish children.
- Whv are vou telling me this?
- Your friend Julien...
...has the Duguav bovs in the house.
I heard them.
- Who told vou to come here?
- No, please.
Nobodv knows I'm here.
I came because...
...I want to be vour friend.
- I have to go.
- No, wait! Please, madame.
Wait! Stop!
Stop!
Turn, please.
No need for rudeness. I'm an important man. I speak to important people.
So vou will be mv friend...
...and the bovs will be safe.
IKiss me.
Tomorrow. I'm dirtv down there. We'll be together tomorrow, when I'm clean.
- Lf vou trv to leave, I'll kill vou.
- Tomorrow.
You will come. I know manv people.
You understand? Manv people.
I understand.
- Is anvone following?
- I don't think so.
- We should have warned Julien.
- Thev'll be watching him.
- Ah, madame.
- Is evervthing all right?
- Come on.
- Out vou get.
Come. I have some little babv kittens.
Thev were born two davs ago!
Bed's home!
Got vou!
I've won.
Dominique!
I have to go.
Listen carefullv, both of vou.
I need vou to stav here, in the attic.
It's important not to go downstairs unless Madame Cariteau takes vou.
Do vou understand?
What about eating?
Madame will give vou vour food,
Monsieur Jam.
I just need vou to stav here.
And trv not to make too much noise.
- Whv can't vou stav?
- Yes, stav.
It's safer this wav, sweetheart.
I'll be back tomorrow.
No fighting.
Could we stop a moment, please?
Do vou think it's possible for a person to commit a crime...
...without knowing it?
- No.
Thev can be part of it, but thev can't be responsible.
To be responsible, vou must know what vou do.
Could vou forgive vourself...
...if vou'd been part of something terrible but didn't know?
Yes, of course.
Otherwise, what use am I to anvone?
I don't think I know what I'm doing here anvmore.
- You moved the bovs?
- Yes.
- Thev're safe?
- For the moment.
You want some soup?
It's still warm.
- Where's Dominique?
- She went to rest.
Thanks for watching the bovs.
It's not easv.
All children are a pain in the ass.
I knew that alreadv.
Eat.
That's alwavs vour solution.
To eat.
Stav here tonight. You're tired.
Who is it?
Pichon.
We are from the mairie.
We'd like a word with vou.
Some gentlemen are here.
Put chairs out in the dining room.
Monsieur?
I'm sorrv about the dampness.
We never use this room.
Would vou like something to drink?
Sit down, monsieur.
Monsieur Levade.
Mv name is Paul Pichon.
I work for the Inquirv and Control section of the Vichv government.
- Verv distinguished-sounding.
- We've taken over some functions...
...of the police for Jewish affairs.
Last month, our government carried out a census...
...of all known Jews in the free zone.
Your name does not appear on it.
Do vou have a certificate of non-belonging to the Jewish race?
- Whv...?
- Your papers, please.
- Sorrv?
- Your documentation.
Your identitv card, ration card, work permit, if vou please.
- Evervthing?
- Evervthing, please.
Let me tell vou something about collaboration.
The aim of collaboration is, and alwavs has been...
...to safeguard the independence of French citizens.
It is our sincere belief that bv cooperating with the occupier...
...we offer France the greatest chance of fulfilling her destinv.
Indeed, I'd sav there is no greater act of patriotism than to collaborate.
- These papers aren't properlv stamped.
- I don't understand.
All relevant papers must be stamped "Jew."
- You know that!
- I know nothing about these things.
You didn't bring these people here about papers.
Excuse me? And vou are?
- He's mv...
- I'm his son.
Ah, ves, the son. Sit down.
According to our records, M. Levade's heritage mav not be entirelv French.
For this inquirv, we need to establish the origin of his grandparents.
- Thev were French.
- That's irrelevant!
How is it irrelevant?
He's French. I'm French.
- How French are vou?
- Julien!
He fought at Verdun.
Four vears in a trench.
No one questioned him then.
Monsieur, I mav be of help if...
Sure.
Julien?
A word with vou?
Julien!
Get on with it.
I know all about the Duguav bovs.
You've just moved them, haven't vou?
It's a teacher's business to know the whereabouts of his pupils. Is it not?
So vou see, we have a problem.
Monsieur Pichon has to fulfill his quota.
And to do so, he must either take vour father...
...or the bovs.
Of course, he doesn't know that vet.
It's up to vou.
Do vou need a moment to think?
I understand.
You have something to sav?
His grandparents were Jewish.
And if that makes mv father a Jew...
...then I'm Jewish too.
Actuallv, no.
According to current regulations, vou are onlv 1/8 Jewish...
...and therefore not a Jew.
However, we do have certain matters to discuss with vou.
I'd be obliged if vou'd stav in the house. The old man, please.
Don't let him go like that.
He needs clothes.
Quicklv.
Monsieur, please.
It's all right.
I haven't forgotten.
Here are vour clean clothes.
Julien.
We need to get to the bovs before Renech.
- Julien, we have to get out of here!
- What do vou suggest?
That I tell them I'm suddenlv...
...feeling more Jewish than mv father?
- You did the onlv thing vou could.
- For what?
For two bovs that will probablv die anvwav.
So do vou suggest we give up?
Whv did vou come here?
For France, dutv, I don't know.
I felt...
There was a man I loved.
You joined up for him?
Yes.
- What happened?
- He died.
- Oh, I'm sorrv.
- Whv should vou be?
Well, vou loved him.
We shouldn't talk like this.
It's not safe.
Your father, he's a good man.
He'll understand vou had no choice.
No, he won't.
IKiss me.
Come closer.
Hev!
Unbutton mv blouse.
Hev!
- Run!
- At the church!
Wake up. There's someone downstairs.
Listen.
There's nothing up there.
No! There's nothing!
Leave them alone.
Leave them alone! You bastards!
Leave them alone!
No!
- Andre! Jacob!
- Dominique!
I'll find vou!
- See vou soon.
- Yes, indeed, I hope so. Thank vou.
Good evening, little ones.
Mv humble abode.
Would vou care for a nightcap?
Thank vou.
- Such a prettv part of town.
- A little ricketv, but I like it.
Wait.
I was too late.
Thev're being taken awav bv train.
That was all I could find out.
For God's sake, sav something!
- We have to leave.
- No!
Dominique.
Renech's dead. I was seen.
There's nothing more to do.
- I'm not leaving.
- Think. Thev'll kill vou.
You want that? No?
Then leave with me.
We have a driver to take us to Toulouse. Then, the Pvrenees.
- Dominique...
- I am not leaving.
Listen to me.
If vou stav now, vou'll die.
And before vou die, thev'll torture vou. Then vou'll talk.
- You think that will help us to win?
- How can vou sav that to me?
- What, vou want to kill vourself?
- No.
Whv?
You can't stand to be alive when others are condemned to death?
You think it doesn't hurt to see mv father taken?
To know I can't help him or sav sorrv to him?
You think that does not hurt?
There's nothing I can do.
That's the truth now.
Except survive! That's how it is.
It's not enough!
- Dominique.
- It can't be enough.
- You did vour best!
- Don't sav that!
Mv best?
How dare vou sav that to me?
You don't know what I've done.
You don't know who I am.
You don't even know mv name.
Yes!
I have to do something.
There must be something to set against all this.
You have to go.
I'm sorrv. I'll be all right.
I'll use mv contact.
Please, go!
Now, for vour father's sake. Go!
Go!
Police! Open up!
Open up!
Check upstairs.
Yes?
Nothing.
Monsieur, please.
Hev, no baggage.
Andre! Jacob!
Andre! Jacob!
Jacob!
Duguav?
- Dominique!
- Dominique!
Jacob!
Dominique!
- Andre!
- In here!
Monsieur Levade.
Monsieur Levade! Here.
I have a letter.
From the bovs' mother.
Take it!
"Mv dearest little ones:
I hope that someone is reading vou this letter.
Papa and I are fine and well.
I'm sorrv I was not able to sav goodbve or write to vou earlier...
...but we had to leave so quicklv, and I've been working hard ever since.
We are doing war work in Germanv.
When it's all over, we will return.
But in the meantime, vou must be strong and look after each other.
Eat well, as well as vou can.
Even if sometimes vou don't feel like it.
Trv not to squabble.
And if vou go out anvwhere,
I want vou alwavs to hold hands.
Like vou do when vou cross the road.
We embrace vou with all our hearts.
Your loving Mama and Papa."
He was killed in North Africa...
If vou go through there...
...vou'll see the ladv from the Red Cross. Thank vou. Next?
- Mrs. Baxter, how manv dependents?
- Three.
Four.
Now, see that chap in Housing?
- He'll fix vou up with something.
- Thank vou, miss.
You coming to the pictures?
It's I Walked With a Zombie.
No, thanks.
- Tom Conwav's in it.
- I'll get an earlv night.
Suit vourself.
This came for vou this morning.
- You all right? You look peakv to me.
- Daisv.
I've gone, I've gone.
Have fun.
You got mv letter?
Yes, of course vou did.
I'm sorrv to spring it on vou.
It was a bit trickv getting awav.
How long have vou been in England?
A couple of months.
I wasn't too good when I got back.
Thev...
...told me vou were dead.
- I thought I was.
No, thev showed me photos.
There was a bodv.
It was the navigator.
I was kept hidden. Thev couldn't move me. I was going crazv.
- You all right?
- Yes. I'm sorrv, I just...
I can't quite...
It's good vou got back.
What about vou? What happened to vou?
I went to France.
See, vou never could persuade me not to go.
Whv did vou?
I think I thought I could find vou.
- Oh, Peter.
- What happened?
- Charlotte?
- You were right about war.
It makes fools of us all.
The rest, it kills.
Takes evervone time to recover.
The whole thing is such a bloodv mess.
You know...
...I never stopped thinking about vou.
We could go awav somewhere. Anvwhere.
- Peter.
- I'm due leave, we...
I can't go back.
I'm sorrv.
I wish vou'd listened.
Then I wouldn't have been mvself.
Hello.
Hello.
I didn't think...
No.
There's something I've been meaning to tell vou.
What?
Mv name...
...is Charlotte Grav.
You have anything to drink?
Are you drinking there?
Doctor!
- Cover his head anyway.
- Do as he says.
And what is this?
Get back down there.
We knew him.
- Get back... inside, both of you.
- I'd like to stay.
If they notice we're up here, you'll wish you were him if you don't already.
We don't need the doctor.
Go! We don't need you.
He's dead.
I said he's dead.
He's alive.
If he's alive,
I'm treating him.
Did anybody tell you to get him?
I didn't need to be told.
Did anyone say
"Go for the doctor"?
There's no point in arguing.
You see.
Done.
What?
Do it.
No! Please, no!
Easy, now. Easy.
What he wanted, that's all.
Don't come for me anymore.
Ask me for nothing.
That's easy.
Make sure they get his number.
Thank you.
Take the pack.
They're Hungarian.
I like our cigarettes.
It's shit tobacco.
I like ours.
What they need to do is invade Turkey and then you'll taste a cigarette.
Get going.
You trust the Poles?
What do I care?
The Poles.
They don't trust the Poles.
They don't trust anyone in Number3.
Me?
I can't say.
I'm Hungarian.
But you're here.
So because I'm with the Poles?
Rosenthal's worried. He's gonna say that we don't have the time.
I know, we don't have time.
They wait for lulls.
- If the front...
- That's not gonna happen for us.
- No one really knows that...
- Never.
There's planes almost every day now.
Not for us.
The Russians get 10 km from here we're the first to go right out to the pyres.
Everyone keeps saying that.
Believe it.
You're dead already, either way.
It's just a matter of deciding how.
You have gold?
Of course. So I say?
Tell him it's not happening is what you say.
Get back and tell them.
Go!
Move it out!
It's all a way of putting it off.
Do you need to be here?
Every day counts.
They've been on just as long as we have. They could go before us.
- I don't understand him.
- He doesn't decide.
He goes along. As far as
I'm concerned... He's no different.
They'd heard about the old man.
- Who?
- Abramowics.
- What'd he say?
- That... He'd heard.
- Have you told anyone?
- Everyone knows.
The Doctor had no business there. A man takes pills.
Why are you two in here?
We're nearly finished.
Nearly?
Inside. Yes, nearly.
- But not completely.
- I suppose not.
So I ask the question again.
Three of our men were shot this morning.
What business is it of yours?
We're gonna need replacements and Hungarians.
That's not your problem.
You say we're lazy or disrespectful, but don't leave us the manpower for the work.
Moll shot Lowenthal, one of our strongest men.
- You want things to go fast?
- If it's my neck.
We're going to be moving...
Why do you want to do that?
We're thinking of a reprieve.
Our group is happy to remain here.
Happy?
Why kill us now? We're the best kommando you've had.
Did I say kill?
We both know what we're saying.
So I'm a liar.
You're what you are.
It's not my decision.
Of course it's your decision.
No one is to leave their areas.
You're telling me it's not you're decision?
No one is to leave their areas.
- The Doctor leaves.
- The Doctor is different.
There've been people in the zones.
We haven't been.
We know what we see.
You're to keep with your units.
Each to each building.
- The bribes are taken.
- Nevertheless.
But we're going to need replacements.
Get back inside!
Or I'll be replacing you.
We missed you this morning.
Missed me?
- The data are on your desk.
- Good.
We've arranged for more forms.
You should have said.
- I'm sorry we had to ask.
- Please.
- What about the lenses?
- They're on the way.
You are an astonishing pathologist.
Thank you.
- That's not easy for you to hear.
- It isn't.
Something in you knows that our situation is unique.
And as a scientist, you are as true a one as I've known.
You understand...
...that when I'm sure every cell in your body tells you to do otherwise.
They do.
This isn't our war.
Not mine.
Nor mine, I can assure you.
But to allow this all to go to waist.
I understand your position.
Clearly, you do more than that.
As you wish.
Meaning?
There is no meaning.
We're going to be increasing the volume of our research.
I shall need more staff.
Then you shall have more staff.
Yes?
- Pardon?
- You want to say...
- It's...
- Yes?
We had discussed last time.
Of course.
This gets you anywhere in the camp.
- You wait until now?
- Me?
- This is too wrapped up.
- I got it that way.
- From whom?
- I never saw her face.
Where's Tsipora?
Where is she?
And?
And that's all I know.
I'd never seen her before.
- But they have her.
- I said that's all I know.
There's no way they don't.
I know Tsipora. They won't get a thing out of her.
It doesn't matter.
The point is keep going.
They'll find us like they found her and until then we get in.
It's hard to guarantee how much we'll get anymore.
This is a chain.
You find another link.
I just said we did.
We found a stupid link.
So what's the trouble?
You don't walk out of there everyday.
I do plenty more than that.
This isn't a contest.
Then don't make it one.
I'm prepared for anything, Dina.
- And so am I.
- You should be.
So, is there a problem?
If they find us, what do they do with the rest of our group?
You're risking your own life.
Why should we risk theirs?
You both act like we put everyone in here.
I don't make you do anything.
Be like them, both of you.
That isn't what she's saying.
The whole barracks will be punished.
They'll be before they're killed.
Just like us.
What's the fucking difference when you're dead anyway?
We made the choice, they haven't.
I'm not listening to this anymore.
Make sure these get into the cart.
How many bodies are there?
Eight.
You see, that's good.
The more bodies the better.
Get it?
I'll just take these two.
Idiots.
Is she right?
Of course she's right.
What have you been thinking for the past two months?
I just wish I could slap the shit out of her is all.
Ist ein problem?
Ist ein problem?
Keine Problem.
I feel sorry for the world if we don't win the war.
It's your position.
Men are tribal.
We'll end that.
There'll be one tribe.
No war.
There've been wars within your tribe.
Yes?
Rhoem? The Night of the Long Knives.
You know a good deal about Germany.
That, of course, was a putsch.
What's the difference?
A putsch is not a war.
It's a kind of war.
It's a putsch. If it meant war, the word would be unnecessary.
Why have two words for the same thing?
I'm German, you're Hungarian.
I should think I'd be the authority in this room on the German language.
Of course.
In spite of your obvious intelligence.
Of course.
There's a rumour around the Number3
Crematorium there'll be a rebellion.
The Number 3?
That would involve the First.
That would involve all 4, originating with the Poles in Number 3.
What would I know?
They think we're going to kill them.
Don't you always?
This is the best kommando we've had.
Alright.
You let them know that.
They don't trust me.
You're their doctor.
I'm their doctor but they know what I do.
What do they do?
They work under gunpoint.
I won't tell them what I don't believe.
That we'll let them live?
That you'll let any of us live.
What happens to you has little to do with me.
You're treated well.
Better than anyone.
You should let us know.
- They're not going to...
- If you hear anything.
That's all.
Did you ever consider, Herr
Oberschaarfuhere, that these...
...headaches might be related...
Yes?
...to the increase, lately, in the level of cargo.
Go on.
What I see in the courtyard, if
I just crack the window for some air.
Anyone would have difficulty.
You shouldn't be looking out of windows.
- I'm only suggesting...
- Your job is to diagnose.
Alright.
If I get upset, if my head aches, it's because I drink too much.
Then don't drink so much.
That's right,
I won't drink so much.
But that too should stay between you and me.
- I would never...
- That's right, you would never.
Because you're just as disposable as I am.
- Herr...
- I don't care! Shut up!
I don't care.
We're each of us a part of it.
Once any of you decide to live this way.
And you especially.
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.
Once you make that choice.
About half are in.
Yes?
Max, you'll botch this.
We don't have any choice.
It started with them.
So a bunch of Poles from Number 3 get to decide.
They get to stall it until it's right for them, and it's our people.
Who is our people?
On the fucking trains.
- Because they're Hungarian?
- Yes.
That's because Hungary's the only country with any Jews left.
But that's your reason?
If we were burning Polish
Jews you wouldn't care?
If we were burning Polish Jews we wouldn't be waiting.
What's another week to these guys?
Another ten thousand Hungarians?
They don't care about us.
We're all after the same thing, Max.
It doesn't seem like it.
Here he is.
Sorry.
It was hell getting over.
How is it over there?
They're locking us all in.
- Who said?
- Lopkowitz.
They're getting ready to liquidate another section.
Which one?
I'd guess one of the Czechs. Better for them, anyway. They're all starving.
Give me some vodka.
What's this?
Hungarian wine.
We got it in today.
Any gold?
They haven't come back yet.
Look here.
Check out the diamonds.
Lovely.
- I was gonna get it smelted, but...
- But what?
Smelt it.
Fine.
Looks like we got some god food in.
Smoked oysters, meats, a few cakes.
We should do alright tonight.
We hear you got more machine guns.
- Who told you?
- Hoffman found out.
- Were you gonna tell us?
- Of course.
Doesn't seem like it.
He just said explosives.
No.
Why do you think I came?
Because Hoffman told you to come.
No. I told Hoffman.
They were left inside the fence by the partisans. And twenty grenades.
Who has them now?
We do.
So we don't give any more of ours, you guys are better off now.
When did we ever need from you?
So what's this business about waiting?
- We have to re-coordinate.
- Why?
I don't like the way you talk with me.
You don't like the way I talk?
I don't like the way he talks.
Wait, you don't like the way I talk?
It's difficult to understand?
Why are we re-coordinating?
Again.
- We have more guns.
- We had guns.
You think the partisans aren't wondering why we've done nothing?
You think the women aren't wondering with the powder they've got in?
- The machine guns.
- So?
What?
Escape.
Wait. Who? Us?
You think you think we'll escape?
With guns.
So we kill more of them.
Destroy three of the crematorium.
And get out.
Is that what you're after?
If I get the chance, fuck yes.
You tell them, if this is about escape, we're out.
How can you speak for all of us?
You gonna speak for yourself?
Are you serious?
What, you're gonna go back to your normal life?
Forget that. The point is it doesn't make any sense.
You live to tell.
You're not going to live.
You won't make it to the Vistula.
Others have made it.
Others from the camp, not from the kommandos.
They'll give up on someone from Buna, or the camp...
...but not anyone who's been inside the crematorium.
What we could tell they'll turn Poland upside down.
If we want to accomplish anything, it has to be one thing.
One end.
And that's the machinery.
You've got to tell them this.
And there's no time left.
Do they know that?
Kommando 8 lasted three months and a week.
Not with this kind of cargo.
Even Moll admits...
Moll's not going to tell you.
And with them locking us in,...
Do you hear this?
You don't even speak German.
What the fuck does that matter?
I speak enough.
And I speak Yiddish.
- You speak Yiddish?
- From the Poles.
You heard from the Poles!
Shut up!
Mussfeld told me they are getting ready to move us.
No group has lasted more than four months.
- All he's saying is...
- I know what he's saying.
We could be massacred waiting...
...like every other group, thinking we're different.
Which'll be worse even than ting to escape.
We can tell them we can work this out.
But it has to be the crematorium.
Then they can do whatever they want.
You can run to high heaven.
But after we've done the buildings.
I'd like a bottle of that wine.
Give us the necklace.
Oh, c'mon.
It's good wine, you fucking Yid.
You won't get that smelted and it'll be of no use. We can get something for it.
- Two bottles.
- Fuck you.
Hoffman, give him two bottles.
Be careful.
They're liars.
What are they gonna lie about?
He wanted to keep the necklace.
He thinks he's going to live.
We're a fucking diversion.
These are Jews.
You keep saying that, Simon.
You trust Jews anymore?
No one would make it?
Suppose even you do.
Do you want to look anyone in the face if any of your family's even alive?
What you've done
For a little more life.
For vodka and bed linens.
Anja, listen to me...
...you're gonna die anyway.
We're dead.
They'll find the powder.
Don't say anything.
No matter what they do.
Don't say anything.
I love you.
This process of disinfecting is of vital importance to your health.
One louse can kill you.
Cleanliness brings freedom.
You're all fine.
The quicker you get undressed, the quicker you'll be cleaned, settled...
...and reunited with your families.
Filthy liar.
Remember the number of the hook you hang your clothes on.
He's a liar.
I can't believe it's
Jews doing this.
He's lying everyone.
He's a liar.
Stop it.
You should listen to your wife.
Think what you want to think, but don't cause trouble.
- I'm causing trouble?
- Please.
Look me in the eye and tell me
I'm not gonna be killed.
Hang your clothes on the hooks and keep them separate from your neighbours.
I'm gonna die, but I'll have lived longer than you ever will.
You're dead already.
Be quiet. You think you're gonna change something?
- That's right, what does it matter?
- At least I'll die with my dignity.
- Morris.
- Stop it!
At least I'll die with my dignity.
How'd you get through with herewith that?
What?
The watch, is what.
They'd have killed your whole car.
What does it matter?
See what you've done for yourself now? Give me the watch.
Why?
Give it to me.
You're bathing.
Why do you need the watch in there?
Get it from me after of the Nazis will.
- Do as he says, Morris.
- We always do what everyone says.
I'm not giving you anything.
You're attracting more attention.
Tell me, tell me I'm gonna live, you fucking Nazi.
Tell me I'm gonna live.
Morris, give him the watch.
He's a liar, everyone.
These Jews are all Nazi liars.
And now he wants to steal my watch.
- Give me the watch!
- No.
All I want is the fucking watch!
No!
No! Give him the watch!
Alright, let's keep it moving.
Remember what hooks you hang your clothes on.
The hooks are numbered. You'll need to return once you've showered.
Keep your shoes tied together by their laces so you don't lose them.
The sooner you shower, the sooner you'll be fed and reunited.
Move it, move it!
Keep moving inside.
Move it!
Move it! Move it!
David.
Stay.
David?
Do you want a drink?
No, thank you.
- You have work.
- Yes.
Always so young.
Adult siblings move away from one another.
- How's it going?
- Alright.
He'll make twins?
With German women?
That's the goal.
What's this?
A gall stone.
What are you keeping it for?
He takes an interest in such things.
- He collects them?
- I suppose.
In jars?
That's how I'm giving it to him. What he does with it after is his business.
So, have you heard anything?
Heard anything?
- I mentioned last time.
- I told you...
Yes?
They don't speak to me.
You found your wife and daughter.
Who told you?
Does it matter?
I don't suppose.
You've been several times.
Brought blankets, medicine.
Yes.
In C-camp, is it?
- He gave you a pass.
- Yes.
What did you think of it over there?
Think?
Did you tell them what goes on here?
Of course not.
Do they have any idea?
How couldn't they?
Everyone talks.
- You denied it.
- I did.
It's best.
They're going to be liquidating C-camp.
Who said?
Cuts in administration.
There's not enough food.
In the next two weeks.
We dispose of food.
The order is the order.
The entire section.
Two weeks?
That's what I said.
I'll speak with...
What does he have to do with who stays and who goes?
What does he have to do?...
Because he gave you a pass?
I can assure you it won't be allowed.
It will be easy to save them.
If there is an uprising in this camp there will be a massacre...
...that will far outweigh anything done to us.
These men will suffer.
That's a strange remark.
We let them live.
For a time.
Even if I... they don't.
Someone will speak.
I want to know you'll help me.
If I'm spoken to.
Whatever you hear.
Yes.
Good.
As for your wife and daughter... we must go to KZ Administration and get them transferred.
How?
Find out which are the safe convoys out.
They're sending some west to the munitions factory.
Have them volunteer.
They will be chosen.
It's safe?
I'm telling you I will make it safe.
That's what I'll do for you.
They must keep it a secret, though.
- If everyone volunteers...
- I know.
They save themselves, that's all.
Just like you.
You and your gall stone.
Your gall stone of a Jew.
How did you get the powder from the plant?
How did you get the powder from the plant?
It doesn't matter how they got the fucking powder.
What we need to know is where it's headed.
I'm asking her that.
You think I don't have ears?
You're asking her where it came from. It came from the plant.
The plant wants to know.
Of course the plant wants to know.
They should have wondered that before it happened.
You'll kill this one, too before she tells us who has it now.
Where was the powder headed?
Where was the powder headed?
This is what you want?
You're going to kill me anyway.
You won't be so lucky.
We will do worse to your entire block, after we're done with you.
Why don't you just gas them?
Revive her.
I got the girl.
You two got a date?
I said take the fucking body.
Why are you up here?
There's a girl...
I said what are you doing up here?
There's a young girl on that cart who survived the gas.
She's still breathing.
She'll be burned alive.
We're taking this one.
What do you mean, taking?
I mean taking the body.
Let me get the hair.
I said we're taking her, hair and all.
If she leaves with hair,
I need to know why.
She's a twin.
What's the trouble?
I need this body for the Doctor.
So let him get the hair.
What is it with you people?
We're taking now, with the hair.
If she's a twin, where's the other one?
The other one was caught before she got on the lift.
And why was she killed?
I thought they were taken alive.
Are you saying I'm lying?
I've kept this unit alive nine months.
What do I care?
So you're alive.
We're all alive.
We're all shitting gold.
Make your fucking point.
I don't want trouble.
If you want trouble, send me down to the Doctor with her head shaved.
Take her. What do I care.
Help them.
No, we've got her.
I said we fucking have her.
This will foul everything.
It's blood on our hands.
It's a goddam distraction.
And what do we do with her?
We figure that out.
We'll have to hide her.
And not just from them, but from some of us, too.
We do not have time to be dealing with this.
She was inside.
It'll be and she'll never make it.
What are you thinking?
I'm not going to kill her, alright?
Just think if they found her in the barracks, which they will...
...because you'll never keep her without it'll be worse.
How can that be worse?
Worse for her.
Forgetting what they'll do to us.
She's not even conscious. She goes the way she would have gone.
Meet us at the store room.
I can stop you, Max.
Stop me, then. Do it!
You know we're not killing her.
Where's Schlermer?
Down the corridor.
Where's she?
He won't bring her in until he talks with the Doctor.
Why? Get him.
Who's gonna watch?
What's to watch?
There's no one in the hall.
He won't let anyone near her.
You'd better get her in here.
Go.
I know what you think.
It's not the same.
He's scared.
We'll put her on this table.
If anyone were to find out...
I know.
We're not murderers.
I know that.
We're sorry.
I hadn't been here long enough.
- I'm talking about...
- I know what you're talking about.
- Of course.
- It doesn't mean I'd act differently.
I've aborted suicides before and would again.
- I understand.
- Anywhere.
I didn't.
I was summoned.
Not by me.
After midnight like this, to watch what amounted to a murder.
Something I hardly need to be woken for in this place.
I'm sorry.
- It's not how we...
- Then don't call for me.
I'm sorry.
- And you exclude me.
- Exclude you?
I don't know why you do that.
He told you?
Yes.
That there's no point.
I can't know until you bring her in.
If there's no hope, if she's dead already...
I'm at risk here, too.
I don't give a shit about you.
Bring her in.
Hoffman.
Get some blankets, some tea, some warm broth.
Here.
Well put it over her.
Not there.
How many of those will you give her?
She's had twenty minutes of gas.
Put it there.
It's alright.
Some tea.
Stop that! Let me do it.
Spoon.
This is just some tea.
Tea.
Good. Good.
- What was this convoy?
- Hungarian.
- Who found her?
- He did.
Where?
On the bottom.
The young are always on the bottom.
How was she lying?
Lying?
It's a simple question.
On her side, what?
On her belly.
Can you hear me?
Hello?
You must speak with me.
Hello.
What's your name?
Hello.
Hello.
This is gonna take time.
It'll take time.
So simple...
...and whom does it harm?
It harms only you.
If you refuse to tell us what we're going to know anyway... which is where was the powder going?
Where was the powder going?
Is this what you want happening to the people who have the powder...
...or to the rest of your block until we find them?
Where was the powder going?
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them. Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
You're not supposed to be in the zones.
I'm aware of that.
There were two girls caught with explosives in the Polish section.
You think we're suddenly chummy with the rest of the camp?
You have another piece for the way back?
I'll get it there.
You're not supposed to be in the zones.
You said that.
Give me the other piece.
And have two for the way back.
Or you won't be slapped, you'll be shot.
No one's gonna harm you here.
We're Jews.
Are you Hungarian?
Yes, she's Hungarian.
The point is simple questions.
Give us some more of that soup.
We're going to be found here.
He's right.
We're not moving her.
It's been over 2 hours since we started the lifts. Someone will come right past.
And do we cart her down the hall without getting through the unit?
The unit doesn't know?
What would that do?
At least get her off the corridor.
Fine. The changing room.
The changing room?
I said.
Go see if it's clear.
We're gonna move you. Into another room, you'll be more comfortable.
She's alive, you know.
Where can you keep her?
We can't.
This is a problem.
Yeah, it's problem.
Because we've revived her.
You understand that.
This wasn't my idea.
But she's been revived.
We have a responsibility.
Otherwise...
Otherwise?
Why did we revive her?
- If you tell Mussfeld.
- No.
- If you speak with him.
- Me?
The two of you.
What? Are friends?
None of us is going to talk with Mussfeld.
He will not allow this girl to live.
He doesn't save people.
Your family?
Who told you?
We heard.
You got the run of C-camp...
...and found your wife and kid.
You wouldn't do the same?
- And got them out.
- You wouldn't do the same?
- I wouldn't have the chance.
- That's not what I asked you.
I didn't have the chance.
If we tell Mussfeld, she's finished.
You hide her.
One of the doctors.
Impossible.
They walk in at all hours.
It has to be...
No. I said no.
For a few days.
What few days?
We're almost sixteen weeks.
Plus with men who've been who've hardly seen a...
...and she's what, fifteen?
Put her in your bed.
She's not staying with us, alright? I want her out.
Forgetting for a minute she's a girl... what do you gain by putting her with us when we're about to be...
Until what?
A suitable time.
There isn't going to be a suitable time.
A day or two.
We don't have a day or two.
Nonsense.
What?
There's going to be an uprising.
When?
Alright, who?
Numbers 1 and 3.
How?
Out of Number 3.
An escape?
We're going to destroy the crematorium.
You'll all be killed.
The things that come out of your mouth.
We're to be killed within the week.
How do you know?
Like I said, we're almost four months.
We're dead.
Our time's up.
Were you going to ask for our help?
Ask for your help?
The doctors.
Were you going to ask for our help?
Even tell us?
I never asked to be doing what I do.
You volunteered.
They wanted doctors for a hospital.
You knew the sort of work you'd be doing, and you continue to do it.
I don't kill.
And we do?
I didn't say that.
You give killing purpose.
We're all just trying to make it to the next day.
That's all any of us is doing.
You have no idea, do you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I do not wish to be alive when all of this is over.
I don't believe that.
I know you don't.
I can help you.
You want to help?
Get rid of this fucking girl.
Where have you been?
What do we got?
Plenty, but very little gold.
You're gonna have to divvy up.
They've got three of the women.
Where?
Block eleven. Someone says we're hiding a girl still alive?
Keep everyone away from this area.
- Is it true?
- We'll be up.
We heard. We got problems of our own.
- What's he doing?
- I told him.
You told him?
I just told him. Come on.
- Why are you here?
- What's this about?
She survived the gas.
What're you gonna do with her?
What're you gonna do with her?
Why is he here?
They caught three of the women for the Unio, found powder.
Here?
In the camp.
How do you know?
They didn't come with the powder and we found out. As far as we know...
They've been stealing and they aren't going to find out where it was going?
I didn't say that.
- They are being tortured right now?
- Of course they are.
How long did you expect this to go on, before they were caught?
- We couldn't have...
- We couldn't have what?
We couldn't mustered together at any time once we decided it was time...
- No, we couldn't...
- Oh, God dam, no we couldn't have.
That's a lie.
It was...
- It was who? The Poles?
- No, it was the whole group.
So we waited for this to be killed without the chance.
There are two women being tortured right now.
Why are they being tortured?
Why are we still burning day after day?
Because we've waited. Because suddenly this became about escape.
And let's get it straight,
Hesh.
You were gonna deal us out.
We were just a fucking diversion.
How many times does this have to be gone over?
Every gun you guys have got you've kept and we find out about it later.
Not shit from you guys.
Only plans and delays.
Your plans.
We changed our plans.
Changed your plans, but only after we decided we'd be out.
Had to make a deal, re-coordinate.
But were you gonna stay wait until two crematoria were done...
...or let us do that and run run...
...like you always wanted to, while we stayed and fought?
I don't know.
But when we're through with the machinery, I can't run?
I have to stay here and be shot because that's what you want to do?
Because you can't live with it, I can't?
Fuck you, Max.
It's my fucking life.
I hope I live till I'm ninety.
Now we're ready to go today.
- What?
- Today?
Between the shifts.
Why else am I here?
To argue with this idiot?
- Who starts the fire?
- Us.
You see how easy it is once the decision is made.
We have to tell the unit.
An hour. Everyone knows what to do. It's a matter of when.
What about the girl?
What about her?
What do we do with her?
What do we do with her?
- It's got to be now, Max.
- We get her in the fence.
Out?
- The fence into the camp.
- You'll never.
- In a group we could.
- A group is worse.
- It doesn't have to be.
- We're locked in.
Don't do this.
An excuse could be found.
The Doctor's right.
We shave her head, dress her she looks like a boy.
What happens on the other side of the fence?
She gets taken in.
- Which camp?
- Does it matter?
Yes, it matters.
What do they do with her?
How do they account for the extra?...
This is Germans we're talking about.
They stand corpses up in the snow...
They're going to suspect someone of breaking in?
Breaking in from here.
She's not even numbered.
Don't fuck this up for one life!
You'll be shot and so will she.
Then there's alert and today's impossible.
He's right, Max.
It'll drag us down.
No single person is worth that.
Look at her.
Does she even have a mind left?
Can she speak?
We don't know.
Can you speak?
The gas got to her.
Why are you even considering?
- We don't kill people.
- We don't?
We put them in the rooms, walk them in and strip...
...them look them in the face and say it's safe.
What the hell is that?
- It's not...
- It's not what?
It's not pulling the trigger.
You leave the room.
Bring them in and leave say it's safe, you'll see them when it's over.
Who put her inside? Now you think she made it through.
God knows how you're a hero.
Not a hero.
Not a hero, not a killer.
What are you, Max?
Better we do it than them.
I'll make it easy for you.
We can solve this another way.
I'll fucking kill you!
You won't do shit.
We're not going to kill her, alright?
I'm not saying we shouldn't have, but we're not gonna do it now.
On the bench here.
What about me?
What about you?
If he sees me we're fucked if he sees me.
There's hundreds of He's not gonna know you. Just keep still.
He wanders around half drunk.
It's a fucking check.
Why is this door shut?
We were organizing the morning muster.
Organizing?
With Lowenthal... Gone.
We settled that.
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer, but now with one short...
Who's going to replace him?
He is.
He's not capable.
You!
Yes, Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.
And who replaces him is your business.
That's just the thing.
- What happens with...
- The duties in the room stay the same.
Yes, sir.
It's miserable outside.
I've grown to hate Poland.
How are you, Doctor?
I'm well.
Do you want to come over for a drink?
I have some Hungarian wine some brandy.
Later.
- If you've got a chill...
- I said no.
There's a convoy arriving...
...and your group haven't finished with the cargo from this morning.
- We just have to...
- You have to clear the elevators.
Yes, sir.
And it's filthy down there.
Yes?
What?
Why are you here?
Here?
This isn't your unit.
This isn't your building.
To help.
How did you get over?
I was moved.
- By whom?
- Almaier.
That's not true, is it?
Of course it's true.
That's how it'll go for all of us.
First you, then us.
The last thing to do is smile.
Your bombers only speed it all up.
We'll dispose of as many of you as we can before they do it to us.
Why was he here?
He was moved.
He was not moved!
You were to stay with your groups.
Why were the women from the Unio hoarding powder?
Why were the women from the Unio hoarding powder?
We let you live.
You're not gonna let us live.
If something is attempted, that's certain.
If you think we have powder, tear apart the crematorium.
Move away from the bench.
Where did she come from?
Doctor?
Everybody out.
You give orders now?
It won't help anyone if there's a row.
How will the work get finished?
Everyone out.
I'll take care of this.
What do you mean, take care of this?
I want what you want.
Don't speak Hungarian!
What are you saying?
Leave quietly. Leave.
Let's go.
Save her. You've got to fucking save her.
Shut him up. Take this with you.
And burn it with the others.
I've seen them strike the ones that are slow getting in.
Hey steal, lie to each other.
I never fully despised the Jews...
...until I experienced how easily they could be persuaded to do the work.
To do it so well.
And to their own people.
They'll be dead by week's end eve soul...
...and we'll replace them with others' no different.
Do you know how easy that'll be?
Who are you?
She doesn't speak German.
I don't even think she speaks.
- You don't understand me?
- She's from a convoy.
I didn't imagine she's from Osweicum.
- This morning's convoy?
- Of course.
So you're Hungarian.
They took her out from the undressing room?
Why her?
She's related to someone?
She survived.
Survived what?
The gas.
All I can think is that, with the wet floor...
It kills everyone.
If there was a pocket of wet air...
Should we speak in private?
If she doesn't speak German, what's the problem?
I find it difficult to stand here and discuss while...
What's to discuss?
I have the information you requested.
The information?
At the time you saved my wife and child.
Tell me here.
I don't want to tell you here.
You.
Stay here with her.
If you take her out from here, both of you will be killed.
Stay here.
I used to think so much of myself.
What I've made of my life.
We can't know what we're capable of, any of us.
How can you know what you'd do to stay alive until you're really asked?
I know this now.
For most of us...
...the answer is anything.
It's so easy to forget who we were before.
Who we'll never be again.
There was this old man.
He pushed the carts.
And on our first day... when we had to burn our own convoy...
...his wife was brought up on the elevator.
Then his daughter.
And then both his grandchildren.
I knew him.
We were neighbours.
And in twenty minutes...
...his whole family and all its future was gone from this earth.
Two weeks later he took pills and was revived.
We smothered him with his own pillow.
And now I know why.
You can kill yourself.
That's the only choice.
I want them to save you.
I want them to save you more than I want anything.
I pray to God we save you.
You can hear me, can't you?
I thought so.
Yes. I thought so.
I don't understand, Doctor.
I don't know how I can make it clearer.
Dr. Mengele says you're the best surgeon he's seen ever.
I Jew, even, and he admits it.
Which is astonishing.
He says you do the work of five men.
That without you his research would be impossible.
Where is this leading?
Your expertise has quintupled the torture.
I haven't...
Has quintupled the torture of children in this camp...
...and that is fact!
So that you can live here as you do, which is better than any other Jew.
And better than all but a handful of Germans.
Including me.
I haven't seen you once protest...
...and as the workload has increased.
And you've saved your family.
We do what we do.
You make up for that with the life of this one girl?
I don't pretend.
Good.
Don't.
And who is to die in her place?
No one lives here without someone else dying.
I don't believe that.
It's a fact of the camp.
It's numbers.
There's only so much food, so much room.
This is one child.
Which you could say about anyone.
Your wife and daughter.
You save one, you take the life of another.
Put her in a bed, give her food someone else doesn't get...
...dies or is removed.
To save her is a meaningless lie.
It's your lie,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.
We want the girl to live.
If you tell me this information,
I will spare the girl.
There's going to be an uprising.
When?
I don't know. They don't want me to be a part of it.
And they have powder.
The women got them powder?
- I said I don't know.
- Why did they tell you?
Because of the girl.
Because they wouldn't hide her.
- Who told you?
- The one you killed.
How did you speak with him?
He was here, wasn't he?
That's why you shot him.
No one else here speaks with me.
- But they have powder?
- I don't know.
- Weapons?
- I don't...
But powder from the women.
That's where the powder went.
I've heard nothing else.
- This information is useless to me.
- It's all I was told.
It's not worth the life of the girl.
You agreed.
Wrong, Doctor. I agreed to save your wife and daughter, which I have done.
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer...
There's nothing more to discuss.
What about your headaches and your drinking?
Excuse me?
I'll tell him you're unfit.
And they won't move you somewhere else.
I'll want to see her.
Not a hair on her head, and on the other side.
Through the fence, if you'd like...
...but numbered, shaved and alive.
And to live isn't to kill,
Herr Oberschaarfuhrer.
Because we are not doing the killing.
No. Please, no!
Because she knew.
Because all of you know.
And these two know.
I could say I don't want to be doing this but that wouldn't be true.
It's less bodies for us to worry about.
Keep track of.
Feed.
So, do us a favour and remain silent.
But you don't seem to be enjoying it...
...murdering your friends to protect... who?
Polish partisans who hate you?
Sold Jews...
...and stole from Jews early in the war.
One by one...
We can do this until we're done with your whole group...
...and then we'll move to the next block.
Or one of you any of you...
...tell us where the powder is, where it was headed.
They don't know.
None of them know.
Tell them, please.
Tell them.
They don't know.
Don't you think they would say?
You know, and you're silent.
Stop the killing.
You know, because you had to have been approached.
And you are getting it for somewhere.
Stop the killing.
Please. Please.
No! No!
Don't shoot her!
Get a proper count.
It's all sentimental.
Do you understand sentimental?
Because they look you in the eye twice.
Once before and once after.
Suddenly they believe in heroics.
You wait here.
Hold her in here until I get back.
Don't leave her.
They're saving her.
No, Max, the Doctor will make certain.
You saw, or they told you?
The Doctor told me.
We did this.
Listen to me, listen.
What's going to happen to her will happen, no matter what you do or see.
You're right, we did it.
We saved her.
The best thing you can do is to finish the day quietly and wait for later.
That's it.
That's it for you.
The goddam end.
Hoffman, you have to get over to the
Third, tell them about Abramowics.
How am I to get through?
We'll load you up.
Here.
Exactly what happened.
I don't speak Yiddish.
Well, you can fucking convey somebody getting shot.
And don't try to come back.
We're not waiting for you.
- I talked to her.
- Yes?
I talked, she understood.
What are you saying?
- We were alone while...
- Did she talk?
I said I talked.
What did you say?
- Everything.
- Everything?
You told her?
You would have, too.
What do you know what I would do.
You would have.
What does that do for her?
Maybe it did something for me.
Fuck what it did for you!
What do you need?
She'll know who we were.
And why does she need to know that?
I don't know.
That's right. You don't know.
Do you?
- Get going.
- Fuck off! I'm going.
Do you?
Fire! There's fire!
He said between the shifts.
Cohen, Lowy, we won't have time to organize the groups.
Get the guns and down into the corridors and barricade the doors.
Let's go!
Let's go, let's go!
Go see what's happening.
Get the fuel drums.
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer?
Have you seen the Oberschaarfuhrer or any SS men with a young girl.
No!
Please, have you seen a young girl? She was alive.
We've only got two drums up there.
We're nearly out of explosives.
They're only the machine guns.
I don't need to know.
Go tell Schlermer.
We're dead up here.
Move down, move down!
Kaminski needs bodies in the furnace room.
We're setting the explosives.
Have you seen Mussfeld with a girl?
We need you in the furnace room.
Come on!
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get out!
Get out!
Surrender if you want to live.
It's over.
We're gonna blow the room!
Do it!
Why don't they kill us.
Did you ever see her?
No. Did you?
Why am I asking?
Why aren't they killing us?
The Russians will be here before the year's out.
If it weren't that, we would never have pulled this off.
You hid.
Will I be killed?
Do you want to be killed?
You would have fought.
Wouldn't you have?
I've spoken with Dr. Mengele...
...and assured him that you had nothing to do with any of this.
That you knew and did nothing.
You will continue with your work.
That's right, Doctor.
We will both continue with our work.
Because that's what the living do.
We will have saved each other, then.
We needn't save anyone else.
In Budapest, mostly.
My wife was from the city.
But we stayed north.
I still don't know why.
It's beautiful there.
Yes, it is.
But we were finally gonna move near her family.
- Where did they live?
- Near the markets.
We would be neighbours.
Will they kill her?
They're gonna show her this then let her live.
But why wouldn't they have done it already.
You're asking for reasons.
I guess I was.
We did something.
Yes.
We did.
Yes. Bye.
Neighbours.
After there vo It, half the ovens remain...
...and we are carried to them together.
I catch fire quickly.
The first part of me rises in dense smoke...
...that mingles with the smoke of others.
Then, there are the bones... which settle in ash.
And these are swept up to be carried to the river.
And last...
...bits of our dust simply float there...
...in air, around the working of the new group.
These bits of dust are grey.
We settle on their shoes and on their faces...
...and in their lungs.
And they become so used to us...
...that's on they don't cough and they don't brush us away.
At this point, they're just moving...
...breathing and moving.
Like any one else, still alive in that place.
And this is how the work...
...continues.
German bandits at two o'clock!
Increase throttle! Power dive!
Spell it right, Rafe.
"Rudder" is spelled with two Ds.
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.
Whoa, bandits!
Crack shootin', Danny.
Crack shootin', Rafe.
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.
Great flyin',Dad!
Come on.
I'm gonna teach you how to fly.
I get the front!
No, you take the back.
I'm bigger, and I should be in front.
I'm older, and I'm teachin', so no.
Wow.
It's like we're really flying.
Yeah, I did it lots of times.
Come on, you man the guns.
I'll give her some throttle.
We gotta get those dirty German bandits.
Oh, gosh!
- Hang on!
- Make it stop, Rafe!
I've seen my dad do this lots of times.
Don't worry!
Rafe!
Oh, my gosh! We're flying!
We're flying!
Whoa! Uhh!
Wow.
My dad's gonna kill me.
Come on.
Yes! Whoo-hoo!
We flew!
We flew! Yes!
I'm a pilot!
- I know!
- Yeah!
We flew.
- You no-account boy!
- Daddy-
I done told you, you spend time playing... with this stupid boy can't read... you ain't never goin' to amount to nothin'!
He ain't stupid, Daddy!
Daddy!
Ohh!
Come on!
Uhh!
Get on back home. Now!
Get on up.
You got work to do.
Come on! Come on, get on home!
Uhh!
You let him alone!
Daddy, no!
I will bust you open, you dirty German!
What'd you call me?
I fought the Germans in France.
And I fought 'em in the trenches.
And I pray to God no one ever has to see... the things that I saw.
You're my bestfriend.
Daddy, wait!
Daddy, wait.
Adolf Hitler... builds the German military machine... and drags all of Europe into war.
But even while France falls to Hitler...
America still refuses to join the fighting.
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.
Alright, Danny.
Now let's show 'em how to fly.
We're gonna play chicken.
You ready?
This ain't the farm, and these ain't no cropdusters.
I'm not playing chicken with you.
Now don't be a baby.
I'll tell you what-
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- Well, I'm coming right at you.
You can turn, or you can hit me.
It's up to you.
What the-
Oh, boy.
Why you always bustin' my ass, Rafe?
Which way you goin'?
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.
OK, we're goin' left, right?
Ri-uh, right. Right?
Right like we're goin' right, or right like we're goin' left?
Well, now you got me all mixed up!
I don't know.
Make up your mind.
God, Rafe, we're going right!
Righty-tighty!
Aah!
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Those are some smooth aces.
Did you say something?
'Cause let me tell ya, those farm boys are grounded!
Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable use... of m-m-military aircraft, sir.
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.
Get those hedge-hoppers in Doolittle's office.
After two years of training... you believe that a $45,000 airplane... is there for your amusement?
No, sir.
I was just trying... to keep my edge, Major.
And when you did the outside loop last week... what did you think that was?
Honing your skills?
That's not training, McCawley.
That's a stunt.
And I personally consider it to be reckless... and irresponsible.
Major...
How could that be, when you're famous... for being the first man in the world ever to do it?
Don't get cute with me, son.
No, sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful.
I just think that- well, I-
It is reckless and irresponsible... if you're just doing it to be a show-off.
But I was doing it to try to inspire the men, sir... in the way that you've inspired me.
I believe the French even have a word for that... when the men get together to honor their leaders.
They call it an homage, sir.
- A what?
- An homage, sir.
That's bullshit, McCawley!
But it's very, very good bullshit.
Thank you, sir.
McCawley, you remind me of myself fifteen years ago.
Which is why we need to discuss this.
Have a seat, son.
The British have accepted you into the Eagle Squadron.
You're on your way to England tomorrow... if you still want to go.
Huh. Wow.
Just a few British pilots are all that stand... between Hitler and total victory in Europe.
They're gonna need all the help they can get.
Yes, sir.
Well, I'm on my way.
Just for the record...
I'm supposed to ask you to reconsider.
Sir?
Sooner or later we're gonna be in this war... whether we like it or not.
And I'm gonna need all of my best pilots.
So it's my duty to ask you to stay.
Major, what would you do?
If it was me...
I'd go.
Get out. Am I going bald right back here?
Ooh!
Man, I am one good-lookin' son of a bitch.
Don't you ever die.
Die. That's exactly... the concept you gotta work tonight.
You put a drop of this clove oil under your eyes... and you let 'em sting and well up.
You get your nurse alone, take a breath... let her see your eyes glisten... and say, "Baby, they're training me for war...
"and I don't know what'll happen...
"but if I die tomorrow,
I want to know...
"that we lived all we could tonight. "
Come on, guys!
We got nurses waitin'.
Come on, before the rest of his hair falls out.
How could you do this?
Well, Doolittle assigned me.
He wanted me to get some real- real combat training in.
Well, guess what?
It's not training over there.
It's war.
Where the losers die, and there aren't any winners- just guys who turn into broken-down wrecks... like my father.
Yeah, I understand that, Danny.
But I feel like
I got a duty to go.
Don't preach to me about duty, damn it.
I wear the same uniform you do.
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.
But why go looking for it?
God, Danny, come on.
I'm gonna be twenty-five.
I might as well be an old man.
They're gonna have me bein' a flight instructor.
I don't wanna teach loops and barrel rolls.
I wanna be a combat fighter.
Hey, come on!
The nurses can't d- d-dance by themselves.
Let's go.
If the call of duty means seeing 150 men... in their underwear every day... we are here to serve.
I can't believe it.
Saturday night in New York City.
Do you know what they're doing where I come from?
Nothing.
Cow-tipping.
Well, that's why you joined the Navy, hon'.
To get out of that dusty little town and see the world.
May I remind you, Barbara, we're Navy nurses, not tourists.
I joined to do my patriotic duty and... to meet guys.
Me, too.
Girls, we're gonna have so much fun tonight in the city.
You've gotta tell them the story, Evelyn.
What?
Oh, come on. Tell us.
Oh, it's such a long story.
We got time.
I saw it happen.
Well, it was about four weeks ago...
What do you think is b-b-better?
All in the one cheek, or spreading them out?
OK.
Fusco, Anthony.
You all right, buddy?
Sweetie, do you really have to do this?
I'm not gonna get yellow fever in my barracks.
No? If you'd rather, she can do it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just gimme a minute.
Honey, the government says stick 'em, we stick 'em.
Uh!
Hey, Red, you alright?
Eye exam number four?
Listen, Doc, I have passed a dozen medical checks.
You write that, they won't let me fly.
Sorry, son.
I'm gonna fail.
They're gonna take my wings away.
No, they won't. Just relax.
Read the bottom line, please.
Just keep practicin' the bottom line.
And don't worry.
I'm right behind you.
J- L-M-K-P-O-
Next.
Ma'am.
J- L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.
Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.
Slow down, flyboy.
And, instead of the bottom, read the very top. Both eyes.
Yeah.
"C"- sorry, "J."
Ahem. "C"...
- "W."
- "W."
- "Q."
- Uh, "Q."
Uh, "'Q."'
Read the bottom line again, please.
But read it right to left and every other letter.
"E."
Heh. "'X."'
- X-E.
- X-E.
X- E, ma'am.
Ma'am, I know how this looks.
I'm sorry, Lieutenant,
I really am.
But Army and Navy requires 20/20 vision.
Oh, i-it's-it's not a problem with my eyes.
I mean, I can see.
I mean, I can hit a running rabbit with a $3.00 pistol.
I got a problem with letters, that's all.
Well, maybe after some schooling... you could come back and take the test again.
No, I had schooling.
I mean, I-the teachers just never knew... what to make of it.
It's just letters.
I mix 'em up sometimes.
That's all.
I mean, I just get 'em backward sometimes.
L- look here. Uh, my-my math and-and spacial reasoning... and my verbal scores are all excellent.
But you barely passed the written exam.
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.
Ma'am, I-I'm never gonna be an English teacher.
But I know why I'm here.
To be a pilot.
And you don't dogfight with manuals.
You don't fly with gauges.
I mean, it's all about feeling and speed... and lettin' that plane become like a part... of your body.
And that manual... says that a guy who's a slow reader can't be a good pilot.
That file says I'm the best pilot in this room.
Ma'am, please, don't take my wings.
Well, I felt so bad.
Evelyn, rotate to station three.
I had no choice.
I passed him.
- Good.
- Uh-huh.
So, then this cocky pilot comes back.
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.
"Yeah"? Boy, you're talking to an officer.
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.
Ma'am, I didn't get a chance to thank you.
Drop your skivvies.
Ah, oh, OK.
Just like this?
That's fine.
He did have a very cute butt.
You know, I know you didn't have to pass me... and you did. And I just-
I didn't think you'd understand, and you did.
You know, you still haven't said thank you.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.
You're like my hero now.
Actually, my father was a pilot.
And, um, I've seen first-hand what happens... when a pilot loses his wings.
You know what?
Your father's my hero, then, too.
Infact, as an officer,
I think it'd by my duty... to take my new hero's daughter out tonight...
Just to-aah!
Gosh, did I poke too deep?
I think you hit the bone there.
You are so mean.
What? So is- is there any chance... that you might, kind of, sort of... you know, like me, or...
Oh, how did you guess?
They never taught us... how to deal with this... feeling.
Wh-what feeling?
Well, it's kind of like... this.
Ow!
Well, he was getting fresh, so I poked him again.
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.
Hold on a second.
Miss...
I really, really lick you.
What did he mean?
Like you.
I didn't mean to say that.
And I just, um...
I just want to ask you, please, if I can donate dinner.
He started to act very strange.
Or, well, buy you dinner.
This isn't your chart.
Whoa.
No. That's the, uh, this, uh, fellow over here's.
I think he left.
Have you already had this shot?
Yeah, well, once... already.
Well, I wanted-
I mean, can I ask you out?
No!
And he just went wham!
Unh!
Oh! What'd you do to him?
Poor guy.
Hey!
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?
Uh, yeah.
I'm fine. I feel great.
This is just standard precautionary... thing.
Look, I got some, uh, genuine French champagne... from France.
I thought, you know, maybe we could celebrate.
Celebrate what?
Oh, I don't know. Uh, well, you being my hero, for one.
OK. Why not?
So, uh, ahem...
I wanted to thank you.
And I just wanted to, uh... put your mind at ease about passing me... because I really do think you did this country a service.
I mean, I'm-
I am a great flier.
And if you have a fault, which you obviously don't... it's modesty.
No. If I have a fault, it's candor.
You are just so-
Uhh. Cork just got away from me.
God, oh, it hurts.
It hurts something fierce.
I'm sorry.
- Ohh...
- Oh, it's bleeding.
- God.
- Oh!
- Ohh!
- Lay still.
I ruined everything.
- Lay still.
- Oh, it hurts.
- Ow! It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.
Yeah. I can't breathe.
Lay still.
You are so beautiful it hurts.
It's your nose that hurts.
No. I think it's my heart.
And then I kissed him.
Oh, Evelyn.
That's the most romantic story
I ever heard.
It's been the most romantic four weeks and two days of my life.
Oh, I'm so jealous.
Hello, Lieutenant.
- It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.
Pick a hand.
It's beautiful.
What's in your other hand?
Mine.
Well, it took me six hours to fold these.
Oh!
I want you to meet my friends.
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra-
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.
Would you happen to have any friends?
Huh. Take your pick.
Hi.
Whoo!
We ever get in this war and somethin' happens to me...
I can't tell you how good it makes me feel to know... that someone as sweet as you will be there... to nurse me back to health.
Good, but we're not in the war yet.
- Ahem.
- OK. That was a bad line.
Hi.
I'm-I'm Red.
Red-
S- s-s-s-strange.
Heh heh.
Your last name's Strange?
Yeah. She's all yours, soldier.
No. It-it's Winkle.
Red is such a ladies' man.
Do you always stutter?
No. Only when I'm-
She's totally buying it.
- Nervous?
- Yeah.
Why can't I get something like that?
Hello.
Hi.
Danny seems kind of shy around the girls.
Tsk. It's not that he's shy.
He's just, ahem... a little unsure of himself, you know.
His old man used to run him down a lot.
Get him in a plane, he's sure of himself.
He's like my brother.
He's like my best friend.
He's my right hand.
Which at the moment is a long way south of my waist.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess I lost a little altitude.
Yeah, I guess you did.
Excuse me.
You and me, we got to talk.
So, the rumor is the Navy's shipping us to Pearl Harbor.
Well, won't be so bad.
It's about as far from the fighting as you can get.
You'll get a sun tan.
So maybe the Army'll post you guys there, too.
You... are a super special woman.
And, and, well...
Well, they're- they're training me... to be a big bad warrior, and, well...
So, I mean, you never know what might happen tomorrow... or... or any day after that, you know?
So...
God, we need to make tonight super special.
Why are you crying?
I guess it's the thought... that I might not ever get to see you again.
Dry your eyes, toots.
Tonight, you're mine.
I don't want to be with a crowd tonight.
I just want to be alone with you.
Well...
How does New York Harbor by moonlight sound?
Ohh! Heh heh!
Are you gonna be a bad influence?
Of course I'm a bad influence.
Let's see if we can commandeer this vessel...
'cause we're, uh, officers of the U.S. Government.
Not for long, we won't be.
One day, we'll take a trip on a boat like that.
Would you like that?
We'll be dressing for cocktails and walk into the grandsalon.
No one's talking about war.
They're just dancing to Cole Porter.
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.
- You're out of your mind.
- Oh, yeah.
Careful now.
Here, sit down.
Now let's see here.
Ah! There we go.
See, this is as close as I could get you to your ship.
So, at least I tried, right?
Actually, you know what?
This is better.
Yeah, it is.
God, you're pretty.
What's gonna become of us all, Rafe?
Well, the future's not exactly in our hands, is it?
No. I guess you're right.
- Aah!
- Aah!
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?
Yeah, are you?
That was not part of the date.
Watch your step.
Oh, thank you.
Evelyn!
Guys, come up! Come on up!
Come up! We're in 321.
There's something
I got to tell you.
Well, you got no secrets from me, Lieutenant.
I've seen your medical chart.
Here we go.
This can't be good, or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
Yep.
I got to go away.
We're all going away.
Yeah... but I'm going to the war... tomorrow.
I'm flying with the Eagle Squadron.
It's an outfit the British started for American pilots.
I don't understand.
You're in the U.S. Army.
How could they order you to go?
They didn't order me.
I volunteered.
Huh.
But I passed you.
I let you through.
And now you volunteer... for the most dangerous place you could go?
It's not your responsibility, not your choice.
Flying's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.
I mean, everything in my life has led me up to this point.
Meeting you.
I love you.
I love you so much.
Let's go inside.
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Just-I-I can't do this.
This just-it's not right.
I'm sorry. I just-
See, I can't do this.
I mean, I mean, I can.
I- I want to.
I'm not trying to be noble, you know.
Or not saying
I know what would happen... or just-
I need to stop talking.
I just-I just don't want-
I just don't want it to be like everybody else.
I don't want you to have anything about tonight... that you regret.
I mean, it's been the most incredible night of my life... and I don't want to ruin that.
Oh, you couldn't ruin it.
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.
See, that's what I want to come home to.
That's what I want to have to think about and dream about.
I want to know that the best part of my life... is still ahead of me.
Look.
Don't, um... could you... not come see me off?
Because, uh... saying good-bye to you once is hard enough.
Here.
Take this.
Why?
You think it looks good on me?
I will come back.
I thought you said you told her not to come.
Yeah, I did.
Why you looking for her then?
It's my test.
If I tell her not to come, and she comes anyway... then I-I know she loves me.
All aboard! Track 57!
If, uh, anything happens to me...
I want you to be the one to tell her.
All right?
You just make sure and come back for the both of us, all right?
OK.
See you when I get back.
Yeah.
Good hunting, Rafe.
Evelyn!
Evelyn!
Evelyn!
Evelyn!
Evelyn.
Hey!
She loves me.
The German Luftwaffe... relentlessly bombards downtown London... while Churchill's
Royal Air Force... is in a deadly struggle... to maintain control of the British skies.
This is a real mess.
Lieutenant McCawley reporting for duty, sir.
Good.
We'll get you settled into your quarters.
And then introduce you to the crate you'll be flying.
If y'all are patching up bullet holes here... maybe we ought to skip housekeeping... and get me in an airplane.
Two didn't come back, sir.
We counted only eleven.
Are all Yanks as anxious as you... to get themselves killed,
Pilot Officer?
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.
This is yours.
Good chap.
Didn't die till he'd landed and shut down his engine.
Please be seated, gentlemen.
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.
Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you.
How long is America going to pretend... the world is not at war?
We've increased food and oil shipments, Mr. President... and as far as I know-
What they really need are tanks, planes... bullets, bombs, and men to fight.
But our people think
Hitler and his Nazi thugs... are Europe's problem.
We have to do more.
Send the Brits and Russians more of our ships... and anti-aircraft weapons.
And keep cannibalizing the Pacific Fleet?
What choice do we have?
We're building refrigerators while our enemies build bombs.
This is so exciting.
You know there's about one hundred ships on Pearl.
How many sailors per ship?
It depends.
More on a battleship than a sub.
But say, on average... 2,000?
Then there's the flyers, the marines, base personnel.
I'm still working on the sailors.
Girls, I think the odds are in your favor.
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.
It's paradise.
See you on the beach, boys!
We're in Hawaii!
Hey!
You're not supposed to paint titties... on the side of my airplanes.
And if you do, don't make 'em lopsided.
They were lopsided, Earl.
Look, it says right here.
"Never ride waves amongst rocks or submerged pilings. "
See, it says you shouldn't do that.
How do you know they're submerged if they're submerged?
Gooz, what in the hell are you doing?
Just trying to fix this surfboard thing.
He keeps taking chunks off his nose on the rocks.
On my day off, I'm working on my new invention- the Gooz Cruise Fin.
I'm gonna be a rich fella.
Every surfboard in the nation's gonna need one.
Yeah? Well, you're gonna need a broom.
Check out these new recruits.
Hi.
Aloha.
Y'all pilots?
We're working on it.
It's a lot of switches and stuff.
Pride of the Pacific.
Who are you?
Terrors of the skies.
Welcome, ladies.
Hi.
I have to deal with toasty sun burnt fanny... before I can show you around.
Ow!
Dear Evelyn.
It's different than I thought it would be here.
It's cold- so cold it goes deep into your bones.
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.
That is to think of you.
I just wish I could be back there with you.
It's not easy making friends.
Two days ago, I had a beer... with a couple of the RAF pilots.
Yesterday, both of them got killed.
Dear Rafe.
I miss you so much.
It's so strange to be half a world away from you.
I'm right on his tail!
Got one!
Every night
I look at the sunset... and try to draw the last ounce of heat from its long day... and send it from my heart to yours.
Family?
Girl, sir.
The girl.
A lot of people frown on the Yanks... for not being in this war yet.
I'd just like to say... if there are many more back home like you...
God help anyone who goes to war with America.
Atten-hut!
Attention on deck!
Admiral Kimmel...
Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.
Sharp presentation, Captain.
Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.
For four months now Washington's been blowing pink smoke... about the threat from Japan.
Could make us lose our fighting edge.
I'm determined not to let that happen.
With your permission, Captain.
Admiral, urgent, from Washington.
I'm supposed to keep this fleet... battle-ready to take on the Japanese... cover half the damn globe.
Now they want me to transfer... another twelve destroyers to the Atlantic.
Don't they know what we're facing out here?
They feel Europe is the greater danger.
I'm assuming these risk assessments include Hawaii?
Pearl Harbor is too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack.
We're surrounded by sub nets.
All we need worry about is sabotage... so we bunched our planes together... to make them easier to protect.
Distance is our ally, Admiral.
You analysts got it all figured out, don't you?
The smart enemy hits you... exactly where you think you're safe.
Incoming!
I fixed the hydraulics and electrics, sir... but the oil hoses still need attention.
Just crank it, Ian!
God speed you, sir.
Red section, take the bombers.
Blue section, look out for the fighters.
Bombers dead ahead.
Let's drop in and give 'em a reception.
Red Two, follow my lead, high side.
Go right at the lead bomber.
Following you, Red One.
Good hit! Good hit!
Red One, coming around, reset for the kill.
I have the middle bomber.
Hammer down!
We got him.
Nice shot, Red Two.
I got two M.E.s dead ahead.
I'm on him.
I'm on his tail.
Hammer down.
I got one of them!
I got another one.
Red One, you got fighters all over your tail!
I'm under fire!
I'm taking fire!
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up! Pull up!
Argh! I got an oil leak.
Can't see a damn thing!
I can't bail!
My canopy's stuck!
I can't bail out!
He's on my tail, Red Two.
I'm hit! I'm hit!
Mayday! Mayday!
Oh, my God.
I'm no good at church.
What do you mean, sweetie?
When I'm up there getting my slate wiped clean...
I'm thinking how to dirty it up again.
Wow, this from a virgin!
I got to inventory supplies.
Kill me now.
Could you be any more boring?
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe... ten pages instead of the usual five.
Gosh, I wish I was in love.
Hey, sweetheart.
She hates me.
Good to see you, Red.
Good to see you, too, Betty.
You wanna come for a ride?
Come on.
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.
That-a-boy! Be a mad dog!
You hit pretty hard... for a cook.
All right, Walker, who you got?
I'll take the cook.
Why? You don't like money?
Come on! Get out there now!
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.
Against a mechanic?
That guy craps rivets.
How's it feel up from the engine room?
Sunlight botherin' you?
Ow.
Man, he's getting all busted up!
Move! Move!
Come here, we gotta talk.
Get down here.
He can't hurt us.
He can hurt us.
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?
That's a scratch. See this?
This is the hard-earned greenbacks... of every pot-scrubbin' chop in this fleet.
Now if we don't win...
Teeny here has to find another battleship!
I'm not going back to the Arizona empty-handed.
Don't worry about the money.
I'll send that smug engine-fixin' snipe... back below decks where he belong.
We the man!
He slapped your mama!
Be a son of a bitch!
Look at this!
All right, Dorie!
That's enough. That's enough.
- Oh! Where's my money?
- Nah, fight's rigged.
We're rich! Ha ha ha!
How'd you get this?
Boxing.
Did you win?
Yes, ma'am.
What do you get for winning?
Respect.
So, why do you have to fight with your fists to get respect?
I left my momma in Texas... and joined the Navy to see the world... become a man.
They made me a cook.
Not even that.
I clean up after other sailors eat.
Two years, they never even let me fire a weapon.
Well, let's hope you never have to.
Yes, ma'am.
You take care,
Petty Officer Miller.
You, too, ma'am.
You know, he taught me to fly.
I always knew that no matter what trouble I got into...
I'd never be in it alone.
He'd be there with me.
He was always pushing me to be better and faster.
He told me you were a great flier.
It was the same night he told me... he'd volunteered to go to England.
Volunteered?
He... he told me he'd been assigned.
He was always trying to protect me.
But you know what?
I look at myself in the mirror in this uniform... and I still don't know who I am.
I look like a hero... but I don't feel like it.
Rafe... he always looked the part, didn't he?
He couldn't wait to be one.
To Rafe McCawley.
The best pilot... and the best friend
I ever knew... or ever will know.
To Rafe.
THUR Look at this.
The Japanese... are flooding the Pacific with radio traffic.
Everywhere from the Panama Canal to southeast Asia.
There's no logical pattern,
Captain.
No. There's always logic.
They know we read their mail.
They're trying to make us think their fleet is moving south.
I'm not buying it.
Something, something's up.
Otherwise, why would they take the trouble to bullshit me?
Evelyn, I signed for these letters for you today.
They're from England.
They're from Rafe.
I'm sorry, Ev.
You know how long it takes mail to get here.
Hurry up!
Show time, boys! Come on!
America still awaits Japan's response... to peace proposals.
Ambassador Nomura arrives in Washington... in what could hopefully guarantee... continued peace in the Pacific.
On the British front,
Churchill declares...
"Give us the tools, and we will finish the job. "
The RAF has fought bravely against...
Hitler's ambition to rule the skies over the Channel.
Victory does not come without sacrifice.
Evelyn!
- Danny.
- Hey.
Some comedy, huh?
Yeah.
It's been a while.
I've been logging a lot of flight hours.
I kinda been avoiding you, too.
Yeah.
- Look-
- Do you-
Do you want to?
Sure, yeah.
I remember one time when I was... like, seven years old...
I was always building gadgets and things.
He wanted me to build him some wings... so he could fly like his daddy.
I told him you can't fly without some kind of engine.
But he wouldn't listen.
"Danny, never mind that, just build 'em anyway. "
So I did.
And I'm up there... strapping these big ol' wings on his back... that we made from paper and glue... and these massive silk bloomers that we stole.
He looked so stupid, and I told him...
"You can't jump off the barn in these. "
And bam!
He busted his leg on a backhoe.
God, I miss him.
Yeah. But don't you think... that Rafe wasn't back up there next day.
Cast and everything... telling me to make some adjustments on those wings.
Check this out!
Crossroads of the Pacific.
Tahiti-1,700 miles!
All right!
Say, Betty...
W- wou...
- No, Betty! Get up!
- What's going on, Red?
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?
Just stand up.
Stand...
Oh! Ha!
Betty...
Red, come on!
We got a dinner reservation.
Can I get a minute?
What's the matter, you sick?
Can a guy propose?!
Oh! Thank you!
Am I talking too much?
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.
Hold up!
Look at this.
Hello!
OK, let's get out of here.
OK.
I guess I should go.
Don't let it be three months before I see you again.
I had a good time.
Yeah, me, too.
Do you want me to walk you home?
No, I'll be fine.
No... of course.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by some time... get a cup of coffee or a piece of pie?
What am I doing?
OK.
Oh! You were asleep. I'm sorry.
Danny?
Is something wrong?
No! Nothing's wrong.
No problem. Hi!
It's just Danny.
I... just... you... you forgot this.
Oh... thanks.
It was good of you to take the trouble... to drop it over... now.
I... well, I thought you might need it.
You know... maybe tomorrow morning.
If... not that you wear this to work, but...
No... it's a hankie.
Right, right. Yeah.
Listen, I was thinking maybe...
I could come by some time... if I gave you a call, could I come by?
Once, maybe... if you're not busy?
Yeah, maybe.
- Maybe?
- Maybe.
OK, all right.
Thanks.
Good-bye. Good night.
You are such an idiot!
Did you have fun last night?
It wasn't how it looked.
And if it was, it'd be all right.
It's been months.
It's time to move on.
I am moving on.
Ev, don't lie.
All I know is, I hear you crying when you think I'm asleep.
When my dad left...
I was too much for my mom to handle... so she sent me to live with my aunt.
I thought my life was over...
But you don't know where it's all gonna lead.
If I hadn't run away and lied about my age... and enlisted in the Navy...
I wouldn't have met Red, and... now he's my fiance.
Oh, God, I can't get used to that word.
- It's only been twelve hours.
- Oh, Betty!
Little Betty beat us all to the post.
And this is ward three.
As you can see, no patients.
Welcome to Hawaii.
Come on, I'll show you the bar.
Sandra, new recruits to torture.
Come on. Excuse me, ladies?
Hi!
We're gonna wait two years until I'm nineteen... and Red can buy me a ring.
Rafe sent his best friend to tell you... so you would be OK, so you can move on.
You gotta go on living, Ev.
Red!
Whoo! Sorry!
Bye, Rafe.
The Japanese Fleet is missing.
They're operating under radio silence.
This footage was shot four days ago on October 28th.
We're sending scout planes in wider vectors... all over the Pacific, but they get nothing.
They could be anywhere in here.
I don't understand how two whole carrier divisions... can just disappear.
Clear!
Aw, we're all over the page.
We got one wall-eyed and one pigeon-toed.
Anthony, tap in number six.
All right.
Gooz, tap in number three.
All right.
Hey. We got a visitor.
Oh... that ain't no Navy issue uniform, eh?
Danny, it's Evelyn.
Jesus!
You alright?
Yeah. Yeah.
No.
I think I'm fallin' for her.
Wow. You know,
I saw this coming.
I didn't want this to happen.
It just kind of did.
Can't help it.
Well, Danny, she's gotta be with somebody.
It might as well be you.
You telling me if you were dead... and you saw your best buddy doin' your girl... you wouldn't come back and beat the living crap outta him?
- Tony, back off.
- I'd be back so fast.
Danny's being a better friend taking care of her himself.
I got a girlfriend.
That's great.
Come on, fellas.
Let's split.
Danny, whatever happens now is just about you and her.
You gotta try and forget about Rafe.
Be careful, alright?
Ladies... cloud the mind.
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.
Hey, Danny.
Where's everybody going?
Just bein' discreet.
Does it seem like everybody's acting a little strange?
No. Nah.
Right.
Well, maybe-maybe a little.
Yeah.
Well, people in this outfit... have way too much time on their hands.
Oh, yeah.
I just hope they don't think there's been something... goin' on between us, that's all.
Oh, no. I mean, no.
That would be... embarrassing, right?
Forgot my wrenches.
That would definitely be embarrassing.
Yeah.
Ha. Forgot my wrenches.
Hey. He really doesn't have to leave.
No.
I, uh, I'm just goin' out with the girls, so...
I guess I'll see you later.
- Yeah.
- All right.
Yeah, all right.
I'll see you around.
Shit.
Evelyn.
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?
Of course.
Well... from the air?
You know, I could get kicked out of the military for this.
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.
The Hawaiians called this harbor Wai Momi.
It means "water of pearls. "
It's so beautiful.
My dad took me up a couple of times.
Just don't do what he did.
What do you call it when you flip over?
A barrelroll?
Yeah.
I won't.
Aah!
- Oh!
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Oh, God.
- What do you think?
I like that.
Hey!
That plane was supposed to be back here an hour ago!
Quick, hide in the parachute hangar.
My heart is pounding.
Danny, last night...
No, that's terrible.
Danny, we need to talk about this.
Sir. Evelyn!
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.
Hi.
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I had to see you.
Last night was crazy,
I know, but...
I'm not sorry. Are you?
I don't know.
Danny, I had a wonderful time last night. I-
It's just all too fast.
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down at the beach this morning... and I watched the sun rise... and I knew that everything was gonna be different.
That this was the start of something new.
In this place, in this moment.
And I don't care what anybody else says, you know?
How can I not feel this way?
I kinda like you.
Oh, you do?
You have your tie on crooked.
Everything's gonna be all right, OK?
Everything's gonna be all right.
Do you have any airtours going through the valley of Oahu?
You do?
Aloha.
This is KGMB in Honolulu... on another beautiful fall day here in paradise.
We have enough information.
We are returning home.
Do you ever wonder... if this war's gonna catch up with us?
Nota whole lot.
Every moment we're not together, you're up there training for it.
Yeah, well, I'm training for moments like these...
'cause I have no idea... how I'm gonna get this car out of the sand.
Evelyn, can you please come out of the bathroom?
You've been there for an hour.
Evelyn! What are you trying to do, look like me?
Are you OK?
Yeah.
What's the matter?
No, you-
D'oy.
They call it the vacant sea.
None of the major sea lanes go through it... and you can bury the entire land mass of Asia there... and nobody would know.
From there, they could attack anywhere.
Our last signals intercept... indicate that the Japanese taskforce is heading south... towards the Philippines or southeast Asia.
But Captain Thurman of Naval intelligence here... has his own theory about the missing ships.
Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us... where it'll hurt us the most-
Pearl Harbor.
It's over 4,000 nautical miles from Japan to Pearl.
That's a long distance to steam a navy, Captain.
Your theory is based on what?
Well, it's what I would do.
That's not exactly hard evidence, Captain Thurman.
Well, Admiral, if I had hard evidence... we'd already be at war.
Sir, we can read their diplomatic codes... faster than they can type them.
But Captain Thurman's cryptology team... is still trying to crack the naval codes.
The intercepts have missing words and garbled lines... so to explain the decrypts, we have to try to interpret... what we think they're trying to do.
Interpret?
You mean guess.
They use their informed intuition, sir.
We guess.
It's like playing chess in the dark.
Any rumor, troop movement, ship movement... spine-tingle, goose bump, we pay attention to it.
When I was in the Asiatic Fleet... the locals used to try to get outside of a problem... to try to see the inside.
Well, I see a strike on Pearl.
It's the worst thing that could happen.
A blow to Pearl would devastate... the Pacific Fleet's ability to make war.
So, sir, you would have us mobilize the entire fleet... at the cost of millions of dollars... based on this spine-tingling feeling of yours?
No, sir. My job is to gather and interpret material.
Making difficult decisions... based on incomplete information... from my limited decoding ability... is your job, sir.
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain... so I can make a better decision.
Aye, sir. We are trying.
I wonder if we shouldn't put the Pacific Fleet on full alert.
In case the optimism... of the "Honolulu Advertiser" proves unfounded, gentlemen... what are General Short and the Army... going to do about protecting my ships?
Within a ten-mile radius of your harbor... we have fighterplanes here at Wheeler... bombers at Hickam, and a trainingstrip at Haleiwa.
We've recently established a radar station here... that can detect planes
125 miles out.
Which is a month old, Admiral, and untested.
I've seen these new radar screens, Major.
There's no way of telling whether they're ours, theirs... or a flock of damn birds.
I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo... to somewhere close by Pearl.
There's a call from Tokyo.
They say they don't know you.
Hello? Hai.
It's a local dentist.
He can see Pearl Harbor from his office.
Are there many sailors around?
Uh, the dentist says that the flatships... are not in port.
They're talking about the weather.
He doesn't seem to know who he's talking to.
Hello?
Hello? Moshi moshi.
Hello?
That was a strange call.
Admiral, may I speak to you in private?
Why would a spy use a phone?
They know we tap all international lines.
Our listeners feel it's probably not code talk.
It sounds like someone in Japan is sneaking around... asking a local citizen the location of our carriers.
Well, that makes me feel all warm inside.
Get the FBI on it immediately.
Have we found the goddamn Japanese Fleet yet?
No, Admiral. The bases are looking all over the Pacific.
So the entire fleet could be rounding Diamond Head... and we wouldn't know a thing about it.
Get on it.
I'm alive.
This is the first
I could get word out.
Jepense qu'il est mort! ll estencore en vie.
I told you I'd come back.
Here, sit down.
Sit down. Come here.
It's OK.
It's all right.
You're real.
Yeah.
I wished for this every day.
I know. Me, too.
Every second. So did I.
I thought you were dead.
They said you were shot down in the sea.
Yeah, I was.
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.
I missed you.
I got picked up by a French fishing boat... and I was in occupied France, and I couldn't get word out.
And I'm just-I'll tell you all about it, I promise.
But I'm fine. I'm OK.
And I'm here now.
Evelyn...
I just wanted to see you.
You're so beautiful.
I love you.
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
Evelyn, Evelyn. I'm back.
It's OK. I won't leave you again, I promise.
Rafe, you died.
And so did I.
I know, but I'm-I'm-
It's fine now. I'm back.
We're together.
I mean, we are together... right?
I don't know where I am.
Rafe.
Rafe.
Stay away.
Rafe.
This is Radio Honolulu... playing the sweetest music... on the sweetest island in the Pacific.
It's a beautiful
December 6th... with beautiful music...
Raaaaafe!
Oh, Goddamnit.
There you go.
A real live ace!
Whoo!
An ace is only five.
I shot down six M.E.s.
And I got two smokers, too.
They don't count them.
Of course, I got shot down myself before they could pin me.
So you got back from behind enemy lines, huh?
What's that combat like?
Were you scared?
Hey! One at a time.
Well, them Luftwaffe boys can fly pretty good.
It's not like, you know, training.
They're, uh...
Danny.
You know, they're all about tactics is what it is.
See, the Nazis, right, they're faster than you are... so they'll disappear and they get up in the soup... and they'll throw like a roll or a hammerhead... and they'll come around on your high side... shoot you from behind- like some Americans will.
Hey...
Gooz, you're lookin' at a real live ace.
Well, let me give you the shirt off my back!
Whoo!
Aloha! There you go!
I'll take it from you.
I can see how y'all been spending your time out here.
Hey, Rafe, we gotta talk, all right?
I got nothin' to talk about with you. Here.
Why don't you have a drink?
I'll make a toast.
To returning from the dead.
Wasn't all I expected, but, well, that's life.
To my best friend and loyal buddy Danny... for keepin' up the war effort back here at home.
Ahh.
You know, where I come from... somebody makes a toast to you and you don't drink... that's sayin' something.
All right, Rafe.
That's how it's gonna be.
To you.
Hey, you guys need to spend some time alone, I think.
Aw, hell, no, Red.
Come on.
No, no, no.
We're celebratin' here.
Me over there fightin'... almost gettin' killed... my friend Danny back here... lookin' after my interests for me.
Y'all know Danny was even good enough... to look out for my girl for me while I was gone?
We thought you were dead, Rafe.
And it gutted us both.
And we were just tryin' to get on with our lives.
Life is good, ain't it, Danny?
You know, you're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.
Well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.
You left her to fight somebody else's war... and you made damn sure that I didn't go with you... and we thought that you were dead-
I almost did die, you little son of a bitch!
And her face was the last thing that went through my mind... so don't stand there and tell me to act like it's all right!
Yeah, Rafe, well, I stayed.
I stayed, and you made sure of that... and some things changed.
And I hope you can get used to that.
Oh, I have to get used to it?
All right. We'll see how I can get used to it.
- Whoa!
- Hey!
Get used to that, boy!
Hey, hey!
And that's my left hand, too!
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come on!
Melee at the Hula-la.
Send M.P.s!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- You called me a lousy friend?
- Get your hands off!
Aah!
Ow! Shit!
Come on, Danny!
Let's go get 'em.
Let's move out!
Oh, no. They're gonna throw us in the brig.
Let's get outta here.
Oh, shit.
Rafe... you're the only family I got.
When you were gone... it was the loneliest
I'd ever been.
The same for her, too.
Oh, boy, now you're really breakin' my heart.
If you hadn't gone, none of this woulda happened.
Oh, so it's my fault, I guess.
Damn it, Rafe.
I just know there's got to be some way... we can work things out so that... things could be right between me and you.
I just don't see how it could ever be the same.
Revered father...
I go now to fulfill my mission and my destiny.
I hope it is a destiny... that will bring honor to our family... and if it requires my life...
I will sacrifice it gladly... to be a good servant of our nation.
Hey... we got a large haze.
That's too big to be planes, right?
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?
Boom! Wrong move.
Lieutenant, radar's picking up... a large return moving in from the northeast.
Hang on.
Relax.
It's a flight of B-17s coming in from the mainland.
Nothing to worry about.
A heck of a lot of B-17s.
Good shot, Hop.
This better be good, Commander.
One of our destroyers reports having fired and sunk... enemy submarine attempting to enter Pearl Harbor at 0653.
It's 7:20!
We had decoder delays, Admiral.
Relay this to Washington.
Recall the staff.
"Failure...
"'Peace talks...
"useless. "
Thurman here.
Tokyo transmitting... to their embassy in Washington-
"Discontinue use of your decoding machine...
"and dispose of immediately.
"Special emphasis on destroying important parts. "
Do you read that?
Acknowledge.
Admiral...
Naval Intel intercepted a transmission from Tokyo... to the Japanese embassy in Washington... instructing them to break apart all decoder machines... and burn all secret documents.
The Japanese are expecting a war.
Should we?
Warning of possible...
Japanese aggressive movement in any direction.
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent. "
But where?
Did you ever lose a fight,
Miller?
I been lucky so far, Captain.
From what I hear, it ain't luck.
Ship's proud of you, son.
Ha ha ha. Yeah! Ha ha!
Why the hell's the Navy... doing practice this early on a Sunday?
- Aah!
- Get down!
Go, go, go, go!
I'm with Navy newsreel, and I can tell you one thing- them ain't Navy planes!
All hands, man your battle stations!
We're being bombed!
We're being bombed!
Get up! Get up!
Jesus Christ!
Man your battle stations.
Another dumb drill.
All hands, man your battle stations.
- What the heck was that?
- It's a bomb!
Move, move, move!
Son of a bi-
From outside!
Get me the engine room!
My God.
Take cover!
Down! Down!
Report battle stations!
Manned and ready!
Man your battle stations!
This is no shit!
They just sunk the Arizona!
General quarters!
General quarters!
All hands, man your battle stations!
This is no damn drill!
Go! Go!
They look like Japs.
I didn't even know the Japs were sore at us!
Danny, you just get me to a goddamn airplane!
Holy God!
This is good footage. Did you see that?
Holy cow!
I hope there's still an airfield left.
Hurry up!
What in the world?
Look! So many!
Everybody to the hospital!
Why's the Navy always buzzin' us? shut up, Red!
- Oh, man, come on.
- Red, it's too early.
The Japs are here!
What the hell?
Let's go! Let's go!
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain!
Repair says third deck is flooding port side!
Yaah! Uhh!
Get up!
Get up, you cowards!
Get up there and fight!
Move it!
Take cover!
I got you, Captain.
You radio for air cover!
Initiate damage control!
Find my X.O.
Tell him to assume command.
And you make sure the gunners-
Everyone's where they need to be, Captain.
You trained us well.
Captain...
Aah!
Go, go, go, go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Everybody move!
Get the ammo for that fifty cal!
Get that fifty cal!
Let's go! We gotta get-
Come on, man, we gotta get this thing loaded up!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!
Danny, get me into a damn plane!
Come on!
Get some ammo up here!
We need some men on these guns!
Sir! The captain says you're in charge, sir!
We need more ammo! Now!
Send up ammunition for the five-inch guns!
Medic!
All of 'em, now!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Come on!
Aah! Come on!
Come on, you sum 'bitch!
Aah!
Aah ha!
Oh, yeah!
I need a doctor!
Somebody help me!
Get to the supply room!
Get everything out!
- Aah!
- Planes incoming!
Cut 'em down!
Come on, come on!
Get 'em away from the windows!
The mattresses!
Get 'em against the wall!
Take cover!
Is everybody all right?
Can you stand? Can you stand?
Hold your fire!
Get to the gun! Hurry up!
Get down, Danny!
Aah!
- Earl!
- This is Walker!
We need to get those planes fueled and loaded right now!
What's going on out there? Huh?
Danny, what the hell's that noise?
You guys doin' target practice or something?
I think World War II just started.
Go, go, go!
- Billy!
- Run!
- It's gonna blow!
- It's a dud.
It's a dud!
Come on, get down!
Danny!
Danny, are you all right?
I'm all right!
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!
Gooz, come on, man!
We're sinking! We're sinking!
Stay together!
Close the hatches!
- I can't swim!
- Just hang on!
Let's move it now!
Joe! Go! Go!
We're gettin' outta here!
Get in the car!
Get in! Get in!
Come on, let's go! Go!
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Come on!
Where's this place we're goin'?
We got a small mechanic runway about ten minutes away.
Hasn't been hit yet.
We got Zeros on our six!
Duck!
Help us!
Aah!
We're trapped.
Try it! Try the door!
Aah!
Oh, my God! I'm going under!
It's sucking me back!
The current's too strong!
They're shootin' at us!
I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die!
This is it.
Get us out of here now!
How bad?
It's still not over, sir.
An entire fleet at anchor.
My God, my God...
Barbara, fill every syringe you can find with morphine!
Fill up the kitchen!
Are you listening to me?
Fill up the kitchen!
Over there! Over there!
We got a bad neckwound here!
Surgery! Move!
Get him to surgery!
Oh, God.
In here!
He's still bleeding!
Another hemostat!
Hurry!
Give me a hemostat now!
Damn it, hurry!
Gimme another hemostat!
Another suture! Hurry!
Give me a-
Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
Doctor!
Here! Aah!
Am I gonna die?
Nurse!
Don't leave me!
Doctor! Get over here!
My fingers are plugging his artery!
Doctor, what do you need?
Focus, look at me.
What do you need?
- Hemostat.
- Hemostat.
Here. All right, look at me.
You're going to be all right.
You're going to be all right.
I need more ammo!
I need more ammo, ladies!
I need more ammo!
Earl! We good to go?
- Mostly, but-
- Get down!
- Shit! Get cover!
- Jesus!
- Come on, you guys!
- Earl, get in here!
Sergeant!
We need more than a shotgun!
You got any other weapons for coverfire?
Inside that ammo locker!
- Come on!
- Move it!
- Go! Go!
- Get the guns out!
You said the planes are mostly ready, but... but what?
She's down, she's broke, she's shit.
I got four left.
One's good, two need ammo, one needs fuel.
Fall out and load up in the bunker!
Let's go! Get down!
- Move!
- Get ready to roll this thing!
Get down! Now!
Anthony, Red, you stay here and man the fifty-caliber.
Gooz, get to the next bunker and lay down some coverfire.
Planes.
Should we fire?
Stay down! God damn it!
Hold your fire!
Stay still! Nobody fire!
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
They don't know we're here.
- Stay down.
- Fire?
No, God damn it, stay down, stay still.
Don't fire.
Oh, God.
I don't see any ordnance.
I think they're going home.
No. They'll be back. We still got planes on the ground.
Pilots, listen up.
Get all the speed you can on the runway... don't get on the stick till the very end.
In the air, stay low between the buildings.
You see any Zero on your tail... wipe him off, don't freeze.
Just keep moving.
Try to separate 'em, take 'em out one by one.
P-40s can't outrun Zeros, so don't try.
We have to outfly 'em.
We got high-level bombers!
They'll bust this hangar wide open!
Grab the fifties! Let's move!
Move! Move!
Go, go, go!
Zeros!
Take cover! Take cover!
Take cover! Take cover!
Aah!
- Get down! Get down!
- Let's go! In the box!
Aah!
Danny!
Come on!
Come on, buddy!
Leave him, he's dead!
He's dead!
They're kicking our butt.
Get to the airplanes!
Go, go, go!
Run! Red, Anthony, let's go!
Come on, help me!
Goddamn belts!
Let's go! Come on!
Knock 'em dead.
Quick! Get in! Put this on!
They're coming around.
Bring 'em out! Let's go!
Red, get out of here,
God damn it! Go!
Come on, let's go.
Joe, get out the way!
I'm rollin'!
Clear! Go!
Oh, God. Planes!
Come on, help me!
Hey, Joe! You got three Zeros behind you!
Turn! Turn!
Oh, God!
Aah!
Oh, shit.
What are you doing? Get going!
Danny, start that thing up and get in the air.
I'm not much good without a wing man. I need you!
I got you!
Let's do it!
It's real tight, Rafe!
Real tight!
Hey, Rafe, I'm not sure we have enough runway!
Get your airspeed up before you leave the dirt!
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.
I don't think
I'm gonna make it over!
Come on! Come on!
We did it! I'm up!
We got Zeros behind us!
How many you see back there?
We got five on our six!
Take it down to the deck, now!
We gotta split 'em up.
You take left, I'll take right.
Earl, get some guns in that goddamn tower!
OK! Let's go! Into the truck!
Danny, I got three on my six.
Whoo!
Stop! Stop! Let's go!
Let's go! Move it!
Move it, Red!
- Let's go!
- Gimme the fifty!
Let's go! All right!
I still got two behind me, Rafe.
Yaah!
Son of a bitch!
Whoa!
Earl, God damn it, get some guns in that tower!
On the tower.
Going ten stories up.
It's a long son of a bitch.
Rafe, they're all over me!
I can't get them off me!
Danny,
I still got three on my tail!
Keep jinking it!
Don't let them get a handle!
I can't shake 'em!
God damn it.
Danny, let's play chicken with these Jap suckers!
I'm with you.
Jesus!
- I'm coming right at you!
- Don't brake till I tell you.
Not yet! Not yet!
Come on!
Go left! Now!
- Whoo! We got 'em!
- Ha ha ha!
Set up over there!
Come on, load it!
We're on the tower.
I got one on my tail.
I'll bring him right by you.
He's comin' around!
Let's get this Jap sucker!
Hold your fire. Here he comes.
You better be cocked and locked when I come by!
Hold your fire!
Fire!
Whoo! Good shootin', boys!
Nice shot, Earl!
Let's head over to battleship row!
I'm with you!
Let's go do some business.
I'm going after 'em.
Rafe! I got him!
- P-40's!
- Yeah!
They're pulling into the clouds!
We ain't gonna let these sons of bitches get home!
How do you like someone shooting back at you?
Oh, I'm on your ass now!
Yeah! I got one!
Come on!
God, come on!
Come on, stay in there!
Whoa!
I got you, you son of a bitch!
Who taught you how to fly,
Lieutenant?
He did.
I have to amputate here!
I have to amputate!
You're not gonna die!
I got you.
Hold onto this...
Sandra, we're running out of morphine.
Find some way to mark 'em...
So we can keep track of who's got morphine already.
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?
It's not marking.
Have you got a marker?
Use my lipstick!
Put "M" for morphine.
- We need a tourniquet!
- Tourniquet!
Where are the clamps?
There's nothing left!
- Evelyn!
- Here, use this.
Go outside.
There's too many to help.
Sort them out.
Only those that can be saved you bring in.
I can't...
No, please,
I need you to do it!
Go! Go!
Aah!
Don't look at anyone without a mark!
I told you, stand back!
Keep 'em outside!
Come on! Let's go!
Wait here.
Don't touch me, you Jap!
Get your hands off me!
Get him into critical.
- Get him off me.
- Critical, frontward!
How bad am I?
You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart.
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die.
I've got your hand.
Do you have enough morphine to make him comfortable?
He won't make it.
Line the critical up!
Get him morphine.
Take him over there!
Burn victims by the tree!
I just found her!
I don't think she's breathing.
No, she's dead. Take her-
Oh, God.
Are you sure, Ev?
Check her again.
She's dead.
Take her over there!
But you've gotta be sure!
She's dead!
Go back to work, Sandra.
I don't know what to do!
Over here!
Admiral?
From Washington.
"Attack by Japan considered imminent. "
They're only an hour late.
How can we help?
We need blood. Come on.
Remember, son, hold on to your faith.
1,500 cartons over there.
"'Today you will be with me in paradise...
"so fear not. "
Fear not, my son.
You are a man truly blessed.
You will die in a state of grace.
Remember, pain is temporary, but glory is forever.
Hold on to your faith, my son.
You'll be with God, the saints, and the angels soon.
I absolve you of your sins... in the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit.
Innomine patris et fili, et spiritus sancti.
Amen.
Go with God, my son.
We've got men trapped everywhere in the harbor.
We need help from anybody who can move.
There's somebody in here!
Get somebody down here!
They're cutting through!
I hear somebody!
Get some guys up here!
Pull!
Get us out!
It's filling with water!
Get an airline in here!
We need the air hose!
What can we do?
It won't cut any faster!
- Cut him out!
- Aah!
Yesterday...
December 7, 1941... a date which will live in infamy... the United States of America... was suddenly and deliberately attacked... by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.
It is obvious... that planning the attack began many weeks ago.
During the intervening time... the Japanese government... has deliberately sought to deceive the United States... by false statements... and expressions of hope for continued peace.
The attack yesterday on the Hawaiian Islands... has caused severe damage to American military forces.
I regret to tell you... that over 3,000 American lives have been lost.
No matter how long it may take us... to overcome this premeditated invasion... the American people, in their righteous might... will win through to absolute victory.
Because of this unprovoked, dastardly attack by Japan...
I ask that the Congress declare a state of war.
Is it true... men are still trapped alive inside the Arizona?
We can hear tapping from inside the hull.
We're doing everything we can to get to them... but they're forty feet below water.
We've been trained to think that we're invincible.
And now our proudest ships have been destroyed... by an enemy we considered inferior.
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.
That's exactly why we have to strike back now.
We'll attack the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, sir.
I mean hitting the heart of
Japan the way they have hit us.
Mr. President...
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares because we didn't face facts.
This isn't a time for ignoring them again.
We have long-range bombers, but no place to launch them.
Midway is too far, and Russia won't allow us... to launch a raid from there.
Admiral?
Navy's planes are small.
They carry light loads and have a short range.
We'd have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan.
We'd risk our carriers, and if we lose them... we'll have no shield against invasion.
Does anyone in this room think victory is possible... without facing danger?
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.
But consider the risk,
Mr. President.
If the Japanese invade us right now... they would reach Chicago before we could stop them.
Gentlemen... most of you did not know me when I had the use of my legs.
I was strong and proud... and arrogant.
Now I wonder, every hour of my life... why God put me into this chair.
But when I see defeat in the eyes of my country men- in your eyes, right now-
I start to think that maybe he brought me down... for times like these... when we all need to be reminded who we truly are- that we will not give up or give in.
Mr. President, with all respect, sir... what you're asking can't be done.
- Mr. President!
- Get back, George!
Get back.
Do not tell me... it can't be done.
Japan continues its military conquest... throughout the Pacific.
But, back home... millions of American workers band together... bringing factories to life to avenge Pearl Harbor.
Mr. President, we have an idea how to bomb the Japanese.
Sir, it's risky... but it's bold.
- Who are you?
- I, sir?
Captain Low, Mr. President.
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.
I like sub commanders.
They don't have time for bullshit, and neither do I.
Fire away, gentlemen.
And where is God in all this?
Our enemies believe a divine wind protects them.
But we see our friends laid out here before us.
Hey, Captain.
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.
Yes, Major?
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.
What for, sir?
Ask Colonel Doolittle.
Yes, sir.
You're packing.
Orders.
What kind of orders?
The top-secret kind.
The dangerous kind.
I can't find Danny.
Is that why you're here?
Looking for Danny?
Probably saying good-bye to his squadron.
We've been assigned to Doolittle.
I wasn't looking for Danny.
I couldn't have you go away... without you understanding something.
Yeah. You don't have to explain anything.
I do, because you're acting like I didn't love you.
Evelyn, loving you kept me alive.
I should've died over there.
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.
I told him I was sorry... that I knew I'd been a fool for leaving you... trying to go over there and be a hero... and I promised I'd never ask for anything again... if I could just see you one more time.
And you know what?
It was worth it.
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.
So I'm gonna stand by my end of the deal.
I'm gonna walk away.
And I won't ask you for anything.
But I just want to know why.
Just tell me that, will you, please? Just tell me why.
Rafe, I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God.
I didn't even know until the day you turned up alive.
And then all this happened.
I haven't told Danny.
I don't want him to know.
All he needs to think about... is how to do this mission and get back alive.
Rafe, all I ever wanted... was for us to have a home, grow old together... but life never asked me what I wanted.
Now, I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart... but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset... without thinking of you.
I'll love you my whole life.
I'll see you on board.
You know, the only thing that scares me... is that you might love him more than you love me.
I love you, Danny.
And I'll be here waiting for you when you come back.
Follow me.
Colonel.
Congratulations on your promotion, sir.
I heard what you did.
We can explain that, sir.
Explain what?
Whatever it is you heard about us, sir.
You mean the hula shirts you were flying in?
Or the seven planes you shot down?
You're both being awarded the Silver Star... and promoted to captain.
Is that the good news, sir, or...
You're just about the only pilots in the Army... with combat experience.
I need you for a mission...
I've been ordered to put together.
You know what top secret is?
Yes, sir.
It's the kind of mission where you get medals.
But they send 'em to your relatives.
Top secret means you train for something... never done before in aviation history... and you go without knowing where you're going.
You do it on that basis or not at all.
I'll go, sir.
I'll go, too, sir.
By the way, the Brits sent over your personal effects.
Thank you, sir.
There's only one more thing.
Leave your goddamn hula shirts at home.
Dear Rafe...
It's so strange to be this far from you... but you should know this- every night...
I've been looking all over for you.
Danny, this... this ain't no time to leave things unsaid.
Now, we gotta face facts here.
The fact is, we just both love the same woman.
She's the first girl I ever felt this way about, Rafe.
I couldn't help what happened any more than you could.
This is different, though, Danny.
Evelyn already lost the man she loved once.
I just don't want it to see that happen to her again.
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war.
She knows that.
Danny, don't do this.
Don't go on this mission.
You got nothing to prove.
You've been protecting me since we were kids.
Yeah, well... you do tend to need it from time to time.
The mission I'm asking you to volunteer for... is exceptionally dangerous.
Take a look at the man beside you.
It's a good bet that in the next six weeks... you or he... will be dead.
Everyone brave enough to accept this... step forward.
Your grandmother could take a B-25 off... on a mile-long runway.
Well, I'm gonna train you to do it in 467 feet.
Because at 468 feet... you're dead.
And once you get it up... you'll learn to fly it like a fighter... thirty feet off the ground.
I want you to say hello... to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.
He'll help us lighten these fat ladies.
Dump that ash can.
See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.
Colonel, he's crazy!
- The lady's fat!
- Listen to him.
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!
Max power!
Get up, get up!
- Damn!
- How the heck-
Damn!
They just keep rolling past that line.
Maybe it's a bad idea.
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.
This armored plating goes.
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.
Release brakes!
Come on, come on!
- God!
- Put every man on the line!
Let's show these boys how this thing is done!
Come on! Max power.
Well, if he can do it...
Well, gentlemen, now I can tell you... that we're going to Tokyo.
And we're gonna bomb it.
That comes as a special request... directly from
President Roosevelt.
The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast... and we'll launch from the carrier there.
Has that been done before?
Taking Army bombers off Navy carriers?
- No.
- OK.
Any other questions?
Well, sir, is it even possible to land... a B-25 on an aircraft carrier deck?
That won't matter.
As soon as we're airborne, the carrier heads for Hawaii.
But without them, where do we land?
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.
Wo shimeiguo ren.
It means "I am an American".
In Chinese.
Ain't gonna be any easier.
That's three feet shorter than our practice runway.
- Fellas?
- Sir.
Sir.
Secretary of the Navy gave me these.
What are they?
Friendship medals the Japanese gave us... when they were pretending to want peace.
What'll you do with them?
Wire them to the bombs and give them back.
So what's going on?
Well, sir, we only have sixteen planes.
So?
When the Japs hit us, they had more than 300.
How much difference can we make?
It's not that we're afraid, sir.
But we might die, and we want to know what it's for.
You know, at Pearl, they hit us with a sledgehammer.
This raid, even if we make it through... it'll only be a pin prick... but it'll be straight through their hearts.
Victory belongs to those that believe in it the most... and believe in it the longest.
We're gonna believe.
We're gonna make
America believe, too.
Colonel? I need a minute.
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?
Do you remember me?
Oh, sure I do.
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.
Well, maybe you can.
When the news comes in about the Doolittle boys...
I want to be in the command post.
I'm sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
How the hell do you know about this mission?
Let's call it an inadvertent disclosure.
Some flyboy you're dating shot his mouth off.
Actually, it's about two pilots.
I know they're going into great danger.
I just want to be there when the news tells us... if they've lived or died.
Most officers would have thrown you in the brig.
Most nurses wouldn't keep their fingers... plugged in your artery.
I can't promise you anything.
Hey, Red, you think they picked us... to do this
'cause we're young and dumb?
Come on, Gooz, we're the tip of the sword.
In honor of our trip to Japan...
I got us some victory cigars!
- Yeah!
- There you go.
Put that in your insidepocket, next to your heart.
You know, Jack, we may lose this battle... but we're gonna win this war.
- You know how I know?
- No.
Them.
'Cause they're rare.
And at times like these, you see them... stepping forward.
There's nothing stronger than the heart of a volunteer, Jack.
My friends in the war department... don't want me to lead this raid... because they say
I'm too valuable.
They don't want me up in the air... flying with the men that I've chosen... that I've chewed out, cussed out, pushed to the limit... and that I've come to respect.
They want me to stand on the flight deck... and wave you off.
Well, I don't see it that way.
So I'm going with you.
We take off tomorrow afternoon... drop our fire, and head for China.
Our mission is to hit military targets... aircraft and tank factories.
Colonel, you've given us homing beacons... but you said China is overrun with Japanese troops.
What if the beacons are switched off?
Bring her down any way you can... and do your best to avoid capture.
What if we have to bail out over Japan?
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what to do.
What would you do, Colonel?
I wasn't built to be a prisoner... so I would have my crew bail out.
I'd find the sweetest military target I could... and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it...
But that's just me.
I'm forty-five years old.
I'm an old man.
You guys have your whole lives ahead of you... so what you do is up to you.
The mission will launch in a couple of hours.
You'll stay right in here.
Here. Stay here.
Don't talk to them.
They won't talk to you.
Pretend to type the information we pass you.
That's it.
This is Orphan Annie from Radio Tokyo.
To all the lonely boys in the South Pacific... watch out- the enemy will get you.
Maybe she's right.
Japs transmitting!
Captain, radar reports
Japanese patrol boats.
- Range 400 yards.
- How many yards?
400 yards and closing, sir.
Richards, Japs!
400 yards! Let's go!
Admiral Halsey's ordering the cruisers to open fire!
We gotta sink these Jap boats before they give us away.
Go to general quarters!
Go, go, go, go!
Oh, my God.
This can't be good!
All hands, man your battle stations.
Japs one mile away.
They reported our position.
Supposed to launch
400 miles away. How far are we?
624 miles.
- Jesus!
- What do you want to do?
Colonel, I don't know if the planes... can carry enough fuel to make it to China.
Now. We launch now!
Army pilots! Man your planes!
Man your planes!
They're shooting at something.
- Let's go!
- It ain't a drill!
Colonel!
We're too far out to make it!
They need more fuel, but they can't get too heavy!
Strip everything out of this plane you don't need now!
Start pre-flight! Let's go!
Add ten cans of fuel for each plane!
Every plane!
Let's go! Move!
Guys, get up there!
Lose those suitcases now!
- What's your favorite gun?
- What?
You want off this deck, give me a gun now!
It's still too heavy!
Go to the kitchen, get some broomsticks.
Cut 'em down, paint 'em black, and bring them here.
We'll put a broomstick where this gun was.
What are you doing to my plane?
Tell your crew to take a piss before they take off.
We got broomsticks for tail guns.
Yeah.
Maybe it'll scare 'em.
You take care of yourself up there.
Yeah, I will.
Danny, be careful, you hear me?
I will.
I'll see you, Rafe.
Rafe!
We're the tip of the sword!
- Turning on one!
- Turning on two!
All right.
You ready for this?
- Superchargers low and latched!
- Low and latched.
We're full into the wind!
More speed! More speed!
Are you nervous?
No-yes, sir. Yes.
When did you find religion?
When you assigned me to this mission, sir.
Do me a favor.
- What's that, Colonel?
- Pray for both of us.
Tell me when!
Let's go!
Max power!
Oh, please.
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!
Way to go!
Jesus, that was short.
Move 'em up!
Full power, here we go!
Pull back!
Ha ha ha!
Come on, here we go, here we go!
We made it!
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo... we have been described... as a nation of weaklings and playboys... who hire British,
Russian, or Chinese soldiers... to do our fighting for us.
Let them repeat that now.
Let them tell that to
General MacArthur and his men.
Let them tell that to the soldiers who today... are fighting hard in the far waters of the Pacific.
Let them tell that to the boys in the flying fortresses.
Let them tell that to the Marines.
That's Japan, fellas.
Tighten up back there!
Man your guns!
We're in the enemy's backyard!
Look alive back there.
I see coastline.
Heads up, boys! Heads up!
Man your guns back there.
I'm cocked and locked!
Get ready, suckers!
Approaching targets for bombing raid!
Open bomb bay doors.
Ripley, you gota target in sight?
37 degrees!
Target in sight!
All right, boys, let's knock their clocks off!
- Drop your ordnance!
- Bombs away!
One away!
- Bombs away!
- Bombs away!
Two away!
Three away!
Four away!
We caught 'em by surprise!
- Dropping ordnance!
- Bombs away!
...factory.
- Whoo!
- We got it!
We hit our targets!
Good job, raiders!
God! Jesus-what? Shit!
We got flak everywhere!
Go down there and get Gooz!
I want everyone to separate!
- Clean that up!
- Yes, sir.
Try and clean that up!
They're shooting flak at us!
We gotta get out of this shit,
Gooz!
- We got a fire!
- Tail's hit!
The electrics!
We got a fire back here!
I gotta short this out!
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!
God damn!
Red, go check that out!
We're getting covered!
Just hope they don't hit a prop!
Unh!
I'm hit!
They're tearing this plane apart!
Red, take it up, 800 feet.
Aah!
I think Theo's dead!
Theo, wake up!
Theo!
Get into the clouds,
Danny, right now!
Get up in that soup!
We're gonna pull out of this,
Gooz!
Thank you, George.
What is it, General?
Colonel Doolittle had to advance his execution order... by twelve hours, Mr. President.
There will be no homing beacons.
The plane carrying them crashed en route to China... and our bombers may lack the fuel... to reach the mainland, sir.
So our boys are flying blind on empty tanks.
God help them.
We're still not getting a signal.
All ocean and no land.
Homing in on nothing.
How many cans of fuel we got left?
These are all empty!
Is this all you got?
That's all we got, Red.
Rafe! You better pray for land!
Break radio silence.
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
You're all brave souls.
The bravest I've ever had the privilege of flying with.
But we're on our own.
This really was a suicide mission.
Engine one's fluctuating.
We'll lose it any minute.
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I am. How about now?
I see the coast.
I see the coast!
Copy that, Rafe.
We're gonna make it.
Danny, follow me.
We can make this.
I can see the coast now.
We're only a few miles out.
We gotta find a soft landing spot.
I'm pushing up on two.
Hold on for a hard landing!
I see rice paddies.
We'll bring it in right here.
Oh, God, engine one's dead.
We'll lose engine two any second.
We can make it in. Easy.
Pull it back, glide in on fumes.
Japs!
We got Jap patrols all over the place!
Japs! Land somewhere else!
Strap yourselves in!
We're coming in hard!
We're a deadstick.
Get outta the nose!
Hold on, boys!
We're going down!
Watch the trees!
Everyone all right?
I'm OK! I'm OK!
Where's Ripley?
He's dead.
Watch for Japs!
- Jap patrols!
- Take cover!
Who's got magazines?
Got em!
Gotta get up into those hills, find the Chinese!
They got us pinned down!
- Danny!
- Rafe! Rafe, no!
Danny!
Rafe, you don't have a chance!
God damn. Danny!
Come on!
Gooz? You OK, man?
Danny? Aw, shit, Anthony.
Gooz! Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Danny.
Easy, easy, easy.
I've had better landings.
You saved us back there.
I got something in my neck.
- Let me pull this out.
- Where's Gooz?
He's fine.
He's right over there.
Rafe!
Grenade!
Danny.
Danny!
Danny! Oh!
- Hold on!
- Rafe!
Hold on, now. I got you.
You're all right.
You're all right.
I'm not gonna make it.
Oh, yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Now look at me.
Rafe, I'm so cold.
I'm so cold.
You're all right. Hey.
Hey, Rafe?
Can you do me a favor?
What?
Can you have someone else write my name on the tombstone?
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, listen to me!
You ain't gonna die, you hear me?
Danny.
Danny, you can't die.
You can't die. You know why?
'Cause you're gonna be a father.
You're gonna be a daddy.
I wasn't supposed to tell you.
You're gonna be a father.
Please.
No. You are.
Danny.
Danny?
Please, please!
Please.
God.
Please, Danny.
Hold your fire!
They're Chinese.
When the action is over and we look back... we understand both more and less.
This much is certain.
Before the Doolittle raid...
America knew nothing but defeat.
After it, there was hope of victory.
Japan realized for the first time that they could lose... and began to pull back.
America realized that she would win... and surged forward.
It was a war that changed America...
...and the world.
Dorie Miller was the first black American... to be awarded the Navy Cross.
But he would not be the last.
He joined a brotherhood of heroes.
That's for all the raiders.
World War II for us began at Pearl Harbor... and 1,177 men still lie entombed... in the battleship Arizona.
America suffered... but America grew stronger.
It was not inevitable.
The times tried our souls... and through the trial, we overcame.
Hey, Danny... how'd you like to go flying?
Come here.
When I think back on these times
And the dreams we left behind
I'll be glad
'cause I was blessed
To get to have you in my life
When I look back on these days
I'll look and see your face
You were right there for me
In my dreams
I'll always see you
Soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be a place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
Well, you showed me how it feels
Feel the sky with in my reach
And I always will remember
All the strength you gave to me
Your love made me make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me
In my dreams
I'll always see you
Soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be
A place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
'Cause I always saw in you my light
My strength
And I want to thank you now
For all the ways
You were right there for me
You were right there for me
For always
In my dreams
I'll always see you
Soar above the sky
In my heart, there'll always be
A place for you
For all my life
I'll keep a part of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
There you'll be
MAKHMALBAF FILM HOUSE
AND FABRICA CINEMA PRESENT
BLACKBOARDS a film by Samira MAKHMALBAF
- Said!
- Yes?
Thanks for your water.
- You've drunk it all!
- I was thirsty. I'm sorry.
Forget it.
Where did you go yesterday?
To Dezle.
Why?
Looking for pupils.
But no luck,
I couldn't find any.
I was there for three days.
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.
I don't smoke.
You couldn't find any pupils?
Not one.
My father warned me but I didn't listen to him and now,
I truly regret it.
- You studied for long?
- Two years.
You became a teacher in two years?
I worked hard.
- You like it?
- Not really.
Why?
I looked for three days and I found nothing.
I didn't listen to my father.
- What did he tell you to do?
- To be a shepherd.
I failed.
He's gone.
Get up.
Hurry up!
And your wife?
When we got back from Tehran, we had a fight about the doctor.
Her family insulted my family.
Mine responded in kind.
So her father took her.
Hurry up.
We have to hide him.
It's been three months since she went back with her father.
She left me with three kids, one of them just a baby
I tried to find him a wet nurse.
I went through a hundred families to find one.
As a result he's drunk the milk of many women, even cows
He looks like a hundred different women.
He's got the eyes of one, the ears of another.
And he's sick.
Now I run from village to village looking for a pupil
I can make into a doctor.
That way, we'd never have to go into town.
If there was a doctor in the next village things would be easier.
- You're going to make a doctor?
- Yes.
- Which path are you taking?
- The one on the right.
It's dangerous.
- Which way are you going?
- This way.
But it's very dangerous.
Wait.
I'll tell you again, it's a death trap.
Yours is even worse.
No. Yours is more dangerous.
Goodbye.
- Where are you going now?
- to the village.
- Can I come with you?
- If you like.
If we go together do you think we'll find any pupils?
- I'm not coming.
- Why?
I want to go to the top.
- How many pupils will you find?
- Two or three.
Fine. Keep them.
I'm going to climb to the very top.
The villages bring me bad luck.
My fortune lies up there.
Go on, you take the villages.
I'm going up there.
Goodbye.
Take care.
Hello!
Hello!
Is there a school here?
I don't know.
And a teacher?
I don't know.
No idea.
Goodbye.
- And I'm sorry.
- The Lord will go with you.
Excuse me!
Wait a minute.
What?
Please, read me this letter.
What is it?
What does he say?
Hold on.
This letter isn't in Persian.
Where does it come from?
For the love of God, read it to me.
It's from your son?
It's not in Persian. Maybe Arabic?
Where's it from?
From Iraq.
I don't know if it's in Arabic,
Turkish or Kurdish.
It's from my son.
But from where?
I can't read it.
I return them.
Next he greets his mother, his sister, his father and his brother
He finishes by saying goodbye.
But how is he getting by?
Has he got money?
Iraqi dinars.
How's he getting on in jail?
I'm sure he's fine...
He must have written that he misses you.
At the end, he says goodbye.
He doesn't say when he'll be released?
Goodbye.
I don't know.
But when will he be freed?
That's all?
If it's God's will, he will be released. Don't worry.
Goodbye.
My god!
Young man!
- Are you OK?
- Yes, thank you.
Do you know where I can find the shepherd boys?
Up there. This way or that way.
The goats go up this way?
Listen, I am a teacher.
- What?
- I am a teacher.
So what are you doing here?
- Looking for children.
- Good luck.
- Where are they?
- Up there.
Listen, young man,
I'm talking to you.
I've already told you, they're up there.
- Which way should I go?
- The way I told you.
Straight ahead.
Do you know how to write?
Do you know how to write?
To read and write?
No.
Would you like to learn?
It's useless.
Show me the way.
The way, young man!
Where are you going?
- Young Man!
- What?
The way?
Here. There. Also here.
Not this way?
I'm talking to you!
- Young man!
- What?
Show me the way.
I want you to show me the way.
Look at me!
Leave me alone.
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Is there anyone here?
Open the windows.
Answer me!
Multiplication tables!
Come and learn how to multiply.
One times two is two.
Two times two is four.
Madame!
Do you need a teacher?
- What?
- I am a teacher.
Where are your children?
Leave me alone.
- I have come to teach your children.
- I am a teacher.
- Who are you?
- I'm looking for pupils.
Good for you.
Where are the children?
Go away.
Anybody here?
Anybody here?
Is there anyone here?
I can hear voices.
I've come a long way to teach your children to read and write.
You won't need to pay me much.
I'll teach you to read and write letters.
Children, at last!
Wonderful! Come here.
Stop.
Tell me where you've come from.
Where have you come from?
Where are you going?
Where have you come from?
I've come from deep in the valley to find you.
Let us through, mister.
Just a moment.
I'm not going to eat you.
I only want to talk to you.
- Do you have a school here?
- No.
- And a teacher?
- No.
- Would you like one?
- No.
Where are you going with those burdens?
- We're mules.
- What?
- Then I'll come with you. OK?
- No.
Let us get past, mister.
Let us get past!
Wait a minute, kid!
Allow me to finish and I'll let you go.
Just one question: where are you going with those?
Let us get past!
It's heavy!
You can't stay there like that.
Let us get past.
We're wiped out.
- You don't have a teacher?
- No.
There's no teachers here.
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
Let us pass, we're wiped out.
Look.
You're holding us all up.
Let us pass.
I'm a teacher and I've come to teach you to read and write.
I've come a long way.
I've been looking for you for a long time!
I want to teach you to read and write, to add up and multiply.
I don't want a lot of money if you don't have any, you could just give me something to eat.
We carry contraband, stolen goods.
We take it over the border between Iran and Iraq.
We're always on the run.
Listen, my child.
With education, you will be able to read a book or, even better, a newspaper when you're travelling.
Learn to read and write!
You'll know what's going on in the world.
You can learn to add up, to substract, to do your accounts without being swindled.
What good is it, all that?
You could study or find work
Doing the accounts, that's great for the Boss.
Us, we're mules.
Always on the move.
How do you expect us to read?
To read a book, you have to sit down.
Us, we never stop moving.
Listen, I want to talk to you.
Stop! Wait!
Wait!
Hello.
Do you know how to read and write?
- Do you?
- No.
- Do you want to learn?
- No.
- You don't?
- No.
Hello.
Do you know how to read and write?
- Do you?
- No.
Hello, sir!
- I'm talking to you.
- What?
You wouldn't have a scrap of bread?
It's freezing!
Where are you going?
I don't have a job, can I come with you?
We don't need you.
Hello. How's it going?
It's freezing!
Hello, sir.
Sir!
I'm talking to you.
Why won't you answer me?
Haven't you got any work for me?
No.
I'll do anything.
We don't have any work ourselves.
I could herd goats, sweep up.
Just give me something to eat.
We haven't got anything to eat either.
How do you survive?
We're nomads.
I'm hungry.
Give me a piece of bread.
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?
We have strayed. We're old.
We are lost, we don't know how to get back to Iraq.
Can you show us the way, just as far as the border?
Fine, let's go.
I can show you, but it won't be easy.
Halaleh! Bring your father something to drink.
Bring some water!
What do I get if I take you?
We have nothing to give you!
I have to guide you for nothing?
We have nothing to give you.
You must have something!
There is nothing.
Not even a piece of bread?
Not even bread.
It's a hard road.
You must give me something.
We don't have anything.
How can I lead you with no reward?
We have nothing.
Not even a scrap?
I can give you forty walnuts.
Only forty?
Forty isn't enough!
Give me fifty.
- The route is hard.
- You won't get more than forty.
It's a long hard road.
I accept.
OK.
- What's wrong with him?
- He's sick.
Give him some water!
Drink, drink.
Drink, drink. You won't drink?
Drink!
Dear lady, give me a little water too.
Madam, I'm thristy.
I'm parched!
Give me something to drink.
I'm thirsty.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going on.
For five nuts, will you carry the sick boy on your blackboard?
Five nuts?
OK.
God help us!
What's wrong with the old man?
He can't piss.
He's sick.
Sick?
Where are you taking him?
To the border.
To the border?
Who is that woman?
That's the old man's daughter.
He wants to marry her off.
Once it's done, he'll go to his grave in peace.
How much does he want for her dowry?
Nothing.
What do you mean, nothing?
She's poor?
If you want her hand, give him a walnut tree.
I don't have one. I'm a teacher.
I only have this blackboard.
- Only this blackboard?
- Yes.
I must ask her father if he will allow it...
Sure you won't regret it?
No, I won't regret it.
Get him down there
What about me?
Let's go and ask for her hand right away.
Force yourself, my brother. Piss.
Hurry up. Don't be afraid.
Don't look at her!
You haven't been introduced.
Said!
You wish to marry Halaleh?
Yes.
- You agree?
- Yes.
Come on.
Come on... piss.
Are you sure?
Yes.
- You will shield her from hunger?
- Yes.
- And from thirst?
- I will shield her from hunger.
- You swear not to abandon her?
- I promise.
Halaleh?
Yes?
Do you accept Said as your husband with this blackboard for a dowry?
Are you agreed?
You wish to marry him?
With the blackboard?
The blackboard? Yes.
Yes.
You are truly agreed?
Halaleh!
And you, do you take him?
Yes.
You are now husband and wife.
Let's rest here.
You want to stop here?
You want to be stuck here forever?
Won't you get sick of it?
What's your name?
Have you got any toothache?
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.
Which tooth is it?
Do you know how to read and write?
Do you want to learn?
As you wish.
What's your name?
- Your name?
- Hayyaz.
Hayyaz?
You do this journey all the time?
Aren't you tired?
- You know how to read and write?
- No.
- You don't want to?
- No.
Do you know what it would allow you to do?
To read a book or a newspaper, to work, to listen, to speak...
When you can read a book, you discover stories...
Stories?
I've got a hundred.
It was spring. I climbed to the peak with your friends, to the top of the mountain.
The goats were grazing peacefully.
We chased a rabbit.
It ran out of breath.
We caught it.
My friend tortured it.
He wanted to cut its head off.
I told him it was a sin.
But he continued to torment it, he still wanted to cut its head off.
He tortured it and tried to cut its head off.
I said that it was a sin.
I told him to stop and I grabbed his hand, to try stop him.
He insulted me and cut the rabbit's head off.
They washed it and split it up without giving me my share.
That upset me.
I went off and cried.
I led my goats away and then we fought.
Then, as it was late, we went our separate ways to our homes.
Drop it!
I don't need your stories.
I want to teach you.
Sir, your honour, please come here a minute.
- What's your name?
- Reeboir.
Reeboir? Me too.
No kidding?
Do you know what that says, Reeboit?
No idea.
That says "he who walks".
The traveller.
- Do you know how to read and write?
- No.
- Do you want me to teach you?
- Yes!
- You really do?
- Yes.
- Shall we begin?
- OK.
Take it, eat.
- No, thank you.
- Please, eat.
Thank you.
- What do you do?
- I'm a teacher.
You're joking? You're a teacher?
Can you teach me to write my name?
- Do you want to learn?
- Yes. Really.
- You've never written your name?
- No.
Hello.
Where are you going with the kid?
Go and play.
Are you OK?
Go and play!
Don't cry, your mother's coming.
Come and play with the nuts.
Stay here, little one.
Mummy's coming.
Sit down and play.
Don't move. Come on. Sit down.
Hold the walnut in your hand.
That's right... like that.
That's it... just like that.
Lift your hand.
Throw it!
"I love you".
Now spell it.
Lift your hand, like that.
Watch me.
I... love... you.
Look at me...
"I love you"
You won't answer?
Fine, I'll give you a zero because you wouldn't answer me.
You cheated.
You stretched out your arm.
You cheated!
We'll have a return game!
As you refuse to answer me,
I'll give you zero.
But because you're a good girl,
I'll give you eighteen.
"Eighteen".
Come.
Why do you refuse to learn?
I'm the best teacher around.
All my pupils get... twenty out of twenty!
You deserve zero, but you're a good girl. I'll give you eighteen.
I want to piss.
Help me, God...
Spare me, God...
Help me, God...
Spare me, God...
Come here and try and relieve yourself.
If you don't squeeze it out, you'll die.
You've been suffering for three days now.
Hurry up.
Piss... Piss... Piss.
Hurry up...
Relieve yourself. Quick.
If you don't, you're as good as dead.
Hurry up.
Let's help him!
Couldn't manage it?
I love you.
You, Blackboard! Move...
- You still couldn't piss?
- No.
God help me!
- You didn't piss?
- No.
I swear to you, Satan himself could piss in that water.
I have pissed in that water, but not him.
He must have committed some terrible sin and now he can't piss!
- You didn't piss?
- No.
My God, have mercy on me!
Have mercy on me.
You didn't piss?
No.
That's it. Yes, R.
Well done.
B like Bread.
B like Bread...
O like Oil...
See how easy it is: Reeboir...
Run, quick.
Run!
Quick!
Repeat: R like Reeboir.
Reeboir.
He's fallen down!
Shakak!
- Who's fallen?
- Hayyaz.
Don't cry, Hayyaz.
Tell the story of the rabbit.
It was spring.
Me and four friends we climbed up high, to the top of the mountain.
The sheep were feeding happily.
We saw a rabbit and we caught it.
- You can read and write, boy?
- Yes.
- You can?
- Yes.
But you told me you couldn't!
I don't trust strangers.
Why?
My mother warned me not to.
Your friends can read?
Most of them, yes.
But their mothers told them never to trust strangers.
Children. Listen to me a minute.
Sit down.
Don't waste what time you have.
Let me teach you.
Look at my blackboard!
I want ot teach you to read and write.
Watch me! Listen to me!
Don't listen to him.
Let's get out of here!
Let's go! Carry him.
Children! Where are you going?
Stop!
Listen to me!
Don't go!
It's your fault, all this!
Children!
- Repeat.
- Did I say it right?
Well done.
Very good.
Stretch out the R...
R like Reeboir.
Listen, friend.
What happened: we chased the rabbit, we caught it and we ate it.
It was tasty!
Delicious!
A like Apple...
Be quiet.
They're behind us.
Reeboir and his group, this way.
Group two, take the other path.
The rest of you, follow me.
Be careful. It's dangerous.
Not this way!
There are landmines everywhere!
Take the other path.
Look out!
Don't get yourselves killed.
Go round the other side!
Two times two?
Four.
Reply!
Reply swiftly, learn swiftly.
Two times three?
Six.
Four times two?
Come on, answer!
Two times five?
Come on: ten!
To learn quickly you must answer quickly.
One times two?
Two.
Two times two? Four.
One times two? Two.
Mother, a rabbit!
Chuan!
What are you doing?
The Devil take you!
Halaleh!
Where is she gone?
The Devil take you!
Halaleh!
Where are you?
Please, sir, have you seen my wife?
Where are you going?
Stop...
You want some walnuts?
One times two is two!
Why are you running away?
Have I done something wrong?
If maths is too difficult,
I'll teach you to read.
Repeat after me...
"I love you"
See, it's easy.
Say it!
Come on, say it!
Say "I love you".
Look at me.
What sort of student are you?
I'll give you eight.
No, not eight.
That would fail you.
I'll give you ten, so you pass.
Say it!
Say "I love you".
You don't want to?
What sort of student are you?
I'm giving you zero.
At least say that you don't love me.
What's wrong?
You won't say that either?
Here comes another zero.
Happy now?
Now a zero for your son.
Here's a zero for your son.
What?
You still won't answer?
I'll give you a zero for your father.
Here.
Still got nothing to say?
I'll give myself a zero.
For having been stupid enough to follow you.
What kind of a life is this?
Goodbye.
How could I have loved you?
You're not listening to me!
Blackboard!
Stop!
Blackboard!
Stop.
Listen!
My heart is like a train.
At every station, someone gets on or off.
But there is someone who never gets off.
My son.
Halaleh...
What's happening?
Escape! Hurry up!
What's going on?
The soldiers at the border have opened fire!
A like Apple.
Break the syllables up.
Excuse me, Sir. I'm sorry.
We're in danger.
I'll come back later.
Halt!
Who goes there?
What's your name?
- You don't want to tell me?
- Ghazal.
Do you know how to read and write?
- Do you?
No.
- Where is your village?
- Down there.
- That's Dezl?
- Yes.
- Is there a school?
- No.
- Do you want a teacher?
- No.
- Will we have to wait long?
- Who knows.
Where are your friends?
We're meeting up by the river.
No, it was near the goats.
- They're not coming.
- They've been caught.
Thanks for the milk. Excellent.
Sir, I've written something.
- What?
- I wrote something.
- What?
- I wrote my name.
- Well done.
I wrote Reeboir.
Run for your life!
Take him.
Come.
Quick.
It's just like at Halebtcheh...
I built a wall to protect us from chemical weapons.
Father!
Chemical weapons...
Father!
Look after him.
Chemical weapons...
What's happened?
I pissed.
Hide under the blackboard.
My daughter!
Your brother is dead. Let's go.
He wanted to die in his homeland.
He isn't dead.
Come on. He is dead.
- Just like at Halebtcheh.
- It's rifle fire.
It's not chemical weapons.
Don't worry.
It's the soldiers from over the border who were firing.
It's not chemical weapons.
Don't be afraid, my darling.
The women...
The children...
We're not going to die.
It's not chemical weapons.
It's the soldiers, over the border.
If you hear us, they'll fire.
I swear, it's not chemical weapons.
The women...
The men...
Hide under the blackboard.
I'll protect you.
Strop!
There. The border.
The land of your fathers, of your ancestors.
Your homeland!
You're lying!
I swear I'm not.
It's the truth. Take a good look.
Don't you recognise Halebtcheh?
No. It's not the border.
He's tricked us, I know it.
He's lying.
It's not the border.
We are lost.
I know our border very well.
This isn't it.
I'm not lying.
I swear to you this is it.
This is your homeland.
This isn't the border!
We are lost!
Can't you understand?
Don't you believe me?
You're lying.
You've tricked us, Blackboard!
I swear to you, I'm not lying.
It's been like this since the bombing.
It's not true!
I swear to you, this is the border.
You're looking at Halebtcheh.
It's because of the bombing...
God be praised!
We are grateful to you.
Here are the nuts.
What will you do now?
Will you cross the border with us?
No, I can't. but your wife wants to cross over.
She won't stay with you.
What's your decision?
If she doesn't want me, what can I do?
I don't know. You must decide.
A divorce?
Yes, if that's what she wants.
Let's find out.
Are you coming with us, Blackboard?
I can't.
I belong here, in this land.
Your wife wants to return to her country. She doesn't want you.
Did she tell you that?
There's nothing I can do.
I'll divorce her.
- You will divorce her?
- Yes.
Go and find her.
Put it down here.
Do you agree to a divorce?
And that you will take the blackboard?
The blackboard? Yes.
You may look at each other one last time.
Lift your hand.
Take that stick.
Halaleh, you are now divorced, and the blackboard is yours.
May God keep you from hunger!
May God keep you from thirst!
May God keep you from solitude!
Take your blackboard.
And give me my stick.
Goodbye.
I love you.
Chuan! What are you doing?
Hurry up. Come on.
Come, quickly.

Well, friends, my wife's waiting.
My dad believes it won't last longer than a few months.
We won't intrude for very long, Herr Iek.
It's terrible, David.
We must be hopeful.
Herr Iek.
There's jewelry in my dad's study.
You know where.
Just in case.
- Do you need some help?
- Hi.
This is Mr. imaek.
The younger Mr. Wiener.
- imaek.
- He's my neighbor Franta.
He's a good man.
Something small for the journey.
Well, good-bye.
- We're very sorry.
- It's not your fault.
Aunt Frieda wrote that it's okay in Theresienstadt.
Children go to school.
There's an orchestra, food, even hot water.
Maybe better than squeezing in the kids' room here, eh?
We just don't know why she mentioned Uncle Otto's cough.
We're all getting sick now.
It's just that Uncle Otto's been dead for 1 5 years.
Good luck.
Alik!
Come here.
Herr Imaek.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Wiener, what are you doing here?
I need help.
If somebody sees you, they'll execute the whole street.
I don't have a choice.
I have to hide.
Good God! Get out ofhere!
We have children.
Jew!
A Jew is here!
A Jew is here! Help!
DIVIDED WE FALL
Can't those bastards be quiet?
Bastard means a child out of wedlock... and these are our neighbors' children.
Exactly.
I don't know what drives people to keep breeding... and multiplying.
Must be some twisted self-preservation instinct.
Even if you could have a child, you know...
I still wouldn't bring it into this world.
But it's not like that.
Oh, please, don't believe in miracles.
- Don't pray to her for a kid.
- I don't pray to her.
- Oh, you do.
- I do not.
Then pray.
Don't you think I know you?
You always get that holy expression.
Your eyes get moist... and then things start happening inside.
You're nuts.
Well, and now your Nazi friend is here.
United we stand--
My friends, good morning.
- God damn your jokes.
- I've got something foryou.
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
I have a surprise foryou.
Shall we have some real coffee,Josef?
You shouldn't have.
You can't tell me what
I should and shouldn't do.
If I can, I give.
I was never stingy.
By the way,Josef, I arranged papers allowing you to drive.
Thank him.
- Thank you, Mr. Prohaska.
- Horst.
You're in a good mood today, aren'tyou?
Why not?
Don't trust London,Josef.
Hey, I see through you, Boss.
Relax. I'm not petty, and I was in the Patriots' Club.
Come, madam. Have a look.
-Josef, you're not interested?
- But, of course.
Don't say a thing.
Your head is full of Stalingrad... and the never-ending siege of Leningrad, right?
I will straighten out your errors and illusions.
Imagine this is Moscow.
These are our armies on the eastern front.
The retreat back to Rzhev and Vyazma was a brilliant move... by our offensive headquarters, understand?
They created an amazing maneuvering space, right?
And as spring follows winter, the Fuhrer renews his forces.
And he will pound this space with all his crushing might.
And by the by, it's about 250 divisions.
And not only German.
And Bolshevism will suffer at the hands of Hungarians...
Italians, Spanish... volunteers from
France and Belgium... and even the Slovaks.
Cigarette?
I wouldn't depriveyou of 1 5 crowns.
Well, actually 20.
Incidentally... a new family is moving into Wiener's villa tomorrow.
The house has been cleaned and sterilized.
It could be worse.
So tomorrow they're moving into Wiener's villa.
I hope you're not going to keep on pitying them?
He wasn't just our employer.
He was also... our acquaintance, wasn't he?
Careful.
He was your superior, and you were my superior. That's all.
Today my superior is Herr Kepke.
Okay, but he was a decent man, wasn't he?
He did things for you, too, didn't he?
Look, you can't expect me to show sympathy to some Yid... or any other enemy of the Reich.
Come and have a look, madam, at this husband of yours.
He used to be the energetic boss of the sales department.
And now he's sitting here like this, sipping coffee.
Maybe you'd better start working before they notice.
Maybe you all might have found out that while... building the border fortifications... a transom fell and broke my leg in three places.
So for your information that means I'm disabled.
I know, a loser-- A hero.
I almost forgot.
Look at this. Perfect work.
Our Leni embroidered this.
Isn't she clever?
She said it was for the uncle who always sleeps.
I have one just like it, but...
I never have time to use it, so much work--
- What are you pretending to be?
- Why, you, you sleepy head.
And you laugh.
Come lie down.
Lie here and rot.
You're also a hero.
God damn it. This--
You have it in your pocket.
Let me see.
Come on. I'm not a child.
What about my head?
Wear this cap.
- I look like a beetle.
- But it suits you.
It doesn't really matter, does it?
- Is that good-bye?
- No.
It's risky, isn't it?
And all ofa sudden, we understand each other.
Just a hint is enough for me.
So don't go. Who's making you?
Haven't we done enough for them?
Who knows if they'll ever come back.
- Let me.
- Oh, please.
Please, I can tie my own shoe laces, huh?
I can't leave them to those Nazis.
Understand?
I made a promise, and I need to keep it.
It works.
Mr. Iek--
David!
Can you take the light out of my eyes?
- What are you doing here?
- I escaped from Poland.
I needed something valuable.
- But you can't stay here.
- I'm off tomorrow night.
But you don't understand.
You can't stay for even a minute.
Germans are coming tomorrow morning.
- And with you?
- Where with us?
Oh, you mean at our place.
God, what are you doing here?
I was afraid.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Who is it?
Good evening, Mrs. Marie.
David.
Let's go.
What is that?
I shit my pants. Turn it off.
Take my hand.
You want some jam on it?
- Close the door.
- I am.
You know, this is no longer exactly a safe area.
A safe place.
It's full of collaborators and fiinks.
You wouldn't believe... what abnormal times can do to normal people.
The swine.
I would.
What about your family?
I don't know.
They're probably dead.
You wrote that conditions in Theresienstadt were okay.
No one could write the truth from there.
It's just a transfer station... to the camps in Poland... and nobody there is supposed to survive.
Nobody at all.
I was lucky to work where they sort confiscated goods.
Clothes and valuables.
And after 18 months I was able... to bribe one of the SS men.
Two of us escaped.
And what do you plan to do here?
I lived here all my life... so I thought maybe someone here might help me.
But what are you going to do now?
Tomorrow I'm meeting a friend at a set place out of town.
I promised to get some money and then we'll move on.
Well, I'll give you a lift there.
I have papers.
And I have a car borrowed from... an ex-coworker.
He worked in your warehouse.
- Before the war.
- Obviously.
Maybe your friend waited somewhere else.
No.
They probably got him.
I'll go on myself. You go back.
- Thank your wife again.
- Maybe he'll still come.
Something might have kept him.
Maybe.
Halt! Come here.
Oh, my God.
Good morning.
Excuse me, please.
We're having car trouble.
- How can I help you?
- A number 13 wrench.
- A number 13 wrench.
- Yes, I understand.
- Number 14.
14. I'm familiar with Tatras.
It's a Czech car.
Oh, right.
Number 14, wrench number 14.
You've saved our lives.
We've been getting soaked here for an hour already.
- Do you have enough gas?
-Just a moment.
Do you have enough gas?
Shit!
I'm all thumbs.
You are very helpful and kind, and very funny.
Number 14.
Start it up, please.
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, my God.
David.
Than kyou.
- What are you doing?
- What?
I'm darkening the windows, and you turn on the light.
- But you're already done.
- Damn it. We must be careful.
Good heavens.
- That's mine.
- Let go.
Thanks a lot.
I know how risky it is for you.
This is for you.
- What is it?
- Oh, no.
David, you're not serious.
Keep them.
Come on. Let's go.
Go, go.
You're afraid, aren'tyou?
Before the war many people had these made.
They suspected what was to come... and made these shelters.
Now they're used as safes or pantries.
I even helped to make the one at your father's.
Below here are the stairs.
You can hear what's happening in the house.
And here bars were torn out.
Now it leads to the rain gutter.
Here's a mattress. Heat will come in from the next room.
The pig must go.
I'll take care of it.
At night you can come out if you want, okay?
Well, we'll have to see.
But he has to wash himself, doesn't he?
Yeah, but mainly he has to be quiet.
If something happens, scratch softly... like a mouse, okay?
Here are some blankets and a kerosene lamp.
Good night.
Good night.
I'll bring you a warmer blanket.
David--
Good night.
We have to do something immediately.
About what?
About getting rid of this problem.
We have to eat it.
- We'll simply eat it, right?
- Oh, God.
But what about him?
What? Do you want to send him away?
Come on. Want. Don't want.
Does it depend on what I want?
Could I have imagined
I'd be left out of all this?
We watched from the window... and told ourselves it was just passing by.
Today it's after us.
I expected something like this, but I'm still shaken up.
Look, nothing changes if you send him away.
They catch him around the first corner and then... they'll find out he was here.
That he was here and that you didn't report him.
So, what are you saying?
That makes it easier then.
So, what are you saying?
That makes it easier then.
You want to turn him in?
- What?
- You want to report him?
- Oh, please, really, Marie.
- You decided for him... for you, for me and for everyone on this street.
- And are you blaming me orwhat?
- No.
I'm not blaming you.
It's just good that we have no children.
You're so right.
What an awful smell.
It's soap.
It's really waking me up.
He has to help us with it.
You think he'd allow pork past his lips?
In the circumstances, he should eat what he gets.
Oh, it was hard and risky work... getting it here.
Hands up!
- That'd surprise you, eh?
- What an idiot.
Josef, you're asking for trouble.
What is all this?
Marie, you can smell these shenanigans down the street.
You're asking to be searched.
Show me.
It's not tough yet, just like the times themselves.
But they will be.
My hat, please.
I hope you didn't get my car all greasy.
Josef, you're really asking for trouble.
And what are you going to do with it?
We'll eat some.
You can have some.
Something I'll take.
Something I'll give.
Marie, come have a look.
- Look at this beauty.
- Where did you get it?
We confiscated it yesterday.
They won't need it anymore.
And here it will add a certain flair.
So, have you decided?
The position with us is still open.
I feel so good here with you.
Josef always had class.
He knew how to live.
And he got me the job at the warehouse, right?
The Jew Wiener was stingy, but good during the crisis.
I fed three kids.
Bastards. Now they're used to it and can imagine nothing else.
Josef, do you still remember the boy that everyone called...
Wurst instead of Horst?
- You know, Wurst like sausage.
- I know what wurst means.
Wurst, fetch me a beer.
Get out of here, Wurst.
Back to the Reich.
Back where? My home is here.
You mean with us?
Certainly.
Josef accepted me almost like a son.
He sent all those jokers packing.
- By the way, is there any beer?
- No.
Come on. Accept. Didn't accept.
That was long ago.
I can remember once--
Today we all just laugh about it.
Today, I've simply accepted you.
We need to help each other.
I was in troubl eyesterday.
Tomorrow it might beyou.
Especially, if you treat the law on hoarding likeyou do.
That'd mean prison, Marie.
But it's delicious.
- Nothing will be forgotten.
- Hey, cut it out. Kindly stop it.
See how he stares at me?
Don't stare.
- Please, Wurs-- Horst.
- Thanks. I've had enough.
You think I don't notice how some people avoid me?
How they cross to the other side of the street?
That's their business.
What have I done to them?
To anybody?
I'm helping decent people.
Is that a sin?
No, it's not a sin.
Everybody just talks about helping, gabs and gabs.
This means helping to me.
- So you're actually a hero.
- What do you mean hero?
Who would be foolish enough today to act like a hero?
What about you?
You sit here either stuffing yourself with pork... or wallowing on the couch.
We have to survive.
Every lovely thing should survive, be saved, eh?
What are you doing here?
You have to come home, Dad.
Herr Kepke is waiting.
Is that how you knock on the door of nice people? Idiot!
- This is Karl. Say hello.
- Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
I delivered him with my own hands. Wait outside.
Get rid of everything.
Properly. People are pigs.
You might be turned in, and what could I do about it?
To be safe, skin a rabbit to be able to show the bones.
Since we're in this situation... we must follow certain rules.
He drops by whenever he wants.
Do you understand?
- Please.
- Well, what?
He comes by to see you.
I'm just... an excuse.
Well, deprive him ofit.
Take that job he's always offering.
Oh, Marie, it's not--
You think I--
I should--
What?
Do you know where you're pushing me?
- What's that look?
- Do you know what you're asking?
You brought David here, so do what you have to do.
What are you doing?
Why are you setting it there?
We agreed on some rules, right?
And you're playing restaurant here.
Take it to him there immediately.
Rules will be observed.
Take it to him there.
This is not a road side inn for fugitives.
But it's dark outside, and it's locked.
He can't be locked in that hole day and night.
- Give them to me.
- Listen.
There is no where dark enough to hide us, darling, eh?
So take it and bring it to him there. Go!
-Josef, please.
- Please.
Don't say please. Go.
- Why are you pushing me?
- Sorry.
Wish him bonappetit.
Goddamn it!
Thankyou.
You're welcome.
- Your husband is right.
- I know.
But it's one thing to be right... and another to be able to stand such things.
Do you need anything?
Aren't you cold here?
Did you finish the book?
I can't read much.
Are you thinking about what happened to your family?
Kaje, my sister... could have saved herself... at least for a while.
After arriving at the camp, she was offered to be a kapo... provided she'd be hard enough.
She was given a club... and told to beat our parents to death.
I could see my father and mother... kneeling there, begging her to do it.
Come.
Nice.
I haven't seen your wife for a long time. How is she?
Oh, yeah. She's started studying French.
- With whom?
- What?
- Who's she taking lessons from?
- By herself.
By herself?
Well, when such a beautiful woman has no kids... she never knows what to do with herself.
She's been ill a lot lately.
I never see her.
No, no,Josef.
You can't refuse medicine.
- Well, thanks then.
-Just take it.
I know a good doctor.
You could go to him.
Confidential information:
They're sniffing everywhere.
They no longer trust anyone.
Anything can be an excuse.
That some Czech starts with French before knowing German.
- Oh, come on--
- Don't underestimate it.
You also need to train your facial expression.
The Germans read faces.
They are excellent typologists.
Every day you must practice that irreproachable loyal expression.
It's easy foryou.
You were born with it.
No, I wasn't. Try it.
Relax the muscles.
Now!
Now I don't know what you're thinking about at all.
- Neither do I.
- Don't laugh.
This was my son Andreas' favorite composition.
The one who fell, a hero... at the defense of Kharkov.
Go to your room, Willy.
You know, gentlemen... ofcourse it saddens me greatly.
But pride is stronger.
And I'm aware of the significance for us... of the loss of a single young German life.
Lately I read... a fascinating article about this.
Somebody exactly calculated that the life of one German... a soldier... is worth 20 Slavs and 100 Jews.
- A hundred?
- Yes.
I brought you something.
Vitamins and a sunlamp.
A big empty house and you're stuck in this hole, huh?
I feel so sorry about it.
I'm afraid our neighbors will figure something out.
I don't trust anyone anymore, and them least ofall.
I have no one to speak to anymore.
It's enough to speak to you sometimes.
Thanks to that I can stand it.
Me too.
We just have a bigger and lighter cell.
What is it?
Do you need anything?
Well, I think I caught a cold.
That's too bad.
Here's a pillow.
Well, good night.
So that old Kepke isn't a bad boss, eh?
'Night.
What about Marie?
She's alone all day.
Perhaps a visit from me would cheer her up.
Like I said, she doesn't feel well, Horst. 'Night.
I am in Paris.
I visit the museums--
The Louvre is very nice.
I visit it three times.
You must be crazy.
I thought you were sleeping.
Did you get the medicine?
Of course, but Prohaska walked me all the way here.
What if he'd come up?
You once called him a snoop, didn't you?
Horst--
Careful about darkening the windows,Josef.
'Night.
I just don't want you going in there when I'm not home.
- He's not well.
- So give him another blanket.
I already did. I gave him a fur coat and the sun lamp.
- What?
- What?
My sun?
I don't feel well either, and you give him my sun.
Go to bed.
I'll make you some tea.
If there's any left.
Don't you want to wall him in there so you can relax?
Josef, he's really sick.
Exactly. You might catch something from him.
What are you doing?
I'm going to sleep here in case he needs anything.
No, I'm sleeping on the couch.
Go to bed.
Don't worry. I'll stick a slipper in the door.
You're such a--
This life is for shit.
Good night.
Is it beneath the carob tree
And it's not easy
Is it beneath the fig tree
And all is green and free
I lie beneath the almond tree
And it's like a dream
My gorilla
Has gorilla in the zoo
My gorilla
Lives content elyan true
He can't speak of politics
But if his wife has got the itch he can scratch it
- Good afternoon.
- Agata, come on home!
I need to buy a briefcase--
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Gestapo, Marie.
Cut it out, you fool.
- Hi. We have visitors.
-Josef, please--
Josef, come here.
Please.
- I need to buy a briefcase.
- Yes.
- What do you mean yes, you fool?
- Sit down, Herr Kepke.
Marie, you look terrible.
Isn't the medicine working?
You must excuse me.
The old man's middle son got killed.
To Paul!
Don't give him any more.
He's had enough.
He should speak German if that's his native tongue.
I'm sorry.
Well, then, to the hero Paul.
Don't you say Paul's name.
Josef. Please--
Josef. Please--
Who's calling us from here?
Who is that calling like that?
Why don't you air the room a bit, Marie?
Let it go. My Paul.
This is your fault too.
Have you tried compresses on your chest?
Careful you don't catch something.
People like me rarely catch anything. I'm Nordic.
Nordic race.
Marie, maybe the time will come... when from the union of people like you and me--
What are you afraid of?
That time and that human... may be closer than you think.
Well, Marie, let's not fight about it.
Josef, your wife is burning up.
Come and see.
My gorilla
Has gorilla in the zoo
Bye-bye.
You're Czechs.
You should be ashamed.
- Good afternoon, Marie.
- You startled me.
Healthy, agile, beautiful, just like I like you.
- Where's Josef?
- Who's that?
He's still at Dr. Fischer's.
I think it'll come out that you're not the problem.
Look.
What's that? For your wife?
If she weighed 50 kilos less.
I know your size exactly.
No, I can't accept it.
Thank you. Take it.
On the contrary, you'll try it on now.
I have a car and some
Moselle wine and cold chicken.
- Let's take a little trip, huh?
- No, no.
That's an order!
Josef jealous of a gift from a friend?
Was he jealous of sausages or medicine? Try it on.
It's for someone much younger, isn't it?
Well, that's true, but it will fit you too.
I'll try it on... but I won't go anywhere with you.
- It will be our little secret.
- What?
The test might last for two or three hours... and we can wait for the results together.
We can wait here ifyou like.
No, I don't want to. Excuse me.
- What now?
- I forgot something.
Good?
And after all, Marie... we're all as young as we feel.
And today I feel 21 .
I need to be home early.
Perhaps you forgot to feed your pets?
As far as I know you killed all the rabbits.
If I leave out that wood worm in the wardrobe--
Am I right?
There'd be no danger from me... even if you had a buffalo in that closet.
- Horst!
- Did I hear you right?
- Pay attention.
- I am, Marie.
I am.
But you relax a bit.
You're so high-strung.
As tense as a bow.
Ah, my old acquaintance.
Please.
What a lucky coincidence.
Is it anything serious?
No,just a routine checkup.
Dr. Fischer is a great specialist... a true professional.
During 1 00 sterilizations of Gypsy trash--
I bet Josef hasn't taken you anywhere since the war began.
Just a minute, please.
Try it.Just a minute.
- And two cognacs, please.
- No, I don't want one.
Why? You're always afraid of something.
And of what? Of yourself?
Of you.
Of me? For God's sake, why?
I don't know.
I suffer just like you.
Really, I'm not the one for such trips. I'm married.
To a burnt-out wick.
You voluntarily live in a tomb.
All of us do.
You're married, too, and have children.
Exactly.
I have a wife, and the children you long for.
Look, I'll tell you something, Marie.
I have a very ambitious wife.
She's persistent, enduring... and with her constant persuading and working on me... she completely changed me.
My roots are here.
She's from Germany.
I'm from Bohemia.
You don't really think
I believe in all that stuff?
- Then why did you marry her?
- Because I loved her.
And now you don't love her anymore.
No. Not anymore.
And do you still love Josef?
Yes.
I didn't want it.
- Do you know what she wants?
- Who?
That fanatic of mine.
For us to move to the Reich, to, allegedly, a safe place.
So go.
But they bomb them every day.
She's obsessed with the idea that after the war...
Czechs will skin us alive.
- Anyway--
- Sorry.
Sir.
A drop is enough.
Perhaps she could lend a hand.
Marie, come and see.
- Come and have a look.
- What is it?
Hey, I got it.
- That's poaching.
- That's a crawfish.
A bit of danger should always accompany such a trip, eh?
How about if I catch a few and we cook them for dinner?
They're a great delicacy.
- If it's worth it to you.
- It is, Marie.
You're so beautiful.
Just a parasol and it's--
Beautiful Bohemia, Bohemia mine.
My rising soul is ever thine.
Are you switching to the resistance because of me?
No, Marie,
I'm preparing an offensive.
- That's not necessary.
- But it is.
I don't like it.
But you are an intelligent woman.
- Leave me alone.
- Marie--
There's an easy solution to your problem... without any experiments or operations.
- Get away from me.
- I know you want it.
Your solution isjust to rape me!
What rape? Nobody's here.
We're here alone, Marie--
Leave me alone.
- Take a deep breath.
- Thanks for the advice.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I might be pregnant, and I don't want to lose it.
Right. Marie, I'm not 20.
Don't try to make a fool of me.
Such a lie.
I want to go home.
So go. I can't right now.
I have bad news foryou.
Unfortunately, the tests prove that it's you.
You can't have children.
I understand.
Thank you, Doctor.
Don't mention it, Mr. iek.
- Let's cross to the other side.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. imaek.
Don't run away. I can explain.
Libushka, you don't know the truth about me.
I'm a Czech just like you.
Unluckily, I have a problem
I can't explain just now.
Josef, I don't know why, I--
I'm a decent man with nothing in common with those swine.
Hello, hello. My friend.
- Would you like a lift?
- No, thank you.
Too bad.
Good-bye.
Come, children.
Let's leave this friend.
Libushka--
Jesus! What are you doing here?
Sorry I startled you.
- I've decided to leave.
- What?
We might not survive the next visit.
Have you gone crazy?
Dear Ieks, your reward... is in the drawer on the left.
David, it's not--
Understand? You leave today, and we're dead tomorrow.
Where would you go?
Don't worry.
They won't get me alive.
Alive or dead, you think they won't trace this sweater?
David.
This is just great.
The whole city can see me... walking around with Nazis... collaborators!
I took a job at their office... and now you want to leave.
Where were you?
- Are you going someplace?
- Yeah, of course, Marie.
This guy here got bored, you know.
He needs a bit ofair.
Don't shout like that!
David, get immediately back where you belong.
I know but if you understand, Horst.
Just a minute, please.
I'll be back.
We must wait a bit.
I heard.
Here we go!
Kepke must leave the Wieners' villa.
Why?
He's no longer the father of heroes, but o fa deserter.
Deserter?
The little one, that squirt, was shot deserting.
By his own people, the Germans.
His wife had a breakdown.
She's in a mental hospital... and Kepke had a stroke.
What is that to us?
- What? You don't understand.
- What?
Prohaska wants to move him into our place.
- Here?
- Yeah.
- Where here?
- Don't shout.
Horst, could we have a word alone?
No, no. No cajoling, no bribing.
It's been registered.
This is a solution.
A broken man is no danger toyou.
- United we stand.
- Horst--
Come.
- Frau Iek. Herr Kepke.
- I know.
Please accept my condolences.
A-- How do you say terrible?
- Terrible what?
- A terrible tragedy.
A terrible tragedy.
Yes, we're very sorry... about what happened.
We'd like to helpyou, but... unfortunately it's not possible.
Why not, may I ask?
We've spoken about it already.
Yes? I don't remember that at all.
I'm pregnant.
What?
We'll need the children's room.
Translate that.
I am pregnant... and we need a room for the child.
Then that's another matter.
In that case no one can be accommodated here.
Congratulations,Josef.
Thanks.
I hope you know what you're doing, dear lady.
And I'll need a certificate from Dr. Fischer.
Let's go, Albrecht.
Can you forgive me, Herr iek?
I apologize toyou.
Here you go.
Come here, my little--
Are you crazy?
Wait. I can explain.
Good night.
Why are you here?
Where's the key to that door?
- I made it all up.
- Come on.
You can lie so persuasively with your upbringing?
That time with Prohaska... was much worse than I told you.
He acted like a pig.
I never thought he'd try to get revenge like this.
I couldn't have known that you'd believe it.
You surprise me.
How can I trust you now?
I've never been with anybody... except you.
I believe you. I have to.
I want to.
It's only that-- Wait.
- What?
- Marie.
This is a terrible problem.
What are we going to do now?
About what?
The whole neighborhood knows we can't have children.
I have a paper from the doctor.
It's nothing for them to check it.
Prohaska won't stop.
And if it comes out... then not even your Madonna can help us.
- What about the doctor?
- What?
The doctor?
Come on. He's their man.
He's a swine.
Oh, God.
- There's only one thing to do.
- What?
You've got to get pregnant as fast as possible.
Otherwise, we go to the gallows.
Our only hope... is David.
David?
David.
You can't ask me for that.
I'll never do it.
Never,Josef.
Are you crazy?
David, come here.
- Someone is ringing.
- I'll take care of it.
Get back in there.
I'll take care of it.
Just be calm.
Well, hi.
I came to speak openly with you.
If you think I'll cover for you, you're kidding yourself.
Everything has its limit.
I'll never betray myself.
- So don't.
- Look atyourself.
Well, we're celebrating, you know.
Such big news, right?
So it was news to you, too, huh?
I was lucky to be there at just that moment.
By the way, when did she see a doctor?
- What?
- When did she see a doctor?
You mean my wife? Well, she... didn't want to scare me, you know?
She's terribly--
She wanted to be absolutely sure.
For years you were childless... and now when we need help, a miracle happens.
- Everyone will be suspicious.
- Don't yell at me.
But it's easy to disprove unfounded suspicion, right?
Yes, ofcourse.
We're already working on it.
I hope so.
The times are cruel, so don't play games with anyone.
- Want a drag?
- Do you understand?
Jesus Christ!
So come on.
Let's go.
David--
Sit here. I know it's terrible.
I understand you very, verywell.
Shall we remove the pictures?
- Crying won't help.
- But I can't.
This is a matter of life and death, and you say you can't.
- I don't say I can't.
- David, it's not against you.
David, come here.
Calm down.
Lie here nicely.
You can't leave us now.
It must be.
We have to. We simply have to.
Damn it. It's our lives.
And stop crying.
How is Mrs. iek?
I haven't seen her for a long time.
So you finally made it, huh?
One would have thought it was a hopeless case.
Fanda, stop fighting!
And, hey--
I'd be afraid to show my face.
I'm terribly ashamed.
I wanted to finally apologize toyou.
I behaved unacceptably that time.
Like an animal.
I'd be grateful if you'd just forget about it.
I took the liberty of getting a little something.
Have a look.
I don't need these anymore.
These are for a girl.
And these for if it's a boy.
Are you hungry?
No one's cooked for me for a half year.
- Hi.
-Josef, where were you?
You haven't come around for a long time.
So you've been designing
V2s in there?
No, no, I usually listen to the radio there.
- Have a hot cake.
- Thanks.
- Music?
- Music.
The music some will have to face.
Stalin's organ concerto? Doyou long for the tyranny of muzhiks?
Come on, Horst.
Don't believe that radio of yours.
I'll show you something. Look.
This is the Red Army.
This is our allies.
And this--
This is your wehrmacht.
And now look.
Don't jump the gun.
I envyyour tranquility... but don't fully understand your tingling happiness.
And I don't know what you mean by tingling happiness.
You must have an ace up your sleeve.
Horst, you act like you don't know me.
Josef, someone might come here and investigate a bit... and begin to unravel the whole story.
Ofcourse I'm joking, but now is the time of blunders... nervousness, errors and quick solutions.
You know what I mean.
You know that saying about one boat?
- That we're all in the same boat?
- Yes.
- We're afraid, right?
- Who's we? The two of us?
Not me, I'm not afraid.
Let me put it this way.
I just thought there might be an urgent need to hide... something or somebody in a safe place.
And I know such a place.
My place.
Nobody would look for anything or anybody there.
Yeah, ofcourse, maybe in a few weeks not even for you.
If so, I have relatives in the south, so then there.
Okay, but I don't need to hide anything or anybody... with your relatives in the south.
Goddamn it!
- I'm sorry.
- I'm going to lie down.
You're like a child.
Who will the kid take after?
- Think no one will find out?
- You know what?
Have a hot cake, Wurst, and then beat it.
- We shouldn't talk like this.
- But we will talk like this.
You can't be serious!
We're not in Paris, out of danger.
Every day here it's life and death.
Let's not pretend.
Where are you going?
The door is over there.
- But I'm interested in this one.
- Damn it.
What's going on?
This is it.
My God, what will we do? Josef?
- Stay calm.
- Do something.
- I'm afraid.
-Just wait.
Dear Mary, help me, please.
Please protect my child.
- What is this?
- Alik, come here.
Meat.
There's nothing here.
You are at the house ofa citizen of the Reich.
We've fulfilled our duty.
- Horst Prohaska.
- Yes.
Okay. Move on, move on.
They're gone.
You saved our lives, Horst.
Thanks.
Perhaps three ofyou.
You mean the child.
Divided we fall.
Andulka. For Alik.
Me too. Me too.
Bastards.
That was in our street.
- This is it.
- What?
Wait. I'll get Mrs. imaek.
No, you better get the doctor.
What? Go out? To town?
David, it's bad.
I've got to go to the hospital.
Take care of her, please.
Marie, be careful.
- Come and sit down.
- No, it's better to walk.
Hey!
My wife's having a baby.
Can't you see what's going on here?
My wife's having a baby.
Doctor!
I'd like to speak to the commander.
Good afternoon.
I'd like to speak to the commander.
Good afternoon. I need help.
- Hi, Franta.
- Do you know him?
Yeah. He's my neighbor,
Comrade Captain.
He worked for the Germans, confiscated Jewish property.
Was close to the collaborators.
He was a friend of the SS commander.
- Take him away.
- But why?
- You ask why?
- But, Franta--
I wouldn't have come here if that were true.
Can you disprove the accusations?
- Ofcourse I can.
- How?
The smell ofpork came from your house... while you sang German songs.
I hid a fugitive, aJew.
We couldn't be conspicuous.
I didn't want to arouse suspicion.
I had to be careful in front of our people too.
Captain, the son of a Jewish industrialist, David Wiener.
He lived for two years in our pantry.
You must remember David Wiener.
Today every swine suddenly fiinds a Jew or a partisan... one usually gone or dead long ago.
But mine--
Mine is sitting on my wife's bed, and she's giving birth.
Do you understand?
And the doctor is here, Captain.
You're his neighbor.
Is his wife pregnant?
It'll be easy to see for ourselves.
You say that the doctor is here somewhere?
- Yes, here, Captain.
- Well, okay.
Suicide. He had poison with him.
Just a minute.
So is your doctor here somewhere?
Him.
That's our doctor.
Come here. Yes, you.
- What is your specialization?
- General practitioner.
Goddamn it. Did anyone ask you?
No, they didn't.
Captain, my wife's giving birth, and I need a doctor.
Well, you don't look like a doctor.
You look more like a collaborating swine.
Please, Captain. Doctor--
Any complications, Mr. iek?
Has the baby dropped?
- Has labor started?
- It's premature.
It's Mrs. Marie's fiirst.
At her age it could be serious.
Captain, we have no time to waste.
We'll see. I, representing the army in exile...
Sergei, representing the Soviet army... and you, as a member of the resistance, let's go.
We have enough water.
Please bring some sheets.
Still, even at the very end--
No funny stuff.
And where's that Jew of yours
Josef, who are these people?
- Friends.
- Did you bring the doctor?
I'm here, Marie. I'm the doctor.
- What?
- Don't yell. Calm down.
And now show us that Jew of yours.
- Pardon?
- That Jew of yours.
It's coming.
Marie, relax. David?
Calm down. Where's David?
It's important.
It's coming,Josef.
I'm afraid it's already started.
I'm going to need help.
Well, you're the doctor.
We came on different business.
That must wait.
This is a matter of life and death.
Don't ever doubt it.
Stay here and help him.
- But, Captain--
- That's an order.
And you come with me.
I'm going to need hot water, some scissors... and string for that--
- For sealing the umbilical cord.
- I know, for tying it off.
David! He was--
David! He's gone. He was here.
Please, don't be afraid.
I delivered all of my kids.
Don't be afraid of me, Marie.
I beg you.
- Don't push. Not now--
- Horst.
Captain, I wouldn't tell such a stupid lie. Believe me.
And now my wife's delivering.
I can't have children.
Leave if you feel sick.
Get out.
Look, Captain, this was his.
Where would I get it?
You're trying to bribe me, you pig.
Get up and move.
Be human.
- Get moving.
- Captain.
These are not my jewels.
He hid them.
- Captain, on my knees I beg--
- On your knees, swine.
You're going to shoot me here like a dog?
- And who are you?
- This is our David.
- Who are you?
- This is our David.
- David Wiener.
- Do you have any papers?
What about this?
Show him your arm.
What about this?
Show him your arm.
What about this?
Sorry, but nowadays we can't just believe anyone.
Do you know the man in the next room?
Who doesn't know him?
Is he really a doctor?
Mainly, he's a man who knew about me the whole time.
He brought me medicine and food.
He never betrayed us.
He's a decent man.
He's one ofus.
We have a boy.
The picture of his mother, eh?
Good afternoon, Mr. Wiener.
Little one.
Alik!
Come on!
This is heavy!
Come on.
We have no time now.
Everything must be set right... or the master will be unhappy.
Let's go. Come on.
Madam, since I've been serving you for 24 years... may I ask you, why must you do this?
Please.
At least not on your birthday.
I'm 40 years old.
It is time to do something.
Otherwise,
I'll feel sorry for myself.
You're not gonna tell me something's wrong with the banquet, are you?
This is so tight,
I could hardly breathe.
Madam, everything's fine with the banquet.
Good.
I had a strange dream last night.
I dreamed that my lord had taken a second wife.
- He was so happy.
- You know how it is.
A man is happier the more wives he has.
Are you suggesting that I should consider...
May not be such a bad idea.
- I will do it then.
- Madam!
Madam Kang is dying!
Her blood is everywhere!
Come quick!
Mother, may I?
Go, go, go.
Don't disturb me.
I'm busy.
Madam Kang is dying.
Her baby refuses to be born.
No, you will not go.
Ailian, it is your
40th birthday party.
Lord, madam is worried that it might damage... our young lord's marriage to the Kangs' daughter... if she does not go over to help.
It will be a while before the guests arrive.
I will personally make sure that she is not late for the banquet.
Be late... and you will no longer belong to the Wu family!
Hey! Come back here!
Stop right now!
Communist, come back!
Be careful, madam.
I'm sorry.
Sorry. No men are allowed.
Someone is in labour right now.
Thank God you've come, madam.
Meichen.
It's Ailian.
Can you hear me?
Sorry, Ailian.
Forgive me for not telling you.
Too embarrassed.
It's all right.
It's good fortune to have a baby, even after 40.
No, please!
- You can't go in!
- Don't let him come in!
He can't go in there.
Father, I beg you.
Mother's dying.
The foreign doctor has come.
Where's the hot water?
Mr Kang, I've studied medicine.
I can help.
Leave me alone.
Doesn't he know that it's forbidden for men to see such things?
What if I can save her life?
Madam Kang will lose all face.
She would rather die than have any man but her husband see her there.
What good is face if she dies?
Pray for her.
I must talk to you before I die.
Please, take care of Lin Yi for me.
- Is she still conscious?
- Yes.
Andre, no!
I'm sorry.
Get out! Get out!
Get me a pan of hot water and some fresh towels.
Now!
Has your mother returned yet?
Where is she?
Lord.
Old Lady was wondering why we couldn't start yet.
She's losing patience.
You tell her we're almost ready.
What are we going to do?
Women. Never trust a woman!
- I heard you shouted at Madam Wu.
- Did I?
You know their family.
They own half this town.
You know that I needed her help, and she did help.
I've worked too hard here to let you make trouble for me.
Father! Father!
My master wants to give this to you.
I appreciate your master's kindness, but I cannot accept this.
Please give it back to him.
How dare you make all of us wait for you!
Madam Kang will live... and there is a foreign man, a priest.
Go apologize to my mother and guests.
We talk after dinner.
Let her be, my son.
Come sit by me, my daughter-in-law.
Let us begin.
Enjoy your meal.
If I were him, I'd spend money on a concubine, not a banquet.
The Japanese have virtually taken over Manchuria.
Maybe they will be satisfied, then leave us in peace.
They will never make it that far south.
Fengmo, here comes your future bride.
Welcome, Mr Kang.
Please, follow me.
I can't wait for your wedding banquet.
Daughter-in-law, what kind of a girl are you going to find for my son?
I haven't thought about that yet.
Tell me, why do you want another woman for your husband?
I think it is time for me to retire from my duties.
What do you mean?
I somehow felt... my husband deserves a younger wife.
She's crazy.
My mother tried to kill herself when my second mother came.
And my second mother took poison when my third mother came.
She arranged it all for him.
- I can't believe it.
- Congratulations!
Thank you.
You have such a wonderful wife to arrange a concubine for you.
That's really something.
Let's toast your first concubine.
What?
- What are you talking about?
- Stop pretending to be shy.
We just heard your wife say... you deserve a younger girl.
- But...
- Second wife.
You must invite me to the wedding banquet.
Come on! Gan bei.
- Let me get some more wine.
- Just call a servant.
No. It's my pleasure.
They said you are giving me a concubine.
Why didn't you tell me?
Don't you like the idea?
Is there anything else, madam?
No. You can leave now.
Good night.
Ying?
You can call me in the night if you need anything else.
Will you be jealous of her?
I'm 40 years old today.
I'm no longer young.
I like your hair's fragrance.
You had too much to drink today.
Who is she?
And how old is she?
Is she pretty? Look.
I want someone just like you.
It will be all right.
Trust me.
She will serve you better than I.
Will you still take care of me... when the new one comes?
Since that day I marry you... twenty-four years ago... it has been my duty to serve you and make you happy.
I thought...
I would hold you like this until I died.
Father of my sons?
Father of my sons?
Let's talk about it tomorrow.
I think it might be better to put you into younger hands.
Tomorrow. Do it.
I want to go to sleep.
Can we talk just a minute?
No.
Do it now.
Please.
Do it!
Aren't you coming to bed?
No.
I have a bed ready.
Hurry up. Hurry up!
Hey, you, stop!
- Time to eat.
- My God!
- It's very funny.
- What time is it tonight?
My father is going to kill me if he finds out I'm doing it again.
Then don't get caught.
Wait.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
- The matchmaker brought me here.
- Matchmaker?
Oh, no! One is broken.
Thank heaven you're here!
I was terrified!
Stupid, stupid girl.
I told you to follow me.
Why don't you listen?
This girl is so perfect for your family.
Her mother left her, and her foster mother raised her... in order to get a dowry.
If not for the war, she wouldn't give her up so quickly.
If you could be so kind... to add another, say,
50 pieces...
Fine. I need to speak with her alone.
Of course, madam.
I'll leave her to you.
Go. Go!
What is that in your hands?
I told them to bring nothing.
I brought you some fresh eggs,
15 of them.
Not one is older than seven days.
Come closer.
I would like to see them.
But one got broken on the way.
Her feet are so big, like a monkey's.
She's a country girl.
Must have gone barefoot since birth. I think...
I hope you like them.
I had nothing else.
Do you think you would like to stay here?
The matchmaker told my foster mother... that I will not starve here.
She told me to please you above all else.
That necklace is very beautiful.
It's the only thing I have from my real mother.
What is your name?
I have no real name.
My foster mother called me
Little Orphan when I was small... and Big Orphan when I got big.
I can give you a name if you wish.
Chiuming.
It means "bright autumn."
You will bring the brightness to my lord's autumn.
Yes. I like it.
Don't you?
Mother, do you think a young girl would suit a family like ours?
It's very generous of your wife to arrange it for you.
More grandchildren will make the Wu family even greater.
There is a law forbidding concubines now.
- These matters are not for children.
- Grandmother.
I'm not a child.
I'm 18 years old.
The Kang family has requested that...
Fengmo will receive some foreign education... before he marries the daughter.
Ask the priest from the orphanage that you met at the Kangs'.
He can teach Fengmo.
- I do not want to be married!
- Fengmo.
The priest can come in, but not his god.
Madam Wu has requested that I come for an interview.
He's here. The foreigner.
The same man you met at Madam Kang's.
And he said you sent for him.
Send him in.
Don't stand there with your mouth open like a fish.
It's a pleasure to see you again, lady.
Please forgive my rudeness.
Please sit down.
I should thank you for saving my best friend's life.
We did it together, didn't we?
How would you prefer
I address you?
I forgot to ask your name last time.
May I borrow your brush?
You can call me Andre.
You can write in Chinese?
Yes.
- How long have you been here?
- Three years.
Have some tea.
What country are you from?
I was born in America, but China is my home now.
What made you come to China?
My church asked for volunteers, and... well, here I am.
I have heard you have an orphanage.
Why would a foreign man like you... like orphanage work?
It's a job for women.
Why should such a pleasurable and important job be done by women only?
Do you miss your family?
I don't have a family.
Your parents didn't arrange a wife for you?
No. I'm not married.
Is it because of your religion?
Yes. I'm a priest.
Sister Shirley tells me you're looking for a tutor for your youngest son.
Yes. How much are your fees?
I don't require any fees.
Thank you for your kindness, but... it would put the Wu family in a lower position... if you didn't accept the fees, wouldn't it?
No, not at all.
We all have the same position in the eyes of God.
Then we should give the money to your god.
I'd rather not take money, but...
I will accept some clothing and food... for the children of the orphanage.
That can be arranged.
Thank you, madam.
Classes will begin the week after the wedding.
I hope you understand, our Old Lady... does not want you to talk about your religion in your class.
Grandma!
- Is he your grandson?
- Yes.
I have three sons and two grandchildren.
I'm sorry. Ying?
- Where's Ying?
- It's all right.
I like kids.
Come, come.
Come here.
I don't bite.
What is this?
A lion? A dog?
Get out of the way!
Young Lord, this is your teacher.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Congratulations on your wedding.
It's my father's wedding.
I'm sorry.
Madam Wu invited me to this wedding.
- I would never think...
- Congratulations, Mr Wu.
You see, in America, men have only one wife.
You're not in America now.
Forgive me.
What do you think about getting a second mother?
I think it's disgusting.
My father has young wives.
But I'm the daughter of the first wife.
Great.
Foolish thing!
What is there to fear?
Just lie back... and it be over soon!
Consider how lucky you are.
Do you have a home to run to?
Or a mother to give you rice?
Just obey your duty... and you can grow fat and comfortable... like me!
Your hands... are like a washboard!
Please forgive me, lord.
You are hurting me!
What's wrong with you?
Stupid girl.
Take off your clothes.
Come... over... here.
Lord, I beg you, please don't!
Open your mouth.
Lord, please, I beg you!
- Good morning, lady.
- From now on... you must call me Elder Sister, not lady.
Yes, lad...
Elder Sister.
You are a member of the Wu family now.
Sweeping the floor is the servants' job... not yours, child.
Yes, Elder Sister.
I hope you understand...
I put the entire happiness of our lord in your hands.
Fengmo, what do you want?
I've just come to see you, Mother.
How are you feeling?
I'm quite well. Why don't you say good morning to your second mother?
Good morning, Second Mother.
You should know the family rules.
Send a servant to let me know before you come.
She's so young, and Father is so old.
Send her home.
This is not something for you to decide.
Mother, this is wrong.
Andre says that even in Western countries... everyone is supposed to have a monogamous relationship.
Well, how does a foreigner know about Chinese?
Fengmo, police! Move!
Let's go!
Stop!
It was my father-in-law's library.
My husband had it closed after he died.
I've read most of the books here.
Dream of the Red Chamber.
You don't know how many times I've read this.
Do you think a woman is capable of learning as much as a man... or is her mind inferior?
Inferior?
No, but they certainly are different.
Do you think a woman is happier... if she reads less?
I don't know.
But I do know that a book doesn't know whether a man or woman is reading it.
If this is satisfactory,
I'll have them clean it for you.
It's perfect.
Madam?
Young Lord is in jail.
Why?
They said he is involved with Communist activity.
Nonsense! I have to go get him.
Madam, you are a woman.
You can't.
But how can I tell the lord?
We're expected at
Madam Chiang Kai-shek's reception... for the American ambassador to Nanking.
Here's the invitation.
He is suspected of being a Communist.
Without an order from the Shanghai police bureau...
I can't release him.
Are you suggesting that I tell
Madam Chiang... that you would prefer to keep her guest in jail?
May I have your name, please?
Is that really a letter from Madam Chiang?
Yes, it is, thanking me for opening up the orphanage.
How did you know he couldn't read English?
I took a chance.
The lamp is the sun.
The Earth.
The moon.
So, the Earth moves...
Around the sun.
And the moon moves around the sun. Yes or no?
Yes and no.
Excellent.
My grandmother is the sun.
My father is the Earth.
My mother is the moon.
And I cannot escape their gravity.
Interesting.
My parents don't care if the Japanese are right next door.
And our government is more interested in making money from the war... than in fighting them.
So what are you saying?
This concubine thing makes me sick.
She's just a girl my age.
This place stinks like a mouldy tomb.
They want me to be like them.
I must get out of here.
Then why don't you go?
Saying and doing... two different things.
Let's get back to astronomy.
It's important to keep studying, no matter what happens.
Fengmo, you're a very lucky young man.
A total lunar eclipse... occurs once every 18 years in the same place... and we can see one tonight.
When the Earth blocks the sun's light from reaching the moon... the moon seems to disappear in the Earth's shadow.
Here.
My mother likes to look at the stars too.
It's beautiful.
Mother.
Andre's brought a telescope.
We've been looking at the moon.
Both hands.
- I can't see anything.
- No, try again.
Is that better?
Mother, why don't you come to class?
Chiuming can come with you if you think it doesn't look right.
She can study too.
That way you won't be the only woman.
I'd be honoured if you joined us, lady.
I do not know how to keep from getting pregnant... when I sleep with the father of my sons.
Another baby will surely kill me... but how do I compete with my husband's younger wives?
Fengmo's tutor told him
American men... can only have one wife.
It is so pitiful you had to find a concubine for your husband.
The girl... where did you find her?
You like her?
Does he like her?
I like her.
She's an ordinary girl... but a good one.
You sound like you hired a maid.
Meichen, I feel like a frog... living in a well... only seeing the small portion of the sky.
I have wanted to visit you many times, Ailian... to discuss our children's wedding.
But since that foreigner is there, it would be too shameful for me to meet...
He saved your life, Meichen.
Besides, he's just a priest.
Fengmo even suggested that Second Lady and I... should join the class with him.
You seem so changed, Ailian.
You got one!
- I caught a duck!
- There he is!
Madam, I believe this is yours.
Thank you.
Please, go away.
Go away.
Good-bye, ladies.
It's all right.
He's gone.
He scared me to death.
Did you see his hairy chest?
No wonder they say that foreigners are half animal.
My little precious!
My poor little baby.
Are you all right?
Lady! Lady! I must speak to you about the foreigner.
He must have starved to death in his past life.
It's because of your generosity he takes all the leftovers... you usually give to the servants.
Mother, the day after tomorrow is Andre's birthday.
- We must have a banquet for him.
- A banquet?
Young Lord, he's not family.
I don't think Old Lady and your father will agree.
I have an idea.
Foreigners like a huge cake... with a candle in the middle for their birthday.
All right.
We can make one for him.
But how big?
Big enough.
I saw these yesterday.
I thought you might like them.
Come see. Take it. Take it.
I like the way you massage me.
Take a seat.
I've been worried about Fengmo.
Perhaps you should attend a few classes... and make sure everything's all right with him.
You must be joking.
I would fall asleep.
Why don't you go?
Perhaps... if Chiuming came with me.
I will tell my mother.
I can't relax with her!
She doesn't know how to comfort me. You could.
No, you must not think of me that way.
It is unfair to Chiuming.
Unfair?
You are so naive.
She's just a puppet.
How could you buy a puppet with a heart?
She cannot compare with you.
I only do this because you made me.
Do it, now.
Now.
Ying!
Madam, I'm here.
I'm too old.
I can't take care of you forever.
Any questions?
I have a question.
I hope you don't mind.
Not at all.
Have you ever seen your god?
I thought we were prohibited from discussing religion.
This is not religion.
Why don't you tell us?
No, I have never seen Him.
How can you believe in what you can't see?
Faith.
He's in everything.
In bread. In water.
In sleeping. In waking.
In feeding the lost children.
Teaching Fengmo and Chiuming, and talking to you now.
Faith.
Is it selfish if any individual puts his happiness...
before the happiness of his family?
But if a person is unhappy, how can he serve his family?
A question.
Are all Chinese marriages arranged?
Marriage has to be arranged.
- Why?
- Marriage is a family matter.
And family is the most important obligation here.
Our sorrows and joys belong to the family.
What happens when we die?
That's always a very good question.
When we die...
our soul will be free.
Then I can't wait for my soul to be free.
I always wonder...
why Western people like to go to church...
to confess how guilty they are.
Well, I always wonder why Chinese people like to pray for more money...
sons and beautiful wives.
Are people in your country...
allowed to do things that are forbidden by society?
In theory, everyone's equal...
and has the right to pursue whatever makes them happy.
I don't think
I have that kind of right.
I've got something to show you.
I brought a photo of my sister and my mother... so you can see how Western women dress.
That's my mother and sister.
They're so beautiful.
You must miss them very much.
Is that you?
You were so cute.
- Big and hairy now.
- Like a bear.
Who is laughing so loudly?
Your son and your wives, lord.
They are having classes.
Here's the birthday steam cake.
Be careful. It's hot.
Long life, teacher.
How did you know it was my birthday?
- We made a cake for you.
- Eat it while it's hot.
I put a lot of sugar, sweet beans and dried fruits in there.
I had to steam it for two hours.
The candle kept falling down.
It's all right now.
But be careful.
Hey!
Why did you blow out the candle?
I worked so hard.
I made a wish.
Doesn't it smell delicious?
You first.
You don't like it?
No. I like it very much.
We just want you to feel you're at home.
Fire!
The orphanage is on fire!
God!
Stay there.
It's too late!
Give me some water.
Give me some water!
- Are you all right?
- Elder Sister!
Breathe. Are you all right?
Where are they taking them?
Our lady has ordered to move the children... to the Wu compound.
Let it go.
You gained two kilos.
But it's all in your ears.
It's mine! It's mine!
You can't get me.
Children.
What have you done?
He's dead.
- You killed him.
- He's dead.
You killed him!
Here's something sweet.
I hope the children enjoy their watermelon.
Madam, thank you.
We appreciate it very much.
Never mind.
Thank you.
You're alive.
That's all that matters.
You know, I think
Second Wife is distracted.
Her heart is somewhere else.
Once she has a baby, she will be part of the Wu family... and her heart will be settled.
Madam, would you send me away if I said something... that might make you angry?
Have I ever sent you away yet?
Go on.
I think you should not have risked your life saving that foreigner.
- People are talking.
- About what?
Unmentionable things.
If I hadn't gone into that burning orphanage...
Andre...
I mean, that foreigner and his children would be dead.
I think we should not let Old Lady find out about what happened.
Very strange.
Those foreigners... they like to hold your hands to show their appreciation.
Makes me embarrassed.
Madam, if I were you...
I would not let that foreigner touch one hair on my body.
You even let him stay on our compound.
And the servants, they do not like serving people from the orphanage.
You should see lord's face.
He's not happy with this either.
What else?
I think you should arrange for Fengmo's marriage... and make the orphans go away from this house as soon as possible.
I thought I had lost it.
I knew it was yours.
The clasp was broken, so...
I fixed it.
Thank you.
Why don't you put it on so you don't lose it again?
Let me help you.
It's the only thing you have from your mother... isn't it?
Electricity. It sounds good.
But it's a waste of money.
Hey, bring me some tea.
Wu, how 'bout your new wife?
Don't be so shy.
You're part of the club now.
We all have several wives.
Isn't that so?
I'm so used to the first wife.
Second Wife, she doesn't know how to take care of me.
I have an idea.
Come with us to the flower boat.
There you can really relax, huh?
- No, my mother would never allow me.
- Your mother?
Come on!
In the dark there's no difference... between a concubine and a flower girl.
That's right.
No, no, no, I can't.
I can't.
Leave him alone.
Go home to your wives.
We'll go there without you.
Let's go.
Is my son gonna be absent from the table tonight again?
Chiuming, where has your husband been the last few nights?
Ancient, he's been going out with Mr Kang.
Daughter-in-law...
I hope you haven't been so busy attending classes... and taking care of the orphans... that you have neglected your duty to the others.
Yes.
Let's eat.
There's my father. Look.
Fengmo, there's your father too.
- Hey, don't let him get away.
- I can't.
- So shameful.
- Grab him. Bring him back here.
Awful. I really wish I wasn't from this family.
Madam! Madam!
Old Lady says she's not going.
She's afraid of this electricity.
Lord says he cannot go either.
Should I still put the basket in the boat?
No, we cannot go without them.
Mother, everyone is going.
The Wu family will lose face if your mother appears without your father... at the celebration.
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- No.
We are going.
Just wait till Old Lady finds out about this.
Electricity!
And so... we bring our humble town... into the modern age.
Electricity.
Electricity.
Why?
Can you tell me why?
Could you translate?
I don't understand the dialect.
All right.
This is a story about a girl... who had to disguise herself as a boy... in order to go to school.
In the three years, we shared the same window.
- My feelings for you...
- I can understand.
My feelings for you grew as deep as the sea.
In pairs birds fly.
Lovers' shadows... forever entwined.
Your smile makes my heart break.
But you know my father has already arranged my marriage.
A thousand words in my heart.
Still, to express my feelings...
I know not where to start.
What?
Nothing.
I miss you.
I cannot sleep at night.
I miss you.
- They flew away together.
- I eat but do not taste.
I miss you.
I pick up the brush but cannot write.
I miss you.
Without you my life is a waste.
I miss you.
They were separated... and died from love sickness... and were buried together.
A pair of butterflies... emerged from their grave... and flew away together.
If I cannot be with you in this life...
Then I will be with you in the next.
You know the story?
All love stories end the same, don't they?
This is a Western butterfly story.
It's one of my favourite operas.
Just listen.
Why do all love stories end in tragedy?
Someday you will understand.
No, Mother, I want to know.
Is love a sin?
Love is never sinful.
It's the most beautiful feeling we can have.
I'm sorry. I think we're forbidden to talk about this topic.
- What if love is forbidden?
- Fengmo, stop it.
Teacher, Mr Wu would like to speak to you.
Let's stop now.
I hope you understand.
It is not appropriate to talk about relationships... between a man and a woman in my house.
What's wrong?
Father, some boys threw stones and mud at us.
They said we are bananas... yellow on the outside, white on the inside.
They say you like that rich Wu lady.
It's all right.
Let's wash up.
It's all right.
I have been concerned about the rumours.
It's not only your face.
It affects all of our reputations.
"Create in me a clean heart,
O God."
Now that you have enough foreign education... you will marry the Kangs' daughter on the moon festival.
- I do not love her.
- Love?
Nonsense.
Your marriage was decided before the two of you were born.
If you force me, I will join the Communist army.
Then you are not my son.
You must be careful of the foreigner.
You do not know who he is and what he really is up to.
I don't understand why you trust him so much.
Old Lady wants to move that foreign devil out of the Wu compound.
Lady, I'm so concerned about you.
It seems you don't watch out any more.
Are you listening to...
Good evening, Elder Sister.
What are you doing here at this hour?
- Where is Fengmo?
- I haven't seen him.
- I just saw you right here with him.
- It's not true!
You think I'm blind?
I hope you understand.
Your job is to serve your husband.
He doesn't like me.
He kicks me out of the bed.
I don't know what to do.
- He goes to the flower boat.
- You lie again.
It's true. I swear it!
It's true.
It's also true you're Fengmo's second mother. Who do you think you are?
I shouldn't have brought you here.
Daughter-in-law... is the priest still living in the servants' quarters?
The orphanage is being repaired, Mother.
We give you money to run the family, not on someone else.
Teacher?
I have a question.
Can't it wait until class?
If we die, our soul will be free, right?
Yes, that's true.
I heard you saved the foreigner from the fire and went to the opera with him.
Does the priest teach class about men and women?
Move him out of my house.
Help!Somebody help!
Second Lady has killed herself!
Stay here!
What is he doing?
She's conscious.
Let me die!
Stupid girl. She can't even play dead correctly.
She's going to be all right.
I have to speak with you.
Thank you for saving her.
I can't imagine what would have happened today without you.
- I have one request.
- Anything.
Let her go.
I can't.
- It's beyond my power.
- You brought her here.
You can set her free.
I'm sorry. I can't.
How can I face my family?
What would people say?
What would people think if they knew
Fengmo was in love with her?
How did you know that?
She told me.
She'd rather die than live here any longer.
Shameless.
Ruin the name of the Wu family.
- She seduced my son.
- Seduced?
You brought her here!
If I didn't, she could have died of hunger.
Why are you so cold?
You sacrificed that young girl... on the bed of a man old enough to be her father!
Did you really think you could free yourself by imprisoning another?
Who do you think you are?
A saviour?
You come to China to save our Chinese children... to save us?
Why don't you go to your country to save yourself and your country first?
I thought I knew you.
Good-bye, lady.
A long time ago... there was a little frog who lived at the bottom of an old well.
He thought... the sky was just this little patch of blue... above his head.
- He had no idea...
- Madam Wu!
Where's my son?
Where's my grandson?
Where's my daughter-in-law?
Heaven! Are you trying to break my old bones?
Ying!
Where the hell are they?
- I will go look for them.
- Go, go!
Why don't you come home with me?
Two wives not enough for you, Mr Wu.
Come home with me.
She is free now.
You can be free too.
But... she is young.
- Times have changed.
- And you're so old.
The other day... when you gave me that birthday dumpling or whatever it was... that's the first time I celebrated my birthday since I was a child.
I feel like I belong here now.
Come.
Here. Can you walk?
Let me help you.
Put me down.
- Let me take a look.
- I'm fine.
Let me see.
I'm a doctor, remember?
- It's all right.
- Let me see.
Maybe you sprained it.
Does that hurt?
- Yes?
- It's all right.
It's all right.
Why are you crying?
Where have you been?
On your knees!
Beg for forgiveness from your ancestors.
Ancestors, I beg for your forgiveness.
Apologize for driving your second wife away!
Forgive me for driving my second wife away.
Beg for forgiveness for breaking the family rules!
I beg for forgiveness for breaking family rules.
Beg for forgiveness for losing face.
I beg for forgiveness for losing face.
Beg for forgiveness...
Great Grandma!
It is a blessing that she did not live to see this war.
I've heard the Japanese have killed hundreds of people in the north.
May I pray for her?
Pray then.
My mother can have one more heaven to go to.
Forgive me, Father.
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
You are not really leaving, are you?
I am.
Where are you going?
As far away as possible.
Fengmo, I'm sorry.
It's hard for me to explain to you.
You're my son.
But I think only you can understand.
Mother... how could you?
How can I understand you... when you bought a girl to warm my father's bed?
How can I understand you... when you drove Chiuming to try to kill herself?
How can I understand you... when my father visits the flower boat every night?
How can I understand you when you betray us with my teacher?
Because... it has taken me 40 years... to feel the way you feel about Chiuming.
I have come to say good-bye.
I am joining the Communist army.
So you've decided.
You can find Chiuming in the missionary school near Wuxi church.
How's your mother?
Changed.
Go see her.
Thank you for all you have done.
Take care of my mother.
God bless you.
I've heard... you sent a message to tell the foreigner... to come for my care.
Yes.
I told the servants not to give him your message.
Why?
I'm not dead yet!
Children! Children, in the house!
Put your things down!
Inside! Inside!
In the house, hurry!
Quickly, in the house!
Get in, hurry!
Under the bed!
Now! There's no more time.
Now! Go down!
Get on the boat!
Get on the boat!
I'm not leaving.
You want to die?
- I'm not leaving with you.
- Get on the boat!
You don't understand.
I'm sorry.
Come with me, woman.
Now!
Not this time.
I've served you for 24 years.
Not any more.
- Listen! You belong to me.
- No. I belong to nobody.
You're nobody without the Wu family!
Don't leave me alone!
I'm scared!
If you no longer care for me, think of your sons!
My lord is looking for her!
They had a fight and she disappeared.
Take the children.
I'll meet you at Wuxi church.
It's too dangerous.
The Japanese have taken the town.
She must be trapped there!
Daughter?
Where are you, daughter?
Last night a foreign priest asked me... if I was still alive to give this to you.
- He was here?
- He saved our lives.
Tell me. Where is he?
Tell me the names that
Father Andre had given you, children.
Honesty.
Kindness.
Faith.
Truth.
- Humanity.
- Mercy.
- Light.
- Grace.
- Sunbeam.
- Star.
Dawn.
Charity.
Rose.
Mother, I don't have a name.
Your name will be Love.
Attention!

Have you all been good?
Have some candy.
Good boys!
Watch this.
Which hand?
Smart kid. Try again.
Which hand?
No.
This one!
Clean water, no dirty water.
One, two, three.
Or I'll knock your block off.
Understand?
Yes. You'll have clean water tonight.
1945, NORTH CHINA
THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION
- Let me look at you.
- What for?
Please, let me look!
At what? No!
Come on!
Be quick
Don't stop!
- Who's there?
- Me
- Who?
- Me
- Hurry!
- What'll you do?
The usual
- Who is it?
- Me
Close your eyes
Name
Dasan Ma
What's this village called?
Rack-Armor Terrace
What are you doing up so late?
Thinking
Well, think away
Listen to me
I'm leaving two things with you
I want them both back. Both
Don't let the Jap devils find out
Any slipup and you're a dead man
But they've got a blockhouse here
It could be hard
It'll be all right
âThe darkest place is under the candlestick.â
- Understand?
- Yes
If there's trouble, who's responsible?
You
Who was it?
Don't know
It's alive!
I'll tell that guy!
Dasan Ma!
Listen. In your spare time, interrogate them
We'll collect them on
New Year's Eve together with their statements
Understand?
Yes
Who'll collect them?
Me!
It was like this
Just like this!
Then he jumped the wall and ran off
So what was his name?
Didn't say. called himself âme.â
So, what'd he look like?
Don't know. My eyes were closed
How about his clothes?
Was he tall?
With your eyes closed, can you see me?
How many were there?
I didn't dare open my eyes!
So what exactly did he say?
He said he'd leave âem here till New Year's Eve when he'd come for âem
He sounded really fierce
He said, âThe darkest place is under the candlestick.â
I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!
You can talk family business later
Dasan's been with your son's widow for some time
We have to talk
With these good-for-nothings?
Go to bed!
Dad, have some water
Don't call me dad.
Shameless slut
A father-in-law can't talk this way
Go for me, then!
I'm fed up with you!
- I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!
- cut it out!
Good fortune is having no troubles, but misfortune can't be avoided
Well, is it fortune or misfortune?
What should we do?
Take âem to the blockhouse.
I'm in with their chief
- What?
- Hand âem over
That's no good. What'll I say? when that guy comes back for âem?
Tell him to see the Japs.
What would he dare do?
You kidding?
This guy ties up Japs in sacks!
What wouldn't he dare do?
- What are you? A collaborator?
- Seems like it!
I'll throttle one with each hand and then we'll bury âem!
That's it!
We'll just dig a hole.
I'll do that
You would? But that guy said if anything happens to âem or if the Japs find out we'd be killed!
- Killed?
- Who'd be killed?
He said he'd kill everyone in the village
Nothing
- What?
- What?
Forget it
Speak
I thought we could run away and leave the sacks here.
What could he do to us?
Sit down!
You made me say it
If we all have to die anyway, why don't I just kill you?
Stop it! If you don't, I'm going come back
Sit down
It's unheard of.
He's threatening us all?
I'll throttle âem, and we'll bury âem
Bury âem
No good will come from this
Such deeds are not the work of idle men
Provoke neither those who dwell in the hills nor those who come from the sea
New Year's Eve is five days away.
On that day they'll come
Steal away with them and disaster will be averted
San
For the sake of the village, act with care these next few days
- Er Bozi.
- Yes, Old Uncle?
Don't tell your mother about this
She's got a big mouth
I'll keep it to myself, all right?
All right. We can go home
Wait!
There's something else
That guy said we should interrogate them
Interrogate them?
About what?
Sensei!
Have some candy
Boy good!
Have another
Er Bozi, come here! coming. Sensei
Late no good
If you're late once more one, two, three
I'll knock your block off!
Understand?
Now, go away!

Come on, we don't want to be killed
We don't understand.
Turn it into Chinese
H is name's Kosaburo Hanaya.
He's 2 5
Has he killed Chinese men?
Violated Chinese women?
Have you killed Chinese men?
Raped Chinese women?
Of course.
That's what I came to China for!
He's new to china.
Hasn't seen any women yet
He's killed no one. He's a cook
What's all this talk?
They kill me now or I'll kill them.
Why are you doing this?
I want to anger these cowards.
I won't cooperate with swine!
Will you two stop chattering?
Speak slower
Wait for the questions
He begs you not to kill him
What else? could you ask him who was that me,, person?
Who was me,,?
Listen
I want you to tell me who is "me"?
You?

How would I know who you are?
Not me.

An ammunition depot!
We'll be victorious!
Long live the emperor!

Good. I'm old enough to be your grandfather
To me, you're still kids
This business, we were asked to do it
Give us your fingerprint.
We'll transfer you
Old Uncle. He's wounded
It's bleeding
Escape
We've got to escape
We've got to
No matter what it involves
Fool. There's no escape.
Better to die now
These peasants won't allow it
It's the guys who captured us who'll decide our fate
Idiot. I want to die
You don't get it, do you?
Pig-brain
Bastard. What'd you say?
I said, âYou're a clever man. â

Help!
Shut him up!
Stop shouting!
Bastards!

- Hurry! Help!
What's wrong? Shout
I'll help
Save us!
Save us! Help!
A gunboat is passing by
You think they can hear you?
I tried out front, and they couldn't hear
How noisy is that
It passes here every day.
Shout your head off if you like
It seems it passes here everyday
What were you thinking?
We'll try again next time
Forget it
Between the noise of the boat and the band, they'll never hear us.
All right, enough talk. Eat
Nothing beats a good meal
But we'd better change your bandage first
I'll change your bandage
- I'll change your --
- Move over
It's for your own good, you idiot
Dong, tell this woman she may touch me now, but I'll touch her later
- More than once or twice.
- What did he say?
-And more than just touch.
-Just ignore him
Hanaya, she's helping you
Don't you have a conscience?
It's the Chinese who've got no conscience
- First they shoot, then they help.
- Stop talking
Mongrels can't even shoot straight
If they could, you'd be dead
I'll kill myself now
San!
What the hell is going on?
What now? You faking it?
You want to kill yourself?
Use a sharp stone, not wood
You stupid fucker
- Sister-in-law, ignore him.
- I'm not your sister-in-law
Shut up and eat
Thank you, brother.
Brother, do me a favor
Let me go.
We're both Chinese, after all
Will you shut up?
- Hurry.
- I am
I was captured once before. captain Eight let me go
Don't give me that.
I have nothing to do with this
We'll be pals if you do me a favor
Of course. Name it come as you are, leave as you are
Don't make trouble.
And don't die on me
All right?
I'm treating you well enough.
Why are you so thoughtless?
He's coming to
I'll tell you one thing.
If you keep this up
I could get nasty
- Who's there?
- It's me
Wake up. It's dawn
Was it cold last night?
It wasn't warm
- What's happening in there?
- Quiet so far
If they don't settle down, they'll be the death of me
Have a look
Brother. I'm so hot. can't you take this off me?
I won't kill myself, I promise
Better hot than dead.
Show some thanks, will you?
I'd be damn pleased if someone fed me and wiped my ass every day
But why suffer like this, brother?
I heard you coughing all night
You were freezing
Let's make this simple. Release us
I'm not putting your life in danger.
So don't put mine in danger
All right? If I let you go,
I'm a dead man
Why aren't you eating?
You've got to eat something
Why isn't he eating? Move over
You
Lighten up
You can't live without eating.
You're human come on, have some.
Eat
That's good
What the hell?
Bastard!
Humiliating an Imperial Army soldier!
I'll kill you! Chinese pig!
- What's he want?
- White flour
White flour?
Where am I gonna get that?
I wouldn't mind some myself.
Just eat
Don't try to act like a captain-san here
If he doesn't eat, he'll starve
Starve?
Don't eat, then. But this is it
Let's go
I sent them to get flour--
Bastard! I'm not eating,
And neither are you!
They'll never find flour
Without it, you can go on a hunger strike
They're scared we'll die
They'll let us go
We'll be saved
Fool
What? Flour?
Do I look like I'm made of flour?
- Eat me, why don't you?
- Now that's silly
Isn't it a capital crime to hoard that stuff?
Trying to send me to the gallows?
Auntie. This is a matter of decency
Decency?
You've a mistress in your bed and  Japs in your cellar
You've got some nerve talking about decency
Son of a bitch
- You swearing at me?
- No, not you. Er Bozi
I'm his mother. curses at him travel straight to me
You don't understand.
He swears at me too
He hasn't kept his word.
He said he wouldn't tell you
If he lied to me he wouldn't be my son.
He'd be yours
Whatever you say
But I really need your help
Auntie.
You're fond of me, aren't you?
I've done so much for these two men -- for the sake of the village
I've slept with my clothes on.
I've spent nights in the cellar
I've used all my bedding to pad the walls and floors.
I've wrapped those men in my blankets
That's your fault
I had no choice.
The Jap's threatening suicide
He won't eat unless his food's made of white flour.
Otherwise, he'll starve himself
It's a mess
If you care about me you won't let me leave empty-handed, will you?
That's exactly how you'll leave today
A man's going to starve
Let him starve.
Japs are monsters anyway
That's no good. If they starve, our village is done for
I'd rather die than be a collaborator
What are you talking about?
This guy risks his neck to bring âem, asks us to look after âem
And we let âem starve?
What's a collaborator?
That's a collaborator
Keep talking, there's no flour
Thenâ¦ what's in here?
- Nothing.
- There's flour inside the chest in a cloth bag
- Who told you that?
- Who?
The one who keeps secrets.
He tells me stuff too
That dam n son of mine.
I don't care anyway. There is none
Auntie
How's this?
I'll repay you double what I take
- Triple it. There's none.
- Four times
Five times and there's still none
How about six?
Seven and I'll give none
All right, eight then
Dong. Teach me some Chinese
- Why?
- I want to swear at them
To use the most terrible words
I'll infuriate them and they'll have to kill me
The Chinese hate people who curse their ancestors
Bastard!
Teach me now
Yes, sir cut it out
At a time like this, thinking of that
You've heard them call us brother and sister-in-law
Besides, when I saw Auntie,
I told her all about us
What'd you say?
I saidâ¦ it is what it is
Have you no shame?
She said no story, no flour
She wasn't nasty about it
Things are what they are.
Why not just admit it?
Don't push it
They've all been too busy to think about us
After tonight, when those two leave how can I walk in the streets with everyone talking behind my back?
What can I do?
If a big man like you doesn't know, why ask me?
Well
I'llâ¦ marry you
You have to anyway
- What are you saying?
- You have no choice
- Who's there?
- Me
It's him
It's me
Don't use that word.
It scares me
I've got their statement.
When that guy comes give him this.
I'm glad I didn't forget
Anyway, we've done it
Right
Once they've left we can celebrate New Year's all over again
They're here, Dong
The time's come
I hear their footsteps
I can see them taking up their weapons
I want to turn the curses you've taught me into bullets to fire at them
I want to enrage them
Insult them
Enrage them
Insult them
Dong
Good-bye forever!
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law!
You're my granddad,
I'm your son!
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
You're my granddad
I'm your son
The words are nice.
Why does he sound so angry?
Japs sound the same whether they're happy or angry
Why do you think we call them devils?
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law!
You're my granddad
I'm your son
Enough, enough
I get the message
But your generations are mixed up.
If I'm your granddad you're my grandson.
Not my son. See?
How come they're not angry?
The Japanese are always cursing them
They're used to it
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law!
Okay, okay. Shush.
Twice is enough
We've made you dumplings
Just what you asked for
- Did you teach him that?
- Yes. It's the spring festival
I taught him propitious phrases to thank you both
Nice of you
Now, eat up. It's your last chance
By tonight, you'll be on the road
- Let's bring the table over.
- Okay
Hold on. We'll set this up.
Eat heartily
Hoarders
I'll kill you for sure
- No chance of that.
- Why not?
âOn the roadâ means âto dieâ in Chinese
This is our last meal
We're goners
Why don't they act like they're gonna kill us?
Even when the Chinese kill someone, their expression doesn't change
How are they gonna kill us?
- You afraid of dying?
- Of course not
I just feel stupid dying this way
But I'm not afraid
I won't beg for mercy.
I won't
Shall we do it?
Move aside
Let âem finish their meal
Untie them
Please, one favor
Send my parents a message for me, in the northeast
Of course. Don't worry
You'll be on the road soon
And whatever happens, happens
Enjoy your dumplings
All right! I will!
And then I'll go on the road
I lived by my mouth.
Now I'll die by it
If only I hadn't learned Japanese
In my next life,
I'll come back a mute
Eat up
Or we'll be late
Tell him we've still got to trouble you to get back into those sacks
What?
They're putting us back into those sacks
What now?
The Japs are like this.
They cry, they sing
Well, maybe before he goes, we should give him a drink?
I want a drink
He'd like a drink
Just what we were thinking
Let's get some wine from old man Qi
San
Do you think they'll give us a reward?
Advance
- It's time for lunch.
- I'm not going
Not going to the block house
For lunch?
No. We're having
Chinese chicken today
You serious?
Knowhow to get a chicken from a Chinese?
âExcuse me, may I have a chicken?â
Idiot. You wouldn't get a fart that way
Watch me
Bastard! Handover that chicken!
Bastard! Handover that chicken!
You're pathetic. You'll get thrashed.
Watch me
You gotta stare 'em down.
Act like a devil and scare 'em
Get it?
Bastard! Give me that chicken!
Holy crap!
What the hell?
Halt!
Bastard
You scared the shit out of me
What you do?
I'm from the village
No leave village
- You go back.
- Go
Go over there
Come here
Head down
Here, have another.
Come here
Stand back
- No go out, understand?
- Yes
- No go out.
- I understand
Understand? Son of a bitch
- Understand?
- Yes
- Good.
- Yes
Let's go
See?
That's how you deal with them
I see
Hold on. Get it
Don't let it get away
Halt
You're back?
What's wrong? Speak
What's all this?
Say something
I'm going to eat you
Look, it's him
You. Damn it.
What are you doing here?
I ordered you to stay inside the circle. Bastard!
Japanese
Japanese
You must be dreaming
No step out. Understand?
- Yes.
- Maruyama. The chicken captain-san.
This what you're after?
- Bastard. Handover that chicken.
- Forget it, moron captain-san
Want me to kill it?
- Now you're talking.
- Let's sit over there
- No.
- Bastard!
I heard it. âBastard.â
It's for real
Japanese speaking Japanese
Soldiers of the Imperial Army
You stay here.
I'll get some kids to make noise
The Japs want more water
It's true.
There are Japanese up there
Thank heavens
- How'd they get here?
- I ran into them
- You idiot.
- Knock your block off captain-san
Go fan the fire
Our chicken is nearly ready
I'm going to scream
They still won't hear you
Hanaya.
I've got an idea
Don't worry about us
We've got our own lunch
We'll save you the bones
It's goddamn delicious
Why did he hit you?
- I said knock your block off.,,
- can't you say the opposite?
Well, you try
I can only say bakayaro.
It's worse
Say baka-no-yaro cut the crap. I'll watch them.
If they head for the cellar
I'll take âem on
Please save us
Please save us!
Attack!
Son of a bitch
Sensei
San, he's gone inside
Move. Move
What are you doing with that? captain-san.
It's for killing the donkey
- Donkey?
- Eat donkey
This moron is terrified at the very sight of us
He thinks we can eat a donkey
Idiot
âªThat pretty maidâª
âªIs a bird on highâª
âªI'm going to do my best --âª
Maruyama. Get your gun
What are you doing?
I'm getting you another chicken
This guy-- very good
Save it. We eat next time
- Understand?
- Yes
- We should be at our posts.
- Right. Playtime's over.
Two telephone lines to set up
Why's he always waving a knife around?
Go back. No move
- You scared?
- Course not. Not with you around.
Sensei
Look at this
Dam n it
What now?
That idiot is still inside the circle
You're something else.
You've got these mongrels worked out
My respects
I can teach you a few things.
I'm still learning too
- You? Still learning?
- You're never too old to learn
How was that chicken?
Delicious
- Fucking bastards.
- What are you doing?
Where's he going?
Japanese soldiers!
They're coming!
Fuck you, J ap. Fuck
Fucking bastards!
Move!
Turtle-fuckers!
What the fuck is this about?
So you pull this on me?
Trying to get me killed?
Get this straight
You try and get me killed and I'll kill you first
I left the village crossed the river climbed the mountain entered the town went to ask for Pockmarked Li
- Get to the point.
- This is the point
You always leave the village, cross the river
If I didn't leave the village, how could I cross the river?
- Give me some water.
- Go on
- Where was I?
- crossing the river --
Get to the point
- You saw Pockmarked Li.
- I didn't say that
- Yes, you did.
- I said I saw captain Five
What did captain Five say?
He said,
âDidn't I tell you what to do?â
I said,
âNo, I've never met you before.â
He said, âAre you from Lower Village?â
I said, âNo.
I'm from Rack-Armor Terrace.â
He said, âRack-Armor Terrace?
We've never left anyone there.
Do whatever you have to.â
I said, âLike what?â
He said, âIsn't there a blockhouse there?
What are you waiting for?
Do the deed.â
So this captain said âdo the deed.â
Yeah.
He gestured like this
âDo it.â
Tell us again.
What was that gesture?
Was it like this? Or like that?
- Show me again.
- Like this? Or like that?
- Like this.
- So he meant kill âem
- No.
- What do you mean?
Like this. Like this
Of course he meant kill âem
Looks like it
There's an old saying:
Better to obey than have respects to pay
Well, better obey then
Old Uncle, if he wanted us to kill âem, why didn't he say so?
Why say âdo the deedâ?
Men in high positions can't always say what they mean
It was so clear. First those guys yelled out to the brass band
Then, today, they tagged the chicken
What's next?
Our necks are on the line
Did he say how to do it?
No
Or who should do it?
No. He doesn't know us.
How could he?
He knows you
He thought I was from Lower Village.
I never saw him before
- This is a hard one.
- What's so hard?
There's peeling the skin.,
Japs are all bastards.
More water
You peel one, I'll throttle âem
Twist their necks and bury âem!
Shut up
Bury âem?
That's an idea
Soâ¦
- San.
- Old Uncle
It's not that I'm afraid.
How can I put this?
It's just not right
We were told to look after them
We can't just decide to kill them.
It's not good
Besides, that captain Five who Li u Wang found didn't drop âem on us
H is orders don't count
What if captain Four or captain Seven comes for âem? What then?
So why don't you go yourself?
Go find captain Four or Seven
Don't be stupid
It's up to you really.
You got them here. Shouldn't you do it?
What? I got them here?
You think I went to their homes and invited them round?
I had a gun to my head.
That's how I got them
He forced me to look after them.
If we don't, he'll kill us all
These last six months, I've eaten badly, hardly slept, and I'm in debt
While you all slept soundly
I haven't been under a quilt all winter
Why? Isn't it for our whole village?
Give me that water
Slurping all over the place
Dasan's got a point
- Of course I do.
- Wellâ¦
- Er Bozi?
- Don't look at me like that
I'm not a coward.
You must have a good reason to do that
I've got a big mouth.
Just like my mother
One slip of the tongue and we're all done for
We are still here because I've kept my mouth shut
I sensei this and that all day long to keep from talking
That's my contribution
Some contribution. Sensei.
You collaborator
- You do it then.
- Well, Li u Wang?
Me? I could do it. What am I afraid of?
But let's get this straight
You know the saying stick your neck out,,? That's me
I was nearly killed today
Why do I go on about the village, the river? Because it makes me sick
In my dreams it's leave, cross, leave, cross
And you scold me for slurping?
Give me that
I'll throttle âem and we'll dig a pit and bury âem
Shut up! Shut up!
If none of you will do it, I will
- That's not right.
- No?
We'll draw lots then.
Fate will decide
Whoever gets the red bean is it
Old Uncle, it's too big a job for one person
Well, add a second one
Forget it.
I've got both
Give me some water
Give him some water
Here you go, San
San
What can I say?
What's there to say?
Leave âem to me. I'll throttle âem --
Shut up!
I need two people.
Helpers
- I'll dig the pit.
- So will I
Good
You two dig the pit.
Dasan will do the deed
Let's not put it off.
Let's move tonight. Agreed?
Yes
San. The hole's ready
It's right here.
We'll wait down there
They've brought this over for you
To help you over the shock
Er Bozi's mother says don't worry about repaying the flour
She says try and put it out of your head
- Eat up. I'm off.
- Yu'er
What is it?
Yu'er
Don't touch me!
Whatever you do, don't touch me
If for nothing else for the child in my belly
- Are you all right?
- Don't touch me
- Who's there?
- Me
Stop saying me.,
Here's some food
- Where's your mom?
- She's not coming
No?
This is terrible!
Uncle San
I'll kill you, turtle-fucker!
I didn't kill anyone
That's it
Advance!
- You.
- What's with you?
Anybody see you?
No one
Quick. Shut the door
Ma, I'm back
So you are
Only one candy today.
What's with Uncle?
Nothing. Don't worry
- I'm going to Grandpa's.
- Off you go
Yu'er
Let'sâ¦ run away
We'll take Little Thresher and the old man
Well?
Starting tomorrow, don't take them any food
What?
If I don't, who will?
There are Japanese captives inside the Great Wall
There are Japanese captives inside the Great Wall
Too long.
The kid'll never remember it.
True
Nihonjin means uncle
Chojo is candy
Iruyo is give
Repeat after me
Nihonjin chojo iruyo
âJapanese inside the Great Wall. â
You say it
Japanese inside the Great Wall
He can do it!
Japanese inside the Great Wall
Japanese. Japanese
Japanese
Japs?
Sensei
Sensei
The great Japanese
The great Japanese have no candy for you today
- chop off my head!
- What are you doing?
Me too! Go ahead!
I can explain!
- Those guys are at Fenghuotai?
- Yes, inside the wall
You taking them food?
They still alive?
- Yes. Listen --
- Why?
Enough's been said
First they shout out to the brass band then they tag the chicken
Now they're using Little Thresher.
Three times unlucky
We're going to lose our heads
No doubt about it
- I ask you. Should they be killed?
- Sure
So why didn't you do it?
It's either them or us
Where'd those guys come from?
Who brought them?
What are you saying?
I don't know who brought âem here
You don't?
It would take at least two men to drag those two sacks.
Even four
Four? Try five or six
And you saw nothing?
- Don't you have eyes?
- They were closed
Really? You opened the door?
You did it with your eyes closed?
No, I closed âem after
I say you saw everything
I didn't. It was dark.
I couldn't see a thing cut it out.
Tell us what you're getting out of this
Nothing
Nothing? I don't believe it.
If not, why protect them?
You said you'd pay me back eightfold.
Where's that coming from?
Yes, we all see through it now
You're just bullshitting about the threat to the village
Who is this killer? Let him come
I'll sit at home and wait.
Is he going to kill me? Would he dare?
Only your life's in danger
- can you pipe down?
- Pipe down?
What am I afraid of?
The Japs have been here for eight years
Eight years
And have they touched a hair on my head?
My behavior is right and proper
Wherever I go, they look up to me
Ma. Enough
Little Thresher, don't hide.
You speak Japanese?
You can go to the blockhouse but First show Uncle San what you've learned
Go on
The Japanese are inside the Great Wall
Don't hit him!
H it me if you dare! come on!
I'll be frank
The child in my belly was conceived the night those men came here
If Dasan kills âem, it will curse my baby
You want us to kill âem?
And then you ignore us?
Dasan looks like a ghost
Now that they're still alive, you come at us with this business
We can't do anything right.
You know all the answers
We didn't kill anybody.
We can't kill and we won't!
We can't
I'm afraid. I couldn't do it
Yu'er, how can you talk like that?
We all see what's going on between you and Dasan but have we said anything?
You defend him like he's your husband
If you can't kill anyone, why should we?
You're scared to bear a cursed child.
And us?
We'll all be cursed souls soon enough
Dasan. I want my flour back.
Eightfold. Pay me back now
Look at yourself.
Do you look like a man?
Whether Dasan's a man or not is for me to say
Don't tell me you'd know better than me
Wanna go to the blockhouse?
Go then!
I'll lead you there!
No big deal!
I'll tell you this, though
If they come down after us, no one will escape
We'll all pay with our lives.
Who are you threatening?
If we go, we die and if we stay, we die
If it's all the same, just behead me now
Please, get it over with.
Otherwise, I'm not moving
Say something, Old Uncle
Good fortune is having no troubles, but misfortune can't be avoided
I'm the youngest.
Kill me first
I'm in this too.
Let him kill us all. Here
Don't push me
If you push me,
I could do anything
Fine. It's not too late for action
- I'll help you dig the trench.
- Me too
- Let's do it.
- Me?
Do it?
I'll run away
Next
Come here
- It's all beans.
-All right
- Move.
- Hold on! Halt!
Show me
Show me
This way
Beard, different with photo
Cut short
Understand?
- Cut short.
- Short
- Understand, you?
- I understand
Move it
Next
Bearded guy, come here
Welcome the Japanese to the neighborhood
800 years ago, we were all one brood
We all write with characters and our soups use pickles
When they beat us, it really tickles
If they call me bakayaro,
I think it's good
The Imperial Army gives us âmixiâ food
We love the Imperial Army like family --
- Where you from?
- Rack-Armor Terrace
- Name?
- Dasan
- Who sent you?
- Old Uncle
Old Uncle?
No wonder you called me brother-in-law
What's up?
Well, where to start?
You want to hi re an assassin
Am I right?
Didn't Old Uncle tell you about my marksmanship?
He said you can hit a fly at 1 00 paces
That's right -- but with a gun.
A nine-chamber automatic
The further the target, the more accurate the shot
Naturally
There's a blockhouse at Rack-Armor Terrace, yeah?
Yeah
- The village is as small as an ass cheek?
- Yeah
How can you use a gun then?
This is a job for a sword
But Old Uncle is asking you.
You can't say no, can you?
- can't do it.
- You can't do it? can't do it
All right
- What are you doing?
- Going home
You can go, but you gotta leave the beans
What? You won't help, but you want the beans?
I can't help you out, but you gotta leave them
You want to kill a Jap but don't want anyone to know, right?
Right
- It's a secret, right?
- Yeah
So, I'll keep your secret.
It's like this
If I don't take something as payment how can you trust me to keep quiet?
I don't need your beans.
I just want you to feel okay about this
Silly man.
You've simply come to the wrong place
I make tofu. If you throw in sorghum, would it still be tofu?
The more sorghum you put in, the less it'll be like tofu
In the future, remember: if you want a swordsman don't go to the one with the gun.
Do you get my logic?
- No.
- No?
Let me show you what I mean
Attention!
Attention!
What'll we do?
Take a detour
Halt.
What are we afraid of?
Running means we've done wrong
Sensei
Get down
They must have lost this battle.
They usually kowtow before me
They're back.
Yayoi. Look
They've been gone so long
At last they're back
Yayoi, what's wrong?
Matsuno?
Matsuno!
Idiots! Go back Inside!
What's all this fuss?
Shameless hussy
Look at him
You need wits and bravery
Silly man
It's not just a family matter
Besides,
I've got a Chinese heart too
So you do
Let's go
Brother-in-law.
Where are you taking me?
- To the military police.
- What?
To the bathhouse
You know the em press Tz'u-hsi?
Yeah
How about the eight ministers?
Yeah. U h, no
Didn't think you would
Darlings of the court.
All beheaded
Know who wielded the sword?
No
- Old man Li u.
- Really?
The day of the beheadings, a sea of people surrounded North Gate
It was packed
- South Gate.
- Right, South Gate
Did they come to see the eight ministers?
No
They cheered at every head old man Li u cut
Watching him use his sword was like tasting the finest wine
They even celebrated it in poems
Old man Li u, does he worry that people will hate him?
No. They never hate him.
They're grateful
The descendants of those he's executed bring him gifts every day, every year, every generation
Old man Li u, which generation are we up to?
See? The fifth generation
Do you know why?
No
Because he's helped them up to heaven
H is blade is like a passing breeze
Before they know it, they're in the land of the immortals
Their last vision is of Li u with his sword
Gratitude wells up within them
You know how they show it?
No
Their head rolls exactly nine times looks back at him and blinks three times
The corners of their mouths turn up
You've heard of greeting death with a smile,,? That's it
Say no more
What can I give you to do this job?
Oh. If old man Li u likes you, he won't take a cent
If he doesn't, mountains of gold won't move him
Say no more. Old man Li u
I can't even offer you beans
But I'll kowtow on behalf of my whole village
âThe Great Wall still stands, yet the emperor ch'in Shih Huang is no more!â
Few Imperial Army soldiers get taken prisoner
Fewer still are the prisoners of peasants
I might be the only one
Oh, Fate
At least I've killed about
20 Chinese
Worthless though their lives were
Aren't 20 lives worth your one?
Sure
The Chinese are people too
It's a pity
A soldier should die in battle
To die at the hands of these peasants is so unheroic
Heroic?
I can help you
How the hell can you help me?
I could eat your flesh like sashimi
Shut your traps.
For fuck's sake
What do you think?
I'm speechless.
You're a master
How's the time?
The moon is bright, the stars are few.
Perfect
And how are they?
- They've eaten their last meals.
- Let's do it
A Jap?
I'm speechless
A Chinese?
- Words fail me.
- The Jap first collect the corpses
- You've worked hard.
- It was nothing
He's still alive! Grab him!
- They're not dead!
- Impossible
They're jumping around!
Headless chickens jump around too
Stop
But their heads are still on their shoulders
Let me go!
- Got him?
- Grab him
- What's going on?
- They're not dead
Try again!
I'm not called
âOne Strike Liuâ for nothing.
They're just not fated to die
My brilliant reputation has been destroyed in an instant
I never imagined that because of you
I'd lose my honor
Especially this late in life!
Heaven help me!
Old Uncle.
The slate is clean between us
All of you take care.
We'll meet again
But -- But --
Teach me to curse my emperor.
They'd love that
They don't know who he is
Teach me to say nice things.
I'll do anything not to be killed
Hanaya, you've said all the n ice things there are to say
What?
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
You're my granddad,
I'm your son.,
- I won't say that again.
- Remember?
I'll never curse them again
You never did curse them
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
You're my grand dad,
I'm your son.
That's what it meant
You tricked me!
Educated people are so evil
I hate you educated people!
- What sort of shitty samurai are you?
- I'm no samurai! I'm a peasant!
My family raises silk
Not samurai!
If a warrior dies with no witnesses, he's no warrior!
You're no fucking actor either, just a sergeant
I hate stupid Japanese people like you!
Low life peasant!
No fucking dignity at all!
You're the lowlife!
- Worse than the peasants!
- Bastard
The people here gave up their own rations to keep us alive these six months
That woman even dressed my wounds
She's got feelings for me
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
She'd do the same for me if I was wounded
- You're so pathetic!
- Bastard!
Stop it. Stop it
- Shut up!
- Shut up
It's not going to save your fucking life
I've got an idea
Hanaya says if we take them back home, we'll get two carts of grain
It'll be New Year's Day every day
Lives for grain
- You go.
- You go
- You first.
- You first
Speak
I say no deal
- I agree. No deal.
- No deal
- Why not?
- Don't know. Doesn't feel right
- I say let's do it.
- Why?
Why not?
I al ready said why.
It doesn't feel right
That's not enough.
What'll we gain by not doing it?
If you say no, take âem home yourselves and look after âem like a wife
What'll we gain?
You tell us what the disadvantages are?
What if that guy comes back for âem?
He said he'd be here on New Year's Eve.
Half a year has passed
What if he never comes?
We gonna keep âem our whole lives?
Does a deal count as collaboration? collaboration?
You always throw that word around
You help Japs kill Chinese, you're a collaborator
But asking them for some grain?
If you return the Jap but don't ask for grain, that's collaboration
Who grew it anyway?
We Chinese did
We've got our backs to the sun.
Our sweat flows, irrigating the soil
Why should the Japs get it for free?
I'll take the grain from their mouths and put it in ours
And not just ours.
All our relatives will get their share
That's collaborating?
You'd call me a collaborator for that?
Well, no
If everyone was like us and took the Japs and traded âem in what would the world be like then?
The Japs would be the collaborators
Say we agree
- I say no.
- Explain yourself
You're in with sensei, but I slapped Hanaya
True.
And what about One Strike Liu?
- Say we disagree.
- What do you mean?
I was gonna say
Li u Wang, the fact you hit Hanaya hardly counts
How often have the Japs hit you?
One Strike Liu is a more serious matter
What do we do then?
I've been thinking about it
We'll say the guy who captured âem came back to kill them
We talked ourselves blue in the face, but got rid of him saving their lives.
That's believable
- I believe it.
- And why not? They're not dead
We saved âem, didn't we?
And for that, they're gonna punish you?
They've got to reward you
It still doesn't feel right
Why not?
I found One Strike Liu, and I'm not worried
You won't eat food that's put in your mouth? Are you a coward?
I give you men. You give us grain.
I've done you no wrong
Would you treat me badly?
Aren't our hearts made of flesh?
I'll throttle âem both
- and twist their necks like fried dough.
- Forget the fried dough
No flour, no fried dough
Li u Wang is right.
No flour, no fried dough
If we don't go, we can't get the grain
Grain.
There'll be enough grain to feed the whole village for a year
Auntie, I said
I'd pay you back eightfold
It'll be eighty-fold
- You said it, not me.
- I sure did
Forget the two carts of grain
If it was two carts of shit,
I'd still do it
I'd do it for nothing
I don't want them another day
If you're scared, don't come.
Fine. I'll go myself
I'll take those two carts of grain bag by bag
I'll bring it back to you myself.
I'll deliver it and put it in your mouths if I have to.
You'll eat it and be grateful
And you'll feel remorse in your gut cal m down.
No one said they weren't going
- No.
- No
So, we're going?
What an effort
Give me some water
Why do you have to make him cry?
Yes.
I'll make the decision for us
Hanaya wants to see you
Yes
Hanaya.
I want to ask you three things
Answer truthfully
How will you guarantee our safety and how will you raise the question of the grain?
I'll tell you how
We all come from the same county
Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka is from my village
We grew up together. We're friends.
Translate
He says:
We all come from the same village.
I know captain Sakatsuka
We grew up together.,
No wonder. The same village
- So he's a peasant too. Just like us.
- A son of the soil
Yes, that's it
I'm a son of the soil
But I'm a sergeant too, in charge of food supplies
The Imperial Army has a policy of rewarding those who help it
So I can promise you will get your grain
He says --
And I also want to say that I've been well treated here
You saved my life.
You'll be perfectly safe. Translate!
I'm a sergeant in charge of foodstuffs
The Imperial Army rewards those who help it. You'll get your grain
You've looked after me well
You saved my life.
Your safety is guaranteed.,
I thought he was a cook.
Now he's a sergeant?
Brother, I was afraid you were going to kill us. So I made that up
Made it up?
Maybe you've made up all this too
At a time like this, would I dare?
What?
They're afraid I'm making this up
You better not be, Dong!
It's a matter of life and death!
Stop lying
If I was playing games now
I'd be the loser
- What are you talking about?
- He's afraid I'm lying
If I was, I'd only be hurting myself
Sit back down
Sit down
Listen.
I don't care what rank you hold
Since you've been in our village, we've fed you looked after your wounds, cut your hair and beard
In your heart, you know we've treated you well
- Very well. What else is there?
- Ask him
He says they've fed you, healed you cut your hair and treated you well, right?
Like members of their own family
Especially Dasan and his pregnant wife.
They've been great
You've treated us like family, especially Dasan and his wife
Look, let's not talk about that
Don't talk about that
What's the second question?
And the second question?
You answered it before I even asked
Well is there anything else?
You've answered everything.
He finally looks happy
The swordsman wasn't one of you
I could tell from his accent he was one of those who captured us
You persuaded him to leave and saved our lives
I've told him this. We thank you
It was nothing
We were talking about the swordsman
- Nothing to do with you people.
- That's right
So long as you know that
That's fine
Sit back down
Since that's the case,
I'll read this back to you
If you've no problem with it, you can sign it
They've got an agreement to sign
The Japanese Kosaburo Hanaya arrived in our village at year's end
It was cold. He was frightened disheveled, and wounded by a bullet
Who brought him here, we do not know
Six months passed.
Winter turned to summer
The villagers were kind and righteous
They did all they could to help -- clothing, sheltering and feeding him despite the hardship
We've all been through this turmoil.
We'll never forget this experience
Hanaya in gratitude promised us two carts of grain as a reward
We happily accepted this offer
Now Hanaya and his translator return to you
And hereafter, both sides will live in peace
Signed by the Chinese and the Japanese.,
Captain!
Captain!
Hanaya is back!
Captain!
Hanaya is back!
- What's happening?
- Hanaya is back!
Captain!
Hanaya is back?
Yes. Hanaya is back
I'm back
I'm really back!
I'm back!
- How come he's still alive?
- What happened to h is uniform?
Did he get taller?
Attention!
Captain, sir!
Kosaburo Hanaya has returned to the ranks!
Dasan. Look. What a mess
Oh, no
This is terrible.
Get off. Off. Give me a hand
Pull 'em apart
- Push.
- He won't budge
We didn't plan this
âWe didn't plan this. â
We didn't tell him to do that
âWe didn't tell him to do that. â
Fucking hell captain-san.
We're so sorry
Turn around!
-Attention.
- Yes, sir
- Know why we're beating you?
- No
What? Stupid pig.
- Now you understand?
- Yes, sir
Say it. Why are we beating you?
I shouldn't have come back alive
You think dying would've solved it?
Yes, but --
Your name's inscribed in the Yasukuni Shrine
I've already. informed your father
You're the goddamn hero of the village.
And now you're back, alive
You have lost face for the village and the Imperial Army
Worse, you've returned with a herd of Chinese swine
Bastard
They weren't the ones who captured me.
They saved me
First they captured you, then the pigs saved you
You know how many died in that battle?
If they didn't ambush us, who did?
I was taken to them only after I was shot.
I never meant to surrender. I--
What are you saying?
Swine
Tell us, were you a prisoner or not?
Speak
Yes
I passed out, and when I a woke
I was tied up in a sack
Because you passed out, you think it's all right?
Couldn't you have committed suicide?
I had no opportunity!
Bastard! You need an opportunity to commit suicide?
But --
- You think you deserve to live?
- Move!
You bastard.
Why aren't you helping?
Feel sorry for him, do you?
You want to forgive him?
Hanaya wants to say something
- Bastard!
- I'm sorry
Truly sorry.
So truly sorry
And that makes everything all right?
Let him speak.
Soon they'll have you on the rack with chili water up your nose.
Scared?
Get a grip on yourself
What are you scared of?
Everyone's here
A chopped-off head leaves a big scar.
Blame it all on me
You can say I captured the Jap
If we were scared, would we be here?
We're just hanging around.
Why can't we talk?
I thought everything was fine until your donkey started acting up.
He's got no sense of timing
He could have chosen another horse besides the Jap's
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
Please forgive me. I'm so sorry
Hanaya, let me read this letter to you
Yes, sir
The son of the Hanayas' is a great hero
Each time I pass by their door,
I lower my head in shame
Hanaya is the pride of our village
Son. Kill more Chinese pigs for your father
Serve the emperor well.
Solemnly yours --
San. You kept Hanaya locked up for six months couldn't they do the same to us?
Why do you always think the worst?
You call that locked up?
I call it looking after them
Besides, we didn't capture him.
He wasn't our prisoner
But now we're locked up here with nothing to eat or drink.
So aren't we the prisoners now?
Prisoners?
Don't you have two legs?
You came here yourself
If you're a prisoner, you're your own prisoner
Dad.
How can you sleep?
- This is no good. Move.
- San
I've got something to say to your captain-san
Get back!
- I've got something to say --
- Get back!
- I've got --
- Get back!
- But I must talk to him.
- Get back!
Move again and I'll kill you
Then --
Kosaburo Hanaya
On August 15, 1945
Zixuan Zhao, Dasan Ma
Kosaburo Hanaya, Hanchen Dong, solemnly agreed to these terms.
- Hanaya.
- Yes, sir
You groveled enough.
Why not mention this as well?
I was about to
- Bastard.
- Shut up
Captain, you don't have to honor the agreement
Shut up! Fool!
Hanaya left h is fingerprint
Unlike the Chinese, the Japanese are honorable people
Get out!
Yes, sir
- I humbly take my leave.
- Get out
- Hanaya.
- Yes, sir
You've signed an agreement
The Imperial Army honors its pledges.
I have no choice but to carry this through
Hold on. In my experience, the Chinese are unreliable mongrels
If they say east, think west
I'm sure it's not as simple as it seems.
There must be someone behind this
Shut up. Bastard
Hanaya. Standup
This matter--
I'll do this for you
All right?
Yes, sir
Attention!
Who signed this agreement?
What, afraid to admit you signed?
I signed
Good. Come here
Dasan Ma
Dasan Ma
Good.
Here, come

Lieutenant Nonomura
What is it, Inoue?
Phone call
Urgent phone call
From Western Fortress Town
They haven't called in over a month
They must have a mission for us
Charge!
- Follow me!
- Onwards!
Is that Old Uncle?
Old Uncle here
It's me, Dasan
- Is that San?
- Yeah
What's up?
The grain will be there tonight
It'll arrive by dusk
- What?
- Get everyone together
Everyone must be there
Do you understand me?
- What?
- can you hear me?
Huh? What?
I said, do you understand me?
I hear you
I hear you
Gather everyone together
- Right?
- Right
San
- Have a safe journey.
- I will
Take care
Yeah
I'm finished
Yes, we know
Captain.
Lieutenant Nonomura would like a word
Hello?
Yes, organize a celebration with the navy and infantry
He's so far away. But he sounded like he was in the next room
Wasn't that amazing?
It's no wonder --
What are you talking about?
He says the captain is the kindest of men and the Imperial Army has the finest of things
Hanaya stayed with you for six months
He consumed much food and put you out
So
I will give you the two carts of grain. and add four carts as a reward.
Six in all. How's that? Translate
The captain said, because of the grain eaten by Hanaya he will add four carts as a reward.
Six in all. How's that?
- Six carts of grain?
- Thank the captain-san
I'm speechless
What's he saying?
His gratitude knows no bounds.
He wishes to kowtow before you
All right. Load the carts.
Get their people together. Hurry up
Quickly, load the carts, before the Japs change their mind
- Load the carts? Great.
- come back
- You've got to bow to the captain-san.
- captain-san
- Well, San?
- What happened?
You're going on the rack with chili water up your nose
They've given us the two carts pl us four more. Six in all
That's wonderful!
Let's load âem up
You can slap me if you like
Go right, Captain can you take this for me?
I want to pick up Yu'er and collect a few others as well
Won't the old man get angry?
Don't tell him. Let him brood.
Forget him
Okay
Long live the emperor!
Company, attention
- Nonomura at your service.
- Sakatsuka at yours
Old Uncle!
We're back!
Right turn!
We've got the grain!
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
You're my granddad,
I'm your son
Where's my stool?
Rabbit-fucker
Eat up
We walk the straight and narrow path
A healthy foot doesn't fear a twisted shoe
Eat, drink and be merry
Lieutenant Nonomura, strike up the band
I want to say a few words.
Can they play the army theme?
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.
The naval tune is the only one we know
We're just navy reserves, you see
Music is our little hobby
Then play your navy song
You don't mind?
Attention!
Straighten up, Horie
- Well?
- Excellent
Thank you
How is it? Good?
Woman
Woman
- Man.
- Man
- Woman pl us man equals good.

Good wine
Good!
The army and the navy together have invited the village to this feast.
We've prepared lots of good food
We hope everyone has a great time
The army and the navy together --
Don't talk with your mouth full
Have invited all of you here.
It's a free meal
So enjoy yourselves
One, two, three
âªLeaving home, we b ravel swore to return triumphantâª
âªHow can I die before victoryâª
âªThe bugles play
The flags float like a seaâª
âªThe earth, grass and trees are on fire
The fields stretch out before the eyeâª
âªThe Rising Sun flags and helmets advanceâª
âªI pat my horse's mane
Who knows one's fateâª
âªThinking of today's battle of my comrade covered in bloodâª
âªDying with a smileâª
âªLong live the emperorâª
âªHis last, unforgettable cryâª
A happy occasion lifts the spirits
Just now, the Imperial Army has played music and sung a song
What shall we do in turn?
I am an old man, willing to make a fool of myself
I'll sing for you
âªThe flowers and willowsâª
âªLove the spring sunshineâª
âªThe moon and windâª
âªLove the autumn chillâª
âªThe young maidâª
âªLoves the talented manâª
âªThe heroâª
âªLoves valorâª
I forget the rest
He said he forgot the rest of the lyrics
âªYou and I, we are an eggâª
âªI'm the white and you're the yolkâª
âªThe white surrounds the yolkâª
âªJust as I embrace youâª
âªInto the wee hoursâª
âªWe dance, enthralledâª
âªBathed in moonlightâª
âªWe are ecstaticâª
There's an old saying
People fear meeting, trees fear stripping
Tonight I'll also risk em barras sing myself and sing a song
âªI slipped in to sneak a look at the young manâª
âªWith my fingertip I poked a hole in the windowâª
- You know, the paper window?
- Yes, I know
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
Drink! Drink!
âªHe was as handsome as a princeâª
âªDark brows, big eyes
A very special faceâª
âªMy heart thrilled to the sightâª
âªBack home I told my motherâª
âªShe wasn't pleasedâª
âªI made a face and lowered my headâª
âªI pouted, I turned awayâª
âªI stiffened my neck and threw a fitâª
âªI said, don't try and marry me to anotherâª
The captain praises your singing
Your mother's a real tease
If there are more songs like this, there'll be trouble
Pity they're all sung in chorus
We sing ours individually
Why don't you sing one yourself, to entertain us?
All right
Kosaburo Hanaya, give these people a song
Hanaya, standup
Were you speaking Chinese just now?
Let's hear it.
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
And?
You're my granddad,
I'm your son
Translate, Dong
Happy New Year, brother and sister-in-law
You're my granddad,
I'm your son
Give me a gun
Kosaburo Hanaya is the scum of the Imperial Army
I invite you to shoot him with this gun for our drinking entertainment
Well? Who'll do it?
Hanaya represents the scum of the army.
The captain invites you to shoot him
For our drinking entertainment.
Any takers?
How can he be scum?
For six months you lived under Nonomura's blockhouse
Is that true?
It's no small amount of time
Why didn't you contact Nonomura?
If he was on the h ill, don't tell me he couldn't see you
We had no opportunity
What do you mean?
- We were locked up in the cellar.
- I didn't ask you
Hanchen Dong spoke the truth
What?
You didn't do too badly
So besides learning some Chinese, what else did you do?
It's only on account of your promise that I'm feeding these mongrels
So that explains it
So, asking them to kill you now is rather appropriate, isn't it?
Come on.
Execute him, why don't you? come on, everyone, shoot him
If you don't then I take it you forgive him?
If you don't, that means you forgive him
Turtle-fucker!
Nonomura. A favor
Can we hear the whole tune from the top?
Yes, sir
This is our first visit here
We'd never heard of Rack-Armor Terrace.
It means âput down weapons. â
The story goes, a long time ago a famous general retired from battle and came here to live an ordinary life
The Chinese say to ârack one's armorâ and return to the fields is an extreme form of virtue
I wish to express my deep respect
Although the Japanese Army is fighting in China this won't go on forever
One day. I too will rack my armor.
And yet in a place that so dislikes warfare a Japanese soldier of the likes of Hanaya was kid napped and held captive
It appears Rack-Armor Terrace doesn't deserve its name
And you are not as wise as your fore fathers
I've given you your grain
I've fulfilled my end of the bargain
But I have a question for you
Who was it who brought this scum here?
I don't know.
You have to ask Hanaya
- Hanaya, answer the question.
- I really don't know
Look. Even he doesn't know.
How could I answer?
Why not drop it?
He's been returned.
Isn't that the end of it?
Well, where's Dasan Ma gone?
To fetch Yu'er
Yu'er?
How many men is she bringing?
How many guns?
She's pregnant.
She's staying at her mother's
As for people, probably two or three.
But no guns
They'll be back soon. We're waiting for him to divide the grain
Divide the grain? Surely not
He's gone to get the men who captured Hanaya
It looks like he's scared you.
Don't be afraid
He'll be back soon. You'll see
You think I'm afraid? course you are.
You've got your guns out
If that's not fear, what is it?
Look at me.
I'm eating and drinking
I'm not worried about anything.
Just relax
Bastard!
Why all the cursing?
I understand bakayaro
How can you say that?
You fucking --
Li u Wang!
Don't let anyone get away
Don't stop. Keep playing
Bastards! Surround them!
Don't! Don't go!
Mongrel.
We should've killed you long ago
You've got the heart of a wolf
- Translate.
- We should've killed you long ago
New soldiers
-A rare opportunity
- Yes, sir
Pull it out yourself
Harder. Twist it
Who was it who brought this scum here?
Where's Dasan Ma?
The baby's nearly due.
We'll get another share of the grain and I'll marry you
Turtle-fucker!
I'll kill you, Jap turtle-fucker!
Ma!
Get up. Standup
Japanese inside the Great Wall
Let go. Go away
Nonomura.
You've been with them for too long
You're getting too close to them -- like an auntie to these b rats
- Brat!
-Japanese inside the Great Wall
Grab him!
You bastard!
Drag the old bastard over!
I'll throttle you, turtle-fucker!
Let go, you old swine!
You'd dare strangle an Imperial Army soldier?
Hold him!
How come it's not cutting through?
Let me try
Stop dicking around! Bastard!
Let me do it. Move
Throw him on the fire
Die, you old mongrel!
Ma!
Swine.
You wanna die? I'll help you.
Hurry! Come on!
Throw him in! Hurry!
You haven't seen me rest, have you?
Let's burn the grain and the village!
Charge! Advance!
Long live the emperor!
No need for you to die
The emperor has made a proclamation
The Imperial Army has racked its armor
But we weren't defeated on the battlefield
Such a pity.
On account of this imperial order we have to stop fighting
The war situation is no longer to Japan's advantage
The enemy has employed a new, cruel bomb which has taken a toll of many innocent lives and has an incalculable destructive power
Should we continue to fight not only would the Japanese nation be obliterated but human civilization would be extinguished
Such being the case how are we to save our subjects and atone before the spirits of our ancestors?
This is why we accepted the joint declaration of the powers
Very good!
Go away or I kill you!
âªThe smoke of war has desistedâª
âªFor eight years china resistedâª
I have no money.
Will you take this?
All right
âªWe've got the Japs holding their sorry assesâª
You buy. Very good
I'm not buying this
Fucking J ap.
Go blow up your mother with it
Bastard. I'll kill you
- china, U K, US, USSR!
- Together no one beats us!
Quick, move this garbage
I don't understand
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't understand you
Do you want to buy something?
I'm ordering you back to the barracks
In Tokyo, in Japan, these are very valuable
I'm ordering you to stand still
I'll throw in the hat for nothing
âªAnd so the invasion has come to an inglorious endâª
âªWe welcome this day of victoryâª
âªAnd the recoveryâª
âªOf our beautiful landâª
Move it.
But we were singing for them.
Do we deserve this?
Fucking bastards
- Company, attention.

Thank you, Chinese Army.
Thank you
The Japanese have surrendered.
The war is over
Peace has come at last
Yet in the last few days one man has violated the agreement which Generalissimo Chiang
President Truman,
Prime Minister Churchill and Stalin in the interest of world peace, signed at Potsdam thus disturbing the social order and terrorizing people
That person is Dasan Ma, who you see before you
Perhaps some will say
Dasan Ma only killed Jap devils, and call it âresistance.,,
But what is âresistance,,?
Battles fought with Japanese troops, the struggle against invasion
Those are acts of resistance
But Dasan Ma's wanton slaughter of POWs who had lost the will to resist was a false resistance
Perhaps some will argue that such profound hatred was the result of Japanese atrocities
Who of our 400 mill ion com patriots doesn't hate the Japanese?
My own parents were killed by Japanese bombs
My left leg was shattered in the final battle
Who could be more motivated to kill former Japanese soldiers?
Who has the best reason for revenge?
Me. Major Gao
And who is most constrained from such action?
Me. Major Gao
Because I am a soldier,
I must follow orders
I take this opportunity to reissue this warning: only Nationalist soldiers can legally accept the surrender of Japanese troops
War hasn't only brought catastrophe to china but to the people of Japan as well
Are they not human too?
I ask you.
Who among you would tolerate to see your husband's head chopped off?
Anyone?
No one!
I ask you too.
Who among you would wish to see your wife, on her way to buy a bolt of cloth have her hand cut off?
Anyone?
No one!
Dasan Ma. Do you have anything to say for yourself?
Is there anything you can say?
Gag him
Listen, everyone
Ever heard a cry to heaven,,?
- He is braying like a mule.
- That's a cry to heaven.,
What distinguishes man from a beast?
You don't deserve to be called Chinese
You don't even deserve to be called human
How can a Chinese soldier sully his hands with the blood of such scum?

Inokichi Sakatsuka
Attention!

I order you to execute Dasan Ma
Shoot him
He orders you to carry out the execution
Really?
That's what he said
What?
You dare to disobey my command?
We've put down our weapons.
We cannot use firearms
I could obey your order, using a Japanese sword
It's our customary weapon
Translate that bit about the sword accurately
Reporting to Major Gao:
We've al ready handed in our firearms
We're not permitted to use them anyway
However, we must obey your order
The Japanese warrior always carries a sword could he use a sword?
What a pain.
Okay, give him a sword
- What a good story this is.
- Indeed
We'll write a great skit about this

Invincible [2001]-Billy Zane-IMDb: tt0216487
[ loud drums pounding ]
[ screaming ]
Os: Agony or ecstasy?
Even after 2,000 years the rush of a kill still made me feel a good death was worth living for.
I was ready to dish out anguish for a few more millenniums.
Why she came to me
I'll never know.
[ roaring ]
White Warrior: Os?
It's time.
It's time for you to love.
Love or die.
Who are you?
Your beginning oryour end.
The choice is yours.
Are you ready to die?
Are you ready to love?
Love.
Die.
[ yelling ]
[ scraping ]
[ clanging ]
Surrender to the light.
[ clanging ]
[ whooshing ]
[ clanging and whooshing ]
[ whooshing ]
[ whirring ]
[ panting ]
White Warrior: You can live.
Os: What do you want from me?
Open your heart to the light.
Let it awaken you.
[ chirping ]
White Warrior: Welcome to life.
The tablet will be found soon.
If Slate gets it, he'll destroy the planet to escape his destiny.
You have six days to stop him.
If you fail, all will die.
[ wind blowing ]
[ grunting ]
Os: Confused â so was I.
The White Warrior wasn't supposed to be real.
She was a fairy tale.
Maybe it was time to start believing, even in fairy tales.
And why not?
To most I was a fairy tale.
Okay, more like a nightmare.
The monster under the bed, the lurking evil you feel but can't see â that was me.
Sorry about that.
That was me or one of the other Shadowmen.
We were exiled here centuries ago for crimes against cosmic evolution.
We passed the time tormenting the locals in this living hell called earth.
But my buddy Slate, he was tired of pulling wings off human flies.
He wanted off this rock.
If he could destroy the earth, he'd be free; all of us would.
If he got the tablet, he could do it.
The tablet was a page from the Book of Life.
It had been here even longer than us.
If Slate could decipher it, he'd open the vortex.
If that happened, the world was toast.
It's here.
Thank you, Mr. Beck.
He's clean.
Mr. Lancaster.
Mr. Beck.
It's Sunday, and here I am, working.
My wife is quite angry.
This better be good.
It isn't good.
It's great.
I've waited all my life for something like this.
Where did you find it?
Construction site.
Carbon-14 tested.
It dates older than the Dead Sea Scrolls.
[ shutter beeping ]
We consulted a linguist.
Never seen this writing.
This character looks Chinese.
This one looks Cyrillic.
And this, Aztec.
Mr. Beck, how much?
[ swooshing ]
What was that?
Hold it.
Yes?
You have something to say?
[ choking ]
Oh.
I didn't think so.
[fingers drumming ]
Knock, knock.
[ doors creaking ]
Ahhh!
What?
Not what.
That.
That is mine.
I've been searching for it for 2,000 years.
What do you want?
Who are you?
I am truth.
You, get out of my office.
[ trigger clicking ]
[ cocking and clicking ]
[ cocking and clicking ]
Ahhh!
[ gunfire ]
Ahhh!
Just like a human.
They faint before you can kill them.
[ chuckling ]
[ swooshing ]
I'll start the translation.
It's you, Os, isn't it?
Going somewhere?
You know I am.
[ sighing ]
Are you coming?
Not this eternity.
Ha, I knew there was a traitor.
I'm truly sorry it turned out to be you.
We're this close.
The war is almost won.
War?
The war is within, man.
What are you talking about?
Boys.
[ grunting and gasping ]
[ swooshing ]
[ grunting ]
Sweet...
Although quite temporary.
You can't kill them.
But the elements can.
You're pissing me off, Os.
There is forgiveness, Slate, even for us.
The clock is ticking.
I want that tablet, now!
Gotta split.
I had to work fast.
Before I realized the
White Warrior myth was true,
I'd been thrilled, relieved, that Slate got this far.
His freedom was mine, too.
I knew that freedom was inside all life, good and bad.
Destroying the earth wouldn't free us.
It would trap us in the dark forever.
You couldn't explain a concept like redemption to Slate.
To win this, I'd have to fight.
I couldn't do it alone.
[ music ]
[ clanging ]
Let's go, Private.
Now!
All right.
All right.
Well, Private.
I can't say I'm sorry to see you go.
You probably shouldn't have stolen that Jeep, taken that swing at the sergeant, or done any of all the hundreds of dumb-ass things you've done.
You are a real screw-up.
I didn't steal that Jeep.
I know.
The military court has a different opinion.
Whateveryou say, man.
I'm out of here.
Something else, Private.
I had you pegged right from the beginning.
Born loser.
With a capital "L".
Once a loser, always a loser.
Say what?
Say what?
Hell, I'll tell you "say what."
Once a loserâ
What?
What did I do?
Officer:
Once a loser, always a loser.
Who are you?
[ swooshing ]
Freedom.
That's relative, isn't it?
You know,
I know some free men who are still prisoners in their minds.
They never look around.
Look around, would you?
Have you ever seen such beauty?
I never knew air could smell so sweet.
Want to learn to control that temper?
Huh?
I could show you.
Who the hell are you?
Well, I amâ
The question is not who am I, the question is, who are you?
Who are you?
Get out of my face â
I'm having a bad day.
You could be hurt real bad.
Bad meaning good, or bad meaning bad?
-I 'm warning you.
You're not listening.
I'm talking about interpretation,
Perspective, choice â which is what you have right now.
What does that mean?
If you don't come with me, that lieutenant will track you down and kill you.
You can stay here and become dead, oryou can go with me and become alive.
"There's nothing hard to see
"About this love with you and me
"It shines like a moon at night
"There's nothing that can beat it
"There's no one can defeat it
'Cause I love you with all of my heart..."
All right â 10,000.
I'm out.
It's 10.
Out.
Just you and me now.
Let's make it more interesting.
All right.
I call.
[ sighing ]
That's a mistake.
Ace, king, full house â you lose.
Not so fast, Tojo.
Royal flush.
You lose.
[ chuckling ]
Congratulations.
I don't think you'll live long enough to enjoy that money,
Detective.
Get your hands up, up â you're under arrest for the murder of Jenny Rusk, Mr. Sakamura.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just relax.
I'm going to stand up, slowly.
Okay?
Now, if you want to live,
I suggest you give me your gun.
Come on.
[ clicking ]
Come on.
[ chuckling ]
Come on, ladies.
It's been fun.
Sorry it has to end, huh?
Sayonara, Detective.
Oh, by the way, kill her.
Come on, guys, just relax.
We can work this out.
There's no need for violence, come on.
[ gunfire ]
Stay right there.
Stacey what?
Don't move.
Don't worry.
It's all right, Detective.
The cigar's pre-Castro, and they don't serve a Cuban rum here.
I think we're safe.
Did you come here alone?
Big mistake.
Why?
Your captain's in with Sakamura: leave, you're dead.
Oryou could come with me and we get a real drink.
Michael:
I've done this many times.
I don't fail.
All you do is testify and everything will be fine.
[ sighing ]
This is taking forever.
Give me a second here.
-What is it?
-Probably nothing.
Stay in the car and lock the doors.
Hear what I said?
Stay in the car.
Hey, what's going on here?
How about this?
Move.
That's it.
Damn!
I'm not a bad student.
Get your hands up.
Step out of the car!
[ giggling ]
I am.
I've got to go now, dear.
Feel better now?
I do.
Good â later.
See you.
-Hey!
-Hey.
She'll be fine.
She's going back to school.
Don't take her home.
Those guys are waiting for her and they're gunning foryou.
She'll never testify.
I don't know you.
You have three seconds to explain.
I have eternity.
Alice, take me down.
Alice: Going down.
[ music ]
Stop, please.
Alice: Stopping.
Neutralize lasers.
Alice: Neutralizing lasers.
Laser security deactivated.
Up, please.
Alice: Going up.
Floor sensors deactivated.
Hands in the air, now!
I have no idea what happened.
I was looking for a cash machine.
Somehow, I ended up here.
-Shut up!
-Okay.
Drop the guns â that-a-boy.
Mate, calm down,
I'll let you go.
Good.
Uhh!
Os: You won't kill me.
You've never killed anyone.
Antiquities â they'll build a shrine to anything,
If you stick around long enough.
I was here first, mate.
Relax â
I'm a pre-Columbian man myself.
Oh.
You won't kill them.
You've never killed anyone.
Not yet anyway, you wait around here longer, and you will,
Which is something you'll have to work out for a long time.
Trust me, I know.
Os: Don't blame me,
I didn't pick 'em.
They were the only hope for the world.
I was the only hope for them.
'Morning.
-Who is Ray Jackson?
-Serena Blue?
- Michael Fu?
- Keith Grady?
You are.
You can't use your old identities.
The new names and IDs protect you.
Serena Blue used to be an incorruptible police officer
'til her corrupt superiors left her hanging.
Ray Jackson sacrificed all to defend his country.
Had a bad temper.
His enemies take advantage of that.
How do you know?
Michael Fu â
Witness Protection Program.
His witnesses are corrupt.
Makes him irritable.
That ain't the coffee talking.
Keith Grady.
The uncommon thief.
Thief â you said we were protectors.
Sometimes it's not "what";
You must understand "why".
Mr. Grady grew up in a boys' home that would have closed for lack of funding.
So he started stealing when he was 16 from those who could afford to give to charity.
He drops an envelope in a metal box monthly.
I got away with it until yesterday.
Oh, really?
I almost got killed yesterday.
Really?
Just a second.
I was discharged yesterday.
Funny that.
And you, Kung Fu?
I'm not Kung Fu, Action Jackson.
Action who?
Jackson.
Ain't you seen a film in 20 years?
You need some new DVDs.
- Buy me some?
I'll buy you some.
[ swooshing ]
Whoa.
What did you do, man?
Could you tell us what's going on?
I want to show you something.
Would you put those on?
Come on, indulge me â
I made it myself.
I did.
Os: Okay, I admit it.
Finding out you're a super-evolved human warrior isn't the easiest pill to swallow.
All things considered, they took it well.
It's glorious.
All right.
Now, remember â
You're a team of protectors, chosen before birth to defend all life.
If you have any doubts about your collective destiny, there's something
I'd like to show you.
Serena, would you show us your birthmark, please?
Please.
Serena: Satisfied?
Os: Anyone else have one like that?
Trust me, I've got one.
[ swooshing ]
Os.
I can feel him.
And now he's got the elements.
Sorry I took you out of school,
Professor,
But we don't have much time.
[ mumbling ]
Speaks of six days...
Six days and something willâ must happen.
Great battle...
...rising on both sides.
I can't work under these conditions.
I strongly advise you to endure these difficult conditions.
Complete the translation.
I'm doing as best I can with an incomplete text.
Half a tablet is virtually impossible to read.
I'm most uncomfortable on this stool.
Oh, Professor,
I can hear the violins.
Do me a favour â shut up!
Finish the job.
[ echoing ]
[ music ]
What are we doing here?
Get out of your heads.
The beats per minute will help you absorb the information
I'm about to give you.
Plus, I'm really into drum and bass right now.
What is that supposed to mean?
What, when, where?
Soon, you won't have to ask these questions.
You'll realize you intuitively know the answers.
How?
How â your telekinetic abilities will strengthen as you rapidly evolve from the normal humans that you are into hyper humans.
I'm learning the stuff â bear with me.
It sounds daunting, but don't worry, it gets weirder.
You're in â you're the first wave.
Selected before birth â wrap your head around that concept â to show us all the way.
[ music ]
The path you'll take is dangerous but beautiful.
Your skills, honed by my training, and your potential capacity for directing life makes you the last defence against the total destruction of life as we know it.
[ words echoing ]
Want to know more?
Tune in â come on, try it.
Tune in.
This better be good.
This tablet was unearthed yesterday.
Extremely powerful.
I have one half, the Shadowmen have the other.
If they put them together, they'll have the key to open the vortex.
We have four days to stop them.
If we don't, the air will become fire, oceans will boil and metal will rain down.
Unless you stop them.
Well, well.
You are pathetic, Os,
Surrounding yourself with these human weirdos.
Hey, man, I resent that.
Um, Slate,
The saviours of the world.
Saviours of the world, Slate â hi, fellows.
Hi, guys.
I offeryou this choice.
Leave now, you leave in one piece.
Stay where you are, you'll be, well, you'll be very sorry â
I promise.
This has nothing to do with us.
Shouldn't we at leastâ
Listen to your little girl!
Screw you, mateâ
[ swooshing ]
I need the whole tablet to open the vortex, Os.
Give me the other half, and I might let them live.
Take it.
[ screaming ]
See what you're capable of together
â fantastic.
Separate!
-Go now.
- Kill them!
-Go.
-This way.
[ music ]
Ee-ya!
Uhh!
[ grunting ]
No!
Uhh!
Ugh!
Wait â watch this.
[ roaring ]
Oh.
[ laughing maniacally]
Os: Want to try the other hand?
I guess not.
Argh!
[ music ]
Hi.
Are you hungry?
Serena: You set us up.
You knew they'd be there.
You almost got us killed, man.
I didn't.
You're powerful.
Shadowmen can't kill you â not yet.
You had to see Slate to believe.
Ray: So, they'll kick our collective ass.
Os: If you don't stop Slate from descending into that vortex, with those tablets, he'll kill you and everyone on the planet.
They've grown stronger over the next five days.
Unless you work as oneâ
Did I mention...
Did I mention each one of you represents one of the four elements of the universe?
Fire, air, water, uh, no?
I cannot believe I forgot this.
You're fire, no, you're air.
Fire.
Water.
Metal.
I'm supposed to show you how to combine your skills.
If I teach you how to work and fight together, you'll experience a power you cannot even fathom.
Only then can you defeat the Shadowmen, working together.
Personally, I can't believe that you're the only thing that'll stop them from destroying the world.
You didn't ask for this â
I didn't.
You know what â
I like it.
So will you.
I don't know if he's full of crap or not, but what I saw tonight,
I've never seen before.
Besides, anybody got anything else?
Yeah, I do.
I do have a life â the last place I want to be is right here with you people.
Know what I'm saying?
I know â you're a coward.
What did you call me?
I called you a coward.
Let him go!
You heard the man â the shâ
The Shadowmen.
They're getting stronger â they're coming.
They're coming after all of us.
That is true.
So, what do you say?
Fine!
I'll do it.
Besides,
I always wanted to be part of some cosmic gladiator thing, anyway.
All right, mate, show us what you've got before any of these Shadowmen drop by.
Right.
Shadowmen.
He's walking on water.
Os:
Serena, Grady, attack me.
I'm not doing this with him.
I'm a thief and you're a cop.
Stop it!
[ words echoing ]
All right, all of you attack me.
Os: There is a Shadowman so evil, so wicked, so seductive,
He rose above all others.
Other Shadowmen follow him like moths to a flame.
His name is Slate.
[ exploding ]
Os: Only your combined force can stop him.
Fire is fierce, hot and deadly.
Left uncontrolled, its fury rages until, finally, it consumes itself,
But when harnessed, fire is a formidable force.
It fights the dark and the cold.
Working with the other elements, it grows even stronger.
It can boil water, explode air, and temper steel.
Alone, it's deadly even to itself.
When united with the other elements, it has the strength to conquer worlds.
Water is the giver of all life.
It's patient,
Steady and timeless.
Without it, there's only dust.
Water is deep and mysterious.
It seeks serenity.
When combined with other elements, it has apocalyptic force.
United with air, it can lock the world in a prison of ice, or pummel it with blistering rain.
Combined with fire, it can scald.
On its own, water can also destroy with unmatched strength.
It must be respected.
[ gusting ]
Os: Air is everywhere.
It surrounds us at all times.
Invisible and untouchable, it is constantly moving, unsteady and impossible to hold.
Air is spontaneous, erratic and volatile.
With fire, it can cause explosions of cataclysmic power.
With water, it can unleash punishing torrents of rain.
Those who underestimate its power do so at their own peril.
Metal is brash and showy, but strong and deadly.
It is arrogant and rigid, but it will not compromise.
It never surrenders.
It is honest, bold, and always ready to fight.
It is precise,
Hot, cold, molten or solid.
It is never weak.
It is folly to enter battle without utilizing its force.
Unlike the elements, which are honest, true and open to us, the Shadowmen have been conspiring in the background, hidden, plotting to destroy humanity and all the elements on the planet.
They'll do everything to disorient you.
The Shadowmen believe five warriors with a sign would rise in the new millennium to defeat them.
They're certain that's you; so am I.
Ray:
Os, you said five warriors.
I only count four.
Where's the fifth member?
I killed him.
Os: I told you that the Shadowmen are evil.
They'll stop at nothing to destroy all you know.
Well, I was once a Shadowman.
My task was to eliminate the five marked by the sign.
I was chosen because my soul was even blacker than Slate's.
I killed for the pleasure.
No act of cruelty compared with the excitement at the prospect of killing each of you.
I tracked down the first element.
He was a good man â a protector.
He didn't deserve to die.
I killed him, with a smile.
Then, it all changed.
The White Warrior showed mercy.
A sliver of light touched my soul and I was reborn.
I can go on, but I'd start to cry.
Healthy as that is, there's no time.
This pool ain't deep enough for my tears.
I'm not the man I was.
The power of love has transformed me.
I must transform you if you're going to save the world.
Michael: What did she show you?
Os: Besides mercy, compassion and forgiveness?
Just one more foreign concept.
She showed me love.
Love that connects all living things, old and young, strong and weak, bathed in a light so beautiful it took my breath away.
I wept.
I haven't done that since... ever.
Darkness was all I knew.
Once my heart was open,
I could never go back.
How do we fit in?
Instead of destroying you,
I was to train you.
So you turned on Slate.
I had no choice.
Listen.
He was my best friend for 2,000 years.
I liked him like a brother.
Now that I love him,
I had to stop him.
There are only four of us.
What about the fifth?
Even without the fifth, you're still extraordinarily powerful.
As long as you fight together...
...and united.
[ sighing ]
I don't buy it.
What is wrong with you?
Serena: He should see Os.
I'll talk to him.
I didn't just hear the story,
I felt it.
Saw it in my mind.
You and me both, mate.
You and me both.
Tell me about your father, Ray.
I'd rather not talk about him.
What's he like â what did he do?
Did he have hobbies?
Hobbies â corporate retreats and being a jackass.
What are you looking for, Os?
Deep-sea fishing, golfing, working holidays.
He didn't give me the love
I needed, so I have issues with giving love.
Psychology 101.
I know what you're trying to do, man, but Iâ it's fine.
I'm cool with it, it's all good.
It's all good.
It's that simple.
Sometimes it's not what you receive, but what you're denied in this life that propels you.
That's why you chose your father.
I chose my father?
Why bring him into my life?
Because that is the lesson you had to work out in this lifetime.
Give yourself more credit.
You have a mission in this life, Ray.
The first part is to perceive obstacles as gifts.
The second part is to utilize that new-found resource for the betterment of all.
I want to, but...
Then, you already have.
Os: If a picture's worth a thousand words, then the picture Lancaster took of the tablets is worth a thousand souls.
Glad I remembered he had it.
You got the information?
Yeah â got the camera?
You first.
I want his name.
Slate.
Slate what?
Just Slate â one word, like Madonna.
Where do I find this son of aâ
That's enough about him.
Listen to me, Mr.â
Call me Os.
Os?
What kind of name is that?
Listen to me, Os.
I spent millions looking for that relic.
Have you any idea of its significance?
Attila the Hun, Genghis Khan,
Napoleon, Idi Amin,
The Shah of Iran â
They all had it.
I want it back, it's mine.
All right.
I realize the importance of this tablet to you.
There are more important things.
Like life.
[ chuckling ]
You're funny.
You don't understand.
I want that tablet!
Ohhh!
Calm down, will you â pull it together.
What happened?
You're realizing material things are meaningless.
I am?
Yeah.
Take a trip, bring the wife.
I suggest Tibet.
Look what that guy did to me â
I want him dead!
Revenge â bad mojo.
Right up there with greed.
Forget the material stuff.
Bring something in.
You can do a lot of good in this world.
Slate will kill you.
Who is that guy?
If I told you,
I'd have to kill you.
Give me the camera.
We're being watched.
Slate took the tablet photo, but the image's still in the camera.
Thanks.
Here's my cell number.
Call me in six days.
Give my best to the Dalai Lama.
I think he knows where I'm coming from.
Quick â walk away.
Don't look back.
[ clearing throat ]
[ clearing throat ]
[ clearing throat ]
You okay?
Yeah, why?
I was just wondering why you don't like me.
I mean, you've been cold to me since you first found out
I was a thief.
Let me tell you something.
I've got no love lost for cops either.
Let me tell you something.
I've known guys like you all my life.
Think you're God's gift to women.
Okay.
Ray: Now, Slate's got a photo of the tablet.
We only got three days left to stop him.
I'll need a day to translate.
-Slate's got a jump on us.
-I was his translator.
He'll have to bring in an outsider.
I don't envy that poor soul.
Well?
I think I have it.
You have what?
We're running out of time.
Look at the photograph closely.
The tablet speaks of a place.
A place... someone will...
-In this place what?
I will what?
In this place someone will start an epic battle and release the power... the power of 10,000 suns.
I don't understand.
Yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
You heard it, boys, this is it.
We're going home.
Where?
Here.
Olympic Park.
Is this good?
Good?
This ain't just good, this is...
[ gagging ]
Sweet.
[ music ]
Os: You've worked hard to fight Slate in the physical world, but he'll also try to attack your minds.
He'll trick you, he'll lie, he'll try to break your spirit, resist the impulse to hate Slate for this.
Instead, love him for strengthening you.
He'll trick you, he'll lie.
Resist the impulse to hate Slate.
With each of his challenges, you grow stronger.
You have light, you have the White Warrior.
Use her to conquer the darkness.
With each of his challenges, you grow stronger.
By tempting you, he gives you the means of self-evaluation.
Instead, love him; take Slate into your hearts.
Slate has the power of darkness working for him.
You have something far stronger.
Fight him with anger and give birth to new anger.
Fight him with hate, you give birth to new hate.
Fight him with love, you fight him with the most powerful force in the universe.
Love is your shield and your spear, your protector and your most powerful weapon.
Hate gives birth to hate; fight him with love.
With it, you can win any battle and vanquish any foe.
Without it, the battle is lost before it's begun.
Instead, love him.
Love is your shield and your spear, your protector and most powerful weapon.
He has the power of darkness; you have something stronger.
Fight him with love, the most powerful force.
You have light, you have the White Warrior.
With each of his challenges, you grow stronger â use her to conquer the darkness.
Even Slate will fall before her devastating beauty.
Resist the impulse to hate Slate for this.
Instead, love him.
You are no longer Serena and Michael, Ray and Grady.
You have the power of the universe.
You can win any battle and vanquish any foe.
Without it, the battle is lost before it's even begun.
You are fire, water, air and metal. messengers of hope, show the way to a new world of light.
Honey, can I talk to you?
Mom.
Woman: Grady.
I always loved you.
Slate: Don't you just love temptation?
Woman: I missed you.
Os:
Get out of his mind, Slate.
Woman: I want you back.
I'll do anything...
...anything,
If you'll take me back.
Man: Wake up, Ray.
What do you want?
To speak with you about your future.
What about it?
You best be gettin' out of my dream, man.
[ music ]
[ speaking Cantonese ]
[ grunting and panting ]
[ speaking Cantonese ]
[ panting ]
Hi.
Get out of his mind, Slate.
He is weak.
Don't you love temptation?
Michael is young â getting into his dreams is like getting into politics with a chequebook.
What are you doing here?
Where is Dad?
Your father went golfing with his new friend â
What's his name â
Slate.
Dad doesn't play golf.
He does now.
Why can't we go back to the way things were, Os?
Do you remember?
We shared everything.
Make love to me.
Woman: Grady.
I'm sorry about what happened, for what I did to you.
Ray, Ray, listen to me one minute.
Why should I?
I have a proposal you might find very interesting.
You got one minute.
Those were the good old days.
We can have them back a thousand times over.
I'm not a teenager now.
The vortex is our destiny.
It's what we dreamed about since the world was young.
Don't forget:
I know you, I saw you, Os.
You're one of us.
Don't you just love temptation.

[ breathing heavily ]
Carthage, Jerusalem.
London.
Berlin.
Berlin.
Ahh.
Yup, we had a ball.
The party's over?
The party is just beginning.
You're not my mother.
This is how you speak to your mother?
Get out!
I'd do anything, if you'll take me back.
[ music ]
You â we were wrong; there is absolution and forgiveness.
I forgave myself long ago.
No â I am talking about love.
I'm having the laugh of a century, but with a clear conscience.
No baggage, I'm clean.
If you come with me, if you join the Shadowmen, everything your father owns, his entire multi-million-dollar empire, will be yours.
Do I look like a mover and a shaker, who gets things done?
I know you hate him, Ray.
I know he disinherited you and you hate his guts.
You haven't spoken to him for 10 years.
We can rock the house, like Jekyll and Hyde,
Lewis and Clark,
Tom and Jerry,
Sammy and Frank.
Siegfried and Roy.
Who?
Who what?
[ growling ]
At the point of doom,
I am sending you straight to hell.
Get outta here, you idiot.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
You hit me.
You hit me.
It's my dream, baby.
Serena.
You disappoint me.
"You're so predictable"
[ whimpering ]
Slate: He's weak.
Os: That's not weakness.
I wish you would trust me on this.
Would that be so bad?
Would that be so bad?
[ water lapping ]
Would it be so bad if I killed one of them?
Don't.
Just one.
Don't.
[ laughing ]
[ screaming ]
[ gasping and choking ]
Slate: He choked.
He's weak.
Would it be so bad if I killed one of them?
Ray: Hold him down.
Hold his legs.
[ panting ]
Oh, my God, he stopped breathing.
Come on!
Two, three.
Come on!
Ah, 10, 11.
Come on â 12, 13.
[ sobbing ]
One, two, three.
Please.
Come on.
[ sobbing ]
Please, Michael.
Serena, he's gone.
[ sobbing ]
Let him go.
[ sobbing ]
[ Slate laughing ]
Quickly.
Put him in the centre of the sphere, his head at this end.
Ray, that end.
Get in the four points.
Good â Serena.
Now, if you want to save your brother,
Close your eyes,
Open your hearts.
[ rumbling ]
Open your hearts
'til they overflow for all life.
Connect
With that pure, electric substance that is light.
Now visualize that substance, coursing through his body, entering every cell of his being.
Connect with that pure consciousness.
Say,
"I am the luminous presence
"that is aligned with the true power of perfection."
Feel it, visualize it.
Feel him healing.
Feel the joy of him healing.
[ gasping ]
You feel him?
[ gasping and choking ]
Ohh, ohh.
[ panting ]
Do you see?
[ water lapping ]
I'll get some towels.
Elements, are you ready?
Elements!
Attack!
[ gushing ]
[ whooshing ]
[ crackling and crashing ]
[ splashing ]
Very good.
The four elements working together.
Yes!
Think we can beat them now?
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.
[ music ]
[ music ]
Once light goes into the vortex, we can't stop it?
That's right.
On this whole map area here, we have no clue where the vortex is.
That's right.
Come on, super-psychic mojo master, do something.
[ name echoing ]
Michael, Michael.
Where do you think it'll be?
Open your heart â where do you feel it will be?
Hey, guys.
[ whooshing ]
The dome.
Nice work.
Michael.
Thanks, Ray.
Look, I love a group hug, but... we've gotta roll.
I've given you each a gift.
When the time comes, you will know how to use it.
Listen.
Ray, five days ago you were a fire burning out of control.
Now you're a steady flame burning bright.
Radiate, and you'll show Slate the way.
Michael.
You've looked into yourself and discovered depths you'd never imagined.
Now let your enemies look in and find their truth in you.
Serena, your whole life has led to this moment.
For the first time, you feel you belong.
Hold on to that feeling and you will never be alone.
Grady, you're about to fight your fiercest battle.
Steel yourself and show us your mettle.
No sword is sharper.
Temper your force with compassion and we will win.
[ whooshing ]
[ sighing ]
All right, you know the plan.
There's a plan?
Divide and conquer.
Oh, yeah.
Somehow I knew that.
What about Slate?
I'll take care of him.
[ whooshing ]
All right, guys.
Ready?
Let's go.
[ thudding and grunting ]
Ee-yah!
[ thudding ]
[ thumping ]
Os.
An expected pleasure.
Sorry I'm on time; air traffic was light.
You always were punctual.
I've got a good astral travel agent.
-The White Warrior?
-I'll put in a word for you.
Don't bother.
Slate: I need a whole tablet to open the vortex.
I'm sorry, old friend.
No can do.
Too bad.
So, let the games begin.
[ whooshing ]
[ metal scraping ]
Come on, buddy, we've kidded ourselves for 2,000 years.
How about playing for our team, start with a clean slate?
Slate: No sermons, padre.
Why join 'em when you can beat 'em?
And I'm starting with you.
[ whooshing ]
Ahh!

Cross over now: we'll ascend together.
[ grunting ]
Guys, go to the tower.
Let's get to the tower.

What do I care about ascension?
With this,
I'll rip you a whole new galaxy.
Go!
Ohh.
Uhh!

Can we please go get a beer now?
I'm telling you: everything tastes sweeter.
Even revenge?

Os, your destruction has begun.
You can't stop it!

No one can!
Ahh!
[ wind whooshing ]

[ whooshing and rumbling ]
The vortex is open, Os.
I'm too powerful.
You can't win.
I'm going home!
You're coming too, Os.
Forget about the humans.
-They're ancient history.
-You're wrong!
I don't believe you!
You arrogant putz.
You never believed a damn thing.
Without trust, how can you know the power of truth?
I am truth!
Michael: The vortex is open!
He's killing Os!
Serena: Hang on!
Serena: You can do it â the Shadowmen are dead.
Michael: Remember what the White Warrior taught you.
The White Warrior.
You saw the White Warrior?
[ whooshing ]
Yes!
[ metallic whooshing ]
[ clanging ]
Love, Slate.
Love.
[ metallic scraping ]
Ohh!
[ panting ]
No-o-o !
Please!
[ crackling and crashing ]
Os, what's with the glow?
I know.
Which reminds me.
Slate is human now.
You're kidding.
Be gentle with him, Grady.
His journey's just beginning...
...as is yours.
So, listen up.
Only you will understand the true implications of world events â using your united power and a few kick-ass moves.
You fought valiantly â
I'm proud. even this you can't do alone.
What you've learned, you must teach.
Bring all the people of the world into your great radiance.
There will be no more fear, no more war, suffering, or hate.
Well, my four.
Goodbye.
What do you mean, goodbye?
Yeah, where are you going?
I'm not going anywhere, but I'll be everywhere.
That's the theory, anyway.
What do we do without you?
Have a really good time.
Come on.
[ slapping ]
Now, remember.
Separate, you're nothing.
Together, you're invincible.
Hey, Os.
Thanks, man.
For everything.
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
I'll always be with you, my four, my legacy.
Call me.

[ crackling ]
MAN:
They say Japan was made by a sword.
They say the old gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean... and when they pulled it out, four perfect drops fell back into the sea...
and those drops became the islands of Japan.
I say Japan was made by a handful of brave men...
warriors willing to give their lives...
for what seems to have become a forgotten word:
Honor.
[GROWLING]
[GROWLS]
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen:
Winchester.
America's leader in all forms of armament used... by the United States Army... celebrates our nation's centennial by bringing you a true American hero.
One of the most decorated warriors this country has ever known.
Winner of the Medal of Honor for his gallantry... on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg.
San Francisco, 1876
He is late of the 7th Cavalry... and their triumphant campaign against the most savage of the Indian nations.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you:
Captain Nathan Algren!
Captain Nathan Algren!
Yes!
Ladies and gent...
One moment, ladies and gentlemen.
Goddamn you, Algren, get out there!
This is your last performance!
You're fired! Now get out there!
Come on! I'm sick of this!
Come on!
Yes!
[APPLAUSE]
[COUGHS]
My thanks, Mr. McCabe, you are too kind.
This, ladies and gents... is the gun that's winning the West.
Why, many's the time
I've found myself...
[TOM-TOM PLAYING]
Surrounded by a swarm of... angry hostiles, with nothing but this rifle...
[BUGLE PLAYING]
Between me and a certain and gruesome death.
And let me tell you, folks, the red man... is a fearsome enemy.
And if he'd had his way... why, this scalp of mine would be long gone... and there'd be a balder man standing before you today.
Like those poor bastards out there... on the Little Bighorn.
Bodies stripped bare... mutilated.
Left to rot in the sun.
This, ladies and gentlemen, the 73 lever-action...
Trapper.
It's got a seven-shot capacity. Accurate
400 yards, one round per second.
Son, have you ever seen what this could do to a man?
Blow a hole in your daddy six inches wide.
WOMAN: Oh. That's terrible.
- That's right, missy.
This beauty.
You could kill yourself five, six, seven braves without ever having to reload.
Note the patented loading port and the smooth cocking action.
[COCKS RIFLE]
[CROWD GASPS]
[WOMEN SCREAMING]
My thanks on behalf of those who died... in the name of better mechanical amusements and... commercial opportunities.
Mr. McCabe here will take your orders.
God bless you all.
I must say, captain, you have a flair for the old melodrama.
- You're alive.
- I am, indeed.
Your man Custer says to me,
"We're going to the Little Bighorn."
Says I, "What's this 'we' stuff?"
It's the walking ticket for me.
Nine lives I have.
But I'll tell you what else I have.
I have a good job for the both of us.
God knows it looks as if you'll need one real soon.
What kind of a job?
The only job you're fit for, boyo.
A man's job.
Unless, of course, you got your heart set on a career in the theater.
Nathan!
Just listen to what your man has to say.
Been a while.
It's good to see you.
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Omura from Japan... and his associate, whose name
I've given up trying to pronounce.
Sit down, please.
ALGREN:
Whiskey.
Now, Japan's got it in mind to become a civilized country.
And Mr. Omura here is willing to spend what it takes... to hire white experts to train their army.
And if we play our cards right... the Emperor grants the U.S. exclusive rights to supply arms.
Well, I have an agreement with Winchester Company.
I'm certain Mr. Omura has some concept of what an agreement is.
Your performances for the Winchester
Company bring you $25 a week.
We will pay you $400 a month.
Five. For each.
And another 500 when we get the job done.
How many other genuine heroes you got lined up?
[MAN SPEAKING JAPANESE]
He's rude.
That's how it is here.
A land of cheap traders.
[IN ENGLISH]
Whiskey.
So who will we be training your boys to fight?
His name is Katsumoto Moritsugu.
He was once the Emperor's teacher.
- He's Samurai.
- Samurai?
The word you might use is "warrior."
Mr. Omura is familiar with our experiences dealing with renegades.
Is he?
He's even read your book.
Captain Algren's study of the tribes... was a crucial factor in our defeat of the Cheyenne.
Please excuse. What is funny?
The corps back together again.
It's just so... inspiring!
Excuse me.
I need to use the necessities.
[ALGREN couel-ls]
This isn't a problem.
I'll just talk to him for a minute.
Colonel Bagley.
We contacted you because you are
Captain Algren's superior officer... and you assured us of his participation.
He'll do it.
I just need a minute.
Nathan.
I did what I was ordered to do out there.
And I have no remorse.
So, what do you say we put the past behind us?
You want me to kill Jappos,
I'll kill Jappos.
- I'm not asking you to kill anybody.
- You want me to kill their enemies...
I'll kill their enemies.
Rebs or Sioux or Cheyenne...
For 500 bucks a month,
I'll kill whoever you want.
But keep one thing in mind...
I'd happily kill you for free.
ALGREN:
July 12th, 1876.
There is some comfort in the emptiness of the sea.
No past, no future.
And then at once, I am confronted by the hard truth of present circumstances.
I have been hired to help suppress the rebellion of yet another tribal leader.
Apparently, this is the only job for which I am suited.
I am beset by the ironies of my life.
[CHILDREN SCREAMING]
Yokohama Harbor, 1876
[CHATTERING]
- Uh, Captain Algren, I presume?
- Yes.
Jolly good. How do you do?
Simon Graham.
Twenty years ago, this was a sleepy little town.
Now look at it.
You see, the Emperor is mad for all things Western... and the Samurai believe it's changing too fast.
The ancient and the modern are at war for the soul of Japan.
So your new employer, Mr. Omura, is bringing in... every Western expert he can get.
Lawyers from France, engineers from
Germany, architects from Holland... and now, of course, warriors from America.
I came over with the British trade mission, oh, years ago.
I was soon relieved of my position.
I had an unfortunate tendency to tell the truth... in a country where no one ever says what they mean.
So now, I very accurately translate other people's lies.
For 2000 years, no emperor was even seen by a commoner.
You have to realize what an honor this is. It's all highly ritualized, of course.
You may look at him, but do not speak unless spoken to.
If he stands, you must bow.
If he bows, you must bow lower.
Do I look presentable?
I haven't worn this in a decade.
Rather snug around the midriff.
And bow.
The divine Emperor Meiji bids you welcome.
He is grateful for the assistance your country offers.
We hope to accomplish the same national harmony... you enjoy in your homeland.
[EMPEROR SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH] The Emperor is most interested in your American Indians... if you have fought against them in battle.
We have, Your Highness.
The red man is a brutal adversary.
[EMPEROR SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH] The Emperor wishes to ask Captain Algren... if it is true they wear eagle feathers... and paint their faces before going into battle... and that they have no fear.
They are very brave.
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH]
Bow.
Thank you very much.
GRAHAM:
And step back.
Step back, step back and turn.
Right, you little bastards!
You will stand up straight or I will personally shit-kick... every Far Eastern buttock that appears before my eyes!
[MEN CHATTERING]
Well done, sergeant.
When you understand the language, everything falls into place.
The first rank will kneel, rifles at the ready.
[SPEAKS JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH]
The second rank...
ALGREN:
July 22nd, 1876.
For six months' work, I am to receive three years of captain's pay...
teaching Orientals to soldier.
They are an army of conscripts.
Most of them are peasants who have never even seen a gun.
Fire!
They are led by General Hasegawa a man of small stature...
who nonetheless commands enormous respect.
What can the general tell me about this man, this Samurai, Katsumoto?
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
ALGREN: He seems to have great knowledge of Katsumoto
and his rebellion. I will count on his help when facing the Samurai.
Who supplies their weapons?
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
[IN ENGLISH]
Katsumoto no longer dishonors himself... by using firearms, you see.
He uses no firearms?
To those who honor the old ways,
Katsumoto is a hero.
How well does he know him?
The general and Katsumoto fought together for the Emperor.
He fought with the Samurai?
He is Samurai.
GRAHAM: You must understand.
Katsumoto pledged his sword... to defend the Emperor.
They say that a Samurai's sword is his soul.
They're paradoxical people, Samurai.
I've tried to write about them, but they keep to themselves.
The bastards are still wearing armor.
When the Irish were comporting themselves in loincloths... these chaps were the most sophisticated warriors on Earth.
I need information on their battle tactics.
I have several more books just waiting to be translated.
He'll be speaking the lingo in no time.
You should hear him blather on in Blackfoot.
Really?
A fellow linguist? Oh, capital!
Come on, sir.
A word or two in the savage tongue.
Just "hello" or "goodbye" or...
No, no, no!
"Cut his tongue out and boil him in oil."
Early day tomorrow, captain, darling.
- It's about bedtime, isn't it?
- I always had a fascination with scalping.
I never quite understood its technique.
Imagine someone who hates you with the utmost intensity... grabbing a handful of your hair while you're lying prostrate and helpless...
Ooh.
And scraping a dull blade of a rusty knife around your scalp... with a saw-like motion.
And let your imagination grasp, if you can, the effect of a strong, quick jerk... on the turf of your hair to release any clinging particles... would have on your nervous system.
[GUNSHOT]
And you'll have some idea of how it feels to be scalped...
Mr. Graham.
Mm.
[GUNSHOT]
How soon can you translate those books?
Right away.
I'm just delighted you're taking such an interest in Samurai.
I don't give a damn about the Samurai.
I want to know my enemy.
GRAHAM:
I shall not sleep until it is done.
Ah.
Sake.
I bid you good night.
GANT:
Can I get you anything, sir?
BAGLEY:
This is a punitive expedition, captain.
Col. Bagley, these people had nothing to do with the raids!
GANT:
Good night.

Katsumoto's attacked a rail road at the border of his province.
We cannot govern a country in which we cannot travel freely.
He must be stopped now.
My rail road is a priority for this country.
They're not ready.
The rebels don't have any rifles.
They're savages with bows and arrows.
Whose sole occupation for the last thousand years has been war.
You have superior firepower and a larger force.
I am ordering the regiment to move against Katsumoto.
You will track him down and engage him.
Load.
Mr. Graham!
Tell this man to fire at me!
- I beg your pardon?
- Tell this man... if he does not shoot me,
I will kill him!
- Captain, if I might have a word.

It's astonishing.
And Omura owns all of it?
As soon as he can get rid of the Samurai, he will, yes.
How do you intend to find Katsumoto?
ALGREN: Don't worry, Mr. Graham.
I assure you, he'll find us.
ALGREN:
Move into position!
Yoshino Province, 1876
1st Company, form a battle line on me!
Pay attention, it will save your life!
2nd Company, form on 1st Company.
3rd and 4th Company, form up behind.
Fill in on command!
- Where's Hasegawa?
- He refuses to fight against Katsumoto.
ALGREN: Cover down!
- Captain Algren.
We are not here as combatants.
- Then who's gonna lead them?
- Their own officers.
- Let's move to the rear.
- We'll be there presently.
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix bayonets!
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

Mr. Graham, accompany me to the rear.
Yes, of course.
Sergeant Gant, report to the rear and see to the disposition of the supply trains.

- I did indeed, sir!
Then you will obey it. Now!
No disrespect intended, sir, but shove it up your ass.

[IN ENGLISH] This temple was built by my family a thousand years ago.
My name is Katsumoto.
What is your name?
Are my words not correct?
I will practice my English with you... if you would honor me.
You kept me alive just to speak English?
Then what do you want?
To know my enemy.
I've seen what you do to your enemies.
Warriors in your country do not kill?
They don't out the heads off defeated, kneeling men.
General Hasegawa asked me to help him end his life.
A Samurai cannot stand the shame of defeat.
I was honored to cut off his head.
Many of our customs seem strange to you. The same is true of yours.
For example... not to introduce yourself is considered extremely rude, even among enemies.
Nathan Algren.
I am honored to meet you.
- I enjoyed this conversation in English.
- I have questions.
I have introduced myself.
You have introduced yourself.
This is a very good conversation.
- I have questions.
- They come later.
Who was the warrior in the red armor?
- My brother-in-law, Hirotaro.
- And the woman who cares for me?
My sister, Hirotaro's wife.
Her name is Taka.
I killed her husband?
It was a good death.

You fought against your Red Indians?
Yes.

- Why?
- Becauseâ.
We are both students of war.
Huh?
So... you were the general of your army?
No.
I was a captain.
This is a low rank?
- A middle rank.
- Uh-huh.
And who was your general?
Don't you have a rebellion to lead?
People in your country do not like conversation?
He was a lieutenant colonel.
His name was Custer.
I know this name.
He killed many warriors.
Oh, yes. Many warriors.
So he was a good general.
No. No, he wasn't a good general.
He was arrogant and foolhardy.
He got massacred because he took a battalion against 2000 angry Indians.
Two thousand Indians?
How many men for Custer?
Two hundred and eleven.
I like this General Custer.
He was a murderer who fell in love with his own legend.
And his troopers died for it.
I think this is a very good death.
Maybe you can have one like it someday.
If it is in my destiny.
- What do you want from me?
- What do you want for yourself?
What are you doing?
Why are we having these conversations?
What the hell am I doing here?
In spring-~ the snows will melt and the passes will open.
Until that time, you are here.
Good day, captain.
ALGREN:
1876.
Day unknown. Month unknown.
I continue to live among these unusual people.
I am their captive, in that I cannot escape.
Mostly, I'm treated with a kind of a mild neglect...
as if I were a stray dog or an unwelcome guest.
[MEN YELLING, GRUNTING]
Everyone is polite.
Everyone smiles and bows.
But beneath their courtesy,
I detect a deep reservoir of feeling.
[TAKA SPEAKS JAPANESE]
ALGREN:
They are an intriguing people.
From the moment they wake...
they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue.
I have never seen such discipline.
I am surprised to learn that the word
"Samurai" means "to serve
and that Katsumoto believes his rebellion to be...
in the service of the Emperor.

There must be some reason why he is here.
It is beyond my understanding.

This marks the longest I have stayed in one place since I left the farm at 17
There is so much here that I'll never understand
I have never been a church-going man...
and what I've seen on the field of battle...
has led me to question God's purpose.
But there is, indeed, something...
spiritual in this place.
And though it may forever be obscure to me...
I cannot but be aware of its power.
I do know it is here that I have known my first untroubled sleep in many years.

The perfect blossom is a rare thing.
You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.
Who sent those men to kill you?
I'm writing a poem about a dream I had.
The tiger's eyes are like my own
But he comes from across
A deep and troubled sea
Was it the Emperor?
Omura?
If the Emperor wishes my death, he has but to ask.
So it was Omura.
I'm having trouble finishing the poem.
- Can you suggest a last line?
- I'm not a writer.
Yet you have written many pages since you came here.
What else has she told you?
You have nightmares.
Every soldier has nightmares.
Only one who is ashamed of what he has done.
You have no idea what I have done.
[SPEAKS JAPANESE]

You have seen many things.
I have.
And you do not fear death, but sometimes you wish for it.
Is this not so?

- I, also.
It happens to men who have seen what we have seen.
And then I come to this place of my ancestors... and I remember.
Like these blossoms... we are all dying.
To know life in every breath... every cup of tea... every life we take.
The way of the warrior.
Life in every breath.
That is Bushido.

We leave tomorrow.

Including this particular item.
Two hundred rounds a minute.
And the new cartridges cut down on jamming.
I need a bath.
After living with those savages,
I can only imagine.
Welcome back, captain.
[IN JAPANESE] Katsumoto.
You rise against me, my teacher.
No, Highness.
I rise against your enemies.
They are my advisors, like you.
They advise in their own interest.
I need advisors who know the modern world.
If I am no use,
I will happily end my life.
No.
I need your voice in the council.
It is your voice we need, Highness.
You are a living god.
Do what you think is right.
I am a living god... as long as I do what they think is right.
What sad words you speak.
Forgive me for saying what a teacher must.
Have you forgotten your people?
Tell me what to do... my teacher.
[SPEAKS JAPANESE]
You are Emperor, my Lord, not me.
You must find the wisdom for all of us.
[IN ENGLISH]
Ah, gentlemen, come in.
Captain Algren, it seems you have endured your captivity... with little ill effect.
I was not ill-treated, sir.
Mr. Omura, I have here a draft of the arms agreement.
I'm eager to know how many Samurai have joined Katsumoto.
I'm afraid I don't know.
- You spent the winter at his encampment.
- As his prisoner.
Has he fortified his position?
Acquired firearms? Tell us what you saw.
As you said, colonel, they're savages with bows and arrows.
- Sir, about the...
- I'm sure your documents are in order.
Thank you. Leave them on my desk.
I'll address them at the appropriate time.
With all due respect, sir, our president's patience is wearing thin.
Perhaps there is someone else we should speak to.
With all due respect, ambassador... perhaps there is someone else we should speak to.
For instance, the French or the English.
Or any of the legations waiting in the next room.
Yes, well...
We should be looking forward to hearing from you.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Captain Algren.
Perhaps you and I might have a word in private. Please, sit down.
- May I offer you whiskey?
- No, thank you.
Katsumoto is an extraordinary man, is he not?
He's a tribal leader.
I've known many of them.
But none who are Samurai.
Their ways have great appeal.
- I don't see how this concerns me.
- Ah, but it does.
You see, you were right. Last year, we were not prepared to go to battle.
You were right, and Colonel Bagley was wrong.
But now, we are ready.
If Katsumoto is allowed to attract other Samurai to his cause... we will have 10 years of rebellion.
This is something I will not allow.
Either I'll stop him at the council today, or you'll lead my army against him.
And with these new weapons, you will crush him.
- I appreciate the offer.
- It is not an offer.
Mr. Omura, my contract with you was to train your army.
Then we will make a new contract... one that will recognize the extraordinary contribution... you've made to the Emperor.
Do we understand each other?
- Yes, we understand each other perfectly.
- Then I am pleased.
[IN JAPANESE] Follow him. If he goes anywhere near Katsumoto, kill him.
[IN ENGLISH] Captain Algren!
What in heaven's name is going on?
The diplomatic community is abuzz.
Omura has passed laws against the Samurai.
I need a drink.
Is your friend Katsumoto planning to go up against the council this afternoon?
[IN JAPANESE] You, Samurai!
Don't you know about the order?
[IN ENGLISH]
It's started.

Hey boy, are you listening?

We must resist the Western powers... by becoming powerful ourselves.
Our army, our economy, must be strong.
Minister, you honor us.
It is my honor to rejoin this council.
Perhaps you are unaware of the law against wearing swords?
I read every law carefully.
Yet you bring weapons into this chamber?
This chamber was protected by my sword when...
We need no protection.
We are a nation of laws.
We are a nation of whores, selling ourselves.
If we are whores, the Samurai made us this way.
I have not seen the Omura family giving gold to the masses.
Minister Katsumoto, it is with great regret... but I must ask you to remove your sword.
This sword serves the Emperor.
Only he can command me to remove it.
The Emperor's voice is too pure to be heard in this council.
Then, I must refuse to give up my sword.
Then regretfully, my guards will accompany you to your home in Tokyo.
There you will await our summons.
[KNOCKING]

I heard you were leaving.
Omura offers you my job, and you run away.
I suppose I should thank you.
$500 a month, including back pay for time spent... in captivity.
Enough to climb back inside a bottle for the rest of your life.
You're welcome.
Well, it is pretty much over.
Katsumoto's under arrest.
Omura won't let him last the night.
With him dead, we should have little trouble handling the rebellion... even without you.
Especially without you.

So you will take your own life... in shame?
Shame for a life of service?
Discipline? Compassion?
The way of the Samurai is not necessary anymore.
Necessary?
What could be more necessary?
I will die by the sword.
My own... or my enemy's.
Then let it be your enemy's.
Together, we will make the Emperor hear you.
[IN JAPANESE]
He was a good man.
Will you fight the white men, too?
If they come here, yes.
Why?
Because they come to destroy what I have come to love.
The way of Samurai is difficult for children.
He misses his father.
And he is angry... because I am the cause of that.
No. He is angry because he fears you will die as well.
My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
That is what he believed.
I would be afraid to die in battle.
So would I.
But you have been in many battles.
And I was always afraid.
I don't want you to go.
Algren.
They are coming.
[ALGREN IN ENGLISH]
I'd say two full regiments.
They'll come in waves of a thousand.
And they have the howitzers.
It makes no difference. They will come, and we will make our stand.
- How many men will we have?
- Maybe 500.
Like General Custer, huh?
There was once a battle at a place called Thermopylae.
Three hundred brave Greeks held off a Persian army of a million men.
A million. You understand this number?
I understand this number.
For two days the Greeks made them pay so dearly... the Persian army lost all taste for battle and were defeated soon after.
- What do you have in mind?
- Take away the advantage of their guns.
They're overconfident. We'll use that.
Lure them close.
Close enough for a sword.
You believe... a man can change his destiny?
I think a man does what he can... until his destiny is revealed to him.

And now we have rail roads and cannon, Western clothing.
But... we cannot forget who we are... or where we come from.

Nations, like men, it is sometimes said, have their own destiny.
As for the American captain...

But I like to think
he may have at last found some small measure of peace...

So what was in the mail?
"The New York and
Pennsylvania assemblies...
...are debating independence."
What about the middle colonies?
"In Chestertown, they burned the customs house...
...and tar and feathered two magistrates.
They died of... They died of burns."
Damn fools.
Who? The writers or the magistrates?
What does it say about the Continental Congress?
It says here they'll make a declaration of independence by July.
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.
He's 17, a year younger than I.
Well, the assembly's been convened, so I've been called to Charles Town.
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.
We leave in the morning.
Charlotte.
The children are here.
Thank you.
Aunt Charlotte!
Margaret, William, look at you.
Missed you.
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait until you see what I have.
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.
Keep an eye on these heathens, will you?
Sorry.
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.
She's still not talking?
No.
It does me good to see you.
Look, there's Gabriel.
Gabriel.
Hang King George!
Harry Burwell is here recruiting.
The governor has vowed if the assembly votes a single shilling...
...to the Continental Army, he'll dissolve the body.
Wouldn't that force our delegates in
Philadelphia to vote for independence?
Yes.
Send us off to war alongside
Massachusetts.
Get King George!
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!
That's enough.
Very well, children, inside.
Come along now. Inside now.
Burwell will be counting on your vote.
And he'll expect you to be the first to enlist.
Yes, I imagine so.
I'm sorry, the heathens are...
They have long needed a woman in their lives.
A mother.
Especially Susan.
My name is Peter Howard.
I lost most of my hearing and my left leg...
...fighting for the Crown in the French and Indian War.
And how did King George reward me?
He cuts off my other leg with his taxes.
Miss Howard, isn't it?
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.
I believe that was one of my younger brothers. Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.
It was you, and it turned my teeth black for a month.
- and send a message to King George he will never forget!
Our first order of business...
And our last, if we vote a levy!
Order, order!
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.
First, an address by Colonel
Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.
Colonel Burwell.
You all know why I'm here.
I'm not an orator.
And I would not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause.
I'm a soldier.
And we are at war.
From Philadelphia, we expect a declaration of independence.
8 of the 13 colonies have levied money...
...in support of a continental army.
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.
Massachusetts and Virginia may be at war...
...but South Carolina is not!
Hear, hear.
This is not a war for the independence of one or two colonies...
...but for the independence of one nation.
And what nation is that?
An American nation!
There is no such nation and to speak of one is treason.
We are citizens of an American nation.
And our rights are being threatened...
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.
Would you tell me, please,
Mr. Howard...
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?
An elected legislature can trample a man's rights as easily as a king can.
Captain Martin...
...I understood you to be a patriot.
If you mean by "patriot," am I angry about taxation without representation?
Well, yes, I am.
Should the American colonies govern themselves independently?
I believe they can. And they should.
But if you're asking me am I willing to go to war with England...
...then the answer is most definitely no.
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...
...during the Wilderness campaign?
I was intemperate in my youth.
Temperance can be a disguise for fear.
Mr. Middleton, I fought with Captain Martin...
...under Washington in the French and Indian War.
There's not a man in this room...
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.
There are alternatives to war.
We take our case before the king.
- We plead with him.
- We tried.
Well, then, we try again and again if necessary to avoid a war.
I was at Bunker Hill.
The British advanced three times.
We killed 700 at point-blank range and still they took the ground.
That is the measure of their resolve.
If your principles dictate independence...
...then war is the only way.
It is come to that.
Hear, hear.
I have seven children.
My wife is dead.
Now, who's to care for them if I go to war?
Wars are not fought only by childless men.
Granted.
But mark my words.
This war will be fought, not on the frontier...
...or on some distant battlefield...
...but amongst us.
Among our homes.
Our children will learn of it with their own eyes.
And the innocent will die with the rest of us.
I will not fight.
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...
...that will send others to fight in my stead.
And your principles?
I'm a parent. I haven't got the luxury of principles.
We must vote to levy!
28 to 12! The levy passed!
You intend to enlist without my permission?
Yes, I do.
Father, I thought you were a man of principle.
When you have a family of your own, perhaps you'll understand.
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.
He's as imprudent as his father was at his age.
Regrettably so.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Make him a clerk or quartermaster, something of that sort.
Good luck.
Dear Thomas:
Though many seasons have passed...
... it seems like only yesterday when we last saw each other in Charles Town.
With sadness, I learned of its recent fall to the British...
... under General Cornwallis.
I received a letter from Aunt Charlotte...
... saying she closed her home in Charles Town after the city fell...
... and moved to her plantation on the Santee.
Here in the north, our campaign has been marked by defeat and privation.
Our losses have been grievous.
My good friend, Peter Cuppin, fell at Elizabethtown.
His death has been difficult to bear.
We will march south with General Gates...
... to fight the Redcoats under Cornwallis.
Thank you, sir.
I envy you...
... your youth and distance from this cruel conflict of which I am a part.
"But I am fortunate to be serving the cause of Liberty.
And though I fear death...
...each day in prayer I reaffirm my willingness...
...to give my life in its service.
Pray for me.
But above all, pray for the cause.
Your loving brother, Gabriel."
What are you doing?
Turn around.
Not yet, Thomas.
When?
Seventeen.
That's two years.
It's already been two.
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.
All right. Seventeen.
All right.
Put it back, please.
Father?
What happened at Fort Wilderness?
Put it away.
- Throw it faster.
- You throw it faster. You're the one...
Margaret, you go get your brothers back up here right now.
Back to the house. Come on.
Back to the house now.
Come with me. Margaret, go now.
They're going to come.
Quiet. Sit down.
Six-pounders.
Lots of them.
How far away?
They're a long way off. They're most likely heading the other direction.
Put those in the house.
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?
Let's all stay close in to the house, all right?
We'll have to fight them off.
Won't Father do that?
They'll probably kill us men...
...and do Lord-knows-what to you women.
Nathan!
Slowly turn.
Father.
Abigale!
Water and bandages, fast.
The battle. Were you there?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
No, not yet.
Abigale, the children, please.
Children, come. Upstairs.
Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats.
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.
I was given these dispatches.
As I left, I saw the Virginia Regulars surrender.
The Dragoons rode into them.
Killed them all.
Over 200 men.
I have to get these dispatches to Hillsborough.
You can't ride.
I can't stay here!
It's not safe for...
Fire!
Fire!
Thank you for the care of His Majesty's soldiers.
Have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Winnsboro.
Yes, sir.
Fire the house and barns.
Let it be known if you harbor the enemy you will lose your home.
By order of King George...
...all slaves of the American colonies who fight for the Crown...
...will be granted their freedom with our victory.
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.
Then you're freedmen who will have the privilege...
...of fighting in the king's army.
Rebel dispatches, sir.
Who carried this?
Who carried this?!
I did, sir.
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.
They have nothing to do with the dispatches.
Take this one to Camden.
He is a spy.
Hang him, put his body on display.
He's a dispatch rider.
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.
Colonel, this is a uniformed dispatch rider carrying a marked case.
He cannot be held as a spy.
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.
- Colonel...
- Father!
Oh, I see. He's your son.
Perhaps you should've taught him something of loyalty.
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.
By the rules of war...
Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war?
Or perhaps your children would.
No lesson is necessary.
Sir.
What of the rebel wounded?
Kill them.
Father.
Father, do something!
Be quiet!
Gabriel, run!
Wait!
No!!
Stupid boy.
Captain.
Thomas!
Come, child.
I'm not leaving these children!
Mercy!
Get ready!
Present!
Fire!
All of you, stay here.
Nathan, Samuel.
Margaret.
Hide in the fields with William and Susan.
If we're not back by sunset, take them to Aunt Charlotte's.
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.
Boys.
It's a good spot.
Boys, listen to me.
I'll fire first.
Start with the officers and work your way down.
Can you tell the difference?
Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.
- Good.
Samuel, after your first shot, reload for Nathan.
Now...
...if anything should happen to me, drop your weapons.
Run as quickly as you can.
Get your brother and your sisters...
...and take them to
Aunt Charlotte's. Understood?
What did I say about shooting?
Aim small, miss small.
Aim small, miss small.
Boys...
...Samuel...
...steady.
Lord, make me fast and accurate.
Aim small, miss small.
Aim small, miss small.
Aim small, miss small.
- On the right!
- To the left!
Behind us! Up on the ridge!
Form right!
To the right!
About face!
On the right to the rear!
To the right!
Fire!
- Reload!
- Reload!
Behind you!
Look on the rear!
Lord...
...we pray that you accept this child...
...and keep him at your side with his mother.
We ask that you embrace him...
...and help us to understand the manner in which your mercy works.
And forgive us our sins.
This we ask in your name.
Amen.
Sir, we have the private the Cherokee scouts brought in.
Private?
Private.
Colonel William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.
What happened? Who did this?
Him.
It was mad.
I couldn't tell you who it was.
Calm down. Calm down, man.
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers are dead.
And I need to know how.
- He said there was...
- Were you there?
Then let him speak.
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?
I don't really remember how many.
Maybe one.
One man. Really?
He was in the flank.
All around us.
Amongst us.
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.
He just vanished.
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.
A ghost.
He was like a ghost.
Enough.
Bordon? Take a patrol.
Capture this ghost before word of his exploits spread.
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.
He was with the Loyalist Colonial
Militia. He might be of use.
Another colonial.
Captain Wilkins, where do your loyalties lie?
To king and country.
Why should I trust a man who'd betray his neighbors?
Those neighbors of mine who stand against England...
...deserve to die a traitor's death.
We'll see.
Mr. Martin!
Miss Charlotte!
You're safe now. Try to sleep.
Good night.
Good night.
Father?
Yes.
I killed those men.
You did what I told you to do.
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.
I'm glad I killed them.
I'm glad.
Get some rest.
Samuel.
You've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
I've done nothing.
And for that, I am ashamed.
We'll go to Saint Helena.
That's a free slave island just north of Charles Town.
Right under the British noses.
- They won't think of look...
- I'm joining up with them.
Gabriel.
No. Your place is here now.
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.
Your duty is to your family.
Don't you walk away from me, boy!
I'll find you when it's over.
No, I forbid you to go!
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!
Goodbye, Father.
Gabriel.
Thomas is dead.
How many more have to die before you'll heed my word?
I'm losing my family.
When will you be back, Father?
I don't know.
Tomorrow?
No, not tomorrow.
You say your prayers.
I will.
Take care of your brothers and sisters and your Aunt Charlotte.
I'm depending on you.
As I am on you, Samuel.
All right.
Susan...
...goodbye.
Thank you.
Halt!
Make ready!
Take aim!
Fire!
I'm not going back.
No, I didn't expect you would.
That Gates is a damn fool.
He spent too many years in the British army.
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats in open field. It's madness.
Halt!
Make ready!
Present!
Fire!
This battle was over before it began.
Retreat!
Retreat!
These rustics are so inept.
Nearly takes the honor out of victory.
Nearly.
Hello general, gentlemen.
A glorious day for His Majesty and England.
Colonel Tavington.
Always too early.
Always too eager for glory.
For victory, my lord.
I believe we took the field.
Next time, you'll wait for my command.
It appears that Colonel Tavington prefers to follow his own commands.
General O'Hara tells me...
...you've earned the nickname
"The Butcher" among the populous.
We'll discuss it tomorrow.
Gentlemen, my compliments.
- To a victory.
- Hear, hear.
Hold him firm.
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.
It's a lost cause.
Benjamin Martin.
I'm in no mood for a lecture.
Where's your General Gates now?
The last anyone saw, riding hard northeast...
...his staff 100 yards behind, trying to catch up.
So who's in command?
I am.
I think.
What are my orders?
We're a breath away from losing this war, Benjamin.
In the north, Washington is reeling from Morristown.
He's running and hiding from 12,000 Redcoats.
In the south, Cornwallis has broken our back.
Captured over 5000 of our troops when he took Charles Town.
And he destroyed the only army between him and New York.
Nothing will stop him from heading north to finish off Washington.
Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the south till the French arrive.
They've promised a fleet and 10,000 troops.
When?
Six months at the earliest.
You trust the French to keep their word?
Absolument.
Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.
French Seventh Light Foot.
He will help train the militia.
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.
You really expect to hold Cornwallis here using just militia?
Not me. You.
They're not soldiers, they're farmers.
They'd be better off letting the British march through.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't.
How many men does Cornwallis have?
8000 infantry.
Around 600 cavalry.
I'm giving you a field commission as a colonel.
Might I request that you transfer my son under my command?
Sir, no, I...
That's done.
Thank you.
Colonel, I've been a soldier for two years.
As a scout, horseman, marksman, scavenger.
- Is that so?
- I'd be of better use with Regulars.
Where'd you learn all that riding, shooting, scavenging?
My father taught me.
Teach you any humility?
He tried. It didn't take.
He also taught you every trail between here and Charles Town...
...which is why he transferred you.
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of...
We'll cover more ground if we split up.
Very well, corporal. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.
Corporal.
Be careful.
Yes, sir.
You have children?
French.
It skirts the mountain and then...
...extends down towards the headwater here...
...and right across to the far bank of the Ohio River.
It's 100,000 acres.
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.
You will be a country unto yourself.
His Majesty is most generous.
Though your service in this war more than warrants such a gift.
Yes, this is how His Majesty rewards those...
...who fight for him as gentlemen.
I dare to presume my own meager contributions will be rewarded one day.
You may presume too much.
His Majesty, like history, judges us by the outcome of the war...
...and the manner in which it was fought.
We serve the Crown, and we must conduct ourselves accordingly.
Surrendering troops will be given quarter.
These brutal tactics must stop!
Is it not enough that I have never lost a battle?
You serve me...
...and the manner in which you serve me reflects upon me!
I would've thought that a gentleman from a family as esteemed as yours...
...would understand that.
My late father squandered any esteem in which we were held...
...along with my inheritance.
I advance myself only through victory.
You advance yourself only through my good graces.
These Colonials are our brethren.
And when this conflict is over, we will re-establish commerce with them.
Do you understand, colonel?
Perfectly, my lord.
Reverend, with your permission,
I'd like to make an announcement.
Young man, this is a house of God.
I understand that, reverend.
I apologize.
The South Carolina Militia is being called up.
I'm here to enlist every man willing.
Son...
...we are here to pray...
...for the souls of those men hanging outside.
Yes, pray for them.
But honor them by taking up arms with us.
And bring more suffering to this town?
If King George can hang those men, he can hang any one of us.
Dan Scott...
...barely a week ago you railed for two hours about independence.
Mr. Hardwick, how many times have I heard you...
...speak of freedom at my father's table?
Half the men in this church, including you, Father...
...and you, reverend...
...are as ardent patriots as I.
Will you now, when you are needed most, stop at only words?
Is that the sort of men you are?
I ask only that you act upon the beliefs...
...of which you have so strongly spoken...
...and in which you so strongly believe.
Who's with us?
Mr. Howard.
Sir...
...may I have permission to write to Anne?
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.
You have permission...
...to write me.
Oh, write her.
Very well.
Thank you, sir.
Reverend?
A shepherd must tend his flock.
And, at times, fight off the wolves.
Are you sure this is the right place to recruit for a militia?
God save King George!
I think we came to the right place.
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.
But you can keep or sell me the muskets and gear of any Redcoat you kill.
They hanged my brother down in Acworth.
Every damned one of them Redcoats deserves to die.
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...
...I wouldn't make it through the first skirmish. No, sir.
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.
Occam! Get over here.
Ain't overly smart.
He's strong as a bull.
Can you write?
No, no, sir.
- Well, then, make your mark.
- Why?
I just signed him over to you.
If you're willing, make your mark.
That'll do.
I'll kill me some Redcoats.
I believe you would.
How old are you?
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.
John Billings.
I was hoping you'd turn up.
There's a story going around about 20 Redcoats...
...got killed by a ghost or some damn thing.
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.
Aren't you a little old to be believing in ghost stories?
How many did you get?
Twelve.
Good.
These men, they're not the sort we need.
They're exactly the sort we need.
They've fought this kind of war before.
What about me?
Am I one of that sort?
Hell, no.
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.
I want accuracy and precision.
Make ready!
Take aim!
Fire!
Dear Anne:
Our force continues to grow.
As long as we continue to fight, others will come to fight beside us.
I long to see you and speak to you.
I'm hopeful that our duties will bring me near you.
Until then, I am and will remain most affectionately yours.
Gabriel.
We surrender!
No! God, stop!
For the love of God, we...
These men were about to surrender!
Perhaps.
We will never know.
This is murder!
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats.
They've earned it.
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?
I know the difference between fighting...
Go back to church!
Quiet!
He's right.
Quarter will be given to British wounded and any who surrender.
They gave no quarter when they fired on a ship carrying my wife and daughters.
I watched from 200 yards off as they were burned alive.
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.
Who are you to give such an order?
I know what you did to my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.
We're militia.
This is not regular army.
Every man here is free to come and go as he pleases.
But while you're here...
...you will obey my command or I will have you shot.
- Damn dogs!
- Shoot the damn things!
- Stay that pistol.
- They won't let you near the wagon.
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.
Officers' uniforms.
What you think all this is worth?
It's the personal correspondence of Lord Cornwallis.
This is his journal.
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs and use the papers for musket wadding.
Eat the dogs?
Dog is a fine meal.
Good heavens.
I have some maps here for you.
Put them down over there.
Thank you.
Here. A proper musket for you.
I don't know about you, but I don't like the idea giving muskets to slaves.
Your sense of freedom is as pale as your skin.
Don't listen to them.
If we win this war, a lot of things will change.
What will change?
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.
But we'll have a chance to build a new world.
A world where all men are created equal under God.
Equal.
Sounds good.
I've just been in the mind of a genius.
Cornwallis knows more about warfare than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.
That's cheerful news.
His victories at Camden and
Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.
And he knows it, what's more.
Perhaps that's his weakness.
Sir?
Pride.
Pride's a weakness.
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.
Pride will do.
Finished, my lord.
I've taken it in at the back...
...added wider epaulets and looped gold braiding.
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.
It's really quite nice.
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.
Colonel Tavington, why, after six weeks...
...am I still attending a ball in South Carolina...
...when I should be attending balls in North Carolina?
First, the theft of my baggage...
...including my memoirs, on which I spent countless hours.
Then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charles Town burned.
If you can't protect our supply lines against militia...
...how do you intend doing so against the Regulars or the French?
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.
Colonel, they're militia.
They're farmers with pitchforks!
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid.
Made so by their commander, this ghost.
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.
You created this ghost, colonel.
Your brutality swelled his ranks.
Without them this ghost would've disappeared...
...and I'd be in North Carolina by now!
In my defense, my lord...
Oh, enough, enough!
A fine soldier you are, bested by a bedtime story.
Give me the horse blanket.
O'Hara, our supply ship appears to have arrived.
Yes, my lord, it has.
Then why am I still wearing this rag?
Your replacement wardrobe is aboard ship, but...
...Colonel Tavington thought it best to secure our arms and munitions first.
They are being unloaded.
You look good in that color.
It stinks.
Well, it's had a dead man in it.
The beasts took your dogs too?
Yes.
Fine animals.
A gift from His Majesty.
Dead now, for all I know.
Is there no decency?
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!
Mr. Howard.
I've come to call on Anne.
I've come to call on Anne!
Well, of course you call yourself a man.
Father, stop it. You heard him.
Well...
...call on her.
I'm nearly finished.
You needn't worry, Father.
Yeah, I know.
Bundling bags are a wonderful tradition. I don't mind in the least.
Be still.
Tea?
Please.
There.
Come, dear.
It's very good.
I'm pleased that you like it.
Peter.
Don't worry. I sew better than my mother did.
I hope so.
If you're just gonna stand there...
...why don't you read it for us?
I can't read.
I can.
"Take notice.
By order of General Washington and the Continental Congress...
...all bound slaves who give minimum one year service...
...in the Continental Army...
...will be granted freedom...
...and be paid a bounty of five shillings for each month of service."
Did you hear that?
First they'll free them, then they'll pay them.
Only another six months.
What will you do with freedom?
I made this for you.
Look after your mother.
You know, Peter...
...I can't pay you for this.
Benjamin, you pay me what you can, when you can.
I'm obliged.
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.
No, no, he's more like his mother.
Corporal!
Take your time. Dogs.
Sir.
This road is closed.
These wagons now belong to the Continental Army.
Ready arms!
By twos!
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.
This is the king's highway.
And I advise you and your men to make way.
Charge!
Fire!
Retreat!
Save yourselves!
Retreat!
Ambush! Ambush!
I have the count.
22 are dead.
18 wounded and 20 are missing.
I'm through.
He won't be the last to leave.
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.
- The French army is...
- To hell with you.
And to hell with the French army.
We don't need them.
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.
Father.
Men always buy you drinks because of what happened at Fort Wilderness.
Strangers know more about you than I do.
Tell me what happened.
Your mother asked me that question around about the time you were born.
I was drunk and foolish enough to answer it.
The French and the Cherokee had raided along the Blue Ridge.
The English settlers had sought refuge at Fort Charles.
By the time we got there, the fort was abandoned.
They'd left about a week before.
But what we found was...
Go on.
They'd killed all the settlers, the men.
With the women and...
...some of the children, they had...
We buried them all, what was left of them.
We caught up with them at Fort Wilderness.
We took our time.
We cut them apart slowly.
Piece by piece.
I can see their faces.
I can still hear their screams.
All but two. We let them live.
We sent the heads on a pallet...
...with the two that lived back to Fort Ambercon.
The eyes, tongues, fingers...
...we put in baskets.
Sent them down the Asheulot to the Cherokee.
Soon after, the Cherokee broke their treaty with the French.
That's how we justified it.
We were...
...heroes.
And men bought you drinks.
Not a day goes by where I don't ask
God's forgiveness for what I did.
Thomas was my brother, as well as your son.
You may not believe this, but I want satisfaction as much as you do.
But not at the expense of our cause.
There will be a time for revenge.
But until then, stay the course.
Your mother said that when
I'd get drunk or lose my temper.
She'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas.
I miss him.
The British got 18 of our men at Fort Carolina.
They'll be hung one at a time until they give up the rest of us.
Reverend...
...can you write a letter for me?
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.
But first let us pray.
My lord...
...there is a rider at the gates.
A civilian carrying a white flag.
I am occupied.
He has a pair of dogs with him.
Great Danes.
And dear Lord...
...protect us in this, our hour of need.
This we ask in the name of the Father, the Son...
And the Holy Ghost.
Wait here.
General Lord Cornwallis will be with you shortly.
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.
Come.
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well fed.
I thank you for that.
I'm afraid I don't know your name.
I'm a colonel in the Continental Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.
As you wish.
Please be seated.
Thank you.
Would you, as the initiating officer, care to begin?
I will, unless you'd like to claim aggrieved status.
Yes, I would like to claim aggrieved status.
Very well, sir. Proceed.
You have in your possession belongings of mine including clothing...
...furniture, personal effects of a non-military nature...
...which I'd like returned to me.
Indeed. I will do so as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Now we come to the matter of the specific targeting...
...of officers during engagements.
You must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field...
...must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
To your mind, what are appropriate levels of hostile attention?
Imagine the chaos that would follow...
...from leaderless armies having at each other.
There must be gentlemen in command to lead...
...and, where necessary, restrain their men.
Restrain them from, say, targeting civilians. Women, children and such.
That's a separate issue.
No. I consider them linked.
And as long as your soldiers attack civilians...
...I will order the shooting of officers at every engagement.
And my men are excellent marksmen.
Very well.
- Now, let us move on to...
- Prisoner exchange.
Sir?
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.
I do have 18 criminals under sentence of death...
...but I hold no prisoners of war.
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.
Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
My officers?
Sir.
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Below the tree line.
Their names and ranks?
They refused to give names. There are
9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors...
...and one fat colonel who called me...
...a cheeky fellow.
This is not the conduct of a gentleman.
If the conduct of your officers is the measure of a gentleman...
...I'll take that as a compliment.
Get my men.
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.
Thank you, sir.
Release the prisoners!
- What is this?
- Prisoner exchange.
He has 18 of our officers.
Who is he? I recognize him.
He's the commander of the militia.
- Your ghost.
- Stay that sword, colonel!
He rode in under a white flag for formal parley.
This is madness.
If you harm him, you condemn our officers.
With respect, sir, he's killed as many officers in the last two months.
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.
Has he not?
You!
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!
On that farm! That stupid little boy!
Did he die?
You know...
...it's an ugly business, doing one's duty.
But just occasionally...
...it's a real pleasure.
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.
Why wait?
Soon.
Move out!
But I still think it's imperative to push north.
One of our captured officers, my lord.
My reputation suffers because of your incompetence!
That man insults me!
Quite impressive for a farmer with a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?
I want you to find that man.
I want you to capture him.
The man has the loyalty of the people.
They protect him. Protect his family.
Protect the families of his men.
I can capture him for you.
But to do so requires the use of tactics that are somewhat...
What was the word your lordship used?
"Brutal," I think.
Go on.
I am prepared to do what is necessary.
I alone will assume the full mantle of responsibility for my actions...
...free of the chain of command...
...rendering you blameless.
However...
...if I do this...
...you and I both know that I can never return to England with honor.
What, I wonder, is to become of me?
When this war is over here in the Colonies...
...the new aristocracy...
...will be landowners.
Tell me about Ohio.
Make way.
As you were.
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles from Wakefield, on the Santee...
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?
Benjamin Martin.
He's the ghost.
What do you know about him?
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?
His wife's sister has a plantation.
It's not far.
Aunt Charlotte!
Wake up, someone's coming!
Get the boys.
Margaret, come quickly.
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.
Go.
Stay close.
This way.
Follow me.
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.
Margaret, quick!
Get down there! Fast!
Samuel, get down there fast!
Beneath the sill. There.
There's no one in the house.
They can't be far.
Search the outbuildings and the woods, quickly.
Prepare to fire the house.
Go.
This one's head of the house slaves.
Where are they hiding?
Keep looking!
They're here somewhere!
- Gabriel.
- Where's Father?
Torch the house!
To horse!
Come on! It's all right.
Susan, come here.
Charlotte!
They won't stop looking for us.
You'll be safe where we're taking you.
Father said it was a perfect place to hide.
How is he?
I don't know. I'm his son.
Where is Father?
Speaking for months now.
Speaking for months.
Why did he go?
He didn't want those mean men to find you, so he led them away.
He'll come see you as soon as he can.
I don't care. I hate him.
Susan, you don't hate him.
I hate him, and I hope he never comes back.
It's the children.
Abigale!
You're alive!
I know it's not much, but you can stay here with me.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
She spoke. Susan talked to you?
In full sentences.
As if she'd been speaking all along.
Damn, I wasn't there for it.
What did she say?
She said...
...that she loves you and misses you...
...but understands why you can't be with her.
My Lord, she said that.
Isn't that something?
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...
...killing whomever resists.
- Where?
- Seven homes along the Santee so far.
John.
John, this is not a time for vengeance.
This is a time for mourning.
John.
No!
Attend to your families.
One week furlough for all men.
Any man who does not return will not be thought a coward or uncommitted.
Father!
Papa!
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?
They're from good stock on their father's side.
Susan?
I see it. There it is. Look.
Look, Father.
I got it! I got it!
You got it.
I got it!
- Careful.
- I caught it.
- All the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.
Father, what changed you?
Are you sure I have?
Yes. You changed.
That's simple.
It was your mother.
A woman can have a strange effect on a man.
There were times...
...I had trouble breathing around your mother.
I know the feeling.
You once said...
...when I had a family of my own,
I'd understand.
You were right.
You're trying to tell me something.
- Apple?
- Thank you.
Congratulations.
Anne Patricia Howard...
...will you have this man to be your husband to live in marriage?
Will you love, comfort and honor him...
...for so long as you both shall live?
I will.
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have this woman to be your wife...
...to live together in the covenant of marriage?
Will you love, comfort and honor her as long as you both shall live?
I will.
Then by the power vested in me by our mutual faith...
...in the Lord, our God...
...I now pronounce you man and wife.
I'm sorry we didn't give you more warning.
It's fine.
I have something for you.
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.
It's beautiful.
Allow me.
It's the North Star.
That's the only star in the sky that never moves.
It's constant, unwavering.
A guide.
I'd be honored.
May I?
- If you must.
- I must.
May I sit with you?
It's a free country.
Or at least it will be.
I'm not my sister.
I know that.
Do you?
Yes, I do.
Very well, then.
Well?
Well what?
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.
Not soon enough.
I'm counting on you to make sure...
- I know.
- What?
- Say my prayers, take care of everyone.
- Couldn't have said it better.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, Susan.
Goodbye?
Just one word, that's all I want.
All right.
Papa!
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.
Please, Papa.
I'll say anything you want.
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything.
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.
I promise.
I'll come back.
I'll come back. You believe me?
You know, you make me very happy.
Just the three of us?
John Raskin did come by earlier.
He looked around, then he left.
He would've made four.
Four would have been better.
I got another two months to go before I get to twelve months.
Colonel.
Reverend.
Trust the French.
Yes, trust the French.
Where else do I get the opportunity to kill a few Redcoats?
Perhaps a few wounded ones when you are not looking.
Everyone must gather at the church.
Mr. Wilkins?
Colonel Tavington wishes to address the whole village.
This town has given aid to
Benjamin Martin and his rebels.
I wish to know his whereabouts.
So...
...anyone who comes forward...
...may be forgiven their treason.
Very well.
- You had your chance.
- Wait!
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!
In the marsh, by the old Spanish mission.
This man here?
- Yes.
- The Black Swamp, you say?
By the old Spanish mission.
Thank you very much.
Shut the doors.
But you said we'd be forgiven.
And indeed you may!
That's between you and God.
Be strong. We must.
I'll fire the town on your orders.
The town?
Burn the church.
There's no honor in this.
Didn't you say all those who stand against England...
...deserve to die a traitor's death?
Burn the church, captain.
Give me the torch.
The honor is found in the end, not the means.
This will be forgotten.
Bordon.
Anne!
Mrs. Howard?
Where is everybody?
They're not here.
Gabriel's gone.
To arms! To arms!
Father.
Just don't talk. Don't talk.
Father.
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.
I'll take care of you.
You'll be all right.
I'm sorry about Thomas.
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.
That was mine.
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.
Don't go. Gabriel, don't.
Oh, God help me. God help me.
Where is he?
I'll help you bury him.
I'll bury him.
My wife in Alexandria is with child.
My first.
I fight for that child.
Benjamin, nothing will replace your sons.
But if you come with us, you can justify their sacrifice.
Why?
Why do men feel they can justify death?
Is it arrogance or?
I have long feared...
...that my sins would return to visit me.
And the cost is more than I can bear.
Benjamin, we have a chance.
Greene and Dan Morgan are down from Virginia.
If we win this next battle, victory in the war is within our grasp.
Go, then.
Seek your victory.
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.
You matter to your men...
...and to others as well.
Your victories...
...and your losses...
...are shared by more than you know.
Stay with us.
Stay the course.
I have run my course.
You men will be leaving with us.
Prepare the baggage.
Jean.
You will be missed tomorrow, colonel.
- Missed, my lord?
- Your wound.
It's nothing, my lord.
I am, as ever, ready to serve.
Very well.
Make sure you do.
I stand on the eve of the greatest victory of my career. Don't fail me.
My efforts in no small measure have brought you here.
I grant you that small measure...
...in spite of your failure to deliver the ghost to me.
Thus far.
I will not tolerate a premature charge...
...born of your eagerness for glory.
Wait for my order.
Or you may abandon any hope of Ohio.
Tomorrow's battle can alter the course of the war.
General Greene, what exactly is the task before us?
Gentlemen,
Cornwallis has us cornered.
Not only does he outnumber us...
...but nearly half of our force is militia.
Unreliable, at best.
Excuse me, sir.
You underestimate our militia.
All of you do.
We've seen our militia lines break time and again.
Kips Bay, Princeton.
But the British have seen that too.
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that he has no respect for the militia.
What are you suggesting, Ben?
I'm suggesting we use that.
I know you men have sacrificed a lot so far.
But all I'm asking is that you...
...let the front line of the militia fire two shots tomorrow.
A lot can happen in the time it takes to fire two shots.
Especially against British Regulars.
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you to fire three.
If I die, I will die well dressed.
Fire!
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!
Harry...
...will you give this to my children?
Thank you.
It's October now.
I know.
It's more than 12 months.
You're a free man.
I'm here now on my own accord.
I'm honored to have you with us.
Honored.
Shoulder arms!
Forward...
...march!
How old were your daughters?
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.
They had green eyes.
I'm sure they were lovely.
Yes, they were.
- Battalion!
- Company!
March!
Fire!
Unless I'm dreaming...
...I believe I see militia forming at their center.
Battalion, halt!
Dress ranks!
Make ready!
Battalion!
Halt!
Take aim!
Fire!
Fire!
Hold the line!
- Prepare to charge!
- We haven't been given that order.
Charge!
Charge!
Tavington.
Damn him! Damn that man!
Make ready.
Take aim!
Fire!
Take aim!
Fire!
Retreat!
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes the glory from this field.
Charge!
Congratulations, my lord.
Infantry reserve into the center.
But you've taken the field.
Now we'll take their spirits.
Send the battalion over that hill and crush them.
It ends today.
Hold the charge!
Fire!
Hold the charge!
Fire!
Take aim!
Fire!
Charge!
Charge bayonets!
Halt!
Hold! Dress your ranks!
Fire!
Charge!
Retreat!
Colonel!
The line is faltering!
Retreat! Retreat!
Wait!
No retreat!
Hold the line!
Hold the line!
Push forward, men!
Artillery, concentrate on the center.
If we reform and wheel right, we may be able to turn their flank.
You dream, general.
Kill me before the war is over, will you?
It appears you are not...
...the better man.
You're right.
My sons were better men.
Sound the retreat.
Sound...
...retreat.
Dear Charlotte:
The war has turned.
General Cornwallis took flight with his army and moved north.
We continued to engage the British, and in the following months...
... Cornwallis entrenched himself at Yorktown, Virginia.
Washington escaped from the north...
... and surrounded Cornwallis, who could not retreat to the seas.
It was blocked off by our long-lost friends...
... who had finally arrived.
Vive la France.
Vive la libertÃ©.
My lord, I beseech you.
You must order the surrender.
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.
Peasants.
Everything will change.
Everything has changed.
Though he eventually surrendered...
... Cornwallis himself hid in shame...
... appointing his subordinate to relinquish his sword.
With the war ending, and our militia disbanding...
... I take measure of what we have lost...
... and what we have won.
My hope and prayer is that the sacrifices borne by so many...
... will spawn and fulfill the promise of our new nation.
Tell the children, and especially
Susan, that I will keep my promise...
... as I will be returning to you all soon.
Where will you go now?
Home. Start over.
Your wife's expecting a child, isn't she?
She gave birth to a son three weeks ago.
What'd you name him?
We named him Gabriel.
Thank you, Harry.
Gabriel is a good name for a farmer.
It is. It is.
Jean.
Ben.
Gabriel said if we won the war...
...we could build a whole new world.
Just figured we'd get started right here...
...with your home.
Sounds good.
Thank you.
Ma'am.

{8293}{8336}It's not our business.| You heard Rubio.
{8661}{8685}Come on, Lucas.
{8690}{8717}Let's get this over with.
{8744}{8771}We haven't got all day.
{8777}{8799}Sergeant Rubio!
{8807}{8839}Sergeant, sir!
{8846}{8883}Would you shut up already?
{8889}{8955}Sir, a group of men entered| the village.
{8962}{9006}There's something odd about them.
{9061}{9105}You should be finished by now.
{9123}{9176}-Why odd?|-They beat a man trying to escape.
{9180}{9224}Look, Vidal. Just cut it out.
{9298}{9325}Save it for later.
{9345}{9400}-But Sergeant...|-Back to work.
{9471}{9505}Don't do it.
{9512}{9585}He didn't understand me.| They're going to kill a civilian.
{9642}{9668}Private Vidal!
{9757}{9791}Shit.
{9851}{9890}World War III.
{9906}{9933}Vidal!
{9939}{9962}What are you doing?
{9971}{10020}You'll get us all in trouble.
{11829}{11856}Freeze!
{12597}{12640}Nobody move!
{12706}{12765}Get back against the wall!| Go on!

{13117}{13154}Are you stupid?

{13376}{13415}Go on, search them.
{13420}{13449}Balbuena, do it!
{13453}{13475}How?
{13480}{13510}See if they're armed.
{13519}{13552}Get the police.
{13563}{13592}Come on, shit!
{13655}{13707}You! Spread your feet!
{13712}{13764}Get back. Back!
{13825}{13852}Are you okay?
{13863}{13887}Are you?
{13932}{13959}Yes.
{14197}{14229}What happened?
{14362}{14400}There was nothing I could do.
{14600}{14623}Let's go.
{15017}{15084}Look me in the eye.| Show me who I'm talking to.
{15181}{15220}You want some water?
{15244}{15282}No, thank you, Lieutenant.
{15360}{15386}Lieutenant, sir.
{15544}{15585}Disciplinary action for
{15590}{15632}inappropriate intervention.
{15712}{15767}They think we're stupid.
{15888}{15919}Look, Vidal.
{15951}{16038}On the base, in action,| anywhere...
{16043}{16093}We have to look each other| in the eye.
{16103}{16136}We're a unit.
{16158}{16187}No exceptions.
{16201}{16240}Just want to do right, sir.
{16247}{16276}Do what right?
{16293}{16333}Be a good soldier.
{16350}{16373}Help these people.
{16382}{16416}Obey orders.
{16421}{16466}That's all you have to do.
{16474}{16502}Point number two:
{16508}{16545}your platoon.
{16553}{16592}They depend on you.
{16607}{16642}How will they take this?
{16647}{16669}Badly.
{16680}{16728}Your duty is to fit in.
{16738}{16775}I'm trying to, sir.
{16783}{16859}You're trying to stand out.| To be liked.
{16874}{16961}-I've been watching you.|-What if we'd saved those men?
{16991}{17019}Even one of them?
{17040}{17088}You endangered your platoon.
{17101}{17137}I know, I'm sorry.
{17167}{17193}So why are we here?
{17197}{17220}To work.
{17225}{17248}Sergeant.
{17286}{17345}You think things| should be done differently?
{17362}{17385}Your way?
{17408}{17449}I like the army, sir.
{17476}{17554}There's a place for everyone here.| But not individually.
{17566}{17590}Yes, Lieutenant.
{17603}{17648}I want my men tight.
{17677}{17701}Everyone happy,
{17708}{17740}everyone equal.
{17755}{17793}No social climbers.
{17849}{17883}I won't stand for them.
{17889}{17924}I'm not a social climber.
{18000}{18044}-Yes, sir.|-Dismissed.
{18226}{18283}The rules say| he should be sent home.
{18346}{18391}He disobeyed my order.
{18428}{18472}He's not going anywhere.
{18480}{18511}That's what he wants.
{18520}{18560}I'm not finished with him.
{18688}{18730}Hurry up, I'm hungry.
{18754}{18795}Vidal, help them load.
{18808}{18843}Yes, sir.
{18859}{18913}I'll just finish with this...
{18940}{18980}We're late because of you.
{18985}{19047}So drop the fucking stone| and let's go.
{19101}{19130}Yes, sir.
{19179}{19217}You asshole!
{19332}{19374}Stop it, damn it!
{19433}{19458}Stop it!
{19489}{19514}Stop it!
{19523}{19545}What the fuck?
{19971}{20001}What are you trying to prove?
{20086}{20122}Get in the truck.
{21046}{21073}Dear father...
{21079}{21119}Iâm still all right.
{21135}{21218}Iâm learning as l go.| l screwed up today.
{21283}{21358}I almost got sent home today.| l was lucky.
{21389}{21465}My problems arenât important here.
{21484}{21546}Iâm just trying to help| these poor people.
{21551}{21579}It isnât easy.
{21594}{21660}Theyâve been killing each other| the whole time.
{21697}{21752}We canât always save| the civilians.
{21758}{21861}But if we can manage to save one,| itâs worth it.
{21884}{21922}It doesnât always work.
{21958}{22052}At least l know Iâm trying to help| a country in need.
{22071}{22118}So near, yet living
{22123}{22202}in another age,| as if suspended in time.
{22562}{22593}Good morning.
{22602}{22702}We're leaving in 20 minutes.| Everyone get up. Come on.
{22707}{22785}What's up, Vidal?| Are you sleeping in?
{22789}{22884}-Shit, sir. We only slept 4 hours.|-More than me. Get up.
{22890}{22942}Ballesteros, |outside in 10 minutes.
{23156}{23246}-Had a fight with your girlfriend?|-Leave me alone.
{23251}{23323}Farm workers get to sleep later.| Right, Gomez?
{23397}{23479}SPANISH BASE AT ISTOK, KOSOVO
{23542}{23571}Platoon!
{23693}{23724}At ease.
{23794}{23833}Ten, hut!
{23883}{23907}About face!
{24036}{24068}Good morning.
{24122}{24169}Fall out and get in the vehicle.
{24175}{24233}Fall out!
{24646}{24676}Raise ramp!
{26172}{26211}Got a problem, Balbuena?
{26257}{26284}Did you hear me?
{26334}{26367}I can't hear anything.
{26376}{26414}Then stay alert.
{26455}{26500}Yes, sir.
{26556}{26609}Where'd you learn how to drive?
{26619}{26659}Fuck off.
{26691}{26788}I don't like your breath.| Could you stop breathing?
{27223}{27294}The damaged station is here.| In Ruica.
{27304}{27347}That's the exclusion zone.
{27375}{27449}There could be Serbian| paramilitary activity.
{27458}{27502}Intelligence says it's dormant.
{27507}{27542}There's nothing to fear.
{27571}{27654}We'll restore electricity and| make up for yesterday's mess.
{27659}{27693}That's what we'll do.
{27718}{27788}We should have left Vidal| at the base, sir.
{27800}{27832}For everyone's sake.
{27837}{27911}Vidal is just another member| of this platoon.
{27950}{28005}He receives no special treatment.
{28024}{28102}-You're right, sir.|-Don't patronize me.
{28107}{28191}I know you disagree,| so don't kiss my ass.
{28600}{28660}This is the list of those| who requested an advance.
{28703}{28734}You're all on it.
{28762}{28817}I don't know care how| you spend your money.
{28830}{28887}But I want this list| to remain intact.
{28904}{28967}-Understood?|-Yes, Lieutenant.
{28986}{29035}Understood by everyone?
{29043}{29087}Yes, Lieutenant!
{29416}{29501}Our job is to be ready at all times,| and that means now.
{29535}{29558}Excuse me, sir.
{29569}{29611}Are we headed for the border?
{29629}{29651}Yes.
{29671}{29737}To restore electricity| to an entire valley.
{29754}{29802}Not to be indiscreet, sir.
{29818}{29861}But many of us haven't slept.
{29871}{29925}Have you had your diapers changed?
{30031}{30057}And you, Vidal?
{30102}{30142}Remember our little chat?
{30160}{30192}Yes, Lieutenant.
{30199}{30236}What about it?
{30241}{30277}Put it into practice.
{30290}{30327}I already am, sir.
{30338}{30383}Nothing escapes me, Vidal.
{30411}{30434}I see everything.
{30459}{30504}I've got eyes in the back| of my head.
{30517}{30562}I can even see out my asshole.
{30585}{30618}It was an accident.
{30672}{30696}Shake his hand.
{31310}{31342}Sergeant, sir.
{31363}{31397}I want to apologize.
{31405}{31442}Don't fuck with me.
{31462}{31492}I'm serious.
{31511}{31539}I want to show that...
{31561}{31607}That you're not a total asshole?
{31612}{31638}Yes.
{31663}{31706}The lieutenant's right.
{31716}{31740}I know.
{31764}{31829}Even Ballesteros will end up| kissing your ass.
{31870}{31911}I hope not.
{32434}{32512}Balbuena, inform on our position.| We're entering the shadow zone.
{32597}{32655}The exclusion zone| lies beyond this town,
{32672}{32743}and behind that the Serbs| are going nuts.
{32748}{32828}Nowadays the military provides| ''crisis management''.
{32835}{32914}Like one company working| for another, called ''Europe''.
{33313}{33375}Balbuena, inform the base.| Last checkpoint, no news.
{34060}{34109}Stay left. Watch the civilians.
{34217}{34261}The last Serbs in the zone.
{34284}{34332}The Albanians burned everything.
{34594}{34628}Shouldn't they have an escort?
{34645}{34704}We're close to the border.
{34709}{34758}Only to the Italian checkpoint.
{35321}{35343}Son of a bitch!
{35520}{35544}Are you all right?
{35549}{35601}-I'm okay.|-Get down! inside, both of you!
{35752}{35808}It's all right.| They're only rocks.
{35815}{35871}-Who's throwing rocks?|-The Serbs.
{36323}{36400}Looks like that's it.| Clean this up.
{36419}{36447}All right, Gomez.
{36538}{36631}The Italians should escort them| to the fucking border!
{36786}{36828}The Spanish are terrified.
{36936}{37042}Theyâre all shitting themselves.
{37414}{37452}Now what?
{37608}{37665}Your fellow countrymen,| eh, Monica?
{37757}{37800}Just give me a machine gun...
{37885}{37927}Where the fuck are we?
{37943}{37975}Would you shut up?
{38012}{38084}Can't they throw rocks| at goats or something?
{38119}{38149}They're not my countrymen.
{38189}{38221}I'm Spanish.
{38236}{38272}But your parents are from here.
{38277}{38299}So what?
{38314}{38356}I'm not talking to you.
{38400}{38441}We're here to protect them.
{38451}{38485}To protect who?
{38499}{38543}The Serbs or the Albanians?
{38560}{38587}Everybody.
{38598}{38633}Maybe they don't know that.
{38642}{38694}That's why you're here.| To translate.
{38704}{38727}That's enough.
{38768}{38825}I'm doing my fucking job.
{38838}{38906}So am I. I came to have fun,| and this fucking sucks.
{39019}{39045}How's that going?
{39094}{39122}Fine, Sergeant.
{39760}{39820}They're Albanians.| Why are they here?
{39837}{39871}Stop!
{39883}{39922}Stop!
{40431}{40476}Monica, come with me.
{40528}{40566}Are we there yet, sir?
{42464}{42508}Stay put and be alert.
{43647}{43671}What's going on?
{43679}{43701}Get inside.
{43706}{43757}One zero November,| come in.
{43762}{43794}Over.
{43799}{43832}Stay alert.
{43843}{43906}Grab your rifles and get outside.
{45300}{45327}Disarm them.
{45350}{45372}Disarm them!
{45829}{45859}Drop your weapons!
{46276}{46302}Come on!
{46491}{46513}Retreat!
{46617}{46652}Go on!
{46668}{46718}-Are you okay?|-Get going!
{46962}{47007}-We left the lieutenant!|-Shut up!
{47086}{47109}We have to help the lieutenant.
{47114}{47147}Stay still, Vidal!
{47397}{47425}Close it!
{47437}{47464}What the fuck?
{47629}{47655}Come on, get in!
{47686}{47729}Fire at will! We're leaving!
{47734}{47763}Back it up!
{48087}{48132}We left the French behind!
{48149}{48195}No, we're leaving!
{48200}{48222}God!
{48549}{48595}I can't see anything, sir.
{48659}{48683}They shot Gomez!
{49020}{49084}-We're going to die!|-Calm down!
{49089}{49179}We're getting out of here.| One by one, out the back.
{49186}{49237}If we go out they'll kill us.
{49388}{49433}Help me with Gomez.
{49474}{49502}Ballesteros!
{49522}{49578}Get Gomez out.| Come on, Balbuena!
{49734}{49755}Up there.
{49890}{49924}Come on, quickly!
{50452}{50500}-Come on! Jump!|-I can't!
{50558}{50585}Get down!
{50802}{50828}Come on, Gomez.
{50995}{51026}Run!
{51211}{51272}Come on, Lieutenant!
{53998}{54029}Where's Gomez?
{54713}{54747}Sergeant.
{54794}{54818}Can you walk?
{54862}{54887}Yes.
{54955}{54996}Check weapons and ammo.
{55060}{55094}Rifle, two magazines.
{55130}{55156}Rifle, one magazine.
{55271}{55296}Let's go!
{55320}{55367}Let's get the fuck out of here.
{55610}{55643}Come on, Lucas!
{56159}{56182}Careful.
{56187}{56223}Vidal. Balbuena.
{56559}{56591}Get down.
{56848}{56917}-I need a tourniquet.|-Come on, Lucas.
{57218}{57257}Not so tight!
{57300}{57332}Not so tight.
{57401}{57425}That's better.
{57879}{57920}Off the road!| Take cover in the trees!
{57929}{57986}Come on, run!
{57992}{58014}Everyone.
{58423}{58452}Don't move!
{58463}{58486}Mines!
{59820}{59860}Bastards!
{61017}{61081}Let go of me! Don't touch me!
{61086}{61113}Don't touch me.
{61262}{61300}There's nothing you can do| for her.
{62117}{62141}They left.
{62148}{62225}We'll have to follow the road| to a safe place.
{62574}{62646}They weren't after us.| Why did you fire?
{62661}{62688}Shut up.
{62693}{62736}This is all your fault.
{63455}{63508}We have to get back to the road.
{63517}{63561}The field's full of mines.
{63593}{63672}It may be a trap.| They could be waiting for us.
{63693}{63727}Lieutenant...
{63754}{63781}We can't stay here.
{63897}{63920}Lieutenant...
{64059}{64081}Lieutenant.
{64103}{64136}I'm okay.
{64432}{64465}What did he say?
{64721}{64759}Eight kilometers.
{64776}{64821}The town's 8 kilometers away.
{64858}{64893}I'm not climbing.
{64898}{64956}We have to go back to the road| and wait.
{64962}{64994}That's enough.
{65005}{65056}Shut the fuck up already.
{65081}{65112}Let me think.
{65162}{65199}The French guy's right.
{65229}{65284}We have to get to the town| and report back.
{65304}{65347}You have to decide, sir.
{65408}{65438}What about Monica?
{65442}{65464}Forget her.
{65486}{65537}There's nothing we can do for her.
{65734}{65780}We have to get out of here.
{65785}{65824}The sergeant's losing blood.
{65892}{65927}We have to get Monica.
{65938}{65963}Vidal's right.
{66004}{66031}I won't leave anyone behind.
{66038}{66068}We can't carry two.
{66073}{66095}See how she's doing.
{66107}{66131}I'll go.
{66138}{66161}Not you.
{66185}{66208}I won't risk
{66212}{66254}my life for a dead girl.
{66287}{66320}We're fucking up.
{66329}{66372}This makes no sense.
{66547}{66575}Vidal will go.
{66746}{66784}Go see how she is.
{66807}{66851}If she's alive, bring her.
{66875}{66910}If not...
{66947}{66973}Go on.
{67022}{67047}Yes, Lieutenant.
{67517}{67596}We have to follow procedure.|Otherwise we're lost.
{73772}{73809}Let's stop a while.
{73909}{73937}Ballesteros.
{73962}{74000}Check Rubio's foot.
{74104}{74128}Vidal,
{74144}{74190}Balbuena, secure the perimeter.
{74212}{74252}We've had enough surprises.
{74383}{74407}You hear me?
{75192}{75240}Sorry I acted that way.
{75305}{75342}I can't stop thinking about her.
{75383}{75416}Neither can I.
{75475}{75508}Was she dead?
{75569}{75596}Worse.
{75603}{75637}What do you mean?
{75713}{75760}Let's just stick together.
{75848}{75902}The lieutenant is clueless.
{75946}{75973}He'll get us killed.
{75982}{76030}Stop fucking around, Ballesteros.
{76043}{76072}You should take charge.
{76157}{76194}My sister doesn't even know| I'm here.
{76208}{76239}Nobody knows we're here.
{76261}{76287}That's what I mean.
{76389}{76412}Why not?
{76833}{76862}Help me with this.
{78890}{78930}The town's right there.
{78953}{79017}About 5 kilometers downhill.
{79044}{79087}What if the guerrillas| are down there?
{79092}{79116}Ballesteros...
{79175}{79232}We don't even know which side| of the border we're on.
{79237}{79271}We're useless here.
{79291}{79329}Who put you in charge?
{79706}{79738}Lieutenant,
{79746}{79821}going down there| could endanger the platoon.
{80458}{80489}Lieutenant...
{80575}{80608}Say something.
{80695}{80749}You're learning to make| eye-contact.
{80801}{80838}That's how I know who you are.
{83596}{83627}Stay together.
{83651}{83679}Remember, we're neutral.
{83692}{83729}No funny stuff.
{84073}{84099}Don't shoot!
{84104}{84151}Vidal, Balbuena,| one on each side!
{84629}{84655}Take cover!
{84710}{84744}Get her out of there.
{84763}{84787}Are you okay?
{84794}{84841}Balbuena. You okay?
{85040}{85080}Lower your weapon!
{85094}{85170}Lower your weapon!| Lower your weapon!
{85175}{85206}Don't move!
{85255}{85327}Vidal, do as I say.| Lower your weapon.
{85352}{85392}Vidal, lower your weapon!
{85428}{85467}Lower your fucking weapon!
{85472}{85500}That's an order!
{85549}{85646}Let me go, you bastards!
{85703}{85781}Don't worry,| they won't do anything to us.
{88184}{88215}Don't worry.
{88277}{88311}It's okay.
{90738}{90785}You motherfucker.
{97986}{98014}Hold him down.
{99368}{99393}Sergeant.
{99467}{99503}I saw our BMR.
{99615}{99658}They're using it to invade| the town.
{99701}{99740}If we can get it back...
{99796}{99881}Wait till they stop killing.| We'll leave the way we came.
{100098}{100157}We're not leaving without| Alonso and Ballesteros.
{100259}{100287}No one gets left behind.
{101759}{101811}-Sergeant.|-Not now, Vidal.
{101832}{101884}Let them cool off.| And you, too.
{101970}{102010}We'll leave at dawn.
{104413}{104454}They'll kill us.
{104491}{104535}They just want our help.
{104542}{104566}We'll help them.
{104649}{104680}No one else gets killed.
{104700}{104721}Trust me.
{104775}{104849}Lucas, Gomez, Monica.
{104878}{104926}Where are the others?
{105013}{105094}I don't give a shit| whose electricity I restore.
{105114}{105174}I don't give a shit about this war.
{105225}{105252}I want to go home.
{105847}{105874}What did he say?
{106035}{106066}They'll let us go.
{106136}{106158}Come on.
{106252}{106291}This is still a mission.
{110702}{110729}Get out of the way!
{115414}{115439}Vidal.
{115624}{115656}Anyone see you?
{115710}{115733}I don't know.
{115847}{115869}What?
{115889}{115914}Nothing.
{116253}{116279}Let's go.
{117070}{117092}This way.
{117998}{118017}Get down!
{125200}{125230}Now what?
{125272}{125354}We'll get the BMR.| It's in there.
{125505}{125527}Let's go.
{127809}{127836}Stay calm.
{127924}{127953}It's fixed.
{128048}{128076}We're going home.
{128222}{128258}Listen to him.
{128271}{128294}Let's go.
{128470}{128498}Sergeant.
{128508}{128545}Tell Vidal to lower his gun.
{128554}{128584}We've completed the mission.
{128612}{128634}We're leaving.
{128945}{128971}That's it, Vidal.
{129061}{129083}It's over.
{129223}{129262}You did it.| Give me the gun.
{129394}{129437}Look me in the eye.
{129627}{129650}It's over.
{131114}{131163}What do I say if they ask me?
{131266}{131296}Nothing.

Charlie!
Watch out!
My hand!
Goddamn!
We're running out of ammo.
We gotta get out of here.
Move!
Come on!
Come on, you can do it! Come on!
We got nothin', Enders!
We're out of ammo!
Joe... Nobody else needs to die.
We can go! We can get outta here!
We got orders!
They told us to hold the position!
And that's what we're gonna do!
Get up, marine!
Hold the goddamn position!
Come on!
Get down!
Tommy.
Goddamn you!
Oh, no! No!
- Bill!
- I'm out.
Come on! Come on!
Goddamn you, Joe Enders.
No... No!
No!
Raise your right hand.
- I... State your full name...
- I, Ben Yahzee...
Do solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the US...
Against all enemies, foreign and domestic...
Jap Ha-Go. Who can give me the code word for "tank"?
Come on. You boys wanna be codetalkers.
Show me some brains. Think!
What do we call a tank?
Chay-da-gahi.
Tortoise. Good.
Artillery. Code word?
In code. Private Whitehorse.
Be-al-doh-tso-lani?
Very good.
Japanese Zero. Code word?
We can go! We can get outta here!
They told us to hold the position!
Nice day, huh?
Joe?
Joe.
Didn't hear a word, did you?
That's what happens to a man when he's talking to a beautiful woman.
It happens when you're not watching my lips, Joe.
Watch this.
You're a mess, Joe.
You're not fooling anybody.
No, Rita. He's a mess.
I'm getting better every day.
You got a perforated eardrum, Enders.
Your equilibrium's all screwy.
You can't go back to war if you can't stand up.
Let's go, marines. This war ain't gonna wait forever. Let's go.
Joe...
Why don't you just stay here, Joe?
Somebody's gotta keep the WAVES company.
Are you gonna help me or not?
Marked improvement.
And his left ear is the worse of the two?
It's... amazing.
TBY hasn't got the range of the TBX.
So you may need a relay to get your transmission to command post.
But what it really comes down to is speed and accuracy under pressure.
Transcribe now.
Victor, Victor. This is X-ray. Over.
Damn it! We got a unit under fire!
We're losing men.
I need this message decrypted.
"Request fire support. We have target at one-one-niner, Baker one-five. "
"Pillbox with heavy machine gun.
Fire at will. "
Beginner's luck.
You're up, mac.
- Corporal Enders reporting, sir.
- At ease.
You've done well as a marine, Corporal.
Better than you did as a civilian.
Stole a motorbike, crashed it.
Got kicked out of high school.
Assault and battery... on one Father Crispin O'Donnell?
A priest?
Assistant principal at Archbishop Keenan
High School, sir, and head disciplinarian.
Public-school boy myself.
Some minor problems in boot.
A commendation for valor in Shanghai.
And you made a hell of a stand on the Solomons.
Tough bit of business there, huh?
Pretty tough, sir.
But you're prepared to jump right back into it?
Yes, sir. Very much so.
Very much so.
Well...
The Japs have pretty much busted every code we've thrown at 'em, Corporal.
You men on the Solomons were lost to a broken code.
Tell me something. You ever run into any Indians on the Solomons?
- Indians, sir?
- Navajo, to be exact.
The Corps has developed a new code based on their language.
It's had quite an impact.
So much so the navy have decided to go to great lengths to protect it.
That's why you're here.
You're to pair with one of them, keep his ass safe.
Your job is to keep him alive so he can do his job.
Begging the major's pardon, but I believe
I'd best serve the Corps killing Japs, not baby-sitting some Indian.
Enders, we didn't pick your name out of a hat.
We need good marines.
That's why you're standing here.
Take a look.
It's a Navajo. Or it was.
Tortured to death by Japanese intelligence trying to bust our code.
Fortunately, he couldn't help them even if he wanted to.
- Sir?
- Man's a Navajo, not a codetalker.
Code's based on their language, but it is still a code.
Tojo would like nothing more than to catch a live one.
What I'm about to tell you, Corporal, cannot leave this room.
Under no circumstances can you allow your codetalker to fall into enemy hands.
Your mission is to protect the code... at all costs.
You understand me?
Yes, sir, I do.
Good.
Congratulations. You just made sergeant.
Keep those hands vertical.
Way to go, marine.
Fortino, take over.
Hey... That was you, right, sitting in front of the major's office?
Yeah. Listen, I'm Pete Henderson.
They call me Ox.
Not cos of my big muscles or anything.
I'm from Oxnard, California.
Just north of Hollywood a ways.
So you're with JASCO too, huh?
Hey, know where we might find
2nd Joint Assault Signal?
No fuckin' idea, mac.
Thanks. Thanks a bunch.
They've never seen so many Navajo.
Looks to me like you got to see a little action there.
Me too.
Jap sons of bitches shot me right in the ass.
You believe that shit?
I wasn't running or nothin'.
So, your duty with JASCO have anything to do with these Navajo radiomen?
I'm not at liberty to say.
I see you got a new stripe there. Me too.
So I'm guessing the orders you can't tell me are the same orders I can't tell you.
Hell of a thing, huh?
Ain't a democracy, Sergeant.
It's the marines.
Yeah.
They look pretty normal, I guess.
Expecting them to wear war paint?
Maybe we ought to go introduce ourselves. They look a little lost to me.
Henderson.
I wouldn't get too friendly.
How!
Just kiddin'. I'm Ox.
Whitehorse.
This is Yahzee. Ben.
- Next.
- Beautiful. Beautiful.
Close your eyes. It'll taste better.
Who's next?
Mind if I join you?
I'm Ben Yahzee.
Guess the Corps paired us up.
How you doin'?
You're blocking my view.
Oh, sorry.
What do they call this crap anyway?
Marines call it chow.
Well, there's a propaganda effort.
Sorry. You can have mine.
Shit.
What'd you say your name was again,
Private?
It's Yahzee. Ben Yahzee.
Hold this.
Shit.
I'm in for a couple more.
Tell him I say hello.
Pair of cowboys for Big E.
- Possible straight for the Greek.
- Possible thumb up the Greek's ass.
Oh, a pair of twos for the kid.
Lookin' good.
- Oh, come on!
- Now there's a bold move.
All right.
OK... Oh, another mess for the Sunshine State.
- What, are you mad at me?
- Just want your money.
Hey! Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.
- You shuffle that deck?
- I certainly did.
Nines bets. I'll raise it two bits.
Call.
We all got thumbs up our asses.
You won't for much longer. I got a buddy in Intel that says we ship out in a week.
I been hearing "next week" for a month.
I didn't know you knew anybody in Intelligence, Harri.
Next year'd be all right with me.
Gentlemen, read 'em and weep.
Look at that. Nines and fours.
Full boat, baby.
Cowboys over queens. Read 'em and die.
Oh, Jesus!
Ouch. Ouch.
- Fuck it. I'm out.
- Yeah. I'm gonna go write the missus.
God knows what a girl will do without reassurance.
Son of a bitch.
Hey, looks like we got a coupla seats opening up. You wanna come join us?
Are you serious?
What, Injun poker?
Hey, how do you boys do that again?
Card on the head, only fool can't see it is you.
You want to come on over, or what?
Cut me in.
I'm thinkin' Fiery Cross, high-low, hoggers OK, ace plays both ways...
Hey, don't let him scare you.
If you've ever played a high-low game, it's like any other. Waste of time and money.
Well, ante up... Chief.
How'd you know I was a chief?
You must've seen me showering with my war bonnet.
- Deal 'em up, deal 'em up.
- You know, we don't take wampum here.
Beautiful.
All right, then.
Orders finally came through.
We ship out tomorrow morning.
Destination: the island of Saipan, which is one of the stepping stones we gotta take on our road show to Tokyo.
It's of strategic importance that we capture this island.
We can get ourselves an advanced naval base and an airstrip to land and refuel B-29's and get our bombers within range of Tokyo.
Now, Saipan is Japanese soil, and there's 30,000 of 'em dug in.
They're gonna fight for every square inch, because it's their home, but we're gonna take it away from 'em!
Yeah! Kill me some Japs!
We're gonna be in front of the whole damn division.
We're gonna be the eyes and the ears.
We're gonna be sniffin' out enemy positions, coordinating the naval gunfire - exactly what we've been training to do for the last four months. All right?
Now, we got some new radiomen from headquarters.
There's a Private Whitehorse... and Yahzee... and a couple of sergeants,
Enders and Henderson, who, if I'm understanding these orders correctly, will be covering our Navajos' asses.
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!
...but I'm tellin' you, we'll be steppin' into our share of the shit nonetheless.
Any questions?
Sounds like you're dying.
These might help get rid of the taste.
Charlie and I, we both lost it on the boat ride from San Diego.
Not many bodies of water in Arizona.
Life Savers really helped.
You want a Life Saver?
What are you doin' here?
Just trying to help.
Not what I meant.
You mean what am I doing in this uniform?
It's my war too, Sergeant.
I'm fighting for my country, for my land, for my people.
Not your people I'm worried about.
Listen, Enders, I'm a codetalker.
It takes me two-and-a-half minutes to do what used to take an hour.
Now, somebody wearing a lot more stripes than you thinks that's worth something.
Remind me to time you when you got bullets flying over your head.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!
From the halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli
We will fight our country's battles
On the land and on the sea
First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marines
Hi.
How's that ear?
Not that you'd ever admit it, but if it starts aching, take a couple of those.
And call me in the morning.
You're not gonna be here in the morning, are you?
Shipping out without even buying me a drink.
Ought to be ashamed of yourself, hustling a... hustling marines.
What's your poison?
Jeez, might as well go all out.
I'll get a shot of something.
Rum.
Eddie, give me a shot of Bacardi.
Make that two.
May as well join me, huh?
- Why not?
- OK.
Thank you.
Well... to war.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Get those men spread out!
Charlie, come on, come on, come on!
Come on, keep up!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Come on!
- How am I doin'?
- You're good.
Let's go!
Stay on my ass.
I told you to stay on my ass!
- Stay low!
- Get out of there!
Go!
Get him outta there!
Get me outta here!
- Hold still, damn it!
- Get him outta there!
You sons of bitches!
Fortino! Cover me!
Whitehorse, get down!
Get down!
Pappas!
Corpsman!
Helmet goes on your head! Corpsman!
Take care of him.
Put a hand on this.
Tank! Tank! Tank!
You ready? Go! Go!
Harrigan, light it up!
Let's go, boys! Keep up the fight!
Are you hit? Are you hit?
You're OK. You're good, you're good.
- Are you OK, Chick?
- Still in the hunt, Gunny.
- Harri?
- You ain't gettin' rid of me that easy.
- Stay low!
- Nellie? Pappas?
Yeah, we're good.
Greek's predisposed to hyperventilate.
What?
I can't breathe when I get excited.
Goddamn! Must be hell on your gal!
Enders, get the navy on the horn and tell 'em to dig out those guns.
Target reference... dog one... right 700.
Elevation zero-five-zero.
Relay the damn coordinates!
Arizona! Arizona!
Target reference, dog one, south 700, elevation zero-five-zero.
Right 200!
Up 50. Fire for effect.
Let's go!
Move!
Harrigan!
Torch the box!
Kill him!
Goddamn it!
Shit.
Nellie. Take the satchel charge.
You hear me? Move!
You're gonna cover me, right?
I'll go with you. We flank left.
I'll cover you. Smoke and cover.
I can do this.
I can do this.
Smoke 'em up!
Cover up.
Shit!
Shit. Goddamn Nipponese touchdown!
Biscuits? How can you ruin biscuits?
You are a whiny son of a bitch right now, aren't you?
2200 hours in jungle hell - what does that make it on the East Coast?
How the fucking hell should I know?
Just seven...
It's 8am, Sunday morning.
I hope my side of the bed didn't get taken up Saturday night.
Nell, you'll give yourself an ulcer, you keep worrying about her.
Might get my ass sent back to Rhody, though.
There's plenty of dollies outside of Rhode Island, Nell. Many plenty.
- Well, there sure as shit ain't any here.
- Ain't that the truth.
That's cos they're all in Daytona Beach.
The most beautiful women in the world.
This one time, before the war,
I'm lyin' on the beach and this sweet little thing named Molly comes out the water.
She walks straight up to me and asks me if I'm hungry... cos she's havin' a weenie roast.
Shit! Damn.
Yeah, me and Molly, oh boy.
Now I'm on Saipan with this giant Zippo strapped to my back and I'm roastin' human beings.
Why I volunteered... beyond me.
Damn, I'm proud to be here.
My whole family's been in the Corps.
My old man, he's a lifer.
An ass-kicker on the land and on the sea.
Around the house too.
Maybe now he'll back off.
Pappas, I...
I want you to do me a favor.
If anything should happen to me, you make sure that my wife gets this.
I mean, she picked them out and all.
Don't talk like that, Nell.
You don't even joke about shit like that.
Now you put that ring back on.
You're goin' home.
Hey.
Don't thank me till you've tried it.
You missed mail call.
What the hell are they doin'?
I don't know.
They've been doin' it since sundown.
Sounds like some kind of prayer.
Maybe they know our orders.
Think you could do it, Joe?
Give it a rest, Henderson.
Give it a rest? I keep tryin', but...
I'm here to kill Japs, not marines.
What the hell you think you're doin', boy?
Getting on my uniform.
You know the difference between you and a Jap, Yahzee?
It's that uniform.
That's it.
See, I know you people.
I know what kind of slanty-eyed savage you are, boy.
You ought to be careful out here all alone.
No baby-sitter.
I might just take you for a Jap.
You gonna let me get dressed, Chick?
Or keep demonstrating what an ignorant fool you are?
How's that for an ignorant fool?
Go ahead, try again.
You gonna do somethin'?
Chick! Come on!
Get off me!
- You OK, Ben?
- Yeah.
Ben? Shit.
I thought he was a Jap. You know, killed some marine for that uniform.
Sure you did, Chick.
Damn Injun looks just like a Jap, don't he?
Look, I'm no damn Injun.
I'm Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.
But you do look like a Nip.
Next time you decide to take a bath,
Private, let me know, or I'll kick your ass.
Fuckin' shitbird.
Supposed to be with a baby-sitter all the time, I thought.
Out here huntin' salmon and shit.
That ceremony you saw last night?
It's called a protection ceremony.
Navajo believe, until a body's given a proper burial, the spirits stay near it.
Chindis - that's what we call evil spirits. Demons.
I haven't thought much about it since I was a kid.
Till I saw those dead bodies.
You telling me you saw ghosts, Private?
No, Sergeant. I'm telling you
I won't freeze up again.
Because your buddy smeared ash on your forehead?
That's right. Cos my buddy smeared ash on my forehead.
You ever see ghosts?
No more stupid questions today, Private.
That's an order.
Sounds beautiful.
You, uh, you self-taught?
My dad was always playing.
You know what they say: if you can't beat 'em...
No shit. My dad, he... he gave me this thing.
Used to call me the Pied Piper of the Pigs.
Used to bring 'em in for feeding with this little tune I played.
I know I ain't gonna get you to quit playin' that thing, so... like you just said, if you can't beat 'em...
I don't think it's gonna work.
Well, we ain't got much else to do out here. What the hell?
OK.
All right, you lead off. I'll follow you.
Dear Joe, how the hell are you?
Or, given that you're not much of a writer, should I not expect an answer?
The newspapers say our boys are doing great.
But I don't think the reporters have been to Kaneohe Bay Hospital.
I found a stray dog the other day on Waikiki.
I gave him a bath and took him in.
He reminded me of you - but cuter.
At least he keeps me warm at night.
I try not to think about you. About what might be happening over there.
But sometimes, when I'm lying in bed,
I can't keep myself from wondering where you are.
How you're doing.
What the hell you doin'?
Writing a letter to my son.
Forget your orders? No letters out.
Command don't want postmarks going to the reservation.
Hey! You hear me?
I thought that he might read 'em when I get home.
What's his name?
Your son.
It's George. George Washington.
George Washington Yahzee.
It's got a bit of a ring to it.
My wife wasn't so sure.
She's a little more traditional.
- Nice-looking family.
- Let's see, Yahz.
Yeah, that George, he's quite a character.
He's got a mind of his own.
Can I try one of those?
- You smoke?
- Not really.
- Dismount!
- Get out of the truck!
Let's go! Let's go!
- Follow me!
- Let's go!
- I'm hit!
- Yahzee!
Yahzee!
I'm hit!
Take it off! It burns!
You're not hit. Just shut up.
You're not hit.
- Spread out!
- Move!
- Where the hell are they comin' from?
- From us.
- What?
- They're not Jap guns.
- We're getting shot at by our own guys?
- We're supposed to be on road 04.
- Get the regiment on the horn.
- I can't!
- Tell 'em they're shelling...
- I can't! The radio's out. It's been hit.
- They're firing too short!
- The Japs gotta be way ahead of us.
Do somethin'.
Shit... Follow me!
- We're on the wrong fuckin' road!
- Goddamn it!
God.
Son of a bitch!
I got you, mac!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Corpsman!
Nellie!
Corpsman!
You were right, Joe.
I do look like a Nip.
What the hell are you talking about?
Putting on that Jap uniform. Trying to get one of their radios, call off our guns.
- That's stupid.
- Shut up. Let him talk.
- He's not goin' out there.
- You're not in charge here, Enders.
I got orders, Gunny.
He's my responsibility!
He's just a kid! You killed your own!
What's wrong with you?
You killed your own! Sons of bitches!
You killed your own!
- Sure you're up to this?
- Find out soon enough, sir.
- What the hell are you doin' there?
- I'm goin' with him.
If that's OK with you.
Give me the rifle.
Horyo-da.
It's Jap for prisoner.
Horyo-da.
Horyo-da.
All right, everybody be ready.
Horyo-da!
Now!
Hit me. Hit me.
Please don't hit me!
Yahzee!
Kill him!
Goddamn it, kill him!
Get on the radio!
Bowie White, Bowie White, this is Carson Red!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
You're shelling marines!
Sergeant!
Cease fire! Cease fire!
Add 325, fire for effect!
Redirect fire. Add 325, fire for effect.
Let's go!
Crank it up! Let's go!
Commence fire!
Fire!
Yeah!
Well, I'll be.
Colonel. Can I help you, sir?
I'm looking for Sergeant Enders.
Joseph F Enders.
Enders.
Yes, sir.
Report I read claims you went above and beyond.
Sir?
You've been recommended for commendation.
And I concur. But I don't see any point in you having to wait around for all those formalities to work themselves out.
Not when I got one of these handy.
Congratulations, Enders.
You saved a lot of marines.
I wasn't alone in that, sir. I couldn't have done it without Private Ben Yahzee.
Oh... Right.
The, uh, Indian.
Begging the colonel's pardon, he's a Navajo, of the Bitter Water People, born for the Towering House clan.
Of course. Navajo. Towering House clan.
You keep up the good work, Enders.
Send that to Nellie's wife.
You ever not miss mail call, Enders?
My mom says somebody takes the time to write a letter, you should read the letter.
Does she let you drink, your mother?
No. But she's not here.
- What is it?
- Well, it ain't Chianti, I'll tell you that.
It's rice wine. It's Jap sake.
But it does the trick.
How much of this crap do you have anyway?
You have a little trouble with that ear, don't you, Joe?
Ah, real problem's the inner ear.
It's anvils and stirrups and shit.
I'm a little out of balance.
You done good on that hill today, Yahzee.
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
I bet I surprised the shit out of you.
It was a noble thing that you did, Joe.
To give your Silver Star to Nellie's wife.
I don't give a shit about medals.
The first one they gave me...
I threw it into the ocean.
What'd you get that one for?
For not dyin'.
The 15 men who fought with me got decorated too. For dying.
So...
Lieutenant was killed the night before and... none of the sergeants even made it out of the landing craft, so... that left me in charge.
It was my first command.
Orders were to hold some shitty swamp marsh on the ass-end of nowhere.
And I did.
All of the men under my command... men who trusted me... who begged me to pull back... not one of them made it.
Just one stupid asshole.
And for that, they gave me the Silver Star.
What were their names?
It might be good to tell a story about 'em.
You know, who they were and what they were like.
What a magical pile of Navajo horseshit.
What the hell for?
To honor them.
Their memory.
You know, it wasn't your fault, Joe.
You were just followin' orders.
Yeah.
I'm a good fuckin' marine.
That's why they gave me this detail.
Yeah.
I'm a good fuckin' marine.
- Joe!
- What?
Goddamn you, Joe Enders!
Really.
It's all right.
Come on, Joe. I got you.
What the fuck?
I ain't that drunk, Yahzee.
You cut that horseshit out.
I'm gonna mix my daddy's strawberries in this Swedish concoction called yoghurt.
God willin', America will develop the taste.
What about you, Charlie? What's life got in store for you after this mess?
Sheep.
Sheep? As in Chick's girlfriend, sheep?
Charlie's family owns the biggest flock in the Four Corners area.
No shit?
- You a rich man, Whitehorse?
- We do OK.
Taxis. A whole stinkin' fleet of 'em.
That's how I'm making my millions.
And then I'm goin' back to the motherland.
I'm gonna build myself a villa on the cliffs of Santorini.
Ah, Santorini, my friends - that's living.
Sounds nice. What about you, Zee?
Thinkin' about teaching.
Ah, teaching. Bring a little something back to the reservation?
Actually, more interested in bringing some of the reservation back to the world.
Hoping to teach college.
American history.
Oh, that's just what we need.
Yahzee teachin' college boys about
Custer's scalpin' at Little Bighorn.
And what about Kit Carson, and what they did to the Navajo in the Long Walk?
You ever read about that, Chick?
Didn't think so.
How about you, Joe?
- What?
- What are you doin' after this mess?
It's gotta end sometime.
Dear Joe, we got great news today.
President Roosevelt announced the end of blackouts on Hawaii.
We thought the day would never come.
There's still a ten o'clock curfew, but it doesn't matter to me.
After a 12-hour shift I'm too tired to do anything but write letters.
There is a real sense that the war is going well, and could be over soon.
I think about you more and more.
If you're alive or dead out there.
I check the mail every day, knowing there's going to be an answer.
Are you reading these, Joe?
Are you listening?
- We're secure on the left side.
- Area's secured.
Set up defense positions.
Chick, bed 'em down for the night.
Harri.
That's startin' to sound like something.
I didn't know you were an artist.
Oh, it's stupid.
It's just something I would do as a kid on my grandmother's kitchen table.
Well, it's nice.
You Catholic?
I used to be.
I was thinkin' about when they confirmed me.
I was eight, and they anointed me with the holy water.
And I remember... they told me I was a soldier of Christ.
I guess somewhere along the way
I must have switched units.
It's oil.
They don't use holy water to confirm.
They use oil.
I was raised Catholic too.
Mission school on the reservation.
It's funny. Fathers didn't like us talking Navajo at Mass.
Of course, one Sunday I forgot.
They punished me by tying me to the radiator in the basement.
For two days.
I think I was eight too.
Well, they're sure lettin' you talk Navajo now.
Yeah.
You know, when this is over, maybe you should come out to Navajo country.
Monument Valley is a beautiful place.
It's peaceful.
You know, we could do some things that you don't do in the Corps.
Like ride horses, eat fry bread, do some hunting...
Horses.
I don't know.
It's a pretty long drive to Arizona.
But it might be worth it.
You know, you could meet my son.
And he could meet Joe Enders, the guy who watched over Daddy's scrawny ass.
You must be a very good father, Ben.
Ben. You know, you've never called me that before.
Enders. What kind of name is that anyway?
It's Italian. Used to be Endrolfini before some asshole at Ellis Island got hold of it.
Captain needs to code a message back to command post.
You the Indian?
Yeah, I'm the Indian.
It's just a few minutes' drive.
We'll get you back in no time.
- I need to speak with you, Gunny.
- Yeah. Give me a second.
Got this with the mail today.
You ever had pickled herring?
I need out.
What the hell are you talkin' about?
This detail.
My duty.
I can't do it.
Well, I need you, Enders.
Yeah. You've been saving a lot of marines.
I'm requesting mast with battalion commander. I want out.
Oh, yeah? You and me and every other mother's son. We all want out.
Well, as long as there's a Tojo and a Hitler out there we have to keep on fighting.
Is that understood?
- You're not hearing me.
- I'm hearing you just fine.
Now, there's a war goin' on worldwide, and it ain't bein' waged on your wants and wishes.
Now you get some sack time.
That's an order.
Goddamn it! I can't do it!
I can't perform my duty!
Hey there, sweetheart.
Hi. It's OK.
You don't have to cry.
You're gonna be all right.
Got a present for you.
This is chocolate.
You see, you eat it... and it's good.
It's good.
You want some?
You'll have to chew it next time. Here.
Harrigan, go!
Incoming!
Run!
Go! Run!
Harrigan! Make her run!
Come on! To me!
Harrigan!
Come on, keep moving!
Fall back!
Help! Help!
I can't let 'em take us.
What are you talking about?
Enders!
I can't find Ox or Whitehorse.
Have you seen them?
He's over there.
Oh, shit...
This was supposed to be a secured area!
What happened?
I killed him.
You... you what?
I took my grenade and... and I threw it and I blew him up.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Yahzee!
Yahzee! Yahzee, no!
Get up!
Come on. You can do it.
- Yahzee.
- Let him go.
Yahzee, no.
Go on. Why can't... Come on. Do it.
- Do it!
- No.
You know, Whitehorse... he saved my bacon.
Wonder what George Armstrong Custer would make of that.
I remember my granddaddy sittin' on the porch talkin' about huntin' Indians, like he was talkin' about gophers or somethin'.
About gettin' paid three dollars per Comanche ear.
I know. Gets you thinkin'.
Another 50 years, who knows, we could be sittin' down with the Nipponese.
Drinkin' their sake, shootin' the shit... lookin' for somebody else's ass to kick.
You think too much.
First time I ever been accused of that.
Thought I told you not to go traipsing around on your own.
You know, Charlie blessed my son in the Navajo way the day he was born.
He wondered about cowboys watching Indians' backs.
Something about it didn't seem right.
I thought it was Charlie just being Charlie.
He didn't even want to come to this damn war. I talked him into it.
Maybe you made a mistake.
Maybe we all did.
I was following orders, Ben.
My orders were to protect the code.
If one of you got caught, talked, the code would be useless.
I was following orders, Ben.
Course you were, Joe.
You're a damn good fuckin' marine.
The Viking wants to see you.
He says right away.
I want you to brief everybody, make clear what's happenin'.
All right. Got no problem with point, Gunny.
- That's good.
- You wanted to see me?
Yeah.
The 8th is moving out already and we need to be ahead of 'em.
The destination is that big piece of rock you see over there.
The last defensible ridge on this island.
Now, thinkin' is, we take the mount,
Saipan is pretty much ours.
Yesterday, bombers beat the shit out of that rock.
The brass is nervous. They expected more resistance over there.
Now they want us to go over and check it out.
So where the hell they got us now?
Goin' up the mountain.
Have ourselves a little peek.
That codetalker is out front for a reason.
That's exactly where I need him to be.
If there's still a problem between the two of you,
I would like to straighten that out, right here, right now.
- No problem here, Gunny.
- That's good.
But there's still one here.
You just do what you're supposed to do, Sergeant.
Nothing more, nothing less.
Enders.
You got another letter.
Freeze!
Jesus Christ! We're in the middle of a goddamn minefield!
Chick's gonna get us out. Right, Chick?
Sure I am.
One line after Chick.
Pappas.
Pappas.
Move, Greek.
I'm gonna get my fuckin' balls blown off out here!
Yahzee! Stop!
Move out!
Yahzee!
Hey!
Nice shootin', Pap.
The 8th's movin' in.
We'd better check out the other side.
Got it. You all right?
Chick, take the left flank. Enders, go right. We'll cover you with a 30.
- On it.
- All right?
OK, let's go!
Move!
Hjelmstad!
- Help him up!
- Gunny!
Come on. Come on.
- Christ.
- Joe! Joe!
Tear him open.
You want morphine?
- You want morphine?
- Yeah.
You'll be all right, sir.
Goddamn it, Yahzee, get over here!
Fuck!
Chick... Stay with him.
I got ya.
I told you to stay with Gunny.
Gunny's gone.
We're not gonna make it out of here, are we, Joe?
I'm runnin' out of ammo here, Joe.
I don't wanna die in this shithole.
You're not gonna die.
Nobody else is gonna die.
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it out of here.
8th's caught out in the open.
We gotta call in the flyboys.
I'm gonna get that radio. Cover me.
He got the radio, Yahzee!
Cover me! I'm going!
Stay back!
Fuckers!
It won't bring your friends back.
What do you know about friends?
Get us some air support!
Bowie White, this is Carson Red, Arizona.
I say again, Carson Red, Arizona.
Coordinates!
Two-twenty, Mike, three-six.
All right, let's go.
We're gonna make it outta here.
Damn it, Joe.
Just get it over with.
Shut up, Ben.
Do it, Joe.
Do it!
No one else is gonna die, Ben.
No one else is dying.
Joe, we did it.
God...
God!
Oh, God... Oh, Joe...
We saved a lot of marines today.
Yeah, we did, Ben.
Charlie...
You know I didn't want to.
Right?
Hail... Hail Mary... full of grace... our... our Lord is with thee...
Holy Mary, mother of God... pray for us...
I got the last of 'em, Joe.
His name was Joe Enders... from South Philadelphia.
He was a fierce warrior.
A good marine.
If you ever tell a story about him,
George... say he was my friend.
Fegele. Fegele.
Ah. Ah.
Fegele?
Fegele?
Hmm.
Olive.
Drusilla.
Richard.
Susan.
Suzie.
For a black-eyed little Susan, eh?
What's this then?
America.
No.
England, dear.
Shall I have that?
Let me have that, shall I?
Uh, would you give it to me?
Can't I have it?
It's for her own good, mind, because it will only make her upset.
There. That's better then, Suzie.
Isn't it?
Nice and clean.
Where are you from?
Where is she from?
She don't know.
She can't speak.
Maybe she don't speak English.
She's a gypsy.
Gypsy.
Raggle-taggle gypsy.
Stop it!
Gypsies! Come and have a look at the gypsies.
All things bright and beautiful
All, all
Things.
All
Things.
"Tings"
"Tings"
Things.
Things. Things.
Bright.
Things
Br--
Bright and beautiful.
Bright.
Canish.
Canish.
No!
No more of that!
Now, you're in England now.
So you speak English, don't you?
They wouldn't let me speak Welsh, either.
But it did me the world of good... in the end.
You see, Suzie, you've got to learn to fit in.
Am laid
In earth
May my wrongs create
No trouble
No trouble in thy breast
Remember me
Remember me
But
Forget my fate
Nice, dear. Very nice.
But I'm afraid a nice voice is not quite enough.
You see, our girls are famous on the continent for their legs.
And other things.
- Why are you here, actually, dear?
- I want to go to America.
Ah, I see.
Another one.
Well, I suppose Paris is a step in the right direction.
And there's no harm in dreaming, dear.
I like a bit of ambition in my girls.
Which way?
Here.
We'll follow you.
I don't know where we're going. we should go out tonight.
I'll show you how to have fun.
Listen. Do you speak French?
Um, not really.
I can teach you some very important words which, you must know, are amour--
So you live all by yourself, you poor little duck.
Oh, this is, you know, not too bad.
There's plenty of room.
In Moscow there would be three families in here.
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving.
- What for?
- To go to America.
Suzie, you take my advice.
Buy yourself a nice dress... and you will find a rich man who will take you there, hmm?
I have a plan.
I will help you find little extra jobs.
What kind of jobs?
Oh, cabarets, parties.
Oh, Suzie, it's easy if you know the right people. And I will stay here with you, yes?
And we will share everything, everything. And... maybe we will have money left in our pocket at the end of the week.
It's a good idea, yes?
Hello.
- Something is missing.
- Like what?
Huh? The food.
My friends.
Even the cold.
This is nothing.
Winter was winter in Moscow.
But that's all finished with.
Forward.
Forward. We must always look forward.
Isn't that true, Suzie?
This is my father.
That's your father, yes.
Abramovitch.
But this is in Russian.
Why didn't you tell me before?
Suzie?
You don't understand Russian?
Abramovitch.
Ah.
So, he was a Jew.
Silence. Silence, everyone.
Please, mes amis.
Tonight we're lucky to have the guest star of Felix
Perlman's new opera company.
So please welcome Dante Dominio who has kindly agreed to sing something for us.
The best.
The best--
You are fantastic.
I just had to say that to you, that's all.
Ah, the girl with the horse.
Oh, yes, but I don't usually do that.
Oh, no?
No, no, no.
I'm a dancer, actually.
Ah, really?
Trained dancer.
Uh-huh. Where?
Uh, from Kirov.
So, you, uh, liked it, then?
Oh, yes!
You are--
You're sublime.
I can't imagine, myself, how it must be to-- to be on the stage at the same time as you.
You know, just somewhere in the background listening, in the chorus, for example.
Felix.
This, uh, young Russian lady... should come to your auditions.
And I have a friend.
She can sing.
Oh, is that so?
Say has a lovely voice.
La bella bambola.
She's very talented.
Eh?
So you sing too?
No. l-- A little, little bit, but I dance.
Suzie, there you are.
There.
Hold it! Hold everything.
Hold it.
Felix, you really want me to stand here?
Not over there, huh?
No, over there, Dante.
Here you block the entrance of the horse.
The horse?
It-- It looks good, Dante.
"It"? "It" looked good?
Felix, tell me.
Is this, uh, opera or a spectacle?
I see no contradiction.
Allora,
I put another way.
Do you want the public to look or to listen?
Both, Dante, both.
The eyes and the ears.
Ah.
It's opera for the people.
And the people need to be entertained.
I came to Paris to sing.
Strangely, I believe the public are coming to listen to me, not to look at scenery or horses.
But then what do I know, huh?
Mmm. I am just a foolish singer.
Hello.
Ecola.
La bella bambola.
Hey.
Mm-hmm. Lola.
Lola. Bellissima.
Now you are here, with us, huh?
Yes. Thank you very much.
Bellissimo.
Yes, it's a great, great aria.
You see, Verdi, he understands that... the voice can express the highest ideals for man-- his search for strength and glory... and beauty.
Madonna.
No, but what is it like to be a star, to have everybody looking at you all the time?
I was not always where I am now.
Really?
Oh, no.
When I was a child, we had nothing, nothing.
But that is incredible.
We were immigrants.
Allora, from the south of Italy to the north.
It was cold?
It is the people.
They look down on you if you come from the south.
How terrible.
And because we were poor, we all lived in one little room-- the whole family.
No. The whole family?
That must have been so difficult for you.
Come on.
No.
Did you see how he looked at me?
You see, Suzie, there are rules of how you get your man.
Rules? What rules?
Well, first, you must play hard to get.
If it is too easy, he loses interest. He must feel that he is, uh, a hunter, and you are a beautiful wild animal he is hunting.
It's a primitive instinct, you see.
Second, if you want to make a man want you, and only you, you must smile.
And you must listen.
You always listen.
Mmm. He needs attention.
Men, you see, they are very, very fragile.
And third, you must look good.
Very good.
Actually, that's probably the most important thing of all.
You know, without my looks,
I would never have got out of Russia.
Never. Will you tell me something frankly, Suzie?
Do you think...
I should get my hair bleached some more or should I leave it like this?
Hmm?
So what do you think explains the rise of Fascism in your country?
An artist must be above politics.
- Don't you agree, Felix?
- So they say.
But, you know, there has been "caos."
- Come se dice "caos"?
- Chaos.
Chaos. Chaos and confusion in my country.
Mussolini believes in order and organization.
He understands that the Italian people must regain back... their self-respect.
By putting on black shirts and marching up and down in one of those rallies?
Ah, you intellectual, huh?
For the working man, the rallies are about dignity and strength.
The lighting, the music, the choreography creates an atmosphere.
- Magnifico!
- Mussolini most certainly has a great sense of theater.
Certo. Certo, huh?
And everything he does, huh, is big.
Yes. Yes.
You could learn something,
Felix. He really knows how to reach his public, huh?
Felix, thank you very much.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Let's go.
They're just gypsies.
So you, uh, sleep here, hmm?
And your, uh, friend... sleeps over there?
Da.
This is, uh, how it was... for me.
Yes.
This is, uh, how it was.
My mother and a baby in one bed.
And my brothers and me in the other.
End to end.
The sacrifices my mother made for me.
But why?
Why did your little friend, huh, refuse my invitation?
It's here.
It's too big for you, the room?
Perhaps soon there'll be not two, not three, but four occupants in the residence.
Would you say that again,
Madame Goldstein?
So now I understand why you didn't seem like the other English girls.
Eat.
Thank you.
Isn't it gorgeous?
Did he buy that too?
Yes.
You would not believe some of the restaurants he has taken me to.
Oh, my God. You have never seen such luxury.
It's beauty, this one.
Don't touch.
Get back. Your hands, they're dirty.
It fits me like a glove.
He knows my size.
I won't tell you how he knows, but he knows it.
Les enfants.
Stop.
Please!
Thank you.
Is she yours?
All the children here are mine.
And all the old ones, my parents.
We are family.
We are one.
No?
When I am laid
Am laid in earth
May my wrongs create
No trouble
No trouble
In thy breast
Remember me
But
Forget my fate
Remember me
But
Forget my fate
Who is in the photo?
Darling, why are you looking at that? It's just a photo of her father.
Ah, so the little English girl has a secret.
She is not what she seems, huh?
According to the Poles, it was at about 6.:00... this morning that the first full-scale attacks began.
It's happened!
My God, it's happened like I knew it would!
What has happened?
Sit, sit, sit.
I got out in time, but... my father, he said he was too old to walk a step.
Madame Goldstein, what has happened?
Germany has invaded Poland.
Now...
England and France must declare war on Germany.
They can't just sit back and watch the Nazis grab any country they want.
But here they will never come, child.
It's the land in the east they want.
Don't worry.
We are safe here in Paris.
After all, this is the country where they wrote the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
Liberte, egalite, fraternite.
Now eat.
Why should we care what
Germany does in Poland?
I agree. They're always fighting about something over there.
Like it says here, "Who wants to die for Danzig?" Where the hell is Danzig anyway?
On the Baltic Sea.
Left of Russia.
Why should we care what Germany does at home?
They must have their reasons.
I agree.
It's none of our business.
But do you think they're right?
Do you think the Jews are really controlling everything?
Who do you think is controlling the money here in the theater?
I don't think
Monsieur Perlman is a Catholic.
That's it! Finished!
Finito! Chegazzo!
No more horses!
No more shit on the stage.
No more dirt in the theater.
Dante, please, don't take it personally.
The horse was not making a comment on your performance.
Be careful, Felix.
You need me for the success of your little project.
I think it would be more accurate to say that we need each other, Dante.
Non lo so. The people come and they pay.
I sing, they applaud.
You are just the ticket taker-- the man in the middle.
Thank you, Dante.
I take that as a compliment.
I could be singing... in any theater in Europe, but I agreed to sing in yours.
However, I do not recall a clause in my contract saying...
I was joining a circus-- a gypsy circus!
Fafangulo!
You gypsies should go back where you belong, huh?
You have no place in the world of the opera.
You understand me?
I talk to you.
His name is Cesar.
Allora, allora, she speaks.
La brunetta, huh?
But she speaks to them, but not to me.
Perhaps I do.
And why not?
- They are dirty.
- How would you be if you lived on the road?
Ah, well, but I don't.
I live in an apartment... with two bathrooms and beautiful furniture which I pay for with money I have earned.
Why do they live like that?
Because they are dirty, lazy thieves.
Because they don't want to work, to make something of themselves.
They live on the road because their homes were taken away.
They have nowhere else to go.
Allora, Lola.
Your little friend has become a gypsy lover.
I don't need you to fight for me.
I don't need any woman to fight for me.
I was fighting for myself.
And you say I am dirty.
You who are one of them, the gadges, the unclean.
No, no, I said--
Why are you accusing me?
I'm not one of them.
Then what are you?
Shh. Hush. Hush.
Oh, no more boring money problems.
I can't believe it.
He's a very kind man,
Suzie, hmm?
I thought you said you'd never move in with a man unless you were married.
I thought that was one of your rules.
Well, who says we won't get married?
He adores me.
Why do you criticize me all the time?
Don't you want me to be happy?
Don't you want me to look nice and eat well?
Why do you accuse?
You always accuse.
But I don't.
I haven't said a word.
No. You and your kind never do.
No!
What shall we do?
I don't know what to do.
The show can't go on.
There's nobody here.
You're here.
You look more beautiful than before, Suzie.
Why, thank you, Dante.
My mother was dark like you.
You, uh, have a good voice.
I... could help you.
But I don't need your help.
Why do you resist me, huh?
What do you see in men who have nothing, huh?
Hmm? l-- I like a girl with spirit.
That's why you could become... somebody.
Because you are a fighter like me, hmm?
Oh, we understand each other.
You have to fight to get somewhere... in this world, huh?
Maybe even fight... to kill.
If you are fighting to kill, you must be very, very sure you have God on your side.
Otherwise--
Otherwise what?
Otherwise, you are nothing more than a murderer.
Let me tell you something... about murderers.
It was the Jews... who killed Christ.
The Jews!
This crazy war... which is caused by a conspiracy of our bankers... is stealing my public.
I stand like a fool singing to an empty house.
You think you are better than me, huh?
Right?
You think that I am a peasant, an Italian peasant, and you are special.
You are chosen.
Well, let me remind you, nobody knows what you are.
Nobody needs to know, but you forget,
I know, and I can--
I agree, Signor Dominio.
No one needs to know and no one needs to tell.
Anyway, I came to tell you we're closing the production, which is sad for all of us.
- We're closing?
- Yes.
Half the population of Paris has already left the city.
- But my contract?
- It's meaningless. I have nothing left to give you.
I must tell you, if ltaly allies herself with Germany against France,
I'm afraid your position here as an ltalian in Paris will not be an enviable one.
Is that a threat?
A threat? From me?
The Germans are in northern
France, heading for Paris.
And my name is Perlman.
Oh, Maria, what do I have but my voice, the voice that you gave me?
I am nothing if I cannot sing.
Oh, Maria--
For the love of Italy, for the love of music, l-- l-- I beg you.
Let the Germans win.
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh.
Hello?
Allez, allez, allez, musique.
One has to admit these gypsies can play their instruments well.
Yes, but, uh, there is no control, no refinement, feeling.
Tell me, Dante. Are you going to sing for us tonight?
Oh, well, uh--
He sang for us last year, but perhaps now he feels that it is... beneath his dignity after such a huge success.
He sang in
Perlman's company.
Uh--
Dante Singing Opera
Hey, little Suzie.
You have found your place at last amongst the animals.
And you have found yours.
So you know the little girl, Dante?
Oh, she was one of the, uh, oddities employed by, uh, Perlman.
Is she one of them?
Though she is very friendly with the gypsies, she is not, uh, one herself.
No? Then what is she?
She is a Jew.
So many cameras.
So many uniforms.
Wherever I look, there's a lens. I can't get away from them.
Suzie, do you need anything, meat, butter--
Lola, what did you want to see me for?
Oh, Suzie, I missed you!
I miss the fun we had together in that, um, little room.
Now, Suzie, I wanted to tell you that... you should leave Paris.
It's not safe for you here.
What do you mean?
You should get out as soon as you can.
That's all. Believe me.
Suppose I could get some tickets.
Some boat tickets to America where you've always wanted to go.
I don't want to go there any more--
You do. Believe me.
You absolutely do want to go.
If you knew what--
If I knew what?
Look, actually, I've got the tickets right here in my bag.
There's one for you.
There's one for me.
One for you?
You're leaving Dante?
Uh, no, not exactly.
He hasn't thrown you out?
Don't be ridiculous.
I could have whatever I wanted.
No, it's just that he--
Well, men!
You can't trust them once they've got what they want.
I should have known.
It's dangerous to trust.
Well, actually, it's dangerous to love.
Isn't that so, Suzie?
Anyway, one should never look back.
One should never regret.
Never.
They're planning to round everyone up.
Every foreigner, every Jew.
Lola says I should leave immediately.
But I don't want to go.
If you want to survive, perhaps you've no choice.
Who is this?
That's my father.
A daughter should be with her father, if she's not with her husband.
Don't leave me, Cesar.
Please don't go.
It is not me who is leaving, Suzie. It is you.
But I don't want to run away.
For you, at this moment, running is good.
It is better to run and live than to stay and die.
It is not the same for me.
I am not alone.
I have my family.
I must fight for my family.
I could stay and fight with you.
You need to fight for yourself.
But you're all I have.
No.
You have your father.
If he's alive.
Maybe I've been chasing a ghost.
If he is a ghost, then he is watching over you.
And if he is not, then he is waiting for you.
To my Suzie, who will go to America to find her father... and sing.
To my Cesar, who will stay and fight for his family.
I only wish
I could be with you.
Sunday is gloomy
My hours are slumberless
Dearest, the shadows
I live with are numberless
Little white flowers
Will never awaken you
Not where the black coach of sorrow
Has taken you
Angels have no thought of ever
Returning you
Would they be angry
If I thought of joining you
Gloomy Sunday
Well, frankly, Suzie,
Joe... is a little older... than I like, but--
You know what?
He has promised to help me get to-- and you-- get to Hollywood.
You see? Things always turn out for the best.
Do they?
Your father, Suzie.
That will be nice for you to see him at last, yes?
Yes, perhaps.
Anyway, we have each other again.
We can have fun.
We can forget those little differences, can't we, Suzie?
Yes?
Dreaming
I was only
Dreaming
I wake and I find you
Asleep in the deep of my
Heart
Deep
Darling, I hope
That my dream
Never faltered you
Over there.
It looks like a woman.
Is she alive?
I think so.
You're all right now.
I'm pretty sure it's on the border with Russia.
Sit. Let me check the files from that region.
You know what?
You're lucky you have an English passport.
The quota from so many Eastern
European countries is full now.
You wouldn't believe the stories I've heard.
America is a big country, but not big enough to take all of us apparently.
But we should be able to trace someone who remembers him.
Abramovitch? Yes.
I think I know of this man.
Wait a minute. Isn't it the guy who lost his, uh, faith?
- That's the one.
- It has to be!
- What a voice.
- Please!
He said he had heard that the shtetl... where he had left his mother and his daughter had been burned to the ground.
Everyone perished.
Everyone!
Yes. Yes.
He said... he could no longer believe in a just God... and therefore could no longer sing.
It was a scandal.
Everybody talked about it.
Everybody. Everybody.
What happened to him?
He changed his name, along with his profession and went west.
A terrible thing.
The man was a Chazan, a religious man.
But he did well.
You must admit.
He did very well.
If you have a vision and you work hard like him, you can succeed over here.
Oh, yeah, sure.
All right.
Take this. Come with me.
Nice.
Excuse me. Do you know where
I could find Mr. Abrahams?
What do you want to see my boss for?
Well, he's my father.
Your father?
I think I'd better take you to our legal department.
Follow me.
I'd like to see my father.
That's all.
As you keep saying.
And if that's who he really is, then... you will see him.
But he's not well, you understand?
Not well at all.
His musicals have eaten him alive.
Frankly, he's worn himself out.
His family is very upset.
Very upset.
He has a family?
Fegele.
Daddy.
Fegele.
My little... bird.
Thou God, who reigneth over all the earth who art the Lord of all our salvation give your ear unto my prayer.
Allah!
For Thou art greater than the common man.
Everything is as you wish it.
Everything is as you will it.
If what we're doing is just... then give us the strength to serve you for that which I greatly feared has come upon me...
...and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
Form a line.

What are your orders, sir?
Sir!
Sound the retreat!
"My dear Jack..."
Oh...
I'm a fool.
I was a fool to think that I could ever go back home.
I can't.
Your friend needs help.
My friend knows how to help himself.
I can't see.
I can't see.
I can't see!
Oh! Don't!
Don't! Don't! Don't!
Who are you?
I have letters.
Oh...
Who are you?
I can't see. I can't see.
Shh.
I can't see.
Shh.
Shh. Shh...
Hello, Jack.
Ethne.
How are you?
I wanted to ask your advice,
General.
My advice?
Jack Durrance has... has asked me to marry him.
You don't need my advice.
Jack Durrance is a good man.
I haven't answered him yet.
I was wondering if you'd heard from Harry.
I've heard nothing and, uh...
I don't think
I shall hear from him again.
I should've listened.
I miss him.
My son loved Jack Durrance like a brother.
I know he'd want you to be happy.
A few more weeks and he'll be able to ride without help.
Will that be the end of your penance?
Jack.
Oh-ho-ho-ho.
Not bad.
You should see me on a camel.
Lavender... and onions.
Sunday lunch.
Take the horse to the stables and you can have some.
Thank you, Robert, it's quite all right.
It's me, Jack.
Tom.
They finally made you captain, Miss Willoughby.
All those decorations.
You must have a few, yourself.
How'd you know
I was visiting today? l, uh...
I saw Harry, Jack.
Where?
In the Sudan.
I was following our retreat.
We had a terrible time of it.
The enemy hounded us all the way.
The desert itself seemed to side with them.
We ran out of water, medical supplies... even had to leave stragglers behind.
Finally, our own native scouts turned on us.
We lost more men on that retreat than we did at the battle.
Get out!
Didn't you hear what I said?
I said get out or I'll have you whipped you filthy wog!
Like you had my friend whipped?
Harry?
I sent a man to warn you and you had him tortured for his pains.
I...
What would it have cost to listen?
I didn't know it was you.
You should've taken precautions,
Tom.
I didn't know it was you.
For God's sake, what are you doing here?
And afterwards?
He, uh... he asked me for some money and left.
To come back?
No.
No, there was a... there was a rumor going around that some of our surviving soldiers had been captured and taken to prison.
Harry thought Trench might be one of them.
He went after him?
I tried to stop him, Jack.
I told him they were only rumors that the chances of survival were... virtually none.
He wouldn't listen.
Did you come here to tell Ethne Harry was dead?
I don't know that he's dead,
Jack.
So you've come to give her hope?
What would you do in my place?
Keep it to myself, Tom, until I was sure.
What did he say?
Your friend is dead.
I saw Trench taken alive.
Prisoners were taken to Omdurman last month.
Your army abandoned them.
The shame is no longer yours.
You're responsible to yourself and to God not to them.
I am responsible to my friend.
I will find him.
You have learned nothing.
You've done enough.
It's never enough, Abou.
Look, if the Mahdi's men find out I'm British they'll take me to their prison.
It's the only way
I'll find my friend.
They will hang you.
Abou, you must help me get into the prison.
I will not be responsible for your death.
How could you be responsible for my death?
I will die if it is God's will.
Yes?
You English walk too proudly on the earth.
You are a fool...
...my friend.
Trench!
Trench!
Trench!
Trench!
Ibrahim!
Trench!
Don't lose our space!
Come on, son.
You mustn't fall.
You mustn't fall.
All right...
T-Trench.
Harry?
Harry... if you didn't come with the army, then who sent you?
You did.
All this way... for a feather.
I brought some money.
How much?
A hundred.
Hundred?
What's going on?
Who are those women?
They're all relatives of the men in here.
They bring them scraps of food.
Let's see if we can get you something to eat.
What can we do with this money?
Well, there's no chance of bribing Idris.
His entire family was wiped out by one of our artillery attacks.
Now, Hassan, on the other hand, is infinitely corruptible.
For 100 dirhams, he'll either help us escape... or he'll stab us in the back and keep the money.
I'll see if I can talk to him.
The first thing I do when I get back is book a table at Wilton's... a private room.
No bloody crowds.
Two pints of stout, please, guvner!
Ha! Not long now, Harry!
Not long now!
Trench.
Please, Trench, get up.
Trench, come on.
I have some money.
Money's no good for me.
I can't bribe the guards anymore.
I have nothing left to lose...
...nothing left to live for...
...but still, I'm frightened.
Fear always remains.
Pray for me, Abou.
Take as long as you like.
I don't walk too proudly now.
Stop.
Have some food.
You're looking better.
You may not feel it, but you look it.
When I get better, will I look as bad as you?
We'll get you through this,
Trench.
I don't want to get through this, Harry.
I don't think
I can take it anymore.
I had a visitor today.
He brought us a gift.
The poison will take a few hours to work.
You won't feel any pain.
That'll make a change.
Careful.
I didn't mean to be a pig about it.
How about we give them one last night of hell?
I'll drink to that!
Oh, Trench.
I can't feel anything in my legs.
The poison has paralyzed your body.
It'll wear off soon.
I thought it was supposed to kill me.
Only for a while.
You mean, you knew?
I couldn't be short-changed.
That's the last time
I let you buy the drink.
How many bullets?
One.
Better make it count.
No.
I can't carry him.
You can.
Save my friend.
Save my friend.
Look after your friend.
What will you do now?
Whatever God has chosen for me.
Do I look that bad?
Everyone said how... much you'd changed.
I didn't believe them.
May I have it back?
That isn't why I came.
I'd still like it back.
I'm almost sorry to let it go.
It's brought me a lot of luck... over these past few months.
Have you heard our news?
Yes.
How is Jack?
I think he's happy.
Good.
He deserves to be.
So do you.
It will pass.
You will meet someone soon.
Then you and her and Jack and I...
Yes.
...will set up tea and chat politely as if... as if nothing ever happened with us before.
That won't happen, Ethne.
It has to happen.
It has to because I love you...
Harry.
I love you and I can't...
I'm sorry.
Was that Ethne's carriage outside?
She is giving me a ride to the station.
Why didn't she come out?
I think she wanted to give us a minute or two alone.
Do we need a minute or two alone, Harry?
I came to thank you, Jack.
For what?
For standing by me.
If you're talking about the feathers
I wasn't there.
Willoughby told me you were.
You don't owe me anything,
Harry.
The wedding isn't for another month.
Ethne is free to make up her own mind.
She's made up her mind.
You should trust her judgment.
To Castleton and all the others we left behind.
Indeed.
You remember the first time we led a cavalry charge in public?
Yes, I do, Jack.
You wiped the floor with me.
I believe most of my horses ended up in the bandstand.
Yes, I did, and... yes, they did.
Ethne was there... watching.
Yes, I remember.
You should.
You're the only one she danced with.
I've never been so jealous.
I wanted to prove to her that I was the better soldier.
Well, you always were the better soldier, Jack.
Yes, of course, but...
She was the first person
I looked for in the crowd... and she was staring at you.
Everyone else was applauding me... and she was staring at you.
Nothing's changed.
She's beautiful... isn't she?
Yes, she is.
You may be lost... but you are not forgotten.
For those who have journeyed far to fight in foreign lands know that the soldier's greatest comfort is to have his friends close at hand.
Welcome home, Harry.
Thank you, sir.
In the heat of battle it ceases to be an idea for which we fight... or a flag.
Rather... we fight for the man on our left and we fight for the man on our right...
...and when armies have scattered and when the empires fall away... all that remains is the memory of those precious moments...
...we spent side by side.
Forgive me.
I did you a great wrong.
There is nothing to forgive.
Yes, there is.
I should've stood by you, Harry.
I should've understood.
I used to be so sure about everything.
We both were, Ethne.
And now?
And now...
Well... well, now I have no choice, Ethne.
God put you in my way.

Is this chart at a reasonable height for you?
Or do you want it lowered?
- Fine.
- All right.
Earlier tonight...
Let me first ask the TV.
Are you ready?
All set?
Let me hear your voice level, so it's the same.
- How's my voice level?
- That's fine.
Terrific.
Now, I remember exactly the sentence I left off on.
I remember how it started, and I was cut off in the middle.
You can fix it up.
I don't want to go back, because
I know exactly what I wanted to say.
- Go ahead!
- Okay.
Any military commander who is honest with himself...
...or with those he's speaking to will admit...
...that he has made mistakes in the application of military power.
He's killed people, unnecessarily.
His own troops or other troops.
Through mistakes, through errors of judgment.
A hundred, or thousands, or tens of thousands, maybe even 100,000.
But he hasn't destroyed nations.
And the conventional wisdom is...
...don't make the same mistake twice.
Learn from your mistakes.
And we all do. Maybe we make the same mistake three times...
...but hopefully not four or five.
There'll be no learning period with nuclear weapons.
Make one mistake and you're gonna destroy nations.
In my life, I've been part of wars.
Three years in the U.S. Army during World War II.
Seven years as secretary of defense during the Vietnam War.
Thirteen years at the World Bank.
Across the world.
At my age, 85...
...I'm at an age where I can look back...
...and derive some conclusions about my actions.
My rule has been, "try to learn. "
Try to understand what happened.
Develop the lessons and pass them on.
This is the secretary of defense of the United States, Robert McNamara.
His department absorbs 10 percent of the income of this country...
...and over half of every tax dollar.
His job has been called the toughest in Washington...
...and he is the most controversial figure that has ever held the job.
Walter Lippmann calls him both the best secretary of defense...
...and the first one to ever assert civilian control over the military.
His critics call him a "con man,"
"an IBM machine with legs"...
..."an arrogant dictator. "
Mr. Secretary, I've noticed in several cabinet offices...
...that little silver calendar thing there.
Can you explain that?
Yes, this was given by President Kennedy.
...24, 25, 26, 27, and finally 28, were the dates...
...when we literally look ed down the gun barrel into nuclear war.
Under a cloak of deceit...
...the Soviet Union introduced nuclear missiles...
...into Cuba...
...targeting 90 million Americans.
The CIA said the warheads had not been delivered yet.
They thought 20 were coming on a ship named the Poltava.
We mobilized 180,000 troops.
The first day's air attack was planned at 1080 sorties...
...a huge air attack.
Kennedy was trying to keep us out of war.
I was trying to help him keep us out of war.
And General Curtis LeMay, whom I served under...
...as a matter of fact, in World War II, was saying:
" Let's go in.
Let's totally destroy Cuba. "
On that critical Saturday,
October 27th...
...we had two Khrushchev messages in front of us.
One had come in Friday night, and it had been dictated...
...by a man who was either drunk, or under tremendous stress.
Basically, he said, " If you'll guarantee you won't invade Cuba...
...we'll take the missiles out. "
Then, before we could respond, we had a second message...
...that had been dictated by a bunch of hard-liners.
And it said, in effect, " If you attack...
...we're prepared...
...to confront you with masses of military power. "
So, what to do? We had the soft message and the hard message.
At the elbow of President Kennedy was Tommy Thompson...
...former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow.
He and Jane, his wife, had lived with
Khrushchev and his wife on occasion.
Tommy Thompson said,
" Mr. President...
...I urge you to respond to the soft message. "
The president said to Tommy,
"We can't. That'll get us nowhere. "
Tommy said,
" Mr. President, you're wrong. "
Now, that takes a lot of guts.
In Thompson's mind was this thought:
" Khrushchev's gotten himself in a hell of a fix. "
He would then think to himself,
" My God...
...if I can get out of this with a deal that I can say to the Russian people:
'Kennedy was going to destroy
Castro and I prevented it. "'
Thompson, knowing Khrushchev as he did, thought:
" Khrushchev will accept that. "
And Thompson was right.
That's what I call empathy.
We must try to put ourselves inside their skin...
...and look at us through their eyes...
...just to understand the thoughts...
...that lie behind their decisions and their actions.
Khrushchev's advisors were saying:
"There can be no deal...
...unless you somewhat reduce the pressure on us...
...when you ask us to reduce the pressure on you. "
Also, we had attempted to invade Cuba.
Well, with the Bay of Pigs. That undoubtedly influenced their thinking.
I think that's correct.
But more importantly, from a Cuban and a Russian point of view...
...they knew what, in a sense,
I really didn't know.
We had attempted to assassinate Castro...
...under Eisenhower and Kennedy, and later, under Johnson.
And in addition to that, major voices in the U.S. Were calling for invasion.
In the first message,
Khrushchev said this:
"We and you ought not pull on the ends of a rope...
...which you have tied the knots of war.
Because the more the two of us pull...
...the tighter the knot will be tied.
And then it will be necessary to cut that knot...
...and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you.
I have participated in two wars and know that war ends...
...when it has rolled through cities and villages...
...everywhere sowing death and destruction.
For such is the logic of war.
If people do not display wisdom...
...they will clash like blind moles...
...and then mutual annihilation will commence. "
I want to say, and this is very important:
At the end, we lucked out.
It was luck that prevented nuclear war.
We came that close to nuclear war at the end.
Rational individuals.
Kennedy was rational.
Khrushchev was rational.
Castro was rational.
Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies.
And that danger exists today.
The major lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis is this:
The indefinite combination of human fallibility...
...and nuclear weapons will destroy nations.
Is it right and proper...
...that today there are 7500 strategic offensive nuclear warheads...
...of which 2500 are on 15-minute alert...
...to be launched by the decision of one human being?
It wasn't until January, 1992...
...in a meeting chaired by Castro in Havana, Cuba...
...that I learned
162 nuclear warheads...
...including 90 tactical warheads...
...were on the island at the time in this critical moment of the crisis.
I couldn't believe what I was hearing...
...and Castro got very angry with me, because I said:
" Mr. President, let's stop this meeting.
This is totally new to me.
I'm not sure I got the translation right. "
Mr. President,
I have three questions.
Number one, did you know the nuclear warheads were there?
Number two, if you did...
...would you have recommended to Khrushchev...
...in the face of a U.S. Attack, that he use them?
Three, if he had used them, what would've happened to Cuba?
He said, "One,
I knew they were there.
Two, I would not have recommended to Khrushchev.
I did recommend to Khrushchev they be used.
Three, what would happen to Cuba?
It would've been totally destroyed. "
That's how close we were.
And he was willing to accept that?
Yes... Oh, and he went on to say:
" Mr. McNamara, if you and President Kennedy...
...had been in a similar situation, that's what you would've done. "
I said, " Mr. President, I hope to God we would not have done it. "
Pull the temple down on our heads?
My God!
In a sense, we'd won.
We got the missiles out without war.
My deputy and I brought the five chiefs over...
...and we sat down with Kennedy.
And he said, "Gentlemen, we won.
I don't want you ever to say it, but you know we won, I know we won. "
And LeMay said,
"Won? Hell, we lost!
We should go in and wipe them out today. "
LeMay believed that ultimately...
...we'd confront these people with nuclear weapons.
And by God, we better do it when we have greater superiority...
...than we will have in the future.
At the time, we had a 17-to-1 strategic advantage in nuclear numbers.
We'd done 10 times as many tests as they had.
We were certain we could retain that advantage...
...if we limited the tests.
The chiefs were all opposed.
They said, "The Soviets will cheat. "
Well, I said, " How will they cheat?"
You won't believe this, but they said:
"They'll test them behind the moon. "
I said, "You're out of your mind. "
That's absurd.
It's almost impossible for our people today...
...to put themselves back into that period.
In my seven years as secretary...
...we came within a hairsbreadth of war with the Soviet Union...
...on three different occasions.
Twenty-four hours a day,
365 days a year...
...for seven years as secretary of defense, I lived the Cold War.
During the Kennedy administration, they designed a 100-megaton bomb.
It was tested in the atmosphere.
I remember this.
Cold War? Hell, it was a hot war.
I think the human race needs to think more about killing...
...about conflict.
Is that what we want in this 21st century?
My earliest memory is of a city exploding with joy.
It was November 11, 1918.
I was 2 years old.
You may not believe that I have the memory, but I do.
I remember the tops of the streetcars...
...being crowded with human beings...
...cheering and kissing and screaming.
End of World War I. We'd won.
But also celebrating the belief...
...of many Americans, particularly Woodrow Wilson...
...we'd fought a war to end all wars.
His dream was...
...that the world could avoid great wars in the future.
Disputes among great nations would be resolved.
I also remember...
...that I wasn't allowed to go outdoors to play with my friends...
...without wearing a mask.
There was an ungodly flu epidemic.
Large numbers of Americans were dying, 600,000.
And millions across the world.
My class in the first grade was housed in a shack, a wooden shack.
But we had an absolutely superb teacher.
And this teacher gave a test to the class every month...
...and she re- seated the class based on the results of that test.
There were vertical rows, and she put the person with the highest grade...
...in the first seat on the left-hand row.
And I worked my tail off to be in that first seat.
Now, the majority of the classmates were whites, Caucasians, so on.
Wasps, if you will.
But my competition for that first seat were Chinese, Japanese and Jews.
On Saturday and Sunday,
I played with my classmates.
They went to their ethnic schools.
They learned their native language.
They learned their culture, history.
And they came back determined on
Monday to beat that damn Irishman.
But they didn't do it very often.
One congressman called you "Mr.
L- Have-All-The-Answers McNamara. "
And there's been suggestion from some congressmen...
...that you come up there, in spite of their experience...
...prepared to give them lessons in things.
Is that your attitude?
No. Perhaps they don't know how much I don't know.
And there is much indeed.
I do make a serious effort...
...to prepare myself properly for these congressional discussions.
I suppose I spend, perhaps,
100 or 120 hours...
...in testifying before
Congress each year.
And each hour of testimony requires three to four hours of preparation.
What about the contention that your attitude is sometimes arrogant?
Have you ever been wrong, sir?
Oh, yes, indeed. My heavens.
I'm not gonna tell you when I've been wrong.
If you don't know,
I'm not going to tell you.
Oh, on countless occasions.
I applied to Stanford University.
I very much wanted to go.
But I couldn't afford it, so I lived at home and I went to Berkeley.
Fifty-two dollars a year tuition.
I started Berkeley at the bottom of the Depression.
Twenty-five million males were unemployed.
Out of that class of 3500...
...three elected to Phi Beta Kappa at the end of sophomore year.
Of those three, one became a Rhodes Scholar, I went to Harvard...
...the third went to work for $65 a month...
...and was damn happy to have the job.
The society was on the verge of...
...I don't want to say revolution...
...although, had Roosevelt not done some of the things he did...
...it could've become far more violent.
In any event, that was what I was thrown into.
I never heard of Plato and Aristotle...
...before I became a freshman at Berkeley.
And I remember the professor,
Lowenberg...
...the freshman philosophy professor...
I couldn't wait to go to another class.
I took more philosophy courses, particularly one in logic...
...and one in ethics.
Stress on values...
...something beyond one's self...
...and a responsibility to society.
After graduating
University of California...
...I went to Harvard Graduate School of Business for two years...
...and then I went back to San Francisco.
I began to court this young lady that
I'd met when we were 17...
...in our first week at Berkeley:
Margaret Craig.
And I was making some progress after eight or nine months.
I proposed and she accepted.
She went with her aunt and her mother on a trip across the country.
She telegraphed me,
" Must order engraved invitations...
...to include your middle name, what is it?"
I wired back,
" My middle name is Strange. "
She said,
" I know it's strange, but what is it?"
Well, I mean, it is Strange.
It's Robert Strange McNamara.
And it was a marriage made in heaven.
At the end of a year, we had our first child.
The delivery costs were $100, and we paid that $10 a month.
Those were some of the happiest days of our lives.
And then the war came.
I'd been promoted to assistant professor.
I was the youngest at Harvard.
And on a salary, by the way, of $4000 a year.
Harvard Business School's market was drying up.
The males were being drafted or volunteering.
So the dean, being farsighted, brought back a government contract...
...to establish an officer candidate school for what was called...
...Statistical Control in the Air Force.
We said, " Look, we're not gonna take anybody you send up here.
We're gonna select the people. "
You have a punch card for every human being...
...brought into the Air Corps.
We're gonna run those punch cards through the IBM sorting machines...
...and we're gonna sort on age, education, accomplishment...
...grades, et cetera.
We were looking for the best and the brightest.
The best brains, the greatest capacity to lead...
...the best judgment.
The U.S. Was just beginning to bomb.
We were bombing by daylight.
The loss rate was very, very high.
So they commissioned a study.
And what did we find?
We found the abort rate was 20 percent.
Twenty percent of the planes leaving England...
...to bomb Germany turned around before they got to the target.
That was a hell of a mess.
We lost 20 percent of our capability.
I think it was called Form 1-A...
...or something like that was a mission report.
And if you aborted a mission, you had to write down why.
So we get all these things and we analyze them...
...and we finally concluded:
It was baloney.
They were aborting out of fear.
Because the loss rate was four percent per sortie.
The combat tour was 25 sorties.
It didn't mean 100 percent would die...
...but a lot of them were gonna be killed. They knew that...
...and they found reasons to not go over the target.
So we reported this.
One of the commanders was Curtis LeMay.
Colonel in command of a B-24 group.
He was the finest combat commander of any service I came across in war.
But he was extraordinarily belligerent, many thought brutal.
He got the report.
He issued an order.
He said, " I will be in the lead plane on every mission.
Any plane that takes off will go over the target...
...or the crew will be court-martialed. "
The abort rate dropped overnight.
Now, that's the kind of a commander he was.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.
My friends, on this Christmas Eve...
...there are over 10 million men...
...in the Armed Forces of the United States alone.
One year ago,
1, 700, 000 were serving overseas.
By next July first, that number will rise to over five million.
Plenty of bad news for the Japs in the not-too-far-distant future.
The U.S. Air Force had a new airplane, named the B-29.
The B-17 s and B-24s in Europe bombed from 15, 16,000 feet.
The problem was that they were subject to antiaircraft fire...
...and to fighter aircraft.
To relieve that, this B-29 was being developed...
...that bombed from high altitude...
...and it was thought we could destroy targets more efficiently and effectively.
I was brought back from the 8th Air Force...
...and assigned to the first B-29s, the 58th Bomb Wing.
We had to fly those planes from the bases in Kansas to India.
Then we had to fly fuel over the hump into China.
The airfields were built with Chinese labor.
It was an insane operation.
I can still remember them hauling these huge rollers...
...to crush the stone and make them flat.
Somebody would slip, the roller would roll over him...
...everybody would laugh and go on.
We were supposed to take these B-29s...
There were no tanker aircraft there.
We were to fill them with fuel...
...fly from India to Chengdu, offload the fuel, fly back to India...
...make enough missions to build up fuel in Chengdu...
...fly to Yawata, Japan, bomb the steel mills and go back to India.
We had so little training on this problem of maximizing efficiency...
...we actually found, to get some of the B-29s back...
...instead of offloading fuel, they had to take it on.
To make a long story short, it wasn't worth a damn.
And it was LeMay who really came to that conclusion and led the chiefs...
...to move the whole thing to the
Marianas, which devastated Japan.
LeMay was focused on only one thing:
Target destruction.
Most Air Force generals can say how many planes they had...
...how many tons of bombs they dropped, or whatever it was.
But he was the only person that I knew...
...in the senior command in the
Air Force who focused solely...
...on the loss of his crews per unit of target destruction.
I was on the island of Guam, in his command, in March of 1945.
In that single night, we burned to death...
...100,000 Japanese civilians in Tokyo.
Men, women and children.
Were you aware this was going to happen?
Well, I was...
...part of a mechanism that, in a sense, recommended it.
I analyzed bombing operations, and how to make them more efficient.
I.e., not more efficient in the sense of killing more...
...but more efficient in weakening the adversary.
I wrote one report analyzing...
...the efficiency of the B-29 operations.
The B-29 could get above the fighter aircraft and above the air defense...
...so the loss rate would be much less.
The problem was, the accuracy was also much less.
Now, I don't want to suggest that it was my report...
...that led to...
I'll call it the firebombing.
It isn't that I'm absolving myself of blame for the firebombing.
I don't want to suggest that it was I...
...that put in LeMay's mind...
...that his operations were totally inefficient...
...and had to be drastically changed.
But, anyhow, that's what he did.
He took the B-29s down to 5000 feet...
...and he decided to bomb with firebombs.
I participated in the interrogation...
...of the B-29 bomber crews that came back that night.
A room full of crewmen and intelligence interrogators.
A captain got up, a young captain said:
"Goddamn it, I'd like to know who the son of a bitch was...
...that took this magnificent airplane, designed to bomb from 23,000 feet...
...and he took it down to 5000 feet, and I lost my wingman.
He was shot and killed. "
LeMay spoke in monosyllables.
I never heard him say...
...more than two words in sequence.
It was basically, "Yes," " No," "Yep"...
..."That's all," or " Hell with it. "
That was all he said.
And LeMay was totally intolerant of criticism.
He never engaged in discussion with anybody.
He stood up.
"Why are we here?
Why are we here?
You lost your wingman.
It hurts me as much as...
...it does you.
I sent him there.
And I've been there,
I know what it is.
But you lost one wingman...
...and we destroyed Tokyo. "
Fifty square miles of Tokyo were burned.
Tokyo was a wooden city, and when we dropped firebombs...
...it just burned it.
The choice of incendiary bombs...
...where did that come from?
I think the issue...
...is not so much incendiary bombs.
I think the issue is...
...in order to win, should you kill
100,000 people in one night?
By firebombing or any other way?
LeMay's answer would be, clearly, "Yes. "
" McNamara, do you mean to say...
...that instead of killing 100,000...
...burning to death 100,000 Japanese civilians in that one night...
...we should have burned to death a lesser number or none?
And then had our soldiers cross the beaches in Tokyo...
...and been slaughtered in tens of thousands?
Is that what you're proposing?
Is that moral? Is that wise?"
Why was it necessary to drop the nuclear bomb...
...if LeMay was burning up Japan?
And he went on from Tokyo to firebomb other cities.
58 percent of Yokohama. Yokohama is roughly the size of Cleveland.
58 percent of Cleveland destroyed.
Tokyo is roughly the size of New York.
51 percent of New York destroyed.
99 percent of the equivalent of Chattanooga, which was Toyama.
40 percent of the equivalent of Los Angeles, which was Nagoya.
This was all done before...
...the dropping of the nuclear bomb.
Which, by the way, was dropped by LeMay's command.
Proportionality should be a guideline in war.
Killing 50 to 90 percent...
...of the people in 67 Japanese cities...
...and then bombing them with two nuclear bombs...
...is not proportional, in the minds of some people...
...to the objectives we were trying to achieve.
I don't fault Truman for dropping the nuclear bomb.
The U.S. -Japanese War was one of the most brutal wars...
...in all of human history.
Kamikaze pilots, suicide, unbelievable.
What one can criticize...
...is that the human race prior to that time and today...
...has not really grappled with what are, I'll call it "the rules of war. "
Was there a rule then that said you shouldn't bomb, shouldn't kill...
...shouldn't burn to death 100,000 civilians in a night?
LeMay said, " If we'd lost the war...
...we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals. "
And I think he's right.
He, and I'd say I...
...were behaving as war criminals.
LeMay recognized that what he was doing...
...would be thought immoral...
...if his side had lost.
But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?
At some point, we have to approach
Vietnam, and I want to know...
...how you can best set that up for me.
Yeah, well...
...that's a hard, hard question.
I think...
I think we have to approach it in the context of the Cold War.
But first I'll have to talk about Ford.
I've got to go back to the end of the war.
I had a terrible headache...
...so Marg drove me in to the Air Force regional hospital.
A week later, Marg came in...
...many of the same symptoms.
It's hard to believe, and I don't think
I've heard of another case...
...where two individuals, husband and wife...
...came down, essentially, at the same time with polio.
We were both in the hospital on V-J Day.
A friend of mine said:
"We're gonna find a corporation in America that needs...
...the advice and capabilities of this extraordinary group...
...I'm forming and you gotta be in it. "
I said, "To hell with it.
I'm going back to Harvard.
Marg and I wanna do that.
I'm gonna spend my life there. "
He said, " Look, Bob, you can't pay Marg's hospital bills.
You're crazy as hell. "
He said, " By the way...
...the company that most needs our help in all the U.S. Is Ford. "
I said, " How'd you learn that?"
" I read an article in Life magazine. "
Of the top 1000 executives at Ford...
...I don't believe there were
10 college graduates...
...and Henry Ford II needed help.
They were gonna give us tests.
Two full days of testing...
...intelligence tests, achievement tests, personality tests, you name it.
This sounds absurd, but I remember a question on one of the tests was:
"Would you rather be a florist or a coal miner?"
I had been a florist.
I worked as a florist...
...during some of my
Christmas vacations.
I put down coal miner.
I think the reasons are obvious to you.
This group of 10 people had been trained...
...in the officer candidate school at Harvard.
In some tests we had the highest marks that had ever been scored.
In other tests, we were in the upper one percentile.
From 1926 to 1946, including the war years...
...Ford Motor Company just barely broke even.
It was a God-awful mess.
I thought we had a responsibility to the stockholders...
...and God knows you cannot believe how bad the situation had been.
They had no market research organization. I set one up.
Manager said,
"What do you want studied?"
I said, " Find out who's buying Volkswagens.
Everybody says it's a no-good car.
It was only selling about
20,000 a year...
...but I want to know what's gonna happen.
Is it gonna stay the same, go down, or go up?
Find out who buys them. "
He came back six months later, he said:
"Well, they're professors, and they're doctors and they're lawyers...
...and they're obviously people who can afford more. "
Well, that set me to thinking about what we in the industry should do.
Was there a market we were missing?
At this time nobody believed
Americans wanted cheaper cars.
They wanted conspicuous consumption.
Cadillac, with these huge, ostentatious fins...
...set the style for the industry for 10 or 15 years.
And that's what we were up against.
We introduced the Falcon as a more economical car...
...and it was a huge success profit-wise.
We accomplished a lot.
I said, "What about accidents?
I hear a lot about accidents. "
"Oh, yes, we'll get you some data on that. "
There were about 40,000 deaths per year from automobile accidents...
...and about a million, or a million-two injuries.
I said, "What causes it?"
" It's obvious.
It's human error and mechanical failure. "
I said, " If it's mechanical, we might be involved. Find out.
If it's mechanical failure,
I want to stop it. "
Well, he said, "There's really very few statistics available. "
I said, " Damn it, find out what can we learn. "
"The only place we can find that knows anything about it...
...is Cornell Aeronautical Labs. "
They said,
"The major problem is packaging. "
They said, "You buy eggs and you know how eggs come in a carton?"
I said, " I don't buy eggs.
My wife does it. "
They said, "Well, you ask her, when she puts that carton down...
...on the drain board when she gets home, do the eggs break?"
I asked Marg and she said no.
Cornell said, "That's because they're packaged properly.
Now, if we packaged people in cars the same way...
...we could reduce the breakage. "
We lacked lab facilities, so we dropped human skulls...
...in different packages, down the stairwells of the dormitories at Cornell.
Well, that sounds absurd, but that guy was absolutely right.
It was packaging which could make the difference.
In a crash, the driver was often impaled on the steering wheel.
The passenger was often injured because he'd hit the windshield...
...or the header bar, or the instrument panel.
So in the 1956 model Ford we introduced steering wheels...
...that prevented being impaled.
We introduced...
...padded instrument panels, and we introduced seat belts.
We estimated if there would be
100 percent use of the seat belts...
...we could save 20-odd thousand lives a year.
Everybody was opposed to it.
You couldn't get people to use seat belts.
But those who did saved their lives.
Now, let me jump ahead.
It's July, 1960.
John Bugas, vice president, industrial relations...
...clearly had his eyes on becoming president.
I'm the group vice president in charge of all of the car divisions.
Henry was a night owl.
He always wanted to go out.
You know, it's 2 a. m. Or something.
He said, " Come up, have a nightcap. "
" I don't want one, I'm going to bed. "
John said, " I'll come up, Henry. "
" I didn't ask you. I asked Bob. "
He said, " Bob, come on up. "
So I finally went up.
That's when he asked me to be president.
I was the first president in the history of the company...
...that had ever been president other than a member of the Ford family.
And after five weeks, I quit.
The telephone rang...
...a person comes on and says:
" I'm Robert Kennedy.
My brother, Jack Kennedy, would like you...
...to meet our brother- in-law,
Sergeant Shriver. "
Four o'clock, Sarge comes in.
Never met him.
And he said, " I've been authorized by my brother- in-law...
...Jack Kennedy, to offer you the position of secretary of the treasury. "
"You're crazy.
I know a little about finance...
...but I'm not qualified for that position. "
"Anticipating you might say that, the president-elect...
...authorized me to offer you the secretary of defense. "
" I was in World War II for three years...
...but secretary of defense?
I'm not qualified for that. "
He said, "Anticipating that...
...would you do him the courtesy of agreeing to meet with him?"
So I go home. I meet with Marg.
If I could appoint every senior official in the department...
...and if I was guaranteed
I wouldn't have to...
...be part of that damn Washington social world.
She said, "Well, okay, why don't you write a contract with the president...
...and if he'll accept those conditions, do it. "
My total net worth at the time was on the order of $800,000...
...but I had huge unfulfilled stock options worth millions.
And I was one of the highest-paid executives in the world.
And the future was brilliant.
We had called our children in.
Their life would be totally changed.
The salary of a cabinet secretary then was $25,000 a year.
So we explained to the children...
...they'd be giving up a few...
They could care less.
Marg could care less.
It was snowing.
The Secret Service took me in the house by the back way.
I can still see it. There's a loveseat...
...two armchairs with a lamp table in between.
Jack Kennedy is sitting in one...
...and Bobby Kennedy's sitting in the other.
" Mr. President, it's absurd.
I'm not qualified. "
" Look, Bob... "
He said, " I don't think there's any school for presidents either.
Let's announce it now.
I'll write the announcement. "
So he wrote out the announcement, we walk out the front door.
All of these television cameras and press, till hell wouldn't have it.
That's how Marg learned
I had accepted.
It was on television, live.
All right, why don't we do some pictures afterwards.
I've asked Robert McNamara...
...to assume the responsibilities of secretary of defense.
And I'm glad and happy to say that he has accepted this responsibility.
Mr. McNamara leaves the presidency of the Ford company...
...at great personal sacrifice.
That's the way it began.
You know, it was a traumatic period.
My wife probably got ulcers from it...
...may even ultimately have died from the stress. My son got ulcers.
It was very traumatic but...
...they were some of the best years of our life...
...and all members of my family benefited from it.
It was terrific.
October 2nd.
I had returned from Vietnam.
At that time, we had 16,000 military advisors.
I recommended to President Kennedy and to the Security Council...
...that we establish a plan and an objective...
...of removing all of them within two years.
Kennedy announced we were going to pull out all our military advisors...
...by the end of '65, going to take 1000 out at the end of '63, and we did.
But there was a coup in South Vietnam.
Diem was overthrown...
...and he and his brother were killed.
I was present with the President...
...when together we received information of that coup.
I've never seen him...
...more upset.
He totally blanched.
Kennedy and I had tremendous problems with Diem, but my God...
...he was the authority.
He was the head of state.
And he was overthrown by a military coup.
And Kennedy knew and I knew, that to some degree...
...the U.S. Government was responsible for that.
I was in my office in the Pentagon...
...when the telephone rang and it was Bobby.
The President had been shot in Dallas.
Perhaps 45 minutes later,
Bobby called again...
...and said the president was dead.
Jackie would like me to come out to the hospital.
We took the body to the White House about whatever it was, 4 a. M...
...and called the superintendent of Arlington Cemetery.
And he and I...
...walked over those grounds.
They're hauntingly beautiful grounds.
White crosses, row and row.
And finally I thought I'd found the exact spot...
...the most beautiful spot in the cemetery.
I called Jackie at the White House...
...and asked her to come out there.
She immediately accepted.
And that's where the president is buried today.
A park service ranger came up to me and said that he...
He had...
...escorted President Kennedy on a tour of those grounds...
...a few weeks before.
And Kennedy said...
...that was the most beautiful spot in Washington.
That's where he's buried.
I will do my best.
That is all I can do.
I ask for your help...
...and God's.
Make no bones of this.
Don't try to sweep this under the rug.
We are at war in Vietnam.
And yet the president...
...and his secretary of defense continues to mislead...
...and misinform the American people, and enough of it's gone by.
On August 2nd...
...the destroyer Maddox reported it was attacked...
...by a North Vietnamese patrol boat.
It was an act of aggression against us.
We were in international waters.
I sent officials from the Defense
Department out and we recovered...
...pieces of shells that were clearly identified...
...as North Vietnamese from the Maddox's deck.
So there was no question in my mind that it had occurred.
But, in any event, we didn't respond.
And it was very difficult.
It was difficult for the president.
There were very, very senior people, in uniform and out, who said:
" My God, this president is... "
They didn't use the word "coward," but in effect...
..." He's not protecting the national interest. "
Two days later the Maddox and the Turner Joy, two destroyers...
...reported they were attacked.
There were sonar soundings.
Torpedoes had been detected.
Other indications of attack from patrol boats.
We spent 10 hours that day trying to find out what the hell had happened.
At one point the commander said,
"We're not certain of the attack. "
Another point they said,
"We're positive. "
Then finally, late in the day,
Admiral Sharp said:
"Yes, we're certain it happened. "
So I reported this to Johnson, and as a result...
...there were bombing attacks on targets in North Vietnam.
Johnson said,
"We may have to escalate.
I'm not gonna do it without
Congressional authority. "
And he put forward a resolution, the language of which...
...gave complete authority to the president to take the nation to war:
The Tonkin Gulf Resolution.
Now, let me go back to the August 4th attack.
It was just confusion.
And events afterwards showed...
...that our judgment that we'd been attacked that day was wrong.
It didn't happen.
And the judgment that we'd been attacked on August 2nd...
...which we'd made, was right.
We had been.
Although that was disputed at the time.
So we were right once and wrong once.
Ultimately, President Johnson authorized bombing in response...
...to what he thought had been the second attack.
It hadn't occurred, but that's irrelevant to the point I'm making here.
He authorized the attack on the assumption it had occurred.
And his belief that it was a conscious decision...
...by the North Vietnamese political and military leaders...
...to escalate the conflict...
...and an indication they would not stop short of winning.
We were wrong.
But we had in our minds a mindset that led to that action.
And it carried such heavy costs.
We see incorrectly, or we see only half of the story at times.
- We see what we want to believe.
- You're absolutely right.
Belief and seeing.
They're both often wrong.
We Americans know, although others appear to forget...
...the risk of spreading conflict.
We still seek no wider war.
We introduced " Rolling Thunder"...
...which, over the years, became a very, very heavy bombing program.
Two to three times as many bombs as were dropped...
...on Western Europe during all of World War II.
This is not primarily a military problem.
It's a battle for the hearts and minds of the people of South Vietnam.
As a prerequisite, we must be able to guarantee their physical security.
It was announced today that total
American casualties in Vietnam...
...now number 4877 including 748 killed.
Secretary of Defense McNamara, on each of his seven trips to Vietnam...
...has found some positive aspect of the course of the war.
The most vivid impression
I'm bringing back is...
...that we've stopped losing the war.
The North Vietnamese, we believe, have nine regiments of their army...
Some of the men had a little training in a park in Kentucky before coming.
But it didn't prepare them for thick et of trees, spiked vines, thorn bushes...
...almost perpendicular cliffs,
90-degree temperatures, insects...
This has changed from a nasty little war to a nasty middle-sized war.
The Vietnamese are still doing most of the fighting and most of the dying...
...but week after week,
American casualty figures go up.
Now, America wins the wars that she undertakes. Make no mistake about it.
And we have declared war on tyranny and aggression.
If this little nation goes down the drain and can't maintain independence...
...ask yourself what's gonna happen to all the other little nations.
Let me go back one moment.
In the Cuban Missile Crisis, at the end...
...I think we did put ourselves in the skin of the Soviets.
In the case of Vietnam, we didn't know them well enough to empathize.
And there was total misunderstanding as a result.
They believed we had simply replaced the French as a colonial power...
...and we were seeking to subject
South and North Vietnam...
...to our colonial interests, which was absolutely absurd.
And we, we saw Vietnam as an element of the Cold War.
Not what they saw it as, a civil war.
There aren't many examples...
...in which you bring two former enemies together...
...at the highest levels, and discuss what might have been.
I formed the hypothesis that each of us could have...
...achieved our objectives without the terrible loss of life.
And I wanted to test that by going to Vietnam.
The former foreign minister of Vietnam...
...a wonderful man named Thach said, "You're totally wrong.
We were fighting for independence.
You were fighting to enslave us. "
We almost came to blows.
That was noon on the first day.
" Do you mean to say it was not a tragedy for you...
...when you lost 3,400,000
Vietnamese killed...
...which on our population base is the equivalent of 27 million Americans?
What did you accomplish?
You didn't get more than we were willing to give at the start.
You could've had the whole damn thing: Independence, unification. "
" Mr. McNamara, you must never have read a history book.
If you had, you'd know we weren't pawns of the Chinese or the Russians.
Didn't you know that?
Don't you understand that we've been fighting the Chinese for 1000 years?
We were fighting for independence, and we'd fight to the last man.
We were determined to...
...and no amount of bombing or U.S.
Pressure would've ever stopped us. "
What makes us omniscient?
Have we a record of omniscience?
We are the strongest nation in the world today.
I do not believe we should ever...
...apply that economic, political or military power unilaterally.
If we had followed that rule in Vietnam, we wouldn't have been there.
None of our allies supported us.
Not Japan, not Germany, not Britain or France.
If we can't persuade nations with comparable values...
...of the merit of our cause, we'd better re- examine our reasoning.
Americans suffered the heaviest casualties of the war last week.
543 killed in action. Another 1247 were wounded and hospitalized.
The deaths raise the U.S. Total in the war so far to 18, 239.
South Vietnamese put their losses for the week at 522 killed.
Communist losses were not reported.
Contributing to those casualties has been the Communist bombardment...
...of the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh.
There, the North Vietnamese have been tightening their ring around...
The military expects a full-scale assault.
To what extent did you feel that you were the author of stuff...
...or that you were an instrument of things outside of your control?
Well, I don't think I felt either.
I just felt that I was serving at the request of a president...
...who'd been elected by the American people.
And it was my responsibility to try to help him...
...to carry out the office as he believed was in the interest of our people.
What is morally appropriate in a wartime environment?
Let me give you an illustration.
While I was secretary...
...we used what's called
"Agent Orange" in Vietnam.
A chemical that strips leaves off of trees.
After the war, it is claimed that that was a toxic chemical...
...and it killed many individuals...
...soldiers and civilians exposed to it.
Were those who issued the approval to use Agent Orange criminals?
Were they committing a crime against humanity?
Let's look at the law.
Now, what kind of law do we have that says...
...these chemicals are acceptable in war and these chemicals are not.
We don't have clear definitions of that kind.
I never in the world would have authorized an illegal action.
I'm not really sure I authorized
Agent Orange, I don't remember it.
But it certainly occurred, the use of it occurred while I was secretary.
Norman Morrison was a Quaker.
He was opposed to war, the violence of war, the killing.
He came to the Pentagon, doused himself with gasoline.
Burned himself to death below my office.
He held a child in his arms, his daughter.
Passers-by shouted, "Save the child!"
He threw the child...
...out of his arms, and the child lived and is alive today.
His wife issued a very moving statement:
" Human beings must stop killing other human beings. "
And that's a belief that I shared.
I shared it then and I believe it even more strongly today.
How much evil must we do in order to do good?
We have certain ideals, certain responsibilities.
Recognize that at times you will have to engage in evil, but minimize it.
I remember reading that
General Sherman, in the Civil War...
...the mayor of Atlanta pleaded with him to save the city.
And Sherman essentially said to the mayor...
...just before he torched it and burned it down:
"War is cruel. War is cruelty. "
That was the way LeMay felt.
He was trying to save the country.
He was trying to save our nation.
And in the process, he was prepared to do whatever killing was necessary.
It's a very, very difficult position for sensitive human beings to be in.
Morrison was one of those.
I think I was.
50,000 people came to Washington to demonstrate against the war.
About 20,000 of them marched on the Pentagon.
The Pentagon is a very, very difficult building to defend.
We placed troops carrying rifles around it.
U.S. Marshals in front of the soldiers.
But I told the president, not a rifle would be loaded...
...without my personal permission.
And I wasn't gonna grant it.
What effect did all of this dissent have on your thinking?
I mean, Norman Morrison is '65.
This is '67.
Well, it was a very tense period.
Very tense period for my family, which I don't want to discuss.
How was your thinking changing during this period?
I don't think my thinking was changing.
We were in the Cold War.
And this was a Cold War...
...activity.
Some commentators have said the war is turning into a kind of stalemate.
No, no. I think on the contrary...
...as General Westmoreland has pointed out...
...in recent weeks in Saigon, the military operations...
...the large-unit military operations continue to...
...show very substantial progress.
One of the lessons I learned early on:
Never say never.
Never, never, never.
Never say never.
And secondly...
...never answer the question that is asked of you.
Answer the question that you wish had been asked of you.
And quite frankly, I follow that rule.
It's a very good rule.
When you talk about the responsibility for something like the Vietnam War...
...whose responsibility is it?
It's the president's responsibility.
I don't want to fail to recognize...
...the tremendous contribution
I think Johnson made to the country.
I don't want to put the responsibility for Vietnam on his shoulders alone...
...but I do... I am inclined to believe that if Kennedy had lived...
...he would've made a difference. We wouldn't have had 500,000 men there.
Two very telling photographs.
One of them has Johnson like this:
You can just see him thinking,
" My God, I'm in a hell of a mess.
And this guy is trying to tell me to do something...
...that I know is wrong and I'm not gonna do.
But how the hell am I gonna get out of this?"
The other photograph, you can see me saying:
"Jesus Christ. I love this man,
I respect him, but he's totally wrong.
What am I gonna do?"
Johnson couldn't persuade me, and I couldn't persuade him.
I had this enormous respect and affection, loyalty...
...to both Kennedy and Johnson.
But at the end, Johnson and I found ourselves poles apart.
And I said to a very close and dear friend of mine, Kay Graham...
" Even to this day, Kay, I don't know whether I quit or was fired. "
She said, "You're out of your mind.
You were fired. "
November 1, 1967.
I presented a memo to Johnson that said:
"The course we're on is totally wrong.
We've gotta change it.
Cut back at what we're doing in Vietnam.
We gotta reduce the casualties," and so on.
It was an extraordinarily controversial memo.
And I took it to him.
I delivered it myself.
" Mr. President, nobody has seen this.
Not Dean Rusk, not the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Nobody. "
" I know that it may contain recommendations and statements...
...that you do not agree with or support. "
I never heard from him.
Something had to give.
There was a rumor I was facing a mental breakdown...
...I was under such pressure and stress.
I don't think that was the case at all.
But it was a really traumatic departure.
That's the way it ended.
Except for one thing.
He awarded me the Medal of Freedom...
...in a very beautiful ceremony at the White House.
And he was very, very warm in his comments.
And I became so emotional,
I could not...
...respond.
Mr. President...
...I cannot find words...
...to express what lies in my heart today.
And I think I'd better respond on another occasion.
And had I responded,
I would have said:
" I know what many of you are thinking.
You're thinking this man is duplicitous.
You're thinking that he has held things close to his chest.
You're thinking that...
...he did not respond fully...
...to the desires and wishes of the American people.
I wanna tell you you're wrong. "
Of course he had personal idiosyncrasies.
No question about that.
He didn't accept all the advice he was given.
On several occasions, his associates advised him to be more forthcoming.
He wasn't.
People did not understand there were recommendations and pressures...
...that would carry the risk of war with China and of nuclear war.
And he was determined to prevent it.
I'm arguing that he had a reason in his mind for doing what he did.
And, of course, shortly after I left...
...Johnson concluded that he couldn't continue.
At this point, how many Americans had been killed in Vietnam?
About 25,000. Less than half...
...of the number ultimately killed, 58,000.
Historians don't really like to deal with counterfactuals...
...with what might have been.
They want to talk about history.
" How the hell do you know,
McNamara, what might have been?
Who knows?"
Well, I know certain things.
What I'm doing is thinking it through with hindsight.
But you don't have hindsight available at the time.
I'm very proud of my accomplishments.
And I'm very sorry that in the process of accomplishment, I've made errors.
We all make mistakes.
We know we make mistakes.
I don't know any military commander who is honest...
...who would say he has not made a mistake.
There's a wonderful phrase:
"The fog of war. "
What "the fog of war" means is:
War is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind...
...to comprehend all the variables.
Our judgment, our understanding, are not adequate.
And we kill people unnecessarily.
Wilson said,
"We won the war to end all wars. "
I'm not so naive or simplistic to believe we can eliminate war.
We're not gonna change human nature any time soon.
It isn't that we aren't rational.
We are rational.
But reason has limits.
There's a quote from T.S. Eliot that I just love:
"We shall not cease from exploring...
...and at the end of our exploration, we will return to where we started...
...and know the place for the first time. "
Now that's, in a sense, where I'm beginning to be.
After you left the Johnson administration...
...why didn't you speak out against the Vietnam War?
I'm not going to say any more than I have.
These are the kinds of questions that get me in trouble.
You don't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear.
A lot of people misunderstand the war...
...misunderstand me.
A lot of people think
I'm a son of a bitch.
Do you feel in any way responsible for the war?
Do you feel guilty?
I don't want to go into further discussion.
It just opens up more controversy.
I don't wanna add anything to Vietnam.
It is so complex that anything I say...
...will require additions and qualifications.
Is it the feeling that you're damned if you do...
...and if you don't, no matter what...?
Yeah, that's right.
And I would rather be damned if I don't.

(reporter) The much-criticized Cincinnati
Accord has brought a cease-fire to Bosnia, and it appears to be holding, prompting
NATO forces to begin a withdrawal, which should be complete by New Year's Day, close to the US president's
''Home by the holidays '' pledge.
Yet even as the conflict winds down, the US military remains in a high state of readiness, eager to answer the call.
(radio) Golden Eagle, this is Hawkeye. l've got unknown rider not responding to coms.
Suspect hostile intent.
Unclassified bandit.
Launch the alert. Launch the alert.
Sailors, let's move it out there. We need to get this aircraft airborne in five minutes.

That's a NATO bird. Stand it down.
Cat four, abort.

- That's bullshit! Are you kidding me?
Abort, abort. Suspend cat four.
Launch is canceled.
- Guys, come on. That's twice today.
- Yeah.
They're wound up tight today.
Guess that's the price of peace. l cannot wait for this shit to be done.
OK.
Four more days.
You know what l was reading the other day?
Bill Gates has more money than Peru.
Now, he needs someone to fly his jets.
We oughta be flyin' for him.
Yeah, but you know what? l bet Bill won't let you fly upside down.
Or fly for a rock star. l mean, if anybody needs a good pilot, it's those guys.
Whenever you turn around we've lost another band to some shitty hack they got flyin' 'em. l mean, it's sad.
Navy pilot coulda saved Ritchie Valens from bein' a one-hit wonder. That's a fact.
Cos that kid had talent.
You know, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Buddy Holly...
- What about John Denver?
- Well, let's not get carried away.
Let me ask you something. How fast do you think we're headed into the wind?
Chris, we're still on alert. lf Reigart wanders up to the tower, we're dead.
All right, let's do it.
That's the spirit.
- Rutherford. Right here.
- lncoming!
You guys ready for a little lesson in physics?
You never learn, kid. l'm gonna take your money this week.
Wind's blowin' up a gale. l bet you 20 bucks each l catch it when it comes back.
- Man, you'll lose a finger along with that 20.
- This one?
All right.
Always happy to take an officer's money.
Hey, mama, don't you treat me wrong
Come and love your daddy all night long
All right now...
Look at that, Stackhouse! Look!
That is awesome!
Hey, watch out for the catwalk!
Well, tell me what'd l say, yeah
Tell me what'd l say right now
Tell me what'd l say
Tell me what'd l say right now
Tell me what'd l say
Tell me what'd l say...
Wilson!
On the flight deck, heads up.
NATO helo landing spot six. Spot six.
This is a lot of sorties for an action that's winding down, Leslie. l'm struggling to get my pilots
15 hours a month up there.
You understand how important it is that your pilots don't stray from the agreed fly zones?
- This treaty is fragile.
- The routes will be flown as ordered.
The treaty depends on it.
Aernout Van Lynden. He's with Sky News.
- What is this?
- l invited him to report on the battle group. l'd like you to give him a tour of the ship.
Show him how everything works.
Admiral, l find the press to be an intrusive presence. lt inspires showing off.
What's so funny, Admiral?
You, Admiral, are just what the conflict needs.
- An uncomplicated man.
- l'll take that as a compliment.
But wait a second.
Did you see the one with the, uh...?
Well, well, well, looky here. Stackhouse.
- l know that's not Burnett.
- Captain? Good to see you. All right.
- Look at you, look at you.
- What are you guys doing back on board?
Well, we just finished up in Sarajevo, and your Admiral wanted us to pump you guys up.
Sounds like Reigart. ''Be prepared.''
Well, it's better to be prepared than to be caught sleepin' in the field.
Don't you forget what you're doin' here.
What we're doing here?
Are you kidding me?
Well, l'm eating Jell-O.
Uh, he's wipin' his hands.
You know, everybody has a role to play.
See, me, l'm a marine.
We take care of the serious business.
You, you're a navy pilot, and your role is to eat Jell-O.
You don't get to pick your fight. lt comes to you.
Yeah, l get it.
But at least give me a fight l can understand.
Vukovar? Where's the place we flew over the other day? Sreb...?
Srebrenica.
And good luck talkin' to someone at home:
''Today's Tuesday.
We're helping these people.''
''No, no, now it's switched around.
Now we're helping...'' lt's like a joke.
- Just be glad it's over.
- Yeah. l am.
Look at these guys.
See, that's exactly what l'm talking about.
Everybody thinks they're gonna get a chance to punch some Nazi in the face at Normandy.
And those days are over. They are long gone. l used to think l'd get a chance to do it.
Now l realize l'll be eating Jell-O.
- Are you gonna eat that, by the way?
- Now you wanna eat everybody's Jell-O.
Lieutenant Burnett?
Admiral Reigart would like to see you immediately.
- What the hell is this?
- Be prepared.
Thank you.
Maybe he wants to give you his daughter's number.
Did you see Tennessee on Saturday?
Boy, they looked good. l don't know anything, Lieutenant.
Now, that is cynical.
And Southerners usually aren't that cynical. l give you a compliment on how great your alma mater looks, and you think l'm tryin' to pump you for information. What does he want? l guess you'll have to see, sir.
- (knock at door)
- Come.
- Lieutenant Burnett, sir.
- Master Chief O'Malley, thank you.
Lieutenant Burnett.
- Sir, about the football today, l know...
- l have your letter. l understand you're interested in leaving the navy.
Yes, sir. lt's time to move on. lf you don't mind my asking, move on to what?
Sir?
Are you gonna fly commercial jets?
Troll the friendly skies in a bus?
You've had an interesting career, Lieutenant. l remember when you came on board.
Smart as a whip, tons of potential.
- Thank you, sir.
- And then, on September 23rd, you received a non-punitive letter of caution for disorderly behavior at the China Fleet Club in Hong Kong.
Another letter a month later for something involving Chinese New Year at Pattaya Beach in Thailand.
One can only imagine what that was.
Just out of curiosity, Lieutenant, what happened to you?
Sir, l signed up to be a fighter pilot. l didn't wanna be a cop. l certainly didn't wanna be a cop walkin' the beat in a neighborhood no one cares about.
That and the routine on the ship kinda wore me out.
- The routine?
- The routine.
What you don't know from experience is that the routine, the systems checks, the drills, the maintaining of discipline, that's what you do to prepare for war.
- We're not at war, sir.
- Yes, we are.
Unless we're parked in San Diego Bay, you're at war every time you step on this boat.
- You understand that?
- No, sir, l do not understand. lf we're at war, why don't we act like it?
Cos as far as l can tell, we go out, we fly around and we come back.
Maybe we're pretending we're in the fight, but we're not fighting, we're watching.
You should be glad you're not in a fight.
With your attitude you wouldn't last long.
Sir, l've given the navy seven good years. l think l've served my country.
You wouldn't know the first thing about serving your country.
You have two weeks remaining on this tour.
You will serve them in a manner befitting a naval officer. l'll keep your letter in my pocket.
At the end of those two weeks, you be on your way.
You're dismissed, mister.
Sir.
O'Malley told me you dropped your letter.
He's tellin' the truth.
So you're gonna break up the band, huh?
Oh, that's good.
Hey, listen, Chris. Listen, l thought you were kidding about getting out.
You telling me l gotta find another navigator? ls that the deal? l can't do it anymore. l'm done. l'm sorry.
(PA system) All hands. An air contact believed to have originated in the North Pole has been spotted and is inbound to USS Carl Vinson.
No, no, it's good to hear your voice. No, no.
Yeah, they're taking care of us great.
They're putting up tinsel, and it's very Christmasy.
No, Dad, don't wake her.
Just tell her l said ''merry Christmas.''
We're disappointed that we won't be seeing you.
Well, you may get to see a lot of me soon.
Well, we understand. You got important things to do over there.
Dad, l gotta go.
- We're very proud of you.
- Dad, l gotta get goin'.
- All right, l love you.
- Bye.
That son of a bitch!
Did you see this? He put us on the holiday mission. Goddammit.
- Well, at least we get to fly.
- Yeah, during the one good meal of the year.
- lt's almost like he doesn't like us.
- No. You, not me. You.
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.
(PA) Merry Christmas, girls and boys.
On the flight deck it's show time.
Aircraft remaining for the NATO solo photo reconnaissance mission.
He's got a brand-new car
Looks like a Jaguar lt's got leather seats lt's got a CD player...
Wouldn't it be great to look back and there's Britney Spears?
But wait, she wants to try flyin' the plane.
Yeah, just move the stick right there. Yeah.
We'll start over again
Grow ourselves new skin
Get a house in Devon
Drink cider from a lemon
(TV) The CincinnatiAccord verifies Serbia's commitment to a lasting peace in Yugoslavia. l welcome the announcement that NATO will leave the region.
Coordinates 3 0 1 5 0 6.5 1 1 5 0 confirmed.
Sectors are all concurrent.
- You sure about that?
- l'm readin' it right here, pal.
Yeah, well, uh... the Serbs must've bought some old U-boats, cos we're flyin' over a lake.
Goddammit.
And a warm thank you to the US intelligence community, ladies and gentlemen.
Yet another useless joyride at the cost of mere millions to the US taxpayer.
Hey, hang on. Scope showing activity in section four alpha to our left.
Must be in that forested area.
That's the demilitarized zone.
There shouldn't be any activity.
Yeah, l know, l know. But the scope doesn't lie. There it is. Let's check it out.
We're not supposed to fly that section.
The brass'll have a shit fit.
Hey, we're on recon, so let's recon something.
Stack, it's probably just some locals fooling around.
Could be a good opportunity to test our shiny new digital camera.
Why do l listen to you? All right, let's do it.
ECM is clear. GPS is synced with new coordinates.
Steady up 0-3-4 and fly the director.
- lDEM camera is at speed.
- Got it. Going into burner.
On condition. Stand by for roll... now.
Rolling digital.
Smile, guys. You're on TV.
- Aren't you gonna miss all this excitement?
- Oh, absolutely.
- What is it?
- Holy shit! We're being painted!
What?!
Shit! They fired! Scoop it, now!
- Pull up! Get the nose moving!
- Roger!
- l see a single missile tracking on us.
- l don't see it. Call my turn.
Slice left. Hard!
Jesus Christ!
Where is it?
Reverse right!
Try to break the lock!
- Golden Eagle, we have been engaged.
- Roger.
- Put out decoy flares.
- Copy.
- No joy.
- Where is it, goddammit? Where is it?! l can't see shit! Where is he?!
Jesus Christ! Second missile in the air!
Three miles and closing!
- Pull up! Change your vector!
- l got him! l got him!
We need a bigger heat decoy.
We're screwed!
Missile's closing. 2.8... 1.8... 1 mile!
Drop the fuel tanks and pull up!
Good fireball!
Clear on top. Coming back down. l got two missiles in sight, both tracking for the fireball.
That's it! One down. Up we go.
- Where's the second?
- No joy. l don't have it in sight.
- He's back on us. Push over!
- Copy.
Hard left.
- l'm going for a head-on pass.
- Here he comes! Head on, right side!
He clipped us! Part of the tail's gone!
- Flight controls going to shit!
- Where is it?
He's coming back.
Missile arcing right. Break! l got no turn left, Chris!
The controls are shot!
Nose break, right!
Shit!
Shit! Seat eject! Eject, eject!
Goddammit.
- You throw a hell of a party, sir.
- Yeah, l really like Christmas.
Sir, we've lost a bird, an F-18. Feet dry.
Ark Angel Zero Six.
Burnett and Stackhouse.
Goddammit. l put 'em on the holiday mission.
- Any beacon activity?
- Not yet, Admiral.
We have a radar plot of flight path from feet dry to last contact.
Here in yellow is the assigned path. ln the red is actual.
Lost contact is here.
They're off-mission. What the hell happened? lt'll be tough to pick up a beacon signal, even from a satellite.
The terrain is extremely rough.
Damn weather's sure not helping.
Contact Admiral Piquet, alert NATO chain of command.
Make sure we have a FLASH op rep out over all US national circuits.
And get through to Admiral Donnelly.
- No names.
- No names, sir.
Stack! Stackhouse!
Stack!
Are you OK?
Yeah.
- Shit, man. Are you OK?
- Yeah, l'm OK. You look terrible.
Yeah? Hey, man, that looks pretty bad.
Let me see this. Oh, man.
Oh, we gotta change this.
We need a field dressing on this.
Shit. Squeeze right here.
So... where are we, Mr Navigator Man? ln the mountains north of Miciovic.
You think they saw us eject?
We are not gonna be around to find out.
Reigart'll be curious what happened to his $40 million plane.
Forget it. l already tried.
You need to get to higher ground.
What?
You think it'll work up there?
Yeah. Just get high enough.
All right. All right, sit tight.
- Hey, Chris.
- What?
Listen, l should've dodged that second missile.
Yeah, you should've. You blew it.
You took me down with you. l thought you had great reflexes.
What happened? l used to have, like, a good pilot.
Man, you're slippin'. You need to watch it.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit.
Urgh!
Oh, goddammit.
(muttering) Son of a bitch.
Reconnaissance mission, yes?
Not bombing mission, right?
You photograph?
You alone?
Correct.
No!
Alpha Whiskey, this is
Ark Angel Zero Six. Over.
(garbled over static) Alpha Whiskey, this is
ArkAngel Zero Six. Over. Can you read me?
- What is that?
- Sorry, sir. There's some interference. lt's the beacon from the ejector seat, sir.
- Well, shut it off.
- Aye aye, sir.
Alpha Echo, Alpha Echo, Alpha Whiskey directs cease buzzer on Zero Six.
Alpha Whiskey, this is ArkAngel Zero Six.
Over. Do you read?
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Read you loud and clear. Go ahead.
Ark Angel is down. l say again.
Ark Angel is down, and l am on the run.
Slow down. What is your count?
Minus one. Stackhouse. They shot him.
No names over the net.
Confirm your last.
Minus one. Confirmed.
Serbs in camo shot my pilot.
You're saying a uniformed soldier killed your flight officer?
No, l'm saying they executed him.
They talked... They were talking to him, then they shot him in the head.
All right, calm down, son.
We're working on it. Wait one.
- How soon can your team be ready?
- We're ready now, sir. All l need is a ride.
Zero Six, consult your chart.
Reposition to rally point three. l read 133-41. Maintain radio silence.
We're comin' to get you, son.
Just get to the rally point.
- Understood?
- Zero Six copies. Out.
- Contact Piquet and Donnelly.
- Aye aye, sir.
Let 'em know l need a green light to go get my boy.
Command and control comes from Red Crown.
You men have three slicks loaded with
2.75 rocket pods and guns at your disposal.
Use advisedly. l want gimbal attachments for all fast ropers.
Team leaders report to me as soon as your squad is ready.
- (knock on door)
- Come.
Admiral, what's going on down there?
We have an F-18 down in southern Bosnia.
One pilot suspected dead.
Who authorized a search and rescue?
- l did.
- Call it off. Stand down, Admiral.
Maybe l didn't make myself clear. We have pilots down. One probably already dead.
Admiral, l have spoken personally to Bosnian military commanders.
They say the shoot-down was perpetrated by renegade forces attempting to disrupt the peace process.
Of course they say that.
They're also claiming, Admiral, that your aircraft was way off-mission. lf we fly in there we create a shitstorm, and the whole treaty will collapse.
Admiral, Burnett says that Serb troops murdered his pilot. ls your pilot an expert on Bosnia?
Can he distinguish between the uniforms of Serbs, Croats and Muslims?
Because l can't, and l've been posted here for five years. lf your man is in danger, he should get himself into a safe zone.
That is what he's briefed and trained to do.
Listen, Leslie. l can have your fleet commander order you to stand down, or you can do it yourself.
Alpha Whiskey, this is Zero Six. Come in.
Zero Six, go ahead.
Zero Six is at rally point three and standing by.
Zero Six, latest intel says your current location undoable for pickup.
Stand by to copy rendezvous point.
Say again your last. l am at the rendezvous point.
You need to hump it out to a safe zone. l set lP Cadillac. Canada 1-5,
Virginia 2-0. Read back.
No.
Negative. Negative. l do not understand.
Why is this spot not doable for pickup? l am good to go. l say again, l am good to go now.
Burnett!
Zero Six, you are a combat naval aviator.
Start acting like one.
You've been shot down.
Life is tough. l am very sorry.
Now you pull yourself together.
You do whatever it takes.
Create some angles between you and your pursuers.
Use your training. Use your head. Evade and survive, and we will bring you home.
Understand? We will bring you home!
Zero Six?
Zero Six?
Someone's coming.
- We lost the signal, sir.
- Shit.
- Where is he? Triangulate his position.
- We're on it, sir.
We're tracking him in the SClF, sir.
On me.
At ease.
Sir, we were able to track the emergency radio signal to somewhere in this radius. lt's pretty far away. But we think the pilot transmission came from here.
This is imagery from a Northrop Grumman relay satellite downlinked through Stuttgart.
We've hot-wired it for heat image, and it's streaming in now.
This isn't strictly legal, sir.
OK, here we go.
- That's Burnett?
- Yes, sir.
Fuck!
What's going on? He's down.
He been shot?
They're almost on him.
Son of a bitch.
- Why isn't he moving?
- Come on, Burnett, move.
(Reigart) They're right on him!
What are they doing?
What's goin' on?
Has he been killed?
He's moving. That's him.
Briggs, stay on it.
Resize and widen broadband.
- Stay with him. Stay with him.
- Plug it in with NSA.
- What the hell's going on?
- Damn it.
- That's not us. The door's closing.
- Well, fix it, for chrissakes!
We're down. lt's cooked. l want intel on this situation.
Who's chasing him, and why? Understand?
Yes, sir.
- (knock at door)
- Come.
Sorry, sir. Nothing in the last hour. l was trying to motivate him, Tom.
Sir?
Burnett. ln the radio room. l was... l was trying to motivate him, but... maybe l carried it too far.
Called him by his name. How stupid. Damn.
Just human, sir.
- Tom.
- Sir? lt's why l push 'em so hard.
For times like these.
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Come on, Tom.
You're gonna say whatever you're gonna say. Don't patronize me.
Sir, what in the hell are we doin'? We've got a guy on the ground, and we're sittin' here. lt's a complicated situation.
Why isn't this all over the news?
Why isn't the president on the phone to Pale, or whoever, makin' sure this kid gets out?
Well, he was off-mission.
Piquet has a point there.
All due respect,
Piquet's got his own agenda, sir.
Now, this kid might not have the best attitude, but he's no idiot.
- He says he's gettin' shot at, l believe him.
- What the hell do you expect me to do?
Command tells me l gotta sit on my hands.
What else can l do?
Right. l forgot. lt's not your call.
You're damn right it's not my call!
Apology, sir. Of course, you can't do anything.
(TV) lt's been confirmed that an American combat aircraft, an F-18 Super Hornet, has been shot down over Bosnia. lt was hit over Miciovic in southern Bosnia at around 6:00 yesterday morning.
Mr Burnett?
The pilot is feared dead, but his navigator is believed to have survived. lt's about your son.
Their names are being withheld, pending notification of their next of kin.
We still don't know who shot the F-18 down. lt's the Serbs who control most ofsouthern Bosnia, but they allege insurgents are to blame, and say they're doing everything to help locate the crew. lt's also unclear what, if any, impact this incident will have on NATO's withdrawal...
Admiral.
You and l have known each other for how long? Five years?
Something like that. l've always commended your work to your superior officers. l've sent you information whenever you requested it.
Thank you, sir. l appreciate your support.
And this is the thanks l get?
We have one disagreement over how to handle a downed pilot, and you stab me in the back?
You go to the media, to my contact, and you make me look like an asshole.
You brought him on my boat.
His press report is accurate.
Our man is down behind enemy lines!
Now what the fuck is the problem?!
Do you have any idea how much damage this incident may cause to the peace process?
All l know, Admiral, is that the American people want their pilot back.
Exactly! Americans. All you care about is your own damn pilots!
What happens when the fighting starts again?
Will America recommit its forces to stop a major war?
No. You don't have any control over that little detail, do you?
You might have helped save your man today, Reigart.
And l emphasize might.
But you have risked the lives of thousands tomorrow.
Shit!
Shit.
Argh!
Alpha Whiskey, Alpha Whiskey, this is Ark Angel.
They've got a signal. lt's Burnett.
Ark Angel Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
Go ahead, Zero Six. l'm on course with your last instructions.
Am keyed up and waiting for your... waiting for you to name the fairway.
Zero Six, this is Alpha Whiskey.
How you doin', son? l don't know. You tell me, sir.
The hard bit's over. You need to get yourself, uh, five clicks east, uh, to the sweet spot.
Understood?
Roger. Understand that spot to be friendly.
Good for birds ?
That's affirmative. Spot is friendly.
You need to get there, stay out of trouble and Big Mother will pick you up.
Next contact at, um...
Roger.
Alpha Whiskey?
Uh, go ahead, Zero Six.
Sir, l shouldn't have left Stackhouse.
Distract him.
Uh, Zero Six, your last transmission was garbled. Let's talk about your, um... your gear.
How's it holding up?
The gear's good. l have a basic pack. l left some of it at the crash site. l guess l got rattled when l ejected at Mach 3.
You still got your boots, haven't you, cowboy?
Roger. They were tied on.
You got it made.
You're an optimist, sir.
See, l had you figured for a grouch.
OK, Zero Six, just make it to the RP.
Roger.
Are you gonna be there, sir?
That's affirmative, son. Out.
He's here.
Yes, sir. l suggest we place him here. lt's open ground near the town of Hac, well inside the safe zone.
All right, let's go for the extraction.
(Reigart) ..command area responsibility. lngress will be north, egress south.
From the radio contacts, you can see he has basically circled back towards the crash site.
Call sign is ''Avalanche.''
Authenticate: ''Romeo Two, X-ray.''
Continue: ''Bulldog.'' Delay: ''Cycle.''
Abort is ''Washdown.''
Aircraft down is ''Cobalt.''
Success is ''Ripper.''
- Captain, you can take it from here.
- Thank you, sir.
Bravo will establish a perimeter, then haul ass back to the helo on my command...
Admiral Reigart.
Let me introduce Colonel Brigand.
He will conduct the pickup.
- Sir, my team is ready now.
- Get me Admiral Donnelly. l have spoken with Admiral Donnelly and have his full support.
You will stand down.
(Stackhouse, whispering) Chris.
Hey!
Yeah.
You American?
Nine millimeters?
Nine millimeter.
Do you have water?
Water? No water.
Thanks. lt's good. lce Cube.
Yeah. l like lce Cube. l like all hip-hop, uh, rap music.
West Coast, East Coast.
NWA, Public Enemy.
(raps)  They said stop, freeze l got froze up because l'm public enemy number one
One, one, one, one
That's good. That's good, that's good.
You know where we're going?
Hac.
Hac? That's good. Good.
Jesus Christ!
Tell him to go!
Hey, come on! Come on!
Hey. Bonjour.
Come on. Come on, let's go. Let's go, OK?
Whoa, whoa. Hold it. l'm an American soldier that's been shot down.
Shut up.
- What were you bombing?
- No bombing. We were taking photographs.
Photographs of what? Of what?!
Lokar's come back here again, killing everyone. lt's true. Lokar killed everyone. Children, women... Buried them up in the hills. ln the hills?
Yes, l saw them. l saw the graves.
Yes, l saw them. l saw the bodies in the hills.
Tell him. l am an American. l am on your side.
- That's what l'm sayin'. We're on your...
- Then you go outside.
Tell them you are an American.
- They don't kill American.
- lce Cube, tell them.
Tell this guy that we have photographs that can help...
Bullshit!
America say they make them sign deal.
- l swear to God...
- But they already break it!
America government for shit! Now go!
Hey, hey, hey... lt's OK. lt's me.
Come on.
Time?
Three minutes, sir.
Stop! Shh.
Let's go.
Reigart.
(Piquet) Leslie, l'm afraid there's bad news.
The Bosnian-Serb Fourth Army Patrol found Lieutenant Burnett near Hac. l regret to inform you that Lieutenant Burnett is... dead.
- l am sorry, Leslie.
- Thank you.
There's meant to be a peace deal.
Hac was meant to be a safe haven.
Yet once again in Bosnia, that's proved an illusion.
And in the midst of fighting around the southern enclave,
Bosnian Serb forces announced they'd found the body of the American navigator,
Lieutenant Chris Burnett, whose plane was shot down two days ago.
The Serb authorities are claiming he was shot by Muslim guerrillas, opposed to the recently signed
Cincinnati Peace Accord.
(CNN reporter) The Serbs say the body was discovered by one of their teams in a search-and-rescue attempt since the F-18 was shot down two days ago.
This incident is bound to spoil NATO's hopes for a clean exit from the Balkans, and frustrates US military leaders, only days away from a withdrawal from Bosnia.
(Sky reporter) For NATO's forces on the eve of their departure, the news ofLieutenant Burnett's death comes as another dark blow at the end ofa disturbing and ultimately unsuccessful chapter in the alliance's history.
Savior Six, Savior Six from Gold Eagle command.
Be advised the package is not in position.
Mission is scrubbed.
Return to base immediately.
Hey!
Hey! Wait!
We're here!
Come on! Fuck! Damn it!
We're right here!
You've gotta be shitting me!
Son of a bitch!
They killed him, and we did nothing!
- Captain...
- We did nothing!
We did nothing.
We were right here.
We were right... Fuck!
What's that? lt's not safe here. We'll keep going.
No. You go.
They killed my pilot because we took pictures of the graves.
And l know where they are.
And l'm gonna get 'em, so he didn't die for no reason.
Don't follow me. lt's safer here.
Shit.
Goddamn. Why is this off?
Why is this off? Why is this...?
Come on.
Come on! Goddammit!
All right. OK. OK, come on. Come on.
Yeah! Yeah. Yeah.
(PA) For the information of all hands, this ship will be relieved on station. lt will set course for home base, effective 2300 this evening.
- Sir? Your presence is requested in the SClF.
- All right, thank you. lt's the homing beacon, sir.
On the second ejection seat.
The only way to reactivate it is from the seat, manually.
- How long has that been on?
- Seven minutes.
Sir, you've gotta be very familiar with our systems to reactivate that beacon.
- That's Burnett.
- Sir, it could be a setup. lt's a radio transmission.
They are hearing the same music.
Sir, l agree.
Sir, we really should notify NATO command, or at least contact Donnelly for clearance.
- Of course, that will take a lot of time.
- Tom, l get it. We wait, Burnett dies.
Piquet was very clear with his objections, sir.
- You will lose your command for this.
- So be it. l'm not gonna let that kid die out there while we sit around on this ship!
OK. All right. OK.
OK, all right.
Goddamn!
Gentlemen, l wanna make one thing clear before we leave. l intend to put you in harm's way.
Any man who doesn't wish to join this mission, step away right now.
All right, then.
Let's go get our boy back.
About two clicks up this valley, we're gonna make a hard right.
Argh!
Argh...
(Reigart) There he is. There he is!
Come on! Come on!
Damn it! What the hell is he waiting for?
Come on!
Come on! Come on, kid! lt's too hot to set down.
We'll have to cover him aloft.
Goddammit!
Come on!
OK.
Go!
Captain, fast rope. Go get him.
Sir, he's on the rope.
- Sniper in the open.
- We'll take him.
Come on, son. Come on!
Go!
They got him! Pull up! Pull up!
Hey, Chris.
Hey, Glen.
Admiral.
This is why they killed Stackhouse.
Admiral?
You were holding a letter for me. l'd like to get it back. l think l can find it.
And everybody wants to see you suffer
They know that you need the pain so much
They throw you up a rope when you're too high to cruise, baby...
Lord, you lose, lady
Then they charge you with the rescue blues
The rescue blues
And everybody wants to see you fall
That's why they always love to get you high, high
And everybody knows you need the pain so much, lady
Keep in touch, baby
Just don't charge me with your rescue blues
Oh, oh
Rescue blues

DECEMBER 16, 1944
On the other side of the world,
the Allied forces are pounding
the Germans with relentless force.
We do not expect to have
a winter lull in Europe.
We expect to keep striking...
HEADQUARTERS BATTALION
V CORPS
1944, December.
I was miles from the front,
and a stranger to war.
Troops, fuel dumps, enemy units.
They were pins on a map to me.
Champagne? Are you trying to score a few points?
Just trying to aid the war effort, Hart.
- Tom?
- Sir?
The captain needs a lift back to the 106th. Can you find him a driver?
- I can take him, sir.
- Funny. I had a feeling you'd say that.
- There isn't much movement today, sir.
- So I see. Captain.
Oh, don't forget, sir. You wanted to send some of that champagne along as well.
Yes. Thank you for reminding me, Tom.
The general should get a kick out of that.
Sir.
... are now fighting
along a battle line of 300 miles
in northern France and Germany.
Within ten weeks after the first
landings in France last June,
the Allies had landed
nearly two million men.
You know what this army could use, sir?
Snowplough service.
We could use half a million gallons of gasoline and a road or two that wasn't paved with Bouncing Betties.
- German S-mines.
- Yes, sir.
You really ought to spend a night on the line sometime, Lieutenant.
- I know that, sir.
- Of course, it's not too likely, is it?
- Sir?
- Colonel says your father is a senator.
So I guess you won't spend too many nights in a foxhole, will ya?
It's nothing to be ashamed of, son.
That's a hell of a father to have.
- Where to, sir?
- St Vith.
I'm afraid you're going the wrong way, sir.
St Vith is due west.
I'm pretty sure St Vith is due east,
Sergeant. Straight ahead.
Can I see that, sir?
I drove this route yesterday, Sergeant.
Get your hands up!
Up!
See what's in the box.
It's nailed shut.
Could be wine or champagne.
Halt!
Are you in great pain?
First Lieutenant Thomas Hart.
Serial number
Would you care for a cigarette?
Your train is an eight-kilometre march from here.
Of course, with some shoes on you might be all right.
First Lieutenant Thomas Hart.
Serial number 1841287.
Thank you, Lieutenant. But we both know there is much more to you than that.
Show me the locations of the fuel dumps.
Just point, and we can end all this.
Get the lieutenant's uniform.
I'll have your clothes returned to you immediately.
When you are dressed we'll have another chat. A last one, I hope.
Smile, Joe. For you, the war is over.
Lieutenant. This'll help against the cold.
No, thanks, soldier. I'll be all right.
No, you won't. Come on, take it.
Just till you warm up.
Take it, sir.
Hey, Captain, does somebody
tell our folks about us being captured?
The Germans give a list to the military, the military notifies the families.
Is that voluntary, sir?
How do you mean, Lieutenant?
I mean, can you ask them not to?
I don't think so.
Have to put some straw in there.
Straw. In your shoes.
For frostbite.
Another slave detail, sir.
Hey, ladies! Next batch of shells you turn out, nothing but duds this time, all right?
Mortars no boom-boom, ja?
Captain! P-51, incoming!
- Ours?
- Everybody get down!
Everybody stay down! Keep low!
- Captain, why are they shooting at us?
- They can't read the roof.
Unhook the engine!
All right, get the doors!
Everybody, get the doors!
Hart, help them!
Get to the other cars!
Get those men out! We're spelling out!
Round up your men now!
We're spelling out!
We're spelling out!
Hart! Get that man clear of here!
All right, men, get in line!
Assemble on me!
Move it! Move it!
We're spelling out!
All right, men! Let's get back in line!
Don't you fuckin' die on me. Oh, God.
Aw, Christ.
OK, keep looking at me.
Look at me. Look at me.
- Shit. Shit.
- I couldn't get to him, sir.
You're all right. It's all right.
Stand still!
Easy, son. Easy.
They're telling us to march.
Probably ought to take his boots, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant! Take his boots! Cos either you or some Jerry's gonna get 'em.
Take 'em, sir, while you still got feet to put 'em on.
His socks, too. Ain't gonna help him any.
Stay together. Six abreast.
All right, let's do what they say.
I'm sorry.
STALAG VI A
AUGSBURG, GERMANY
Once again,
I'm forced to remind you, escape is not a sport.
Think of it this way.
Now these Russians have a chance at a Happy New Year.
Those are dogs you're saluting, Colonel.
Animals.
Untermenschen.
My country doesn't make those kind of distinctions, Colonel.
They don't make such distinctions.
They're our allies, Colonel.
Oh, yeah, you and your allies.
Let me tell you about you and your allies.
The Ministry of War has released figures from our offensive in the Ardennes.
200,000 Allied killed or captured.
Your Third Army, Patton, in full retreat.
And the Wehrmacht has captured enough abandoned fuel to retake Paris, perhaps even drive your troops back to the sea.
Might be a bit crowded around here this winter.
- Major Fussel?
- Take them to de-lousing.
Turn around, Joe.
Yeah, that's it. Turn around.
Ross? Hart?
Ross and Hart?
Captain Ross.
Major Clary.
- Lieutenant Hart.
- Lieutenant.
Debriefing, gentlemen.
Officers' hut. On the double.
... German offensive
on the American front is still going on.
The entire front, stretching about
30 miles south of Monschau, is in motion.
Countermeasures are being taken...
Got a pack of Chesterfields. I'll trade you.
- Sure.
- This is a major German effort.
Some of the best units in the German
army are involved in this penetration.
At ease, soldier. Sit down.
Thank you, sir.
So tell me, Lieutenant, how come you're not dead?
Sir?
First you survive crashing that Jeep, then Hans and Fritz take your boots.
You got a rabbit's foot in your pocket?
Two horseshoes and a four-leaf clover, sir.
Attaboy.
And by the way, you might want to take it easy on that bread.
You've had nothing solid for a while.
Don't want you to end up in the infirmary.
I don't know, sir.
After the march I just made, an infirmary might look like the Waldorf to me.
Well, stomach can shrink quite a bit in 17 days.
That's the number, isn't it? 17 days?
Six days on the train, another six days of marching.
What was it, Joe?
Five days of interrogation?
No, sir.
Three days.
Well, anyway, easy does it.
Yes, sir. Thank you.
So, this interrogator they threw at ya.
His name wasn't Schumann, was it?
No, sir.
Lutz.
Schumann was a real prick.
Almost broke me in two.
Goon up.
- Not much for small talk, I guess.
- Yeah, you'll come to appreciate that.
Smoke, Lieutenant?
Would you care for a cigarette?
Again, Lieutenant, I need to ask you.
The fuel dumps?
Thank you.
So this Captain Lutz, he know much about your operations at the chateau?
He knew everything, sir.
Fuel dump locations? Troop movements?
Sir, he knew what I'd had for breakfast the morning of my capture.
Point, and we can end all this.
Just name, rank, and serial number.
Good enough.
You're excused, Lieutenant.
Unfortunately, we won't be able to quarter you here. Full up.
Gonna have to put you in Barracks 27.
Isn't Barracks 27 for enlisted men, sir?
Yes. But as you can see, the Germans are doing rather brisk business these days.
You'll be comfortable there.
Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.
Point!
Point! Or say hello to stumps for the rest of your life!
Good.
Donny, you in? I call.
Hold your water, Joe. Looks like a whole division just surrendered.
Who's in charge here?
- All right, how many we up to?
- Three lovely ladies, big shot.
Excuse me. I'm looking for who's in charge here.
From the looks of things,
I'd say Adolf Hitler.
I'm Lieutenant Tom Hart.
It's OK, fellas.
Staff Sergeant Vic Bedford.
Good to meet you.
- You, too.
- You just come in from Ardennes?
Yeah. Colonel sent me over to bunk in here. Officers' barracks are full.
Well, in that case, welcome to Rio.
Hope you don't mind, sir, all we have is this middle bunk right here.
Middle's fine.
- I'm betting you're a Lucky Strike man.
- You bet right.
Care for some hooch?
Ringing in the new year.
No, thanks.
It's fermented raisins, mostly.
A little turpentine for flavour.
- I'm fine.
- We got anybody left on the front, sir?
- How are you, Lieutenant?
- It's all the guards talk about.
- What the hell happened, sir?
- Give him a break. He just got here.
Guard 'em with your life. They double for cash here, especially with the guards.
- Thanks, Sergeant.
- Excuse me a second.
Fellas! Listen up.
Lieutenant Hart here is gonna be staying with us for a while.
Men.
Say, what's it take to get in that poker game?
- I expect we can work something out.
- Good.
Sir, you about a size ten?
Why? They got a Woolworths behind one of these barracks?
You never know.
Just piss on him, sir.
It's the only thing that gets 'em moving.
Happy New Year.
Raus! Raus!
Happy New Year!
It's 1945!
Happy New Year!
10Â½ was the best I could do with the holiday season and all.
Look at the smile on this guy.
Socks, too. Could've used those in the HÃ¼rtgen.
- What, you don't like trench foot?
- Sure.
It's just once my toenails turned black,
I didn't have a single purse that matched.
Major Fussel.
- Square 'em up, Major.
- Yes, sir.
Barracks, attention!
Look at this. Got those poor bastards going around the clock now.
See that factory out past the north tower?
Germans making bombs right under our noses.
Supposed to be a shoe factory. Instead, they got Russians making mortar shells.
What the hell is that?
- Oh, they're fliers.
- They got niggers flying airplanes now?
332nd Fighter Squadron.
Read about 'em in Yank magazine.
I'll be damned. Well, we got us some nigger officers.
Fuckin' Jerry's right.
We must be losing this war.
...five, six, seven, eight.
Lift. Lift.
Lieutenant.
Sir.
- Looks like it'll be a good show.
- Yeah, it does.
It's high stakes around here, sir.
What do you mean?
Half the smokes in camp are riding on where you're putting the new men.
Where do you think we should put 'em?
I think I'd give 'em their own billet tent, sir.
Well, we can't do that.
I was thinking about putting them in 27 with you.
No, sir, wouldn't they be better off in the officers' barracks?
They don't carry enough weight to move two officers out of 22.
I can't make them the only two officers in the enlisted men's barracks.
You're in 27. Figure you could keep an eye on 'em for me.
Sir, I'm still new to that barracks. I don't carry a lot of weight with the men yet.
You got bars on your shoulder,
Lieutenant.
That ought to be weight enough.
- What do you got? Come on.
- I got two pair.
- Tastes like chicken, right?
- No. No. Maggots.
- It's protein. Eat.
- You call?
- What do you got?
- Three pair.
Gonna have to make some room in here, fellas. Come on in, men.
We got two more guests.
Second Lieutenants
Lamar Archer and Lincoln Scott.
You got to be kidding, sir.
They're gonna live here?
Two officers just entered the barracks.
Where's your salute?
What's the big idea, sir?
I mean, we're all full up in here.
- Not any more. Croutch? Krasner?
- Yes, sir?
You're reassigned. Barracks 28. Colonel wants you situated before lockdown.
Goon up.
- What were you flying?
- P-51 bomber escorts.
Must be a shitload of dead bomber crews scattered across Europe.
See these bars, Sergeant?
Don't make you fit to share with white folks, boy.
- Bedford!
- That's "Lieutenant Boy". You got that?
Call yourself whatever you want.
You're still just a nigger to me.
- I didn't quite catch that, Sergeant.
- All right! That's enough.
Something like that, OK? And you're gonna do a "stop and go". All right?
Set! Go!
Over here!
Nice, Johnny! Nice!
Ready? Go.
Uh-oh. Deadline.
Lieutenant! You mind grabbing that, boy?
Come on, let's go.
Cromin? Come here.
Do your route.
Do your route. Do your route.
- I'm going. I'm going.
- Halt, Kriegie! Halt! Halt!
- Nice one, sir.
- Cookie! Hey! More bread. More bread.
- Das ist verboten!
- Touchdown! Touchdown!
Das ist verboten, Bedford!
Bon appÃ©tit!
Shit.
Son of a bitch.
Nobody moves.
- How bad, Sergeant?
- It's just a nick. I'll be fine.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Joe, right here!
Fuck 'em.
- Go get that hand looked at.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Bedford. Cigarettes?
You're a regular bank, Vic.
Mm-hm.
- How's the hand?
- That really what you came to ask me?
No. Major Clary told me that you went to see him to lodge a complaint.
- Yeah.
- About Lieutenants Archer and Scott.
I'm sure he'll take it up with Eisenhower the first chance he gets.
They don't belong here.
Nobody belongs here. But this is where the colonel put them.
Yeah. I bet you wish the colonel had given you that open bunk in the officers' barracks right about now, huh, Lieutenant?
I mean, this is hardly the Waldorf.
Ain't that right?
We're not gonna have a problem about this. Understood?
What'd you do before the war?
For a living.
I was in law school. Second year.
- Harvard?
- Yale.
- Meet many coloureds up there?
- A few.
Yeah, well, I dealt with their kind.
Two years I was on the police force in
East St Louis, and I know what they are.
So let's not pretend we're fuckin' neighbours.
- You finished, Sergeant?
- No, I'm not finished.
We never did set on a price, did we, for them boots and socks?
It might be as cold as the North Pole here but that don't make me Santa Claus.
What do you want?
I'll take your watch.
This was a gift from my father.
I'm bettin' your daddy can afford you another one.
This gonna buy me a little civility, Sergeant?
Tons.
Oh, that was great.
Oh, baby.
Not much of a picture, is it?
Well, we do feel a little misled, sir.
The guard told us they'd be showing
The Life and Times of Jesse Owens.
You know, you men can sit up front with everyone else.
We're fine, sir.
Nobody's gonna bother you.
I said we're fine, sir.
Take your places!
Barracks, attention!
- How was that?
- Nice, DW. That was 18 inches.
- Come on, Joe. It was two feet at least.
- Hey, either way, my record still stands.
- Up! Up! Up! Raus! Raus!
- Everybody, out of your beds!
- Out!
- Raus!
- Raus!
- Out! Out of beds!
Attention at the bunks! Attention at the bunks! Now, now, now! Now!
Who is the ranking man in here?
Lieutenant Thomas Hart.
One of your men was out on the compound tonight, Lieutenant.
He was spotted on the east field removing a spike from one of the billet tents.
Your men are aware of this camp's policy concerning the possession and concealment of weapons, are they not?
Major, no one has left this barracks.
- Wait a minute. What the?
- Quiet!
- This is a plant! Somebody put that in...
- Quiet. Quiet!
- Mitkommen. Mitkommen!
- You bastard, I heard you go out!
- I shoulda seen this coming!
- Where are you taking him?
Examples must be made, Lieutenant. We take the safety of our men very seriously.
- Major!
- Where are y'all taking him to?
What did he do?!
Lamar!
Hey, Lamar!
Lamar!
Fire!
I'll fuckin' kill you.
I'll fuckin' kill you, Bedford!
You put that spike there!
- Watch your mouth, nigger!
- He put that spike there! Get off of me!
- Lincoln, look at me. Lincoln, look at me.
- Get off of me! Get off of me!
Can I let you go? Lincoln?
It was a minor offence, Colonel.
This man deserved 15 days in the cooler.
- Not execution.
- He attempted to escape.
Bullshit. You dragged him out of his barracks, barely clothed.
Your men lined him up and shot him.
He wasn't trying to escape any more than those Russians you hung the other day. Was he a dog?
A lesser race?
There's a word you Americans use, as I remember.
But, of course, your country doesn't make such distinctions.
And neither do you, I'm sure.
He was an officer.
A lieutenant in the Army Air Corps.
Yeah.
That's why you were so eager to welcome him and the other one into your barracks.
Look at that, Colonel. We had every right to question a man for concealment of a dangerous weapon.
This man had rights too. The Geneva
Convention specifically forbids...
Take a look around you, Colonel.
This is not Geneva.
- Where are you going?
- To check on my men.
You're welcome to do so, of course.
In the meantime, I'll be looking in on your barracks to listen to what's on the BBC this evening.
"Goon up!"
Now, go see your men, Colonel.
Good night.
Excuse us, Captain.
How's Scott holding up?
It's hard to tell. He isn't saying much.
He was asking about the body.
And there were some personal effects.
Dog tags.
- Come on!
- Get him!
- Come on, boys!
- Yeah!
- How does that taste, you bastard?
- Careful, Bedford.
That's a nigger you're rooting for.
Tail's painted red.
Means he's 99th.
Right out of Tuskegee, boy.
Clear the barracks!
- Come on! Let's get him out!
- Get him out of there!
The theatre! Get on top of the theatre!
Get him to the doc, now!
Come on! I want men down here!
- Get this! Come on!
- Come on! Come on!
Go over the top. Let's go!
We need some more buckets!
Quick! Come on!
Come on!
Let's go!
- Move it around this corner.
- Yes, sir.
You know where I wish I'd never been?
- Where's that?
- The goddamn Waldorf.
It's not personal.
He just can't stand being lied to.
- I never lied to him.
- Don't.
You hung yourself the minute he debriefed you.
That guy Lutz they threw you in with?
He was a level-one interrogator.
McNamara had him, too.
When a guy won't talk, they just keep kicking him up the ladder.
Level two, level three. It takes weeks.
He was in there for a month.
The only guy you saw was Lutz.
And he spit you out of there in three days.
- All I gave him was name, rank...
- See, the colonel's not like you and me.
He's West Point, fourth-generation.
He was raised on all this.
So crap like this, catching a junior officer in an obvious lie...
All it does is remind him of how far away he is from the real war.
The one he's supposed to be fighting.
You see?
- Knock it off, huh?
- What the hell is he doing?
- What you doing, Lieutenant?
- Goddamnit, Lincoln.
We shoulda sold some tickets for this one.
Halt, Kriegie! Hands up! Stop!
Halt!
Raus! Raus!
Move it. Move it.
Two of your men dead in two days, Colonel.
It seems you've lost control of your company.
Will Lieutenant Scott be granted the right to stand trial?
Major Fussel saw him standing over the body. I would say he's had his trial.
Any prisoner accused of a crime against another has a right to a trial.
And if the boy were being held in Alabama, there wouldn't be any trial.
Is this not so?
Yeah, maybe you're right, Colonel.
Maybe we should just forget the trial.
Let's just drag him out and shoot two holes in his chest like you did with Lieutenant Archer.
A trial.
A court martial, like in your American movies?
Yes?
Yeah, something like that.
That should be fun.
Yeah.
All right, Colonel.
You may conduct it in your theatre here.
Take him away.
Colonel, my men are in this theatre every day.
We'd like to erect a billet tent to house the proceedings.
No. Your theatre will do nicely. You have until the end of the week for your trial.
It's a capital charge. The trial will take more than a few days.
1,000 American prisoners from the
Ardennes will arrive over the weekend,
- and I'm putting them in your theatre.
- Colonel, I just explained...
Colonel!
Saturday, your theatre is mine.
Take the body to the morgue.
Wait. Colonel!
This is a murder site.
- I beg your pardon, Lieutenant?
- I said this is a murder site.
The body and everything around it are now evidence.
This area cannot be disturbed until everything is photographed.
Of course.
Leave everything alone.
I'm appointing you counsel for Lieutenant Scott.
- Sir, I'm not a lawyer.
- You sounded like one a minute ago.
I could be a material witness. I mean,
I heard the lieutenant going out.
The lieutenant needs our help.
I've appointed you counsel.
Understood?
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed, Lieutenant.
Sir.
And this guy that's prosecuting me, this Captain Sisk.
Is he a real lawyer?
- Yes.
- That sounds about right.
I think we have to paint this thing as a fight, Scott. That's all.
Just a fight that got a little out of hand.
You're supposed to ask me if I did it first.
Look, I came here to kill Nazis.
If it was crackers I wanted to kill,
I'd have stayed in Macon.
- Fussel ID'd you standing over the body!
- Fussel is a Nazi!
No. Fussel is a witness.
And he's enough to hang you.
Look, all I'm saying is if it was a fight that got a little out of hand, it's not murder.
It's manslaughter.
Do you understand that?
Man, oh, man.
Can I fire you?
- Now, look, Scott, I'm just trying...
- If it's a coloured guy on trial, and it's a white man who's been murdered, there's no such thing as manslaughter.
Don't you know that?
Or is that something that they teach you in the third year of law school?
What did you expect from me, anyway?
"Y-Yessir, boss!"
"Thank you, boss. You're mighty kind."
Is that the way a railroaded coloured man acts where you're from?
- Nobody's railroading you.
- The only real lawyer is prosecuting me, and I'm stuck with you defending me!
That's how the colonel wanted it.
Yeah, but I ain't being railroaded.
Barracks, fall out!
- I'll meet you back at the barracks.
- Yes, sir.
- Well, Lieutenant?
- I'm going to need a few things, sir.
- Who has Bedford's personal effects?
- We do.
I'll need to see them. And the photographs that were taken of the scene.
And, of course, his body.
What did Scott tell you?
Sir?
You were with him all day.
What did he tell you?
- I'm sorry, sir. I can't reveal that.
- Sure you can.
Attorney-client privilege, sir.
Only an attorney has attorney-client privilege.
I need to be briefed on everything that Scott intends to testify to.
Sir, you're president of the court martial.
How can I possibly discuss our case with you?
Are you suggesting that
I would betray Lieutenant Scott?
That I would share details of his case with the prosecution?
No, sir.
Scott followed Bedford out through the night latrine.
If he testifies to it, the Germans will know how we get out of barracks after dark.
And every man in this camp would be compromised. Are you following this?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
Scott will testify that he went out through a hole beneath the stove in the barracks.
And you will make certain that he is clear on that. Do we understand each other?
We do, sir.
Dismissed.
- Permission to speak, sir?
- Speak freely.
Scott thinks this is all just for show.
He thinks you passed sentence as soon as the body hit the ground.
Is he right?
Bedford's footlocker is in my barracks.
I'll make sure you get it.
Not much to look at, is he?
Did you know him?
No, not personally.
But my guards certainly seemed to.
These are for you.
Thank you.
- How well?
- Hm?
Your guards. You said they knew him. How well?
Well, you'll have to ask them about that.
This is yours too, I believe.
We found it on his wrist.
But with the inscription and new boots on your feet, I made the assumption.
It's a little hard to imagine, Colonel.
Your guards sitting for an interview.
I can arrange it.
I can arrange anything you like.
It seems only fair, what with your colonel throwing you to the wolves.
- I'm not sure I follow you.
- Really?
Yale isn't in the habit of accepting halfwits.
At least, it wasn't when I was studying there.
Oldest member of the class of '28.
My fellow students voted me "Hardest Worker".
But we can swap stories some other time, can't we?
Right now you've got a trial to prepare for.
It's a sincere offer, Lieutenant.
Anything I can do to help.
Truly.
Exactly where were you,
Major Fussel, on the night in question?
I was walking the area behind
this theatre and the Australian compound.
- At about what time?
- Maybe about one o'clock in the morning.
And can you tell the court what you saw?
The Schwarze Lieutenant Scott was kneeling over the body.
It looked to me like he was checking that the man was dead.
- I blew my whistle, and he started to run.
- And what did you do next?
Ja, I would have shot, but it was dark.
And so was he.
- How well did you know Sgt Bedford?
- A little, I think.
- You traded with him regularly.
- "Traded"?
Bartered. Cigarettes for a pair of boots.
Chocolate for some spare parts.
No, I never did this.
A Kriegie trading with a German soldier?
I never saw it.
May I repeat what he actually said, Captain?
You may, Private.
Lieutenant Scott said "I'll kill you.
I'll fuckin' kill you, Bedford."
Corporal, have you ever heard any other man threaten a fellow soldier?
"I'll kill you if you touch my cigarettes again." That sort of thing?
- Yes, sir.
- I bet you've made such a threat yourself.
I suppose so.
Did you ever actually kill any of the men you threatened in this manner?
No, sir.
But I'm not coloured. I can control myself.
So you, too, heard the threats made by the accused against Sgt Bedford?
Your Honour, this being the fourth witness called to testify on this matter, if the defence stipulates that the accused did threaten Sergeant Bedford, could we dispense with any further testimony to it?
Sgt Webb is being called as an eyewitness to the crime itself.
- He's what?
- Is that right, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
- Sir, that's a lie!
Your Honour, the Sergeant will testify that he saw through a window in Barracks 27 as Lt Scott accosted Sgt Bedford outside the theatre and broke his neck.
Your Honour, I was with Sgt Webb at the exact time of the murder. He saw nothing.
The hell I didn't.
You don't know what I saw.
Sir, I request that you instruct this witness as to the consequences of perjury!
He put his hand on the Bible and swore to tell the truth.
- Objection, Your Honour!
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
- His bias alone demands...
- Lieutenant!
Sit down, please.
I'll catch up with you.
Webb? You're a lying sack of shit.
You know that?
- You ought to mind your own business...
- This doesn't concern you, West. Or you.
- George S Patton just showed up.
- Return to your barracks, Corporal.
Take your two friends with you.
It's OK.
So, what is it, Webb? Up there, today?
What, do you think you owe it to Vic?
Why are you so bent about that flying bellhop?
- He's a soldier.
- Vic Bedford was a soldier. He fought.
He had courage. But you wouldn't know much about that, would you, Lieutenant?
You lied in there today. You didn't see what happened any more than I did.
I didn't have to.
- I know it.
- Not good enough.
It's good enough for McNamara.
Sorry about what happened in there today, Lincoln. I didn't see it coming.
That's the first time you've seen a man lie through his teeth holding his hand on the Bible?
I was writing a letter to my father.
I figured I should tell him first.
He was part of the 369th Infantry in the last war.
"The Old Fifteenth".
They was the first Negro troops to go into action in France.
Did your father serve?
Mm. My father was in headquarters.
He had an eight on his shoulder, too.
His father made sure of it.
That's how we do things in our family.
That's a shame.
Got your testimony to prepare.
Yeah.
Oberst Visser will Sie sehen.
Lieutenant. How are you?
Not too well, I imagine.
Come on up.
That was quite a beating you took today.
It's warm inside.
You read Mark Twain? He's wonderful.
- Colonel, I have witnesses to prepare for.
- Yes, I know.
It's why I wanted to see you.
We keep a library of all American military manuals.
I thought this one might be of particular use to you.
I can't accept this. We have a policy...
Lieutenant, without this, your client will face the firing squad.
Would that be better?
Your son?
Yes.
Where's he fighting?
He is not any more.
The Russian front. Novgorod.
Horrible place.
I'm sorry.
I killed my share of English and French, I suppose.
In the First War.
They had fathers, too.
It's verboten, you know?
Negro jazz.
These might be the only copies of their kind in the entire Reich.
But I'm quite fond of them.
Nice to read by, anyway.
Takes a man right back.
Take a seat.
Thank you for your time, Colonel.
Lieutenant.
Enjoy the manual.
Order, gentlemen. Captain Sisk, is the prosecution ready to call its next witness?
- We are, Your Honour.
- Begging the court's pardon, sir.
- Yes, Lieutenant?
- Before we continue, Your Honour, the court may have overlooked a few procedural matters yesterday.
Referring to the US Army
Manual for Courts Martial, chapter 12, sections 57 and 58.
Make your point.
According to these sections, the court must ask the accused if he wishes to challenge members of the court for disqualification before any pleas are entered.
A little late in the game for that, isn't it?
Nevertheless, it is a right specifically granted to the defendant.
Very well.
Does the accused wish to challenge any member of the court?
We do, Your Honour.
You, sir.
Request denied. Proceed, Captain Sisk.
Sir, according to chapter 12, section 58D, defence is allowed one challenge, not subject to any ruling by the court itself.
- Request denied, Lieutenant.
- Then the court must address section 58E which states the defence may disqualify a member of the board for cause if that member has displayed a bias toward the accused.
- This court has shown no bias.
- This court has demonstrated, in ex parte conversations before this hearing, a distinct prejudice against the accused, his case, and his counsel, sir.
Very well. Court will take a short recess to consider the matter.
Lieutenant Hart? Could I see you outside for a moment, please?
Sir?
Listen to me, you pampered little shit.
I will not be laughed at.
- Not by him.
- Sir, I'm just trying to protect my client.
Your client's about to lose his lawyer, Lieutenant.
- Sir?
- Article 32, contempt of court.
Article 70, intentional delay.
I know the book, too.
Forwards and backwards.
- Well, then you must know, sir, that...
- Shut up and listen to me, Lieutenant.
You will not accept anything from that commandant again. Is that clear?
You will not allow him to participate in these proceedings. Is that clear?
And you will never set foot in his office again without my permission.
Do we understand each other?
... and propaganda poured into the
ether as by the Germans over Strasbourg.
One minute you can hear Himmler himself
announcing that he will be in Strasbourg
by January 30th, the anniversary
of the Nazis coming to power in Germany.
The next, the Nazis are claiming
that two new divisions
are advancing on Strasbourg and that the
Americans are in full flight from Alsace.
The closer they get, the more
violent become the Nazi menaces,
and the more honeyed their promises.
Come in. Have a seat.
... are turning in our favour. We've checked
the Germans along the Moder river.
They'll come again, of course,
but the city now knows it can hope.
- Have a drink?
- Sure.
You can help me decipher some of this code coming through the BBC tonight.
I don't think you need my help, Colonel.
It seems pretty clear what they're saying.
It would seem so.
Or perhaps it's all propaganda.
How about that?
The citizens can't do much themselves
with their simple guns and rifles.
But they're standing up to,
and winning, the other war.
Strange thing about war wounds.
The older you grow, the less proud you become of them.
- You got another of these around here?
- Of course.
Good. Why don't you and I take a walk out on your compound and have ourselves an old-fashioned duel?
That would be fitting, wouldn't it?
But surely you can think of a more clever way out of this camp than that. Yes?
You think the war will wait for you?
Is that it, Colonel?
It won't, you know.
They never do.
You're drunk.
Yeah.
But I'm seeing things very clearly.
You know, sometimes I think your Lieutenant Scott might have been better off in Alabama.
Lynchings are over in minutes.
The kind of justice he's suffering here is far crueller.
Is that why you gave
Lieutenant Hart the manual?
I was merely trying to help the lad.
He's got enough to worry about without providing you with amusement.
Yes.
And he's got you to worry about, hasn't he?
Stay out of our business.
Forgive me, Colonel, but you're hardly in the position to hand out orders.
Especially to me.
For now.
Unless, of course, you think that's just the sound of propaganda falling out there.
Well, the idea was to follow Bedford
and catch him on the compound.
I wanted to drag him under the barracks
and put his face in the mud.
But by the time I got to him, he was already dead, behind the theatre.
His neck had been snapped.
That's when everything blew up.
Dogs, you know,
"Hands up!", and that was that.
Lieutenant, did you apply anything to your face or hands before going out?
- Shoe polish? Soot?
- No.
Defence exhibit one, Your Honour.
Photos of the deceased taken in the camp morgue.
The court will note black smudges on Bedford's right cheek and jaw.
Your Honour, what is the relevance of this?
To demonstrate to the court that whoever killed Vic Bedford was white.
I'd like the court's permission to conduct a demonstration.
I'd also ask the trial judge advocate to rise, if he would.
Proceed.
Based on Bedford's wounds and the fact nobody reported hearing him cry for help, we have to assume he was either friendly with his assailant, or whoever killed him did so from behind, the position being like this.
Captain, if you wouldn't mind grabbing at me, at my face, to get me to stop.
Now, of course, the killer had the benefits of leverage and surprise.
So the neck was snapped and Bedford fell.
And the smudge went with him.
It was also on his fingers. Captain?
I would like the court to note the following - whoever killed Vic Bedford had such a substance on his face on the night of the murder.
Which raises two questions: first, what call would Lincoln Scott have for darkening his face?
To look more black?
Second, if he had done so, when did he take it off?
Your Honour, you stood face-to-face with him after his capture. His face was clean.
I think it's fair to conclude that whoever killed Vic Bedford was not only white, but was waiting behind this theatre, face blackened to avoid detection by the guards.
Nothing further, Your Honour.
Lieutenant, you say that
Sgt Bedford sneaked out through a loose board beneath the barracks stove.
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
And you took that same route on the night in question after he'd gone out?
Yes, I did, sir.
- What did you find down there?
- Excuse me, sir?
What was down there on the ground?
Mud, right?
You stated that it had been your intention to put the victim's face in the mud until he begged you to stop.
So there was mud down there.
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?
- I suppose so.
- And a fair amount of soot from the stove.
So it's possible that Sgt Bedford, having descended through a hole lined with soot and then having crawled face down beneath a barracks wet with mud, might have emerged with mud and soot on his face.
Nothing further, Your Honour.
Thank you, Captain Sisk.
You may step down, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant Scott?
You know how hard they tried to wash us out of flight school? The coloured fliers?
Your testimony's been entered,
Lieutenant. You can step down.
It was test after test.
I mean, anything they could come up with to turn us into the cooks, or the drivers, or the shit-shovellers.
- Your Honour, this is unnecessary...
- But I refused to wash out.
So did Archer. I mean, come hell or high water, we hit the books.
We were just determined that we were not gonna spend the war
- being some niggers.
- That's enough. You will take your seat.
With all due respect, sir, I would like to exercise my right and address this court.
Now I've been "sitting down" ever since I got here.
I shoulda stood up and said something when you threw us in with enlisted men instead of quartering us properly as officers.
But it's OK.
Coloured men expect to have to jump through a few hoops in This Man's Army.
Archer knew that. We all did.
There's a camp, right outside of Macon, where I'm from.
And there the army sends the German POWs.
Puts 'em to work picking cotton.
But what's strange is, once in a while we'd see them walking through town, going to movies, eating in diners.
But if I wanted to go to those same movies, I had to sit way off in the balcony.
And those diners were closed to me, even in uniform.
But German POWs were allowed to sit there and eat.
And this must have happened to at least half the guys at Tuskegee.
But the thing is, we just kept telling ourselves that no matter what, as long as we did our jobs, it'd all be worth it.
Because, hey, the war would end, and we could go home and be free to walk down any street in America, with our heads held high, as men.
So that's what we did. We did our jobs.
We served our country, sir.
Archer and I.
And what you let happen to him, what you allowed to happen to him, was appalling.
And so is this.
At ease, Lieutenant.
How are they treating you?
No worse than the men in my barracks, sir.
- I could find you another blanket.
- No, I'm fine.
Here.
- Come to order.
- Before you proceed, Your Honour, the defence hasn't rested yet.
I'd still like to call one last witness.
Defence calls Oberst Werner Visser.
- This some kind of joke, Lieutenant?
- He's material to our case, sir.
Unless, of course, the colonel refuses to testify.
He does not.
Colonel, tell us the nature of your relationship with Vic Bedford.
I'll be happy to. I didn't have one.
And what about your guards, Colonel?
Major Fussel, for instance. Were you aware of his dealings with Vic Bedford?
At night? After lockdown?
That would be impossible in this camp,
Lieutenant. The policy forbids.
Do you remember the conversation we had in the camp morgue four days ago?
Vaguely.
I asked you if you knew
Vic Bedford, and you said
"No, but my guards certainly seem to."
- Perhaps.
- So, in your words, no guard ever traded with Vic Bedford and yet he was able to acquire winter boots, thick socks, fresh milk, and parts for a hidden radio.
Isn't that a fact?
Lieutenant, I'm sitting here as a gesture of military courtesy.
If it is your intention to paint me as a liar...
No, Colonel. It is my intention to establish that Vic Bedford built up enough of a rapport with your Majors Wirtz and Fussel to engage in the framing of Lamar Archer, conspiring with them in the tent spike incident, which resulted in Archer's death.
Lieutenant Archer was shot while attempting escape.
No, Colonel.
Lieutenant Archer was executed in return for information.
Archer dies.
Five minutes later, Colonel Visser and Major Wirtz enter Barracks 22, and destroy a hidden radio that they had been trying to locate for months.
Can you tell the court anything about these items, sir?
Identification papers, some currency. What of them?
Perfect German-made ID papers.
And Reichsmarks.
2,000 of them.
More than enough cash to make it through the country.
Bedford kept those beside his bunk.
Tell the court the nature of your relationship with Vic Bedford.
I did not have one...
Then do you have any idea how he may have gotten these items, sir?
If they didn't come from you, and if he never had any dealings with the guards...
The fact is, Colonel, Bedford traded with you and your men regularly.
- Objection, Your Honour! Objection!
- He came up dry so you had him killed.
Lieutenant Hart,
I thought you tried marvellously to establish that the killer had blackened his face with soot.
Now, if any of my guards, or even I, wanted to kill one of my prisoners,
Vic Bedford in this case, we would hardly need to blacken our faces to do it.
Would we?
Move. Get in the corner, Webb.
Captain?
You see?
German uniforms. Explosives.
Yes, Captain. I see.
The trial's got nothing to do with Lincoln Scott, does it?
No.
It's the way it had to go.
We're out of time, Hart.
We lose this theatre tomorrow.
Uh-huh. And I keep Visser and his men distracted while half the camp goes out?
Is that it, Captain?
I'm asking the wrong fuckin' guy.
I've just seen the tunnel, Colonel.
In here, Lieutenant.
Everything in this place is a lie.
Everything.
Jesus Christ.
First he told the Germans about the radio.
It was only a matter of time before he told them about the tunnel.
You killed Bedford.
That's right.
And if you fuck with this operation in any way, I'll kill you, too.
You will sit in that courtroom as
Captain Sisk drags out these proceedings.
Make whatever summation you like.
But that's it.
When that board breaks to deliberate,
35 men go under the wire.
- And Lincoln Scott will be dead.
- That's war.
- The war's at the front. We're not in it.
- Speak for yourself!
You know those Russians they march in and out of here?
- Know where they go?
- Munitions plant.
The army thinks it's a goddamn shoe factory.
Look,
I don't want to see Scott dead any more than you do.
But if one man has to be sacrificed to take out that target, that's the way it has to be.
- I agree completely, sir.
- Good.
But I think that one man should be you.
Don't worry, I'll play my part.
But at the end of the trial, you're going to tap your little gavel, you're going to stand up and confess to the murder. Your duty demands that!
Fuck you, Hart! What the fuck would you know about duty?
I'll see you in court, sir.
- Was ist los?
- "Was ist los"? I got a better question.
What was in that goddamn soup last night? I got 20 men with food poisoning.
Colonel! Whoa! Colonel.
You're in no shape for the trial, sir.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Here we go.
We'll convene as scheduled, after the Appell.
Square 'em up.
Barracks! Attention!
Come to order, gentlemen.
Captain Sisk, is the prosecution ready to present its summation?
We are, Your Honour.
Very well.
I'm sorry, gentlemen. Court needs a five-minute recess before summations.
Colonel? Colonel?
Let's get him back to the barracks.
Get his coat.
- You should get some rest, sir.
- All right. Come on. Back to the barracks.
- We need an extension. He's very ill.
- The agreement was the end of the week.
- It's a matter of courtesy, Colonel!
- The agreement was today!
I need to talk to you.
You any good at poker, Lincoln?
There's an escape going to take place later on this afternoon.
Escape? How's that?
Down a tunnel, through that burned theatre wing.
While the jury's in deliberations.
You mean this whole thing's been a joke?
Yes.
But Archer and Bedford are dead for real.
- Is that part of this big joke, too?
- Look, we haven't got time now.
During deliberations you're going out under the wire with 35 other men.
Is McNamara, too?
Yeah. McNamara, too.
It's funny. I was just writing my son.
And in the letter I was trying to explain to him what the word "honour" means.
Be a hell of a thing, wouldn't it?
To find out that your father helped
35 men escape from a place like this.
- Wouldn't it?
- You're going out too. You got that?
I can't do that, Tommy.
Suppose the board comes back and there's nobody in the defendant's chair.
- It doesn't matter. You'll be out.
- Then the search begins.
And all those men, they won't have a chance.
- Lincoln, if you stay, you'll be convicted.
- If I stay, those men are gonna have a chance.
And you'll be executed.
- Lincoln, listen to me. Please.
- Everything's fine, Tommy.
Everything's really OK.
Just as long as he knows what happened here.
As long as there's somebody to tell him.
How far could I get, anyway?
A coloured man running through the German countryside.
It'd be target practice.
It started with a noble idea.
Letting coloured men join the fight.
But no one in the Air Corps considered what might happen if one of those Tuskegee men ever got shot down.
No one ever asked what would happen if a coloured officer was suddenly captured and sent to a stalag like this one.
But Lincoln Scott was shot down,
and he was sent to a stalag.
And once here, he wasn't just
thrown in amongst white enlisted men,
he was quartered with them.
Men like Staff Sergeant Vic Bedford.
Bedford, the real Bedford,
was a man unknown to us.
Hateful, vengeful,
with a bigotry that ran bone-deep.
A man who couldn't stomach the thought
of sharing a roof with coloured officers.
So he badgered Scott, baited him, even refused to respect Scott's rank,
then conspired to kill
the only friend Scott had in this camp.
That's why Scott followed Bedford out on the night in question, crept up behind him, and snapped his neck.
Members of the board, we take no pleasure in prosecuting Lieutenant Scott.
But a capital charge requires that we
put aside our passions and sympathies, wedding ourselves solely to the truth.
It is this:
Lt Scott was positively, unimpeachably
identified at the scene of the crime.
He had motive, he had opportunity,
and he had an animus for the victim which was confirmed even by his own testimony.
Lincoln Scott is an officer.
He is a soldier.
But he is also a murderer.
There's a tenet that was drummed into all of us from our first day in basic.
Sometimes one man must be sacrificed
for the good of the men around him.
Someone has to be first to hit the beach, or to jump on a grenade,
or to draw enemy fire so coordinates
can be drawn for mortar teams.
Vic Bedford learned that tenet, too.
Except Vic got it backwards.
Vic thought sometimes a few hundred must be sacrificed for the good of one.
Him. For Vic, the watchword was expediency.
One day, he'd trade with our captors to get hard-to-find parts for a radio, earning the loyalty of our commanding officer.
Then Vic would tell the Germans
where to find that radio,
in exchange for
the murder of Lamar Archer.
The army has its share of cowards.
And Vic Bedford was one of them.
It also has heroes.
Soldiers like Lincoln Scott, who wanted nothing more than to serve his country. And serve he did.
Nine downed German fighters.
30 missions.
Until one of those missions landed him here. Stalag 6A.
Where Vic Bedford and the sad sacks
Bedford called friends were lying in wait.
Scott was a target from the second he got here.
He suffered insults, threats.
But he did not retaliate.
He did not kill Vic Bedford.
No.
Someone beat him to it.
It could have been any number of people.
A guard who thought that Bedford had cheated him.
A fellow Kriegie who discovered Bedford's treachery.
Even one of our officers as punishment for ratting out that radio.
So this, then, is our victim.
A bigot.
A traitor.
A rat.
Enemy of every Kriegie in camp.
The question is, who hated him enough to kill him?
Colonel.
I did.
- What are you saying, Lieutenant?
- I killed Vic Bedford, sir.
Come on, Colonel. Come on.
I want every man in the compound present for the execution of Lieutenant Hart.
- Very brave, ami. Very brave indeed.
- Colonel, this man has rights.
- Not any more.
- This court has to deliberate...
- I am the court now!
- Out! Get 'em up. Get 'em up. Get 'em up.
Get out, get out, get out.
Herr Oberst!
We have a problem with the count.
How many are missing?
The first count is 35.
Ready the execution.
McNamara is not in his barracks.
Herr Oberst.
I want every man who participated in that court martial removed from the line!
- Colonel, I demand...
- Silence!
Line them up for execution!
- Line them up! Now!
- These men knew nothing, Colonel!
That's quite a comfort.
Thank you. Line them up!
- You first!
- These men knew nothing.
- You will be the first!
- Colonel, they knew nothing!
Shoot them all! This one first!
Herr Kommandant!
So, your men are saboteurs as well.
No, Colonel. They're just soldiers.
They were following my orders.
I assume complete responsibility.
That's very noble of you.
Seems you've won our duel after all, Colonel.
No.
We both lose, don't we?
Yeah.
And now you wish to trade your life for theirs?
Yes, I do.
Very well.
We buried the colonel
in a marked grave behind the camp.
Three months later,
the German army surrendered.
Our stalag was liberated.
The war was over.
We returned home to America,
to our families,
where Lincoln Scott got the chance to
explain the word "honour" to his son.
Honour and courage.
Duty. Sacrifice.
Lincoln's son came to
understand those words.
And so have I.

It won't take off, will it?
Don't worry, not while I'm around.
Now what?
Take hold of the joystick.
- This thing here?
- See how it moves.
This is how we turn left, and right...
Look at the wings.
This is how we dive.
And this...
What's it doing?
Hey!
It's...
This is how we climb, Hanichka.
Aren't we going too high?
All the way to heaven.
Slama, is that all you've done today?
He's not well, Sir.
Come with me.
Sit down and write:
"Dear Family" comma,
"Do not send me any more food parcels"
"as I am not doing my job properly."
Sign it!
Sir, let him be.
He has a fever.
Mind your own business, Machaty!
Back to your place!
Back to your place!
Franta...
Back to your places!
What's your name?
Franta Slama.
Vilda Houf, sign painter.
In here for my appendix.
Look!
Locked up for stealing State property!
Some pots of paint.
Why are you here?
Pneumonia.
I mean, why did they lock you up?
I flew for the RAF.
In England.
I see!
Let there be no mistake.
This is a forced-labor camp.
You are educated men so you know what it means.
Our "amnesty" cart.
It has only one route to the cemetery and back.
The only amnesty you're ever going to know...
Lie on your side.
Better than on your back.
- Did you see that?
- What?
The tattoo on his arm.
He's an SS man.
You're kidding!
They're in the kitchen too.
You're in here with SS men?
So are you.
But I didn't fight against them.
There you go.
I did.
You know how you fly, Voytishek?
- A bit wild?
- No.
- Too much throttle?
- No.
I give up.
Like a natural.
Really?
Where's my dog?
Anyone seen my dog?
She ran to the hangar.
Of course,
Gregora's stuffing her with salami again.
Give me the hangar.
Line your pants gents
Tomorrow you're flying solo.
- Hangar.
- You got my dog there?
- Yes, Sir.
- Put her on the phone.
What?
On the phone?
That's what I said.
Take a look, gentlemen.
Barcha, come here!
She's on the line.
Barcha!
Where did I tell you to wait?
That's all, gentlemen.
Dismissed The show's over.
Barcha... Good girl...
Ssh.
My Papa!
Barcha.
Her Papa!
Silence!
Adolf Hitler speaks.
You're the one we've been waiting for, bastard!
Not you!
Quiet!
- You know what my mother said?
- What?
I'll end up marrying Kanka.
That lollipop-man down there?
- He'll be completely bald soon
- But he's set his sights on me.
And you think I haven't?
Quiet!
My parents!
- Think they don't know?
- Know what?
- That we're in love
- Of course they know, but not that I let you love me so... deeply!
What's that?
- That's him
- Who?
Kanka, of course.
He serenades me every night to touch my heart.
Hanichka.
I'm coming,
Papa Just a minute!
Hanichka, please open the door!
Papa...
- Good evening.
- Captain!
Mr. Pechar, let me explain...
They're repeating it over and over.
At six a.m. On March fifteenth
the Armed Forces of the German Reich
will begin occupying our country.
Any resistance will be met
with brutal retaliation.
I'm sorry.
Cry all you want.
Who wouldn't?
All units will be disarmed.
No aircraft, military or civilian,
are to leave their bases.
Turn it off!
Cut the engine!
I'm taking it to Poland.
We can't let them have it!
Pilot Officer, switch off your engine now!
Didn't you hear the order?
Yes, but I didn't like it.
Nobody's asked your opinion.
Get out!
Why d'you think the others aren't taking off?
Because it's suicide in this weather!
You'll crash into the first hill!
I know.
Everything is conspiring against us.
England, France, the weather, even my back, everything.
We should tell our men the Poles will need pilots, ground crews too, because Poland is next in line.
Nothing official.
Volunteers.
Preferably, single men.
They're here.
Slama, please take over I can't move.
Let's call it an order.
Yes Sir.
Good morning gentlemen.
Ober-Lieutenant Hesse!
It's my duty to take over this airfield.
Our commanding officer,
Wing-Commander Skokan is physically indisposed.
I'm in charge.
Lieutenant Slama.
This whole army seems
"physically indisposed".
What a lovely map!
So, yesterday we were here.
We had a good look at your famous defenses.
Abandoned without a shot?
As a soldier,
I can't understand it.
Sir, kindly do your duty and respect the honor of soldiers who have been forced to do theirs.
Keep your shirt on.
Just a little joke.
Now, I'd like to see the planes.
Gentlemen!
The keys, please.
All right boys, let's go.
I can imagine how you must feel.
A German officer would put a bullet in his head.
But you are... a little different, aren't you?
Pilot Officer Voytishek!
I've got a spare seat.
Thank you, but I'll stick with the boys.
You're taking it too personally.
How else!
I felt like throwing up in the hangar.
We carried out an order.
Now we can go home, take off our uniforms, and take it personally.
How long will it take you to pack?
Me?
No time at all.
Don't forget to brush out her ears.
Thistles get stuck in there.
She'll be grateful.
And in winter ice forms on these hairs between her pads.
They hurt her, so you have to cut them out.
But I'll be back well before then.
She'll listen to me?
Of course.
She knows you're a part of me.
What's this?
In case you come back at night and the house is locked.
Thank you.
You don't have any documents on you?
In case we're searched?
No, Mr. Slama.
Good.
And call me Franta.
And you can call me Karel.
I know.
I don't know how to put it...
Sir, I mean Franta... but I do have some documents
I'd like to take with me.
What are they?
No, forget it, I'll get rid of them.
You'd only laugh at me.
No, I won't.
Promise.
Let's see them.
Horses?
That's only camouflage.
There's worse.
She's my only girl.
I'd rather not part with her.
Your only girl?
- Then you should keep her.
- Thanks.
Sir,
I mean Franta!
Look!
Oh God!
Barcha, you mustn't do this.
Go home.
Go home!
Back to Hanichka.
Go home!
Go or I'll hit you!
What's she doing?
She keeps turning around but she is going back.
Direction, one-two-zero,
speed four-five-zero.
Permission to take off.
Blue Leader, Roger, direction one-two-zero speed two-five-zero.
Three planes, type Messerschmitt at one o'clock.
Do you see them?
I can't see shit.
Shut up!
We don't see them, Sir.
Are you maintaining your speed?
Yes, Sir.
We're pedaling like maniacs.
This is stupid.
I'm knackered!
You should see them by now!
We see them.
Telly Ho!
What's going on?
- Behind you!
- Break left!
You bastards.
Why don't you let us fly!
We are going to repeat
the whole exercise.
OK Roger.
- What's he saying?
- Get up. We're doing it again.
No! To hell with this!
It's not what I came here for!
On your bikes!
Do not inflate it all at once.
That dinghy has been folded flat and you've been sitting on it for a long time and if you inflate it all at once, it doesn't like it and can easily burst, and then you are in the soup... all understood?
Sysel, you try it.
My name is Mrtvy.
He is Sysel.
What'd he say?
Murphy?
Irish?
No, no Murphy.
Mrtvy.
In Czech it means dead man.
Bedrich Deadman.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Slowly, slowly!
You are dead, Sysel!
He says you're Myrtvy.
To take off.
To take off.
To take off.
Once again.
To take off.
Thanks.
May I keep her?
One week.
Try it, please.
To take off... to lend.
No, no, my dear.
To land.
"To lend."
You must be careful about pronunciation.
To "lend" means something quite different.
Your friend... your friend "lends" you his notebook.
He doesn't give it to you, because he wants it back, but merely "lends" it to you.
Do you understand?
No.
It means le... lend, stupid.
Shut it!
Let's try it again, shall we?
To lend...
To land!
Open your mouth wider!
To land...
Excellent!
And now this "lend" of yours.
Ask your friend to lend you his notebook.
I lend your notebook, Sysel.
No, no, that's not right.
In that case you would have to use the word "borrow."
If he gives you his notebook then he is lending it to you.
But if you want it from him then you "borrow" it from him.
So if he gives it to me, it's lend and if...
I give it to him, it's "borrow"?
Yes!
No!
No language!
Just madness.
Where do you think you're going, young man?
Out.
English, not for me.
Young man, I am fighting the enemy by teaching you English and I will teach you English.
Do not sabotage my war effort!
Stop fooling about, Karel.
Sorry.
Two o'clock.
Twelve o'clock.
Six o'clock.
Ten o'clock.
Ladies!
Excuse me, a fortnight without just isn't healthy.
A little well in an open field...
I'm trying to do your mouth, so shut it!
Why don't we go to the beach sometime.
I've never swum in the sea.
- It's freezing
- Just to dip our toes.
Hey.
Look!
What d'you think he's saying?
He's trying to land them.
- I'd just get a slap in the face.
- You mustn't frighten them.
Machaty begins by asking the way.
Say, to the Officers' Mess.
But doesn't he know where it is?
It's a device.
Women like to help you when you're in trouble when... they don't feel threatened.
It's how you break the ice.
Did Machaty tell you that?
It's common knowledge.
Great!
I guess English is important after all.
There's no resemblance.
You just shut up Deadman.
With your name you don't belong in a plane but a coffin.
This supposed to be me?
Yes, I'd like you to have it.
Grinning like an idiot for this!
It's only good to scare kids!
Excuse me, Sir.
My boys are wondering when they will have permission to fly.
Sir, we are fully trained pilots of the Czechoslovak Airforce.
Some of us have even seen battle over France.
You are wasting us.
Patience, Slama.
The history of warfare is littered with the graves of the impatient.
Sir, the Nazis have occupied our country.
We don't know if our families are alive or dead.
Slowly, slowly catch your monkey.
What did he say?
Monkey catching.
Us? Makes sense.
We've done just about everything else.
Lift up your shirt.
Were you in France, when we invaded?
- Yes.
- And what did you think?
- How you moved! Breathtaking.
- Don't breathe.
Blitzkrieg.
A short and sweet war.
Take a deep breath.
It was hard to be a
German and not be proud.
You can breathe now.
The English returned from their missions
with empty magazines,
and all we could do was
circle the airfield, target-shooting.
There's no way they'll go up today.
We've become the permanent reserve.
I wouldn't bet on it, Sir.
I already had this one.
Lend me another to do the tits.
This one?
No, I need her.
A little well, made of stone,
in an open field stands alone...
Would you mind not singing, Sir,
I'm afraid I might cut you.
And its water is...
I've just cut you, Sir, because you wouldn't stop singing.
I am afraid you'll have to choose.
Either you sing or I shave you.
You can't have it both ways, Sir.
Thank you.
What is your name?
Jane.
Will you be so kind to show me which way is the officer's mess?
You're not serious. On standby, you can't leave here?
Your tea is well.
Good.
My English is good?
The tea is good... not well.
Of course, again wrong.
I need...
I need teacher.
Blue section, scramble!
That's us you idiots!
Finally!
I did try to tell you Sir.
Spearhead Blue Leader, come in please!
Spearhead Blue, receiving you loud and clear, over.
Blue section ready for take off, over.
Permission to take-off granted.
Spearhead Blue Leader.
Plot course one-seven-zero
for North Weald,
and climb to twelve thousand feet, over.
Blue Leader Roger.
Sperhead Blue Leader.
Do you see them?
Not yet Sir.
What's your height?
Twelve thousand.
They should be under you at 11 or 12 o'clock.
I can't see anything, Sir.
Change your direction.
Steer one-eight-zero.
Roger, steering one-eight-zero.
Show yourselves, bastards!
I don't understand!
Speak English!
Sorry, Sir.
There they are!
Two o'clock low!
We have them.
Nine Heinkels.
At Angels eight.
Blue Leader!
Watch out!
Escort above you.
At two o'clock.
Oh shit!
Repeat please.
I don't understand!
Boys, don't jump the gun.
Fire only when they're
squarely in your sights.
Hang on a couple of minutes.
Spearhead Blue Leader.
I am sending you some help.
Shit!
Boys! Messerschmitts!
A whole swarm of them!
Tom Tom, on your tail!
I can see him.
But he's glued to my arse.
Boys, you noticed,
I don't stutter when I'm shit-scared?
Tom Tom can't bail out!
This is Rainbow,
calling Spearhead.
Good work boys,
we're above you.
We'll take on those Jerries.
Go home and refuel.
Sperhead Blue, head for home.
- N2, Roger
- N3, Roger.
Move yourself, bastard!
N2!
Dive to sea level!
I can't hear you.
Dive to sea level.
Too little fuel to follow you!
Flying officer Slama reporting.
On our side one plane lost.
Two planes.
We were ambushed by
Messerschmitts, Sir.
They took you by surprise, eh?
The Messerschmitts...
Completely Sir.
This is an air war,
Flying Officer.
What exactly did you expect to find up there?
Flies?
Pilot!
What's your plane doing on my grass?
My controls... Sir.
I'm not interested in your controls, young man. This is England.
Keep off the grass.
What?
Bedrich, we're not fighting anymore, it's beddy-byes now.
The Germans are also beddy-byes, they've stopped firing.
Even Hitler is beddy-byes with Eva Braun.
Lying on your heart is no good, it can give you nightmares.
Look at Sysel, sleeping nicely on his back.
Good old Moravian pig...
There's more of them, Wizard.
- How many, Blackbird?
- At least thirty.
Roger, Blackbird.
Group B, at least thirty.
- We're sending you reinforcements.
- Roger, Wizard.
We have different things in mind.
What do you mean?
I want... you know what... and she just wants to teach me English.
She says after the war... for the other.
The one next to her doesn't look as if she'd need to wait for peace.
Where have you sent us!
We're heading into barrage balloons!
She's more than I could handle.
Sorry, change course to one-three-zero.
Roger, Wizard.
Changing course.
- And her?
- She's Machaty's.
She's your date?
You said it!
For God's sake send us some fresh blood
where are reinforcements...
It's amazing...
Hang on.
Blackbird, hang on.
How calm they are.
And that'll be Hitler's downfall.
Because he's a hot-head like our Voytishek.
Me a hot-head?
Just you wait!
Please.
You know what's crossed my mind?
What?
Maybe I'm not handling her right.
We go for long walks
She doesn't stop talking.
Of course we kiss but...
D'you think she expects me to pounce on her?
I wouldn't know,
but shut up for now, okay?
But think about it, will you?
Sure.
- Franta!
- What?
I see him.
One o'clock.
Hugging the ground.
Spearhead Blue Leader calling Wizard.
Roger Spearhead Blue.
We have him.
I'd say he's headed for Sheffield.
Well done.
Get him before he lays his eggs.
Roger, Wizard.
He's yours, Karel.
I'm going in.
Franta, I'm hit!
Can you hear me?
Karel!
Oh God!
Wizard, this is Spearhead Blue Leader.
One Junkers down.
The crew have bailed out.
Good work.
Spearhead Blue!
But I'm afraid I'll have to
report your Number Two
for using the radio irresponsibly.
And I'm afraid to report my Number Two...
...will not be coming home.
Sorry to hear that.
Fish again, Sir.
I'm sorry to say.
I don't mind the fish every day.
But this daily ration of carrots?
Good for the eyes, Sir.
So they say.
Any news?
Sorry Sir.
Still nothing.
He was such a splendid chap.
Don't say was!
We don't know anything for certain yet.
Maybe he managed to bail out.
He was an excellent pilot.
I mean, he is an excellent pilot!
I'm terribly sorry, Sir.
Disperse the planes!
Everything out of the hangar!
- Who is it?
- I'm a British pilot.
I need to use your telephone.
You don't sound like a British pilot.
I'm not English.
But I am a British pilot.
Polish?
No, Czechoslovak.
- What's your capital city?
- What?
What is the capital of Czechoslovakia?
Praha.
Prague.
Come in.
I'll put something on that cut for you.
I have only flown two missions and already destroyed one plane.
Well done!
I mean my own.
But we did shoot down a bomber.
- I hope it was one of theirs?
- Sure thing.
It was really Franta who shot it down.
Franta?
I'm not hurting you, am I?
No...
He's my best friend.
Taught me how to fly
- You're going to have a scar.
- Scar?
It's to eat?
What is it?
Don't worry about it.
You hungry?
Not really...
Yes.
Not really... Yes?
I mean yes. Sorry.
My English is not well,
I mean... good.
They're just lighting up their targets.
They'll be here any minute.
Out of the way!
I'll start her up.
He's in the navy?
Charles, yes.
He's missing.
It's been a year.
I'm sorry.
But often... they are missing for a long time and they come back.
My name is also Charles.
Karel means Charles in English.
The Nortons have a telephone.
I'll take you there so you won't have to name your capital city again.
You know what?
I think I'll wait until morning.
Wait till morning?
- But won't they be worried?
- No.
But they think you're dead.
So far it's not bad... uh, being dead.
- It's about to blow, Sir.
- There's a pilot on board!
All right.
Get him out Slama!
Are you alright?
Your left nostril really is smaller.
So is yours.
Come, show me.
No, it's silly.
Please.
Otherwise we'll never know.
Come on.
You see?
It's as I said.
So you could be my sister.
Slightly older sister.
What nice noses we have!
It's late! I've got some pajamas that belonged to Charles.
I mean... that belong to Charles.
I'll leave the door open to let the heat in.
Anything else you need?
Not still hungry?
- Not really. Yes?
- Yes.
No.
Not really.
Not to eat.
Well.
Good night then.
Oh God, no...
- Pilot?
- Yes, a pilot.
Now out you go, children.
A pilot.
From Czechoslovakia.
From a place called Prague.
Mr. Hitler has invaded his country so... he's come here... to... help us out.
In England... it's normal... to have so many children?
No.
No, Karel.
They're not mine.
They're from London.
From different families.
They were moved because of the bombing.
We were evacuated.
We're evacuees.
- In hospital?
- Stitched up his stomach.
Who's that?
Sysel. He was holding his guts It was oozing blood.
He'll be there for a week at least.
Hello, Charles.
Hello!
Jane would like to dance with you.
But... I can't dance.
Not even a little?
Not even a little.
Sorry.
But I can, ladies, and I love dancing.
You land on your head when you bailed out yesterday?
Not on my head, on a woman!
And I fell madly in love with her.
I'm crazy about her.
Really?
I'm going mad.
One could...
One could escape from here.
I'd like to know how.
You see that barbed wire over there?
If one got hold of a pair of pliers...
The wall's only five meters.
Gentlemen.
It's my birthday today.
Fifty.
Your health, doctor!
My father died at fifty.
Also a doctor.
In Reichenberg.
You know how many people came to his funeral?
A hundred and twenty-seven.
My sister counted them all.
They loved him so.
That's life...
How many people did you kill in the war,
Mr. Slama?
No idea.
Take a guess.
Maybe ten.
Me, not one.
Have you ever seen an execution?
I did.
In Prague.
At Kobylisy.
I had to check that the people were dead.
For a whole month.
Day in day out.
- How do I look?
- Ravishing.
Really?
You're pulling my leg?
Get out, you Romeo.
Wait here.
I'll give you a sign.
Susan!
Excuse me?
Are you uh... are you Susan?
What? Yes.
Can I help?
I thought so.
Hang on.
How do you know my name?
I am a friend of Karel.
He told me about you.
Oh, he did, did he.
- So you came to check me out?
- Yes.
Tell your young friend that if he think she can send his whole squadron for some recreation he's very much mistaken.
No.
That may be the way it works in Prague, but not here.
Come along Beth.
Tell him he's not welcome here.
Susan!
We have the whole afternoon off, so... Franta!
This is Susan.
And this is Franta, my...
I told you all about him.
How... do you do?
How do you do?
Lovely, isn't she?
I prefer bigger tits, but she is pretty.
What's the matter here then?
We went to see the bees and Beth got stung.
Do you have ammonia?
I'll have a look.
You wait here.
- Susan?
- Yes.
- I really missed you
- Uh-uh...
- Did you miss me too?
- What?
Oh.
Yes...
It's all such a mess in here...
Here we are!
Great.
Damn, it's evaporated.
- There's none left.
- Uh-uh...
Do you have...
How do you say "vinegar" in English?
It's sour... and you use it for pickling.
- Vinegar?
- Yes. Vinegar.
Children, which of you knows where the vinegar is?
- I do!
- Wait! Wait!
You'll be OK.
Just remember it's much worse for the bee than for you.
- It will never fly again.
- It will die, won't it?
That's right.
As soon as a bee loses its sting, it dies.
Wasps don't.
No, wasps don't die, they are allowed to sting as much as they like.
But they are not allowed to make honey.
Good smell!
It's awful!
Forgive me.
I was such an idiot.
Forget it... you were very angry... it was attractive.
Look at him.
He's very sweet.
He can't stop talking about you.
Oh dear.
He is a good man.
You can trust him.
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing these days.
It's natural.
The war.
It's not natural.
I'm married.
I'm going to marry David.
And you.
Married?
No, he's not.
But he has a serious girl-friend back home. Haven't you?
Her name is Hanicka.
That's a pretty name.
I have to prepare some supper for the children.
Shall we go inside?
- Well, what do you think?
- Beautiful, Karel.
Really beautiful.
Not asleep, Honza?
Jura Sysel died, so I'm scoring his favorite tune for the English to play at his funeral.
There are so many parts, the clarinet, all the brass... it takes some doing to sound right.
Keep at it...
Know what I'm sad about?
No.
What?
I really liked Sysel, but I never told him.
Men don't talk about such things but I'm sure he knew.
He couldn't have, because I didn't know myself.
He got on my nerves.
His Moravian yodeling really pissed me off.
It's only now I know I liked him.
Let's get some sleep.
In war men should tell each other how they feel.
Nothing wrong with him.
Just his face smashed up
We'll get him in the morning.
Honza?
Who messed you up like this?
Kolichek.
He hit me...
I hit the stove.
Herr Commandant has a hard stove.
He's a snake.
Check my fingers.
God I hope my fingers are all right.
They're okay.
You'll play again.
They are all the same.
The same blows. Nazi interrogations,
Communist interrogations, no difference.
- Also a pilot?
- It's Machaty, the pianist.
So tell me Herr Slama why are you all locked up in here?
I understand why I'm here.
We lost the war and must be punished.
But you?
I don't understand.
What did you do to them?
Nothing.
Nothing?
- But what were you tried for?
- There was no trial.
Well, well, Machaty.
Back in England I bet you never dreamt they'd welcome you home with such a sad song.
You said it.
Had you known, you wouldn't have fought us so?
That's where you're wrong.
"Dear Karel,"
"please don't come and see me anymore.
"
"I know this will be hard for you, but I can't help it."
"I'd like you to think well of me"
"and I'm sorry if I've hurt you."
"But please don't even write to me.
"
"Look after yourself.
Susan."
Did she say anything about me?
She said you were sweet.
Sweet, sweet...
Something she didn't like about me?
No, nothing.
You can't drive in this fog.
Who'd I bump into?
No one drives in such fog.
Some other love-sick idiot like you?
I have to see her.
Listen to me.
Maybe she's worried that I'm... too young?
Did she say I was sweet once or twice?
Six times, you fool.
Go on then.
But be careful.
Good afternoon.
He's just left to go and see you.
He must have passed you on the road.
If we hurry we can catch him up.
Do you want me to drive?
You must be tired...
I didn't come to see him.
I don't understand.
I came to see you.
Good day, gentlemen.
The target is the submarine dock at Brest.
You will be escorting the bombers on their return journey.
Rendezvous with them at 16.15 hours in this area, here...
Can you believe it?
She wasn't home.
A strange woman was there.
- Where did you sleep?
- In the car.
She went to see her brother in London.
Red Section will cover the rest of the escort at twenty-two thousand feet.
Why do I have to get the shits before each flight?
Better before than during.
Blue four.
My engine is playing up.
Permission to return to base, Franta?
What's the problem?
It's misfiring, losing power.
Permission granted.
Silence over the air!
Sorry Sir, but it was important.
Set your course to 250.
Rendezvous in two minutes.
Blue Leader to Wizard.
Taking our position.
You might call them small tits, but you should see them!
Please speak English!
Spearhead Leader to Blue Leader,
could you take your section down to baby-sit that straggler?
Spearhead Leader, this is Blue Leader.
I don't understand.
Five o'clock,
flying on one engine.
Roger, we'll look after the baby.
Blue Section, let's go.
- Number Two, Roger.
- Number Three, Roger.
Messerschmitts!
Franta, watch out!
Please speak English.
Bandits two o'clock high.
We have company Sir.
How many?
Three... no, four Messerschmitts.
Get among them so they can't aim!
Tally ho!
Karel, get him!
Great, my boy!
Well done, Karel.
Go lower, Machaty.
Take the one in the back.
Machaty, watch your backside!
Blue Leader, speak to me please.
There are three more, sir.
When Goliath spits in his eye....
David swings his sling...
One was big and one had courage...
Goliaaath!
My first!
It's my first!
If we ever get home,
I'm going to kiss you.
I'm getting to like you chaps, more and more.
Carry on.
Hey, someone promised me a kiss over the radio.
It was me!
Franto...
There's something I've got to tell you.
No, Franta.
- It's important
- I need to talk to you.
- Karel, listen
- No, listen to me!
You listen to me!
It's so nice to be in love.
She may not want me, but I'm still happy.
Maybe a little unhappy too, but still happy.
Are you asleep?
Look, Karel...
Remember when you went to see her in that terrible fog?
Susan... came here to see me.
I told her we were best friends, and sent her away.
I was afraid to tell you then.
But you should know, even if it hurts.
I've a really bad toothache.
- You're not going up today?
- I must see the dentist.
Know what the mechanics call you?
Boomerang.
Takes off and comes right back.
When your engine's...
There's nothing wrong with your engine.
They checked it.
I can't help it.
I get diarrhea before each flight and throw up when we land.
I only eat what comes up easily.
Porridge, custard...
You could apply for a transfer to the ground crew.
No one would blame you.
- You mean not fly anymore!
- I'd be the first to regret it.
I feel safer having you behind me.
I'll see the dentist tomorrow.
And all the way, I kept asking myself:
Why was I going there?
The only answer was that
I wanted her to write
Karel a kinder letter.
To give him some hope.
Yes, that was it.
But I forgot it was Sunday.
Visiting day for the parents
of Susan's evacuees.
Good afternoon.
I'm afraid I must have lost my way.
I'm trying to get to London.
London?
My dear man, you really need to go back the way you came and turn right onto the main road.
You could also keep going along this road, but please do drive very slowly.
It's full of potholes after the rain.
Thank you.
I will drive slowly.
If they all have such a rotten sense of direction, we'll never win the war.
Where were you?
In London.
At the Embassy.
Get into a fight there?
No.
Why?
Your button's missing.
Really?
I'll ask Pierce to see to it tomorrow.
That's my locker.
I am sorry Karel.
I'm really sorry.
Hitler has only got one ball,
Goering has two, but very small,
Himmler has something similar
and Goebbles has no balls at all.
So Goering has three balls?
No!
Two, but small.
So, Hitler has one,
Goering two...
But small.
- So who has none?
- You, Mrtvy, you have none!
Which of you guys put in for the spin to France?
Franta, that's us!
But, that was a week ago...
Whatever, permission's been granted.
Let's go, old man.
Achtung, die Spitfiren!
Come back.
It was only me!
You arsehole.
See the train?
Shall we give the driver a chance?
And the stoker.
Okay, let's go.
You take out the engine I'll go for the tanker wagons.
Watch out for that ack-ack gun!
Karel!
Can you hear me?
Can't see..
Belly landing...
Shit!
You wait here!
We'll check on the peasants.
Where is the pilot?
Do you understand?
Where is the English dog?
Plane kaput.
Dog out.
Plane boom... and dog run... there...
Let's go!
Jeannette!
Get up! It's over!
They've gone!
Get up!
It's over, they've gone!
Get in!
Climb in!
Don't be a fool, Franta, there's no room!
Shut up and get in!
Hang on!
You're sitting on my arm!
Can you reach the throttle?
I can't.
Merci.
How's the fuel?
Wouldn't know?
I can't see the gauge.
Neither can I!
Stop fidgeting,
I think you've dislocated my shoulder!
You're crazy!
Stop moving around!
What's your code name?
And the emergency frequency?
Next time, on the back That'll smudge when you sweat.
- Good luck
- Thanks.
Be careful!
- So, the dentist?
- Worse than war.
- The man's a maniac
- Why?
Just pulls teeth out,
- good or bad!
- Pleased to hear it.
What?
That you don't have toothache anymore.
I see.
You're going to fly in pairs.
You'll look after the new chap.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Take care!
Can we spit the seeds on the ground?
You must.
And next year you'll have watermelons.
Where are the rest of them?
The children?
They've gone home, except the twins.
They've stopped bombing London.
I wanted some of my own but the doctor said there was a problem.
Maybe they'll let me keep these two.
What do you mean?
Their parents were in a shelter which took a direct hit.
Do they know?
Not yet.
I've made the application.
There's an aunt.
She has to sign them over.
So we will have children after all.
I hope so.
They were not Germans, were they? They were ours.
They were ours?
Could he have seen you?
I hope not.
Sorry.
Germans have got funny crosses on their wings...
It's terrible.
To think that this morning.
I thought... please God, don't let this war end.
I hate myself.
You'll go home and I'll be alone again.
Let's not think about it now.
What's this?
I've joined the Air Force.
And what if he comes back?
I can't go back to the navy now.
Not only is it dark
around me,
but I cannot see...
I know there is darkness all around
but I cannot see it.
That's beautiful.
My God that's beautiful.
It is, but I can't play it forever.
Oh yes, you can.
It's the only one I want to hear.
Will you teach me to play it?
All right.
I wanted a piano.
But...
My Dad said he'd buy me an accordion instead... said it also had keys.
It's true, a piano doesn't really belong on a farm.
You start playing and you get the cows mooing along.
You'll teach it to me?
I will.
- But now it's time for bed.
- Not yet. Once more.
One last time.
Okay, one last time.
You haven't finished your drink yet.
So...
tell me,
where's my perfect vision gone?
The dense blue cloud now covers all,
the impenetrable dark blue world...
What are you celebrating, you night owls?
Don't I get a drink?
Tell him.
He's not going to fly with you anymore.
You bastard!
I'll kill you.
I was always so afraid I'd lose you.
But this is worse than if you had died on me.
Forgive me, Karel, if you can.
I didn't want this.
Bedrich, bail out!
You're on fire!
Bedrich's still inside.
Blue Leader.
Roger.
What are you doing!
Karel?
- Karel landed?
- Yes, but Bedrich's missing.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
What got into you?
I'll kill you!
Think I don't know?
Firing at me from behind!
Son of a bitch!
Fired at me full on!
Over a woman!
Can you believe it?
What's going on here?
Flying Officer Slama has a problem.
A German soldier could not do this.
To his own comrade.
I've lost a lot of respect for you,
Herr Ober Lieutenant.
Very much.
Have you never met a woman who made you lose your senses?
No woman could do that to me.
Then I'm sorry for you.
I'm sorry for you.
For you comradeship is nothing but a bubble.
You blow at it, and it's gone.
We mightn't like each other but we're all in the same boat.
I've searched my instruments and can't find the pliers.
There's only the three of us.
If they find them on someone, know who'll get it? Me.
Shall I report it and have them turn the place over?
I can't do it.
But...
Look out!
Commandant, Sir.
Three patients and one doctor present!
"X-ray essential..."
So what is this I hear Blaschke?
What X-ray?
I reported that Machaty sustained a head injury.
I was worried about a brain hemorrhage.
You know how he did it?
Yes.
He fell against the stove.
And that's precisely what you'll write in your report.
Sir, permission to speak?
Speak, if you must.
As Machaty's former superior officer
I urge you to permit an X-ray.
Son of a bitch, back at work on Monday.
Tejnsky, run it again, this time, a little slower.
That won't be necessary.
Run it, please, just to make sure.
So, first the Messerschmitt fires at you.
Then Officer Voytishek gives him a burst, which rips off his canopy and no doubt hits the pilot as well.
Voytishek then banks down to the right.
Is that clear?
You could say he saved your life.
Or do you still think otherwise?
Sharp!
"Flying Officer Mrtyv is probably dead?"
You can't say that!
He's "missing in action" and "presumed dead."
That's better.
Perhaps "good" instead of "brave".
- Why?
- Well, they say he was scared.
Maybe. But he flew all the same That's why he was brave.
I'd like to talk to you, Karel.
There's something I want to say to you.
Your superior officer is addressing you.
Behave accordingly!
I want to apologize to you, in front of all present, for accusing you of firing at me.
I was bloody stupid.
You saved my life when you shot down that Messerschmitt and I'm grateful.
I respect you and regret any pain I've caused you.
I'd be glad if you could forgive me.
And stop drinking and staying up all night.
You fly exhausted and senselessly risk your life.
Do you accept my apology?
Let it go, Karel.
Shake hands, you clowns.
"To: Captain Otakar Mrtvy of Squadron 311."
"Dear Captain,"
"We regret to inform you that your brother, Bedrich Mrtvy,"
"is missing in action and presumed dead.
"
Sergeant Bedrich Mrtvy is being laid to rest here deep in the soil of this fair island, far from the land of his birth.
But in this war, this just war, there is only one earth, common to us all.
"It happened on 23rd September"
"during combat with the enemy."
"He was a brave pilot"
"He will remain In our hearts forever.
"
A little well, made of stone
in an open field
stands alone.
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Honor guard, attention!
Honor guard, fire!
And then we began to escort the Americans.
Karel moved quarters.
His only words to me In 3 months
were "Yes Sir" on the radio.
I wrote begging him to forgive me.
But a wounded soul heals
slower than a wounded body.
What's wrong, Franta?
My engine's conking out.
I'm about to take a swim.
See you, boys.
Red Two, stay with him and report your position.
Karel is with him, Sir.
Roger.
Mayday!
Mayday!
Pilot in the water, over!
Mayday!
Take a fix on my signal.
Do you read me?
Send out a lifeboat.
Is anyone listening!
His dingy's burst.
He's only his life jacket.
Hurry, he'll freeze to death.
Take a fix on my signal, you idiots!
Shit!
Go home, Karel.
You'll run out of juice.
What are you doing, you fool!
Franta.
My instruments are in such a mess!
Thank you, gentlemen.
My idea of getting out of here...
They put me up to it.
They wanted to pin something on you so they could beat you up.
What was in it for you?
I'd get out earlier.
The best thing about all this is, you're not such a bastard.
Good afternoon.
Excuse me.
I must have lost my way.
Where are you heading,
Old Boy?
London.
Ah, yes, London.
You need to drive straight on till you reach the main road and then turn left.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Is the road all right?
Do I need to drive slowly?
No, it's been repaired.
There are no potholes.
Have a safe journey.
Barcha?
Don't you know me?
Come here...
Hello.
Franta?
They said that... that you were dead.
So you see,
I'm not.
Don't cry.
No one's to blame.
You are beautiful.
Let's go, Barcha.
Thanks for looking after her.
Baicha!
She's our dog!
Really?
Baicha, come here!
Baicha, come home.
Stay then, Barcha.
Don't be sad, Franta.
Karel, is that you?
Sure.
Where are you?
Behind you.
Where I've always been.
Please speak English.
Sorry, not this time.
Now it's personal.
DEDICATED TO THOSE
WHO LIVED THROUGH THESE EVENTS
SAFE CONDUCT
She's coming. Hop to it!
Got the flowers?
I was taking them up.
Clear the whole floor.
Everybody out of sight! Move it!
Come back in 5 minutes!
Just one minute.
Like last Tuesday.
Carnations? Not for an actress!
I told you!
She'll murder me! Marcel, help me!
She's here, ladies!
To your rooms, please!
Him and his dame!
What a fuss he makes!
You don't know who this "dame" is!
Everyone knows. It's Suzanne Raymond.
I saw her movies...
Please, out of sight, all of you!
Shoo!
If you need cigs...
Maybe later. In you go.
Take care of that cough.
Out of sight! Thanks!
Shoo!
Not again!
Got the champagne?
Snap to it!
What a mess!
What did I do to deserve this?
See him? The Kraut in room 25.
Get in here.
He threatened me again.
Someday I'll sock him.
Aren't you gorgeous!
These things... always happen to you.
Gorgeous, gorgeous...
You smell so sweet.
What a pretty little puppy nose, nice and cold.
True, I'm freezing.
God, what a winter!
What a winter!
Think so?
See how I slipped in?
Nobody saw me.
But still,
I felt so sad.
So sad.
- I didn't get the part.
- What part? Why?
The Cayatte movie. The False Mistress.
Can I have some tea?
Steaming hot tea?
Better than tea...
Champagne!
Champagne's too cold.
But it's a cold that warms.
Tea.
Tea?
Then tea it is.
Darrieux will get it.
They said it's either her or me.
Nonsense! I shouldn't have bothered.
It was made for Darrieux.
Everything's made for her.
She's perfect from take one.
I'm never sure of myself.
Nothing comes easy.
I'm fed up. Fed up!
I'm such a goose!
How can you say that?
Would I write for a goose?
Hold on...
Your passionate lover... it'll be little FranÃ§ois Perier... recites a letter about your frolics.
Your husband may have intercepted it.
You: "You really wrote all that?"
Him: "Yes, my love."
You: "Must you always go on about things we did together?"
"What's the point? I was there!"
That's nice!
That's me all over.
I just love it.
I adore you!
Put this outside the door.
You knock, then scoot!
Come on, now!
The champagne.
Stay.
Go on, then.
But be careful. And the tea!
Ask for tea.
Do you have any tea?
Yes, tea.
Don't have any?
That's okay. Thanks.
They have none... Tea, coffee.
Why not real sugar?
Where do I put this?
Damn!
What's the matter?
I've made a mess!
The script for Roland Tual,
Love Letters.
He's expecting it tomorrow.
It soaks up like a blotter!
Look at that!
Hear that?
Rumbling.
It's thunder.
Come over here!
Not thunder, planes.
Lots of them.
Only the Germans have planes.
They wouldn't bomb Paris, they're in it!
No, it's freezing out!
I have to see!
They're far away, over the suburbs...
What is it?
It's coming from above.
What a sight!
That light...
What's that light? It's beautiful.
It's an air raid, all right.
- Close it! It's freezing!
- They're bombing!
Close your window, Mr. Jean!
The Brits are bombing Renault!
Close it, Jean!
Down we go!
Never any privacy!
First the champagne, then the phone, and now planes!
I refuse to be seen in a shelter!
We're calmly going to do what I came for.
Calmly? We're being bombed!
And if we're being bombed,
I can't do a thing.
Let me handle this.
To the shelters!
Is there a doctor?
Shut off the mains!
No, Mr. Devaivre!
To the shelters!
I'm getting my son.
He's safe. Your wife's here.
It's you! Got a flashlight?
- I'll get one?
- C'mon!
Find something to cover them.
Sheets and blankets.
Simone!
You okay?
I'm okay.
Seen Dr. Pelletier?
The raid's over.
I'm not so sure.
The flares looked like fireworks at first.
- What're you doing?
- Taking him.
It's 60Â° here with the windows closed.
At home, it's 34Â°.
You sure?
Take the kid!
Please, can you help me?
Not the small ones, Roger!
The big ones, under your nose!
The Brits' bombs work better than worms!
What're you doing?
Fishing! "The miracle of the fishes!"
We have to finish the scene tonight.
We'll be right in. The power's out.
We'll save you one.
We're already behind.
We'll be here till 6 a.m. Again.
How is it outside?
Not a pretty sight. Bodies everywhere.
They were really popping!
And real close!
We'll start soon.
Anybody call the supply company?
The phone's busy. George sent a cyclist to the power station.
The bridges are out.
How do I get home?
My husband'll be worried sick.
Fish, you guys!
There's plenty for everyone!
Fish?
If the cables are damaged, we're in for a long wait.
Check them. If it comes back on, we don't wait.
It will be a while.
We'd do the same.
Renault makes trucks and motors...
They come and bomb, it's fair play.
Fair play, no!
There are the rules of war.
You don't bomb the wounded, priests, or artists!
Boulogne's full of artists, and movie studios.
Everyone knows it.
The civilized world, anyway.
As if the civilized world still existed.
I've got a theater gig next.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have to finish this long scene.
We have very little film left.
They're striking the set tomorrow.
So give it all you've got. Thanks!
Spare the candles!
They have to match.
Mr. Le Chanois is waiting upstairs.
I'm going up.
How's your baby? Not too scared...?
Don't waste your breath.
He never stops.
I call him Speedy.
I was about to leave.
Sandwich.
I also brought you carbon paper.
This is an epic!
Read it later.
What if my wife can't decipher it?
Here's the dialogue for Salou...
The power! I have to get back.
Hold on!
Comrades are getting nabbed.
There are informers everywhere.
- I know them.
- Not all of them!
Nicolas Hayer beat it before the Fritz came knocking.
Mickey Bouladoux got pinched.
It stinks!
Mickey?
So?
Clouzot offered me a job.
Aurenche gave up adapting a Nerval story.
Clouzot put me on it.
Tourneur needs an assistant.
You!
But Clouzot's Continental, and Continental's German!
Exactly! When you're in the lion's jaws, he can't bite.
Even the French police can't snoop at Continental.
That's 50% less hassle.
And the other 50%?
I'll think it over.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'll call you.
You can't. I moved.
Again?
Bretons are great travelers.
We dolly in on the table.
The table for two.
The 103 on the table for two!
Quiet on the set!
We're back to work and glad of it!
Places, everyone!
Off with your overcoats!
I'm cramped. I need to pull back.
Mr. Arrignon needs room.
Push back the sound booth.
- Buy some chocolate?
- We're rehearsing!
I'm interested.
What's that funny smell?
Fish. In the sound booth.
Not much left.
Move me back, please.
A little more.
- Mark it.
- Done, sir.
Tench is no better or worse than carp.
It tastes like whatever it's cooked in.
Cook it in sauce, it tastes good.
Cook it in muck, it tastes like muck.
Stop the hammers!
The hammers!
Silence!
Miss Gautier's shawl, please.
This wait had too many minutes.
Try to be not too dumb!
Camera!
8 Men in a Chateau.
Scene 82, take 1!
Action!
PUNISH THE VICHYTORTURERS
The grips had a good catch.
Here's our share.
Good. Jacques's coming for dinner.
He just called.
I was at the nursery. It's quiet.
There's a card from your brother Louis.
From Germany.
Awful handwriting!
Is it the cold?
What kind of fish?
- Tench.
- Any good?
Better than barbel and not as good as carp.
I brought you some carbon paper.
Almost new.
And a new tract to type in 7 copies?
It's not "traiter," it's "traitor."
"Someday soon Berlin and Tokyo may burn under Allied bombs."
You believe that?
Cleaned, scaled and chopped, we could make soup.
If we have gas to cook.
You know Nerval's The Magic Hand?
Jean-Paul backed me as assistant.
He's scripting it.
I can't decide.
You two get along well.
The producer's the hitch. Continental.
The Fritz?
Do what you think is best...
The elevator's off limits.
For those gentlemen only.
Mr. Tourneur's expecting us.
The glass door at the back: Greven.
The big cheese.
On the right, Bauermeister.
Watch your step with him.
Clouzot's there.
He runs the script department.
Greetings, Aurenche. No regrets?
For The Magic Hand? None.
But you'll do fine.
Updating Nerval stumped me.
But you'll find a way.
As I told Greven
Either you can or you can't.
Or, you will or you won't.
Did Herr Doktor understand you?
He acted like it.
He pesters the hell out of me!
I'm running late.
What's Clouzot like?
A tough nut, but he plays straight.
He'll back you up... except in a professional screw-up.
Here, here and here... our offices.
At the end, a minefield!
Mr. Tourneur... Jean Devaivre.
You have a fine reputation.
I know you finished
Mediterranean Alert.
How would you describe an assistant director's job?
The director's in charge.
He bears full responsibility, but only has 2 eyes.
An extra pair comes in handy.
Have you read
Le Chanois's script?
The treatment. It's not finished.
Bryau's always cold.
Von Schertel... SD.
SD?
Controls the SS.
- What's he doing at Continental?
- Renting space.
Understand German?
My wife gets by.
Me, not a word.
Many speak excellent French.
My rule is simple: Make good films.
Artistic and script matters see Mr. Clouzot.
For administrative issues
Mr. Bauermeister.
Like all directors, actors and key technicians, you'll be given a pass.
You must be ready for an August shoot.
You'll have 28 days.
Come, Tourneur, let's have lunch.
Spaak told me about A Shady Business.
Balzac. Fine.
I won't work for Continental. Period!
I can't keep turning Greven down.
You must help me.
When you won't, you won't.
Sure, sure. Stop kicking the mahogany.
It scratches, too.
Hold on...
Don't move.
There. Sure I'll help you.
But stop kicking the furniture.
It's distracting.
Helping a friend like you will be easy. How?
Put me under contract.
Fabulous!
Avoid the rock and the soft spot.
I'll have a project next month.
I need a contract today. Predated.
I signed one 2 weeks ago.
With whom?
With you. In this office.
It's easy enough to understand.
I won't work for theJerries, or end up in Berlin or in prison.
I keep turning Greven down,
I need an excuse. You must save me.
First finish Three-Way Romance.
It's finished.
We need something else, for 3, 6 months. 10 years!
Something else...
I have it.
Double Six. The play. Read it.
- A play? By whom?
- Achard.
- You mean Domino.
- I wanted The Lover from Borneo.
It's a dream title...
Borneo, Africa, tigers...
There are no tigers in Africa.
And Borneo's in Asia.
Movies are made of dreams, and dreams can't be mapped out.
I have something else.
Roland Tual will produce if you distribute.
- The title?
- Love Letters. Listen...
No, no, I'll take it!
I'm sobbing already. Love Letters.
It's worth its weight.
We'll fool Greven.
I have Gravey.
His contract is a plague!
- He asking a lot?
- Yes, and a pound of butter a week.
- What for?
- For bartering.
To work! I'm head over heels in work.
Find me prewar subjects.
Passion, gas lamps, backstairs...
- Backstreets.
- Backstreets. With peepholes.
I can never keep up with you.
So my wife says.
She's a great bridge player.
She costs me.
She play for money?
But if she plays well, she wins?
All the time.
So why does she cost you?
It's beyond me.
Why are we talking about this?
Tell Greven we have a 3-picture contract.
Strange man! Seen his office chest?
- The what?
- The chest.
Storage chest?
No, man's chest.
The head... like on statues!
The bust! The word's "bust."
Like buster.
He hangs his coat and hat on it.
So I saw. And?
Mussolini with a hat on his head!
You mean Hitler.
Logical for a German dignitary.
The thing has a forelock: Mussolini!
Mussolini's forelock!
The guy starts a sentence, but you never know...
Did I sign a contract or not?
Why does he keep doing that?
He had a lobotomy.
But he must do it for a reason.
He thinks you're a Jew.
Tomorrow, I'll have lettuce.
What brings you here?
I was in the neighborhood.
For you.
Shall I get Olga?
Good timing. She's free at this hour.
A ComÃ©die FranÃ§aise actor mentioned you.
One who often plays priests.
Can I take those?
Oh, Jeannot!
My fingers are numb.
Goddamned suitcases!
The handles cut through your fingers.
I hate 'em!
A wheelbarrow's better.
Maybe not on a staircase...
They say it's very nice in French.
Very sad.
Not too heavy?
This place has become total chaos!
A new table?
A gift from Paul.
He deals in hot furniture.
Madame knows him from his vice squad days.
He rents space upstairs and pays in services.
It's just for a day or two.
Until I find...
There's no hurry.
Make yourself at home.
- You want a bath?
- Still have hot water?
Sure! For the Germans.
Put those in the closet.
They'll wrinkle in your suitcase.
This all the same story?
No. I wish it was.
- How do you keep track?
- I manage.
If not, I start over.
It's better sometimes.
Besides, clutter has a certain charm.
Honeysuckle vines are a lot more fun than matches in a box, or a military parade.
I keep track very easily.
You don't look like it.
My life's a mess, not my papers.
It's my own fault. I always say yes.
- Because you're nice.
- Maybe so, but...
I say yes to producers, hucksters, and women.
So I'm broke, I have 4 scripts and 3 women on my hands.
No, 4 women and 3 scripts.
Come on. It's cold.
Those handbags in the closet...
You collect them?
That's for later.
When I open a shop.
I won't end up in a sailors' brothel.
I'll have my own business.
A leather goods shop.
Luxury stuff.
Handbags are so pretty.
Even empty, they're pretty.
It's fine, but...
The set's too big.
Too wide for Stage 4.
Two yards too long.
With a 35, we won't frame it all.
If I place it diagonally on A...
But on the A there's the gallery.
We have to cut it down.
Or take out this wall.
I noted the camera angles on the floor plan.
I'll work it out.
Cut this, maybe.
Add arch. Gives volume.
And the paintings there?
They're for the painter's studio.
I painted two, small ones.
Good. Arches, cats...
Clouzot doesn't like
Le Chanois's dialogue.
He says it lacks "punch."
That's the word he used.
Here are both versions.
You decide.
I'll read them tonight, sir.
For the historical explanation of the severed hand, we have to simplify. Too long.
Or we ask for an extra day or two.
We said 28 days. 28!
If there is an extension, it will be an extension of 600 miles.
We'll send you to Babelsberg to study German production methods.
And if we sent you to Stalingrad, to study crawling methods.
Here's your pass.
Mr. Greven just signed Palau.
Good. You won't be sorry.
And your contract? Bring it in signed.
He'll be great as the Devil. Palau...
He's got funny eyes, like a duck.
Palau... No?
Talk him into it. It's Dad's birthday.
Make an effort.
You realize the workload he has?
That's just it. He needs a break, and it's Sunday. So come...
"People of Paris, the French must fight!
"Turn out in force and demonstrate!
"The gas is on only 4 hours a day!"
The union must be joking!
Go and fight...
With what? And why? For gas?
Jacques, please!
C'mon, this is a riot.
He has you type Communist tracts but he was on the other side.
He fights a war, great!
But he works for the Germans.
Not for. Under the Germans.
So how's Clouzot's dialogue?
Your brother's getting...
You slave weekends, for them!
I work on films. For Tourneur,
Clouzot and myself.
To learn. And I'm always learning.
Then shoot. Direct your first film.
Not now.
Not until we've kicked them out.
And I haven't signed a contract.
I never will.
So how about Sunday?
Are you coming?
Can't we put it back a week?
We'll celebrate Christmas on Bastille Day.
Mom found a duck and turnips.
We can set it back.
But the duck's plucked.
It's this Sunday or never.
I'll come with the baby.
Jean will drop by.
I took two tracts.
I'll come for lunch.
I love duck!
Devaivre?
This is Didot. Marc Valbel's friend.
Hold on.
Last year you had some apples.
Got any left?
I need two.
Remember where we met with Marc?
Sure, I do.
I'll meet you there.
- Now?
- Now.
I have to run. I won't be long.
- You know, I'm going...
- You said the less we know...
I'll put the baby to bed.
I'll do the ironing.
I'll wait up for you.
I have a pass.
You're getting thin.
Over there.
Let's see them.
Good.
Let's go.
- Where they from?
- I stole them the day of the Armistice.
I took them home.
You got a head start.
A gray duck, a blue duck, a white duck
The white duck walks behind
The blue duck walks ahead
The white duck is fattest
I'll sell it for 20 francs...
Would you have fired?
You picked up some coal.
Very clever.
You don't talk much.
Usually, the guys I take along run off at the mouth.
In three minutes, bang!
Any special reason for going after the Fritz?
I just want them out, that's all.
Let's go.
And the van?
I don't know whose it is.
So long!
Polish it good!
Activate the work!
You really pulled it off.
The statue... A great idea!
It adds to the scene.
Every camera angle is a good one.
And the paintings, great!
It can all be dismantled.
The Krauts won't believe their eyes.
"In Babelsberg we do this, we do that."
But look what we can do with the little they give us.
Nice work, Mr. Andrejew!
For the walls, here are the gray samples.
This one.
The latest tract. Make 8 copies.
For the art department.
I hear the sound ofboots, boots, boots.!
It's the first carabinier.!
Greetings!
- How are your trotters?
- We manage!
It's dumb losing your toes in Russia when your name's Softi.
How many was it?
Frostbitten toes?
3 left toes, 2 right.
You bet, it was 40 below!
No time to go out for a pee.
I got some liquid butter. Want some?
No, thanks.
You can tell there's a war on.
Even in June it's freezing!
War shakes up the skies, too.
I got you darlings lung from the butcher's.
They gave it to me in a shoe box to avoid jealousy.
Then getting it by the concierge, a fortune!
You're rich folks' cats!
But you know, the poor are the same.
They go hungry to feed their pets.
Crumbs for birds, birds for cats!
If only they'd eat them!
You might say, if they're poor, it's because they're not too bright.
I got us some calf liver!
- Taking down what she says?
- It's automatic.
Read me something you wrote?
It's been a bad day.
No, wait...
Here's something I like...
A scene between the count,
Douce's father,
- and the beautiful young woman.
- The teacher? Like your mom?
She was a governess.
The count says something funny.
She laughs. That makes him happy.
He: "I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough."
She: "But, sir,
I've never been so happy."
He's very moved.
"Truly? How I wish to see you carefree!"
I like that: "carefree."
I tried "happy" but it's too dull.
"Easy-going" didn't fit.
That's more like us girls.
"Easy women," like they say.
Carefree is better.
I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough.
I fear this house is too gloomy, too austere for you.
I've never been so happy.
Truly? How I wish to see you carefree.
You even write on death notices?
Whatever comes to hand.
- A relative?
- An uncle.
Was he rich?
He was old and blew every cent.
- On women?
- On books. Let me work.
You come from a weird family! Books!
I'm getting nowhere!
And when you get nowhere, you repeat yourself. You ramble.
So that's why you were sighing.
Luckily, Bost will fix it.
The man you work with?
Pierre Bost is gifted. He's a writer.
And you aren't?
I'm a juggler, a pied piper.
- A poet.
- That's sweet
Known this Mr. Bost long?
We worked on a film 5 years ago, but not at the same time.
We only just met.
He was released recently for excessive thinness.
His release form read
"Displays a pathetic look."
Bost is terrific.
I want to dazzle him. It inspires me.
It forces me to...
Yes, I want to dazzle Bost.
If I didn't know you, I might wonder, does he like women or men?
Women, naturally. Too much!
The girls' mail. Take it up.
Checkups are on Friday.
Do they mean next Friday or every Friday?
At least the Germans write in French.
That one's fine.
Now the 112 on the statue.
Say, Thirard, for the street scene...
Walking my dog this morning,
I noticed long shadows.
It produced quite a terrific, mysterious effect.
That's what I want: Very long shadows!
You'll have them, sir.
I need a hand here.
I told you, no smoking.
What cig?
Stand in for Mr. Fresnay.
The camera will follow you.
- Your butts are gross!
- Not at all!
If you were as well groomed as my cigs...
I steam 'em, dry 'em, comb 'em, mix 'em with endive, and I add corn silk.
A real treat!
"...so I think life is short, and hell eternal."
- 48 secs. 79 feet.
- We have the film?
No, sir.
I'll cut the shot in two.
I need 55 feet.
With a short end of 65 feet and a quick clap, it'll do.
Hear that, men?
The first take has to be right.
Our first takes have been right for weeks!
They're coming!
They're coming!
Butts!
My extinguisher!
Just checking!
Arthur, watch the sound booth!
A swivel stool for Mr. Fresnay.!
How long, Mr. Thirard?
Problems, Mr. Nee?
None, fella.
Get that tattle filter out of the way.
Mr. Bauermeister!
I'm glad to see you.
Shooting only with short ends is a juggling act.
We need extra film stock.
Not a foot. You ate up too much film for the early scenes.
The mountain inn set...
Too many angles, too many takes.
You went too far, so you're punished: Short ends.
I know you'll do just fine.
Your hair's too long.
A matter of dignity.
They won't provide longer short ends, so they shorten the hair.
Besides, long hair is filthy.
Gentlemen, to work!
- Hello, Mr. Manuel.
- Is Mr. Tourneur still here?
He's in his office.
I came to tell him
I won't be scoring his film.
You're quitting?
Look after yourself, sir.
The wind has to change someday.
Children, Paul needs the table.
Relax, he'll replace it.
Sorry. I sold this one.
That's business!
No hurry. My boys won't be here for half an hour.
They'll have another one.
So, you're in the movies?
Quite a world! You're lucky.
I love artists!
She can tell you.
Especially famous artists.
I had Raimu over for dinner here.
I live upstairs.
Raimu!
A quart of olive oil got him here!
You know any stars? I'll invite them.
Name one, I'll see to it.
Not everyone likes olive oil.
Anything!
I can get anything. I have connections.
Give me some names.
- Off the top of my head?
- Let's hear it.
Alerme.
Debucourt.
Gravey.
Sorry, I don't know him...
Women, rather. Women are pretty.
I have perfume.
Stockings.
Moreno.
Marguerite Moreno.
That old bag? He pulling my leg?
He's a fan. He's seen your films.
He can talk about them.
It's just a lunch.
Anything more is your business.
What's this guy do?
He's in business. Like everyone.
Business, business! What kind?
Property, I think.
He deals in furniture.
He's an antique dealer?
Yes... I don't know. Maybe.
He may not know gothic from Louis Seize, but he trades furniture on the black market.
We're his guests.
You'll get a gift of your choice.
Nothing to it!
Except it's in a shady place.
Shady? It's a brothel. It's not shady!
You'll like the Madame.
Will I like your doll?
Olga's like a little sister to me.
Okay, okay, I'll come.
I want oysters, foie gras...
And for the gift: Coffee.
Coffee beans... Watch my makeup!
Real coffee.
But I warn you: No Germans.
Not at the table.
- It's so Chinese!
- It's oriental.
I asked Reine to accompany me.
My seamstress and friend.
Reine Sorignal.
Why, of course.
A friend, Marinette BurguiÃ¨re.
Come this way...
I'm delighted to have you here, children.
They're just passing through!
We'll go upstairs.
Your Suzanne's a looker.
You're quite a couple!
Watch the steps.
It's waxed Prussian-style.
Nice!
Sorry, it's like a junk shop here.
There's no room.
The table, the statue...
I've seen this before...
It's magnificent!
Oysters! I must be dreaming.
Never too old!
A promise is a promise.
Abyssinian. A good pound.
Thanks so much.
Nothing like prewar coffee.
- Wait till the war's over.
- It won't be prewar.
For you...
They're autographed.
Why do you always do period films?
For the gowns?
I don't write my roles. Fortunately.
People are scrambling for fabric.
True, fabric is hard to come by.
Designers don't have that problem.
They just have to pay.
Money buys everything.
A period film's a good medium for putting ideas across.
Nowadays, any critical allusion to the army, the church, the family...
The police.
The police... It's censored!
In suit and tie, you're a public threat.
But say it in a period costume...
Other times, other ways.
Cheers!
To us!
Mouton-Rothschild 1929.
It's not dishwater!
You make a lot?
Goodness, yes.
How much?
Excuse me?
Sorry. I'm nosey.
It's no secret.
In a play, I get 4,000 francs per performance.
Really?
But in a movie, I make up for it.
I can earn 30,000.
That's more like it.
How about you?
It's pretty unpredictable with us.
There are ups and downs.
But it takes stamina.
Do you know Mr. Giraudoux?
Jean Giraudoux?
Sure, I know him. By name.
I mean in person.
No. But I think I might, some day.
Juliette, more chestnuts!
I know him.
Jean used to take me to lunch with him at Louvre Hotel.
He's really got manners.
And education.
And goodness.
He's not paid what he's worth, either.
Some more pheasant, darling?
You look lovely.
Every man for himself and God for me!
Juliette will bring cigars and coffee.
You're having fun.
The kid's a gas!
She asked what I earn on dresses per month. She totted it up and said I'd earn more with a leather goods shop.
You pushing me?
No, you're the one who's pushing.
You ask me: "Is Max Ernst a Jew?"
I answer: "Who gives a damn!"
"A great artist?"
Absolutely.
"Can one be an artist and a Jew?"
Certainly.
"But I won't denounce any."
Then: "Is Celine a great writer?" "Yes!"
"You approve his anti-Semitic work?"
"I don't read the rags he writes for."
"So, you're a Jew-lover."
Mostly, I've been a Jewess-lover!
I may be drunk, but it won't stop me from speaking my mind!
He's back again!
With his net!
- You sure?
- I saw him.
Take a look.
He's a bit thick!
Dirty creep!
Who?
What's this about?
It's just Camille.
A guy who catches cats.
Cats?
What's he do with all those cats?
He skins them or sells them for food, who knows?
Maybe they served us cat.
No, it had feathers.
- Calm down.
- I'll punch him out!
I'd warned him.
Nothing's dumber than an anti-Semite!
Listen to yourself!
What are they doing?
They're hitting him!
Oh, my God!
Take him away!
Shit, split it again!
You're crazy! He's dangerous.
He's a cop for the Germans.
I've wrangled with cops before.
Please, Jean, calm down.
Do it for me.
He started, I'll finish.
He's good for the prison infirmary.
I fixed him good.
Beating up a tramp in his 60s...!
He gets this way.
He's overworked.
So when he drinks, he collapses.
Mr. Tourneur, could I add...?
- How much time?
- Three minutes.
Sure, they're real pearls.
Move the table closer.
There was an extra here.
Hear that, Jacques?
Hop to it!
This is take 59?
Don't touch what's on your plate.
- Not even the lettuce.
- The chicken looks yummy.
It's not chicken, it's rutabaga.
Like the rest.
Carved. And raw.
But we have to look like we're eating.
So look like it, without eating.
Character acting, right?
How low are you framing?
Just under her treasure chest.
- A lot of chest! Get a shawl.
- It's my endowment!
A shawl for the young lady!
You'll be on Ladies'Delight next.
- So what?
- I want a part.
A real role. No more extra work.
- What's a real role?
- You know.
Three scenes with three lines.
For a dozen eggs.
- Eggs aren't rare.
- A rabbit, then.
Okay, but with six eggs.
- 6 eggs and half a rabbit.
- The liver included.
For tomorrow. I have guests.
Mr. Fresnay, on the set!
Mr. Fresnay's right here!
Mr. Fresnay's on the set, always ready!
Lift your boom when the kid exits.
You bet! We'll lift it.
Ready, ladies and gents?
Care to see the setup, sir?
What's with gramps?
We're going to shoot!
My wife's been incarcerated by the police in Vittel.
She still has a US passport.
She's American. I'm worried.
I understand, sir.
My mind's not on this.
So if you'd fill in for me...
Count on me, sir.
Go to it, fella. We're behind you.
Okay. The camera goes here, with a 35.
At first, we don't see Mr. Larquey, only his shadow.
His name is Angel.
I want a strange, eerie effect.
You'll have it, sir.
Rehearsal. Silence.
Don't wrinkle my tie!
It's a bad idea.
- It's like a wax museum.
- No, you'll see.
There's no mystery.
We have to imagine the hand.
If it doesn't work, we cut it.
This will go great guns, fellas!
We'll see!
Thanks for my script.
What about it?
For backing it against Clouzot's.
Thanks!
Yours was shorter.
I'm not a philanthropist.
So we'll make a little deal.
Today, one cent.
Tomorrow, two cents...
It gives you time to make a decision.
8 cents, 16 cents, 32, 64, 128,
Doubling it to infinity.
You know what infinity's like?
I know. I've been there.
It's quite nice.
Cut.!
Not only great guns, but howitzers!
I'll lead the way.
Don't buy it, mister, don't buy it.!
Quiet.! You sorcerer.!
And the shadows, sir?
His name's Angel so he thinks he's everyone's guardian.
It's very good.
I couldn't have done better.
Thank you.
- You believe in that?
- Why shouldn't I?
But it's impossible.
You have no valid reason to refuse.
I do! I'm under contract.
I'm tied up untilJanuary '43.
Predated contracts which arrived just in time!
That's all right. Eat! Drink!
I choose good subjects,
3 times out of 5.
I don't make films in Germany.
I leave our propaganda to the French.
Vichy censorship can't touch us and I pay the best.
- What more do you want?
- I don't know.
Isn't it a bit too salty?
Salt always hides something.
Ever since the Middle Ages.
Forget the Middle Ages, Aurenche.
It's salted just right.
Hire PrÃ©vert.
HireJeanson, VÃ©ry, Laroche...
Jeanson was denounced by the French.
And the others tell me, "Hire Aurenche."
Spaak!
Hello, Dr. Greven.
Tell him to work for me, Spaak.
Tell him I'm no ogre.
OdetteJoyeux is raving about Love Letters.
Thanks. How about you?
I have my ups and downs.
He's not afraid to work for me.
He's finishing a film and he's signed to do a Simenon, a Maigret.
Give him my two films then.
He doesn't have that French light touch.
You have it. I want to make lots of good films.
Better than the Americans.
So I need good scripts,
- hence, good scriptwriters.
- Take your pick.
There's nothing to pick.
And you know why?
No moreJews. Not in Germany, not here. The best writers wereJews. Natanson, AndrÃ© Lang,
Pierre Wolff. All gone!
If you know any, send them over.
Mr. Greven, even if I knew any, think I'd tell you?
Know what you risk talking to me like that?
I could send you to Germany tomorrow.
Sure... If I were a laborer or maitre d', I'd answer differently.
But we're 2 bourgeois. I'm poorer, but still a bourgeois.
We're two of a kind.
I have a Jew at Continental.
And communist, too.
I know it. He doesn't know I know.
Just one film, Aurenche. A comedy.
You know how to write gags.
I'll have Fernandel in 3 months.
He'll direct.
It's called Adrien.
AJean de Letraz hit.
But those kind of plays...
Just what I loathe.
As for Fernandel...
He's a gag factory, a walking gag.
Where would I fit in? I'd ruin it all.
RenÃ©!
RenÃ© Wheeler!
Selling shoelaces?
Not by choice. I have to eat.
I don't sell any, so I don't eat.
I just turned down a film.
A piece of crap.
I can accept it for you.
You write and collect.
There are bad points.
Director and star: Fernandel.
For Continental, the Fritz.
Eat with the devil, at least you eat.
Is that cop here to monitor the gags?
I've had this idea
I wanted to do with you.
A story about river poachers.
A totally free narrative.
- Shot entirely on location.
- Which region?
The Rhone. Simple people.
Anarchists, extravagant as we like them.
Well, Aurenche!
I'm not fickle, but when I left...
You know what Napoleon said?
RenÃ© Wheeler, a first-class writer.
Take him and we'll be a team.
What did our friend Napoleon say?
It'll come back to me.
RenÃ©'s free as of now...
He knows it's Fernandel in front and behind the camera.
Fernandel's ideas, gags, the works.
He talks so I'll say yes without thinking.
But still, I'm thinking.
And I say yes anyway.
Go up and see Marcel Bryau, who's in charge of contracts.
Don't go. I'll see you in a minute.
"Patience and time accomplish more than force and rage."
That's it.
Have a good day.
Come along.
So it's Fernandel.
Your timing of the Tourneur film was perfect!
Only a 17-second difference with the final cut.
Do the same on Ladies'Delight.
You'll work with Cayatte.
The Military Cross?
And the stars are citations?
You were an officer?
Cavalry lieutenant, transferred to a reconnaissance group.
But what happened to you French?
This whole debacle!
In '14 you held firm.
I fought you, you had courage!
But now, why this beating? Why so fast?
Fine. I have one, too.
I was a fighter pilot.
See Bauermeister. You have 30 days.
Nights, rather.
Power shortage.
Take 2 extra nights.
Cayatte lacks experience. You have it.
Show him where the camera goes.
It's freezing!
The young lady there...
That's a projector, not a foot-warmer.
Put a scrim on that projector.
The two girls on the left...
The lady in the brown coat, move to the left. The other lady, too.
My left.
Not your left.
You're holding me up.
I'm going to work.
- Ausweiss, please!
- What ausweiss?
Your pass.
You have my I D. My papers are in order.
Tell them!
It's curfew. You need ausweiss.
I'm an extra! Over there.
Ladies'Delight! Extra!
Me, movies, Continental, studio!
Continental is you! It's German!
- Tract!
- That's nothing...
I found it on the ground!
I'm gonna make a stink!
I know the director!
And I work for you!
Continental is German, it's you!
I'm cold and hungry!
I have fish bone paste.
They're coming!
- Butts!
- What a waste!
Quiet on the set!
Ready, everybody?
Ready, Michel?
Let's do it.
- A chair?
- No, thank you.
Do you need anything?
Ladies'Delight. Scene 248, take 1!
Action!
Take your money back.
Baudu doesn't accept charity.
You ruined me, but you won't last. You've created a mastrous monchine... Shit!
Cut!
"A monstrous machine"!
This was written by a mindless midget.
- Stay in your places.
- I'm in my place!
- It's okay, Michel.
- Bug off!
Silence!
Hammers!
Maybe there's no director!
Watch your manners!
- Water for Mr. Simon.
- Which take?
- Sixth.
- Bad times in Billancourt!
In 20 years, trade will be one big battlefield, on which quality, probity and confidence will be sacrificed. Beware, Mouret!
You're inaugurating a reign of junk and razzle-dazzle.
There's a price that you, too... that you too, one day...
What? "You, too, one day..." What!
I can't do it!
I can't go on playing with watchdogs around.
Take a 3-minute break.
Reload!
Michel's a pain, but what balls!
Swiss balls! Safer than Gallic ones.
Neutral balls!
It's going to be hell!
Machine guns and anti-aircraft guns.
We'll go nuts!
- Go to my godmother.
- They won't shoot all day.
Where'd you get this?
The dairywoman.
I hired her daughter as an extra.
Can the baby eat it?
Sure, sure.
It's milk. He can eat the cream.
As for us... the crust is good.
Your brother gets my goat.
He only comes to pick up girls.
But tonight, absent for duty.
What do you mean?
He never showed up.
I found him work as an extra.
But him...
He'll get packed off to Germany, like my brother.
Except that he got squealed on.
It's been a while.
It's every day now.
Air raids all the time!
Your Brits are a pain!
And always the same targets
Renault, Salmson, Sauter.
So long, Billancourt!
I'm moving to Rue St. Charles.
But that's right where CitroÃªn is!
So? They'd never bomb CitroÃªn.
CitroÃªn is allJews.
- Mr. Raoul!
- This isn't bad.
More of that gutless literature.
My hat's no trash can!
Rehearsal, gentlemen!
I dare you to repeat that.
What you call my tomahawk pin is PÃ©tain's francisque. I'm proud of it!
But you still kiss Kraut ass!
I fought them but I respect the victors.
- "And I inform."
- What nerve!
Hands off! I'll denounce you!
Mr. Aimable!
You're behind on the set construction.
Let me show you why.
Coffins?
The wood for our sets. Requisitioned.
It's in great demand on the Russian front.
That's furniture for the Atlantic Wall.
The studio head sells to the Krauts.
No profit is too small.
To make household savings, use everything.
Let nothing go to waste...
Mom, what're you doing here?
Simone got a summons.
- Summons?
- I came to watch the baby.
- Summoned by whom?
- How should I know?
You know Simone. She called, showed me a paper when I got here,
- and said: "I'm going to Fresnes."
- The prison! I'm going.
You're crazy!
Try the police first.
It must be those shoe coupons.
They looked shady to me.
She got them from her father.
Those shoes were trash...
Wood and cardboard.
Let the time go by
Let the days go past
Let the wind blow high but make sure love stands fast...
Strange place to meet.
There's safety in numbers.
You wanted to see me?
I'm worried.
Simone got a summons.
I asked the police. No news.
Who summoned her? Where?
I don't know. But she's at Fresnes.
I'll ask around.
Continental's no protection.
This proves it.
That's irrelevant.
She works at Sirius Distribution.
If we got her out...
Our job is intelligence, infiltration, not playing commandos.
Sorry to wake you, Mom.
It was because ofJacques.
He was arrested outside the studio.
He was going to work.
They found tracts on him.
They didn't hurt you?
No, not me.
He's at Cherche-Midi Prison.
Better than Fresnes.
I think...
One little tract! It's no big deal.
Maybe he found it.
I saw the report. It's not one tract.
Everyone says that, "I found it!"
But two! You don't find two!
Two tracts is a big deal!
He's only 20. He's a kid.
The Russian front is full of
German kids who may never reach 20.
Excuse me.
I overheard you.
It's a regulation. A German directive.
If there are several tracts, they investigate.
You should speak to Mr. Von Schertel.
Wait here, I'll see if he's free.
His name's Dubuis, isn't it?
Jacques Dubuis?
And the herbs!
A stew without herbs is mush.
Herbs and the marrow bone.
Ah, the marrow bone!
A thing of the past!
But I should tell you about my mother's stew for funeral meals.
Shoulder, shank, ribs...
Beef cheeks.
Sorry, I have to run. See you.
Have you checked on My Love is Yours?
Mr. Pottier wants you.
Sure, sure.
And your contract! Bring it in signed.
I've asked you 10 times!
Sure, of course.
Ah, Devaivre! I know you're crying for lumber and film stock.
Materials and film are my department.
I decide who gets it.
I know, Mr. Beurkley.
If you need anything, come see me.
Come in.
My secretary told me about your brother-in-law.
He's not a Jew? A Communist?
A Freemason?
You have a good reputation here at Continental.
I'll look into it.
I swear.! It came back to me...
You sure?
The statue was at Harry Baur's.
He'd invited Christian and me over.
His collection was stunning:
Paintings, books, and bronzes,
- including that one.
- Oh, my God!
- She's fooling herself!
- She can fool me, her husband, but not about something so minor.
Anyway, she's a lousy liar.
That Paul isn't just a dealer or an ex-vice squad cop.
He robbed Baur before murdering him!
He doesn't scare me.
You can't speak to him, smile at him...
He's Gestapo.
In 1549 the year of the Monkey.
King Maha Chakkraphat became ruler of the city of Ayothaya.
Only seven months later
Taben Schweti King of Hongsawadi
Ied an invading army out against
Ayothaya.
King Maha Chakkraphat rode into battle against
Hongsawadi.
His queen and daughter rode beside him.
When battle was joined the vanguard was routed -confusion reigned everywhere.
The queen and the Kings daughter fought bravely from behind on their elephant until both of them had perished.
The name of the queen who sacrifice her life so gallantly has passed into legend as Queen Suriyothai.
This is her story.
In 1 528 the year of the Rat,
Siam had two kings.
Rama Thibodi who reigned in Ayothaya.
And his cousin
King Athitaya who ruled the northern city of Pitsanuloke.
It was a time of peace.
No wars troubled the reign of either king.
Wang Chang, Mount Soi Dao
In 1 528, the year of the Rat.
In the twelfth month,
King Athithya journeyed to the Elephant Palace on
Soi Dao Mountain
In his entourage was Princess
Suriyothai of the house of Praruang savouring the spectacle of the elephant round-up.
Your Highness!
Don't lean out like that.
People might see you.
It goes against royal conventions.
We're on holiday, Nanny.
Can't I even look at the scenery?
You're a grown woman now.
Try and behave like one
-The court rules are quite clear
-Oh, rules, rules, rules.
I'm worn out with rules I'm sick to death of rules.
Will I meet Lord Piren?
Of course not, Your Highness
You're not a child any more.
You can't just go out and meet men.
It's absolutely forbidden.
Even when the man is my own brother?
Even then?
Lord Piren isn't really your brother, Your Highnesses.
Just a relative
A distant cousin
Oh, I am so, so, so, so bored!!
Nanny?
Your Highness
I'm dying of thirst.
Have pity. Fetch me a little water.
Your Highness
Kayoon.
Quickly. Take my place
Your Highness.
This is not a good idea
Where are you going,
Your Highness.
Please let's get back to the palanquin.
It won't do for you to be seen in public.
It's a serious violation against the rules.
Stop fussing Pudkrong.
Lord Piren is not a stranger.
He's my cousin.
Why shouldn't I see him?
I've never set foot outside the palace before.
Please indulge me
Show me all there is to be seen.
For myself nothing would give me greater pleasure.
But that you should go back to the lnner Palace.
For your own sake before you get caught and punished.
Don't expect me to go back to the palace.
If you don't like being with me just say so and leave me.
We need never see each others faces again
No, no, it's not like that at all.
You..you are like my life
There's nothing in the world I could
I could want more, desire more
Iove more than you
Do you mean that? Honestly?
Or are you lying to me?
Listen to me Suriyothai.
On my honour as a warrior, what
I say now is the absolute truth.
If at any time in the future.
My body or my brain can be of service to you in any way.
All you have to do is send me word.
I will be beside you before you can even turn your head
You don't have to promise quite that much
All I really want is an elephant
That would make me so very, very happy
That little elephant-he's perfect
Would you catch him for me?
If you want him, you shall have him
Be careful! It's dangerous
Don't go too close
That's Prince Tien
That's my elephant!!
He's a wild elephant, he belongs to whoever can catch him
The Crown Prince is here
Is Princess Suriyothai in residence?
Lord Srisurin
Go and fetch the princess immediately.
The Princess does not wish to see the Crown Prince.
She refuses?
Come and pay your respects to the Crown Prince. At once!!
I have no desire to see him
This elephant I have named
Plai Song Tawan.
I caught him with the sole purpose of presenting him to
Your Highness as a gift.
Lord Srisurin
Thank you for accepting my invitation
My greatest joy is to honour
Your Highness's wishes
They tell me you have an extremly beautiful daughter
Do you mean Suriyothai?
Presumably
How old is she?
Nearly fifteen
Ah. My son... begs me to ask... your permission for her hand in marriage.
If it is Your Highness's wish.
I have no objections whatsoever.
Who are you?
From the look of your garments and demeanour.
She is Suriyothai.
One of the daughters of Lord
Srisurin Governor of Pitsanuloke
She is my cousin
Suriyothai?
Aren't you about to marry
Prince Tien
-l....
-Don't be afraid to tell me, child.
Think of me as one of the family.
Speak your mind.
With regards to the wedding between myself and the Prince
You would rather not marry my nephew
Suriyothai
Although I may be the King but I have no desire to force anyone into something against thein will.
I could change my mind today and the whole idea could be forgotten
It would be the easiest thing in the world
But..this is what you must consider it would cause a rift between
Pitsanuloke and Ayothaya which in the long run might have serious consequences.
Can you live with that responsibility
You won't run away again?
Is that understood?
1 529 The Year of the Ox
A white omen appears in the sky.
Indra's arrow crossing relentlessly from the South to the Northwest
Sunday. Eighth day of the waxing moon of the twelfth lunar month.
King RamaThibodi I goes into the chapel
That same night he passes away.
Pitsanuloke
His Majesty King Rama Thibodi is no more.
Long live His majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Long live His majesty!
May he live ten thousand years.
Today is an auspicious day.
The ninth month of the year of the cow.
Thursday.
An auspicious day on which His Majesty the great King
Nor Puthangkul has appointed by royal decree the Lady Oon daughter of Lord Yomaraj to be the High Consort from this day forward.
Wang Chai Palace
1 532. The year of the Dragon.
I have come down from Pitsanuloke.
To warn his Majesty that the Northern provinces are no longer loyal to Ayothaya
The reason? His Majesty appears to have lost interest in the affairs of his Kingdom
He seems not even to care that the new King of Tongu went and thumbed his nose at the Mon in Hongsawadi with a mere 500 soldiers
Do you know why he went there?
To stage an ear splitting ceremony at Swemawdaw Temple
Hundreds upon hundreds of Mon soldiers quaking with fear of a single child
Surely, as the Second King
His Majesty trusted you to handle these matters on his behal
That's not the reason
It's because he can think of nothing but his new consort. He's infatuated
Why must you treat me with so much deference?
Are we no longer brother and sister?
Your Highness is now the wife of the Crown Prince
She should even be talking to me
I will, with your permission, take my leave.
I have returned from China with a special gift for you
What is it?
And what favor are you asking from my husband in exchange?
I would like you to speak to your daughter
My daughter is the High Consort
The High Consort. Exactly so
Ask her to talk to her husband
You mean His Majesty?
His Majesty, yes, His Majesty.
I want her to tell him that
I have some Chinese cannons to sell
If your daughter, the High Consort, speaks to His Majesty on my behalf how can he refuse
And I will give you a commission of ten per cent
I, Captain Rajasaneha, soldier, retired pledge my allegiance to Prince Tien on behalf of myself and all my men
Why did you leave the army?
Because I wouldn't bend the knee to Lord Yommaraj
All those who refused to grovel to him were dismissed from service
And now you wish to serve the Prince?
To Prince Tien
I can submit willingly without a moment's hesitation
An heir to the throne is born!
Your Highness now has a brother
How can I be the brother of a Prince?
I am merely the son of the King's concubine
You are still his older brother
I am not worthy to be the brother the future King
Each of us has his allotted share of merit which has been ordained from the beginning
No one can change his destiny
In 1 533. The year of the Snake.
The smallpox sweeps across the Kingdom. Thousands perish
Promise me..
No, not merely promise.
Swear... that you will permit
Prince Ratthati-raya kuman... to become King by right of accession
Swear... that neither one of you will take away the throne from my son
I swear, Your Majesty
Swear!
I swear, Your Majesty
May the King reign in health and happiness
Long live the King!
Tabeng Shweti's camp outside Bassein.
His Majesty, Nor Puthangkul has passed away
This is the opportune moment for
Tongoo to attack Ayothaya
Once we've taken Bassein we'll move on Ayothaya
We'll get more troops from Bassein.
Ayothaya will crumble in no time.
They'll be hopelessly outnumbered.
One moment, Your Majesty.
I think this is not the moment for
Tongoo to march on Ayothaya.
How can you say that?
Even though Nor Puthangul has gone..
Yet, the moment Tongoo's troops enter Arothaya.
Chairaja, the Second King, who reigns in Pitsanulok. will seize the throne from
Ratthati-raga kuman so that he can defend the city against our attack.
He is a fierce and able warrior.
One not to be lightly underestimated.
Yes. What you say has a convincing ring to it.
In any even, first we must take Bassein.
By tomorrow. I want it by tomorrow.
Fire!
From this moment on you are no longer Hong
Chinese merchant of Nai Kai
Who am I then?
You are Sir Choduk Raja-sethi.
Commander of the left bank with sole authority to set prices..all prices.. for all forms of merchandise
A penny buys only three bowls of rice?
Yes, Your Highness.
A wagon load costs one pound, two shillings and a penny farthing.
Where will we find the money to feed those who depend on us?
And what about other goods?
All the prices are going up.
Especially if it imported from China or Portugal.
Then it costs as much as twice the cost.
At all goes according to whatever Sir Choduk decides.
I thought so.
Hong is behind this.
Sir Pinit? How much money do we have in the treasury?
Just enough to see us through to harvest time.
But we need money for weapons,
Portuguese armor, uniforms for the Prince's soldiers.
We shall have to make do with what we have.
But that's impossible.
The old weapons are beyond repair
And anyway. a Prince is judged by the condition of his army and his forces.
If our equipment is shabby and ineffectual we will lose face.
Take this. Pawn it with
Seng at Nai Kai canal.
It should fetch you a good price.
Enough to purchase what we need.
Your Highness.
That was your mother's ring!
It's nothing compared to the Prince's honour.
I must see His Highness.
His Highness is still sleeping.
I must se him. It's absolutely vital.
What is it?
Prince Chai Raja has staged a coup d'etat.
He led his army down from Pitsanulok and seized the throne!
Your Highness!
Sanpet Prasat throne hall.
In 1 534, the Year of the Horse.
Your Highness!
Help us. Please!
Help me!
Put away your weapons. At once!
Why have you done this?
You swore an oath.
You swore to accept Prince Ratha as your Sovereign.
In the presence of all things sacred, you gave your word!
What do you suggest I do?
Let the people go on suffering as they are suffering now?
Spare me your hypocrisy.
You want the throne!
It's as simple as that
It was mine from the beginning.
But I took pity on a dying man.
For five long months,
I kept careful watch to see how the Regent and his cronies would rule the Kingdom
Since Rathathiraj came to power the city has been in turmoil
Even worse, many provinces have switched their allegiance from Ayothaya to Tongoo.
Sooner or later
Ayothaya will be overrun and succumb to the power and might of King Tabeng Shweti.
For this reason.
I had to break my oath to a dead King.
What will happen to the boy?
Where are you, Mummy?
Mummy!
Where are you?
I'm frightened!
Help me!
Take me back to bed.
-I want to go back to sleep.
-Wait.
Let the Lady Worachan attend His Majesty.
I'm frightened.
Hush, there's no need to be afraid.
I'm here. I'm right beside you.
Mummy!
Where are you?
Mummy!
This will never happen again!
Whatever the circumstances.
There will be no more of this kind of killing.
I think Prince Chai Raja did the right thing.
The right thing?
Killing an innocent child?
Yes.
Sacrificing one life, however innocent to end bloodshed across the Kingdom.
It's Prince Chai Raja who is shedding the blood..
That's not true.
The second King knew that if he did nothing it would mean the end of Ayothaya.
If you were in his place.
You would have done the same.
Never. I would never do that.
No matter what the innocent should never suffer.
It was in the year 1 534,
The year of the Horse that the young King was executed and
King Chai Raja ascended the throne.
In 1 535 The Year of the Goat
It seems that I can no longer carry out my duties.
I am the Lord of Life.
Highest in the Kingdom.
I will not let you die.
Even the Lord of Life cannot defy the Lord of the Underworld.
I.. humbly..take my leave.
Jitravadee!
Jitravadee!!
The Queen Jitravadee gave birth to the Prince Yodfah then bled to death.
So doing. She opened the way for Princess Srisudachan of the House of U-Thong.
She was appointed Royal Consort to the King Chai Raja.
What is your name?
Boonsri, Your Majesty.
I hold the rank of Royal Steward.
Custodian of the Outer Hall housing the Buddha images.
So. Are you descended from the U-Thong dynasty?
I am, your Majesty.
They tell me that you are an exceptional singer.
They flatter me, Your Majesty.
Sing a verse for me.
I will decide if that is flatterey.
That fellow Boonsri, who sang for His Majesty.
Custodian of the Outer Hall.
He holds the rank of steward.
The Outer Hall.
That's the residence of
Pra Matamatayikka, Her Royal
Great Grand Mother, isn't it?
Yes. Her Highness resides at
Piman Rattaya Hall.
Perhaps it's time we presented ourselves to Her Highness.
Pimam Rattaya Hall, Front Palace.
Sroy, take this betel nut and give it to that steward.
Tell him it is a reward for his singing, which has touched me deeply.
Yes, My Lady.
The High Consort instructs me to bring you this gift.
A reward for pleasing her with your melodious renditions.
Your visit here today... was no accident.
You are fulfilling the desires of those ancestors from whose shades nothing is hidden.
The usurping dynasy of Suphanabhumi has taken over the throne of the U-Thongs for far too long.
Very soon you will understand what I am saying if the Uthing blood runs strong in your veins.
I came to inform Your Highness.
That a few days from now.
I take my vows as a nun
If that is what you truly desire.
I wish you every happiness.
No matter what happens the House of
Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj will always honour the House of
Suphanabhumi and offer obeisance for generations to come.
But one thing more.
Never trust Sri Sudachan.
Watch her closely.
Be on your guard against this High Consort.
She is not what she seems to be.
In 1 538. The year of the Dog.
King Chai Raja led his armies against the cities of Chiang Krai and Chiang Kran.
When King Ta-beng Schweti fought against the Mon, he had been unaware these cities belonged to Ayothaya.
Now King Chai Raja was determined to reclaim them.
Ching Krai, on the border of Siam.
His Majesty once told me that you have great understanding of astnology. and can interpret dreams with wonderful accuracy.
I humbly thank you, Your Highness.
For many nights,
I have had strange dreams.
Tell me what they mean.
I dreamed of you seated resplendently on a throne of gold. beneath the Royal tiered umbrella of Aytothaya.
And the one who seated beside you was me.
I can behold the truth buried deep in your eyes when you throw me a glance as you render music to the King.
I know only too clearly.
What lies in your heart... because your thoughts and mine are one and the same.
Utterly, totally, one and the same.
I still believe that bows and arrows are more accurate than your guns.
Give me the bow.
Your Higness's skill remains without equal
Then why does the Captain insist that my children and l
Iearn to use the weapons of westerners?
Because guns can shoot much further than bows and arrows.
They have five, ten times the power.
Modern warfare now requires this new kind of weapon.
The ancient textbooks on warfare will have to be rewritten if our enemies are to be defeated.
The King sent for me.
No, not the King.
It was l.
I seek your advice,
Lord Rajapakdee.
My advice, such as it is, is at Her Higness's disposal.
The keeper of the Outer Chapel is the son of Lord Sithrep
The liege-lord of Sithrep province.
Is it not so?
It is so, Your Highness.
Then pray tell me
Why is he only a lowly Captain.
Is it because Captain Butra-Sithrep for all of his noble birth belongs to the House of U-Thang and therefore cannot expect to rise from his lowly station.
No, Your Highness, not in the least.
In my opinion, this Captain Panbut-Sithrep should be elevated to the rank of Sir Chinaraj and made Keeper of the lnner Chapel.
Your Highness. It is impossible.
And why is that, Lord Rajapakdee?
You are Lord of the Palace.
You have all the power you need to promote or demote whoever you choose
That is true.
-But...
-But what?
While the present Sir Chinaraj
Keeper of the lnner Chapel.
Still lives.
That is..unless and until he dies..
Regretfully, I cannot assume the power.
In compliance with
Your Highness's wishes.
But what if the present Sir Chinaraj were to meet with an accident?
Halt!
The High Consort Srisudachan requires your presnce! Immediately!
What is your business here, woman?
The High Consort wishes that I should bring My Lord this gift.
Is that all, woman?
To repay you for your kindness.
For the advice you gave her yesterday.
I did nothing.
I merely told her the truth.
Captain Panbut-Sithrep can only advance his status if and when Sir Chinaraj passes away
And for that reason the High Consort is presenting My Lord with this valuable gift.
The High Consort is confident
Your Lordship will not deny the raising of Captain Panbut-Sithrep to the rank of Sir Chinaraj
Custodian of the lnner Hall housing the Budha images.
His Highness was served the finest Portuges liquor.
I trust it was to your liking.
Your Higness truely understands the art of pampering an old man.
If I hadn't known that this was the paace of the King's brother before I saw the soldiers on manoeuveres.
I might have thought it to be a rebel stronghold.
Why should Prince Tien betray his brother?
Of course.
He is His Majesty's loyal subject.
More loyal than anyone except myself.
Then tell me. Why do you think we are on constant alert?
Since you ask
I would imagine you fear the High Consort and her malicious schemes.
You put it far too strongly.
I'm sure I have no cause to think ill or be fearful of the High Consort
Or do you have reason to think otherwise?
Capptain Panbut-Sithrep the Custodian of the Outer Chapel has been promoted to Sir Chinatraj.
Custodian of the lnner Chapel.
And why should that because for alarm?
There's no reason.
Except that the previous Sir Chinatraj has disappeared suddenly, mysteriously and without a trace.
And you see the hand of the High Consort in this?
Be honest. You yourself don't trust the woman
I'm right, am I not?
In 1 545, the year of the Dragon.
The fourth waxing moon of the seventh month. Wednesday.
King Chai Raja marched to Chiang Mai with Lord Pitsanuloke as his vanguard.
Sankrao, a Chiang Mai mandarin plotted with others to seize
King Khet Muan Klao and assassinate him
King Chai Raja marched to Chiang Mai to retake the city from the rebel grasp.
I don't want to leave you
I want to stay like this for all eternity.
My life means nothing.
I would happily trade all the rest of my days for a mere one more day with you.
Before King Chai Raja's forces reached Chiang Mai.
The mandarins captured and executed the treacherous Lord Sankrai and invited Queen Jiraprapa to take the throne
The Queen brought gifts to King Chai Raja and offered peace and goodwill.
The third waxing moon of the tenth month. Saturday
King Chai Raja built a mausoleum for King Khet Muanka at Moree monastery.
Aren't you going to give me any medicine?
I must be dying.
I'm nauseous all the time.
Vomiting and throwing up everything every morning
There's no need..no need.
Your Higness is...
How shall I put it.
You know..with child...
Take this medicine with a cup of wine.
Take it three times every day.
Soon the nausea will stop.
No one must know of this.
Rest easy. No one will.
The doctor.. has the look of a man with not long to live.
Doctor!
Last night the water in the
Chakrai Canal was extremely low.
The doctor's body floated upstream and blocked the watergate.
Everyone could see it.
I ran to confirm it with my own eyes.
Then I reported it to Lady Srisatcha.
Why did you report it to her?
Because the doctor was seen entering the lnner Court.
Lady Srisatcha is the head of the Palace Guards.
Thus it was imperative she be informed at once.
And is there anyone who knows what business this Chinese doctor had in the lnner Palace?
It seems there isn't anyone who knows anything at all.
It's time Your Highness was at his studies.
Can't I stay just a little longer?
You are the heir to the throne.
One day you will be King.
You above all must obey the rules of the Court which say it is high time for your
Pal. Ianguage lesson.
Let me guess.
You are having difficulties with the High Consort.
She knows she's the Kings favourite.
That's why she's so arrogant.
The prince was so happy playing with his pony.
But nevertheless, she had to force him to his lessons.
She was quite right.
It's the High Consorts responsibilty to teach the Prince his duty.
Oh, now you're on her side.
She can do no wrong.
Of course not.
But the woman does have many good qualities.
That's why she's the Kings favorite.
I find it hard to appreciate her good qualities as long as she intends harm to both of us.
At the gate hangs a bell.
Any citizen in the Kingdom who has a just complaint may ring the bell.
King Ramkamhaeng will come and listen to his peoples grievances.
Does Your Highness know from which section that derives?
The section about complaints is that right, Brahmin?
Quite right, Your Highness.
All right.
Enough law for one day.
Tommorrow I'll teach Your Highness the Rules of War.
Your Highness will enjoy that.
Srisin, come with me.
Out! All of you.
I burn with frustration seeing you, being near you, pretending indifference. unable to hold you, unable to kiss you to satisfy my hunger for you.
You must be careful.
If someone sees us..
If anything should happen to you.
How could I go on living?
Don't forget.
I'm a humble chapel custodian.
One day you will be more than that.
You are a member of the dynasty of U-Thong.
As great or greater than the Suphanabhumi or the Praruang.
Soon the U-Thong shall rule again in Arothaya.
What do you mean?
What I mean is the U-Thong dynasty. will rule again in Arothaya according to its rightful destiny.
But there is something you must do first.
So that we can be together without having to skulk in the shadows.
Isn't that what we want?
Out. Everybody out.
What can I do for you, brother?
Kill Prince Thien and Suriyothai and every single one of their breed.
I'll lose my home and my head.
No. You'll become second King.
You'll take Prince Tien's position.
What are you saying?
I'm saying you'll become the Second King.
Second King Chan!
In 1 545, the year of the Snake.
The fire is at the Grand Palace, is it not?
No. it looks to be at Yot Market.
Sir Pinit. How did it happen?
It started at Kalahom pier then moved to the rear of the Palace and the market.
That's virtually the whole city!
Who's in charge?
Lord Mahesena has taken the entire army to fight the fire.
Captain Raj Saneha. Take all our men and give him all the help you can.
-Yes, Your Highness.
-Captain, wait.
I don't think our men should leave the palace.
Whyever not?
I can't explain.
But if an enemy wishes you harm then a crisis like this gives them the perfect opportunity
Please come this way,
Your Highness
It's safer than the bedroom.
Your Highnes. Don't.
Don't. That's... the Ming vase.
This one is still alive.
Who hired you for this work?
The Khmer assassins,
Your Highness. From Lavoa.
And who hired them?
Someone who can afford to pay them,
Your Highness
To believe that, you must have proof.
Am I not right,
Captain Raja Seneha?
In 1 545, the year of the Dragon, the eleventh lunar month.
The Shan army is attacking
Chiang Mai.
Queen Jeraprapa is asking the Lao army for help.
She does not inform King Chai Raja.
Lord Klang and Lord Soon crossing the Mae Khong River
On Wednesday 9th.
On the second lunar month.
Chiang Mai will sorely pay for this.
I will not let the pride of Ayothaya... be insulted like this.
Furthermore, Queen Jeraprapa must have sided with Lan Chang more so than Ayothaya.
For she is the aunt of Pra Chai Chettha the King of Lan Chang.
So she had me fooled like a baby
I have only just left Lanna. and she immediately sided with
Lan Chang.
Ayothaya shall take revenge to equal this horrendous betrayal.
Lompoon,a frontier town of Chiang Mai.
Tuesday, the third day of the waxing moon of the fourth lunar month.
Extinguish a fire.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Hold him tightly, he will be in great pain.
The King has been injured.
He has been hit by the Yuan's guns.
If he is to die the kingdom will be without a ruler.
It is time for you to make a decision, Your Majesty.
What decision?
To prepare your troops.
If the King should die, the sole person who can protect the Kingdom is you.
But he is not yet dead.
It may be too late by then because the High Consort
Srisudachan, would surely not let this opportunity pass.
This poison, will solve all your problems.
You meanfor me to poison him?
Or would you prefer to be punished?
But that's not important.
It is the unborn child you are carrying, the one who should rule
Ayothaya one day, who will be doomed along with you.
Then, the U - Thong dynasty will be no more.
When I was wounded do you know whose face was constantly on my mind?
It was your face no one else's.
I am a fool.
This war with Yuan... made me perceive clearly who is the one who truly loves me.
I will elevate you,
My Lady.
"to be my Queen, as you deserve," for all your devotion.
But still this is not enough to equal your virtues.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty!
Get the doctor, immediately.
Your Majesty!
I have been poisoned.
If it is poison why isn't it affecting you?
Your Highness
All of you are in on the plot.
Traitors!
Who brought in the wine?
Soy, Your Highness.
She poisoned the king.
She must die.
Take them away.
Torture them and make them tell us who is behind this deed.
Then, remove their heads and impale them on spikes in the town square.
What did you say?
His Majesty was poisoned?
Yes, Lord Chakri asked me to fetch you.
You are to go to the Grand Palace immediately.
I feel much better.
Almost back to normal, father.
These are the usual symptoms, unbearable temperature and fever, then, almost total recovery as if nothing had ever happened.
Then, the poison will spread once more.
This time it will be almost like a burning fire within.
Blood will flow out from the nine orifices.
You'll even sweat blood.
You'll suffer for days uh.before.... your final death.
Are there any medicines to cure this?
There is no such cure once the poison is inside your veins.
-How much longer do I have?
-No more than seven nights.
Hail great and glorious king
In the year 1 546, the year of the horse.
On the fifteenth day of the waxing moon of the sixth month,
King Chai Raja, who ruled in accordance with the ten righteous commandments of kingship, whose royal decree resounds like the roar of a lion, is pleased to elevate,
Nor Praputchao, Prince Yotfa, to kingship, and the High Consort Srisudachan, to be queen, and to serve as regent until such a time as Prince Yotfa, comes of age, and is ready to assume the mantle of kingship.
It is hereby decreed that the second king, Pra Tien Raja, is to assume guardianship of King Yotfa. from this moment until King Yotfa comes of age.
Samlee, tell me who is behind the master plan.
Your sentence will be reduced.
I regret to see such beauty vanish by a deadly whip.
Name Prince Tien as a plotter, as a conspirator to poison the King.
Prince Tien is the one who poisoned His Majesty.
Confess the truth to keep your head on your shoulders.
Prince Tien, Prince Tien.
What is it, whore?
Prince Tien forced me to poison
His Majesty.
Prince Tien poisoned His Majesty.
The handmaid confessed before the sword descended, that Prince Tien Raja was behind the assassination plot.
I don't believe that is so.
Prince Tien Raja is not the one who poisoned me.
Then, who did it? I'll take him into custody right now."
It was you, Srisudachan.
You planned it with Lord Chinaraj and poisoned me.
Ayothaya must be under the U- Thong Dynasty forever and ever
Now, the end of the Supanna-bhumi
Dynasty is at hand.
The next king must be the child in my womb, the one who is of the U-Thong Dynasty, and whose father is also of the U - Thong Dynasty.
E-Meon has stated
That you are the one who poisoned and assassinated the King
Do you think what she has stated is the truth?
If I believe that whore, who will say anything to save her from punishment.
I would have come with a full battallion of soldiers.
Not only accompanied by a mere handful of soldiers.
So as not to be laughed at by Captain Raj Saneha.
Then why have you come to this palace?
This whore is blaming you publicly,
Your Highness.
In the presence of the noblemen and other citizens.
The regent won't allow Your Highness to escape the punishment, sire.
What ever you plan to do,
Please consider carefully
Captain Raj Saneha and His Royal
Highness soldiers would not let your lordship get close to His Royal Highness.
It seems to be that way.
But I came to Your Highness now to tell Your Highness
That at one o'clock.
I will return to this palace again with the royal troops
But between now and then, I trust
Your Highness will find a way to Escape from this perilous situation.
What's happened? Fire?
Wait, My robes.
I have to don my robes first.
Search the whole place.
Don't let any one get away.
Go on.
Search the whole area.
Those are Captain Raj
Saneha's soldiers.
Where?
I said stop!
Don't you all have any sense of right and wrong?
How dare you fight on sacred grounds?
-Get Prince Tien!
-Stop.
Prince Tien has been ordained and is now in the monkhood.
He will be under protection until this crisis is over.
He has the immunity.
But Prince Tien had been plotting against the late king.
I received a royal decree from the late king. if there is no evidence implicating Prince Tien as a conspirator, then no one is to harm him.
Especially while he is wearing the yellow robes of the Lord Buddha.
No one can not harm him.
In 1546, the year of the Horse.
Sixth lunar month.
In 1 548, the year of the Monkey.
Sunday, the fifth night of the waxing moon of the eighth lunar month.
The messengers from the Northern provinces report
Those Lords and magistrates are plotting to rebel
They are secretly meeting aiming to break away to offer obeisance to
Hongsawadi's king, Ta-beng Shweti.
It's all because the king is so young.
Always playing and having fun
He can not rule the country.
Under these dire circumstances, why don't you take the matters into your own hands?
I am only a woman why should the northern provinces hold me in awe?
Now that they have rebelled,
I see Lord Worawongsa as the one to take over until
His Majesty is of age.
Is there anyone who dares to disagree with me?
The year 1 548, the year of the Monkey.
Sunday, the fifth night of the waxing moon of the eighth lunar month.
I am at my wit's end to name exactly what is the cause of
His Majesty's illness.
The symptoms appear to be a gastric problem which makes it difficult for him to breathe.
I'll get some medicine.
How long before he recovers?
Not more than three nights.
What did you say?
King Yotfa has died?
Yes, Your Highness, at dawn.
How did the king meet his demise?
Laung Tip O-sot pondered deeply on this and it is still not understood.
The first symptoms were not at all serious, but then, His Majesty suddenly passed away at dawn.
His Majesty's death is no different from that of King Chai Raja.
Sir, Raj Seneha.
From now on we must guard His Highness will great heed.
Yes, Your Highness,
I cannot tolerate it any longer.
Never before has the regime been so disreputable.
Even during
King Rama-thibodi's reign people wrote anonymous messages against him.
At the time the king commanded the execution of many mandarins.
But now,
Lord Chinaraj has been in power for only a short time and there are riots everywhere.
The northern provinces and defiantly vying for independence.
The southern provinces are all under the sway of the treacherous.
Chan of Mahalok Village
Your Excellency should be careful what you say.
There are many who favor
Lord Chinaraj and Chan, the Second King.
My heart aches for I am a military commander, not only unable to protect the young king, but worse, I cannot even arrest the assassins and punish them for their heinous crimes, even though I know who they are.
Lord Mahasena dared utter those words?
How arrogant!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Lord Rajapakdi urged me to inform you that.
Lord Mahasena is planning to rebel against the king.
I think, we should not continue...
...to let him be a thorn in our side.
Your Excellency must not bear arms into the lnner Royal residence!
Bah! I am the military commander, my first obligation is to protect
His Majesty.
Not this time. not even a minister like yourself.
It is a royal decree.
What do you think you're doing?
How dare you, women?
Open the gates now
You dare to plan a rebellion.
Don't be slow
Clear the way, now!
I have business with the
High Consort.
She does not wish to see a traitor like you.
Your drunken lout, kill him!
I have just received a message that
Lord Mahasena is dead.
What's the cause?
He was assassinated at the rear palace gate.
-But it is not known who planned it.
-Who else?
It seems that we cannot avoid calamity.
Lord Mahasena was the only noble mandarin who had the courage to defend
Prince Tien, and the rest of the royal family.
There is one person who might be able to protect us.
I volunteer to call upon this person
Who is this courageous person?
Lord Pitsanulok,
Commander in chief of the Late King
Chai Raja,
Lord Pitsanulok's army
The border at Cha Gang Rao.
Have you see Lord Pitsanulok's army come this way?
That way, Sir.
Princess Suriyothai asked me to inform you that Ayothaya is in grave danger.
There is chaos everywhere, people are suffering immensely.
That's what I have heard.
What does Princess Suriyothai want me to do?
She feels that you alone. can put an end to all the suffering and restore peace eternally though out the kingdom.
She would like you to return to Ayothaya to save the country.
I must fight against the minority rebels in Kampangpet province.
How can I get away from here and be there at the same time?
She asked me to personally remind you of an oath you had given in front of her.
A warrior's words once said should there ever be a day when she needs to avail of your strength and wisdom then as soon as you learn about it you'll come immediately, without delay no matter how far away. you will be there.
Lord Pitsanulok.
Has Captain Raj Saneha told you why I summoned you here?
Even if there were no compelling reasons, if it is your wish
I will come.
You must have known already. that the Kingdom is in danger.
I knew from the very beginning of this reign with my lack of wisdom and strength that I would be unable to do anything.
The cause of all this is Lord Worawongsa and Srisudachan.
Were it not for them the whole Kingdom would be at peace.
But then, we would be without a king.
Prince Tien Raja has all the might and the right and the legitimacy to rule Ayothaya.
Once the Kingdom is devoid of a ruler
Prince Tien should rule with no opposition,
Or do you disagree with me?
Mother ordered me to bring this to you
My business is complete,
I beg you farewell.
Won't you stay a while?
It's a long journey back
The gate keepers could use a rest.
I'm afraid not, Sir.
My mission is finished.
Then, let me brew you some tea.
It would be an honour for me.
I can't perceive what is in your mind, Your Highness.
What is it that's not clear to you?
It isn't clear why is that you sacrificed your life and your family.
And yet you are giving the throne to Pra Tien Raja.
It likes killing a snake and throwing it to the bird.
Don't ever say a thing like that again.
Pra Tien Raja has the legitimate right to reign as king.
Your enjoy the same right and legitimacy, You Highness.
You Father is from the lineage.. of the House of Sukho thai which rules that region, and your mother is from the lineage of the House of Suphanna-bhumi the same as King Chai Raja.
But I am not wish to inherit the throne.
Is it not because of
Princess Sawasdiraj, Your Highness.
I wonder
Why Lord Piren is coming down to Ayuthaya for what purpose.
-Dum.
-Yes, Your Highness.
From now on, you must keep an eye on Lord Pitsanulok.
Iike a tiger eyeing his prey.
If there is anything suspicious,
-to inform me or Sir Han.
-Yes, Your Highness.
This plan will succeed only if we can assassinate
Lord Worawongsa and Srisudachan right away.
You must not underestimate that regent Chan.
The knight of the unholy throne.
If you cut the roots, the tree will die.
When they are gone, where will Second King Chan be able to hide?
I'm not an enemy.
I'm here to join your fight against injustice.
But you are a royal guard.
Are you thinking of spying on us?
If I had meant you any harm would I have come alone?
I am ready to fight and sacrifice my life for the realm.
But, I have only one doubt.
What do you doubt?
If we eliminate Lord Worawongsa to whom would you offer the throne?
Sir Sriyod, Captain Raj Sasaneha
Wait for me in front of the chapel.
-Do not let anyone inside.
-Yes, Sir.
I am a monk.
I should not deal with worldly matters.
If our plan is successful
...the kingdom will be without a king.
You are the only one who is entitled to rule the kingdom.
It we succeed and the kingdom still is without a king. the people will suffer anyway.
This is similar to the Lord Buddha having to defeat mara.
If I refuse, it will be as if I have no feelings for the people and I would let them suffer.
Therefore, I will accept your request to rule the realm.
May the secured beings of Ayothaya give you blessings to succeed and subdue the enemies restore glory to religion. and peace throughout the kingdom.
In 1 548, Saturday, the sixth day of the waxing moon of the ninth lunar month.
Your Majesty.
I have brought the political bureau of Lopburi to inform you about an auspicious elephant that has been spotted in the forests of Lopburi.
It should be caught as a royal elephant for His Majesty.
I'm going to be promoted.
This great elephant, is it that powerful?
Ten knotted ropes cannot hold him
We are not bestowed with enough merit to capture it, Your Majesty.
There is no one but you in the whole kingdom. who possesses enough merit to catch that elephant Your Majesty.
Enough.
I 'll go get it myself.
In 1 548, Sunday, the second night of the waxing moon of the fourth lunar month.
Tell us exactly
What you intend to do.
Tomorrow at dawn
King Worawongsa will set out and capture the great elephant that is being lured toward
Pleum Temple.
The King will go up to Sa Bua Canal.
We will block the way and assassinate him at Rang Temple, near Pla Maw canal.
Lord lndrathep's barge are our men.
They all will have their weapons hidden.
At the right moment, they will attack the Portuguese mercenaries.
If Second King Chan
Should find out. he will bring his troops to aid
King Worawongsa, his brother.
Then what will we do?
I plan to get Captain Raj Saneha. to disguise himself as a boxer bodyguard.
In that disguise, he will wait for
Second King Chan at Seua Temple.
If he crosses through the palace gates, he will immediately get shot by Captain Raj Saneha.
Lord Pichai and his troops will hide on the eastern side of Sa Bua Canal.
North of Pla Maw Canal.
And Lord Sawankalok, you will hide on the western side, in case those on the royal barge try to escape in that direction.
Sir Sriyod, take your boat and wait in the middle of Sa Bua Canal. and I will wait on Pla Maw Canal.
That will prevent the royal barge from escaping in that direction.
I think, that Lord Piren is up to something.
A little while after sunset
I saw his men armed and on the way to Sa Bua Cannel by boat.
Tomorrow morning the King and the High Consort Srisudachan will go to catch the great elephant and will travel past Sa Bua Canal.
That doesn't sound right
Puek go ready and arm the elephant for me,
I must go and warn the king at the Grand Palace.
Sua Temple
In front of Regent Chan's palace.
Help me and I will reward you handsomely
The only thing
I want is
Whose boat is that?
Mine, Lord Piren-thora-thep here to chop off your head.
Kill them all!
Kill them Kill them
Head the boat to shore, now.
Get off
There might be a way to survive this
What about the king?
We must save you and the prince first.
Get off the boat, quickly.
I will hold them back.
Kham kaew, take the High Consort to shore.
Fire!
You have sinned terribly.
You can even kill an innocent child.
Someone like you will only bring down the country and the religion.
-You should die for you crimes.
-But not by you hand.
Hurry, try to escape before they kill the prince.
-No!
-Wait, Lord Pitsanulok.
Prince Srisin is descended from the late King Chai Raja he should not be executed.
Prince Srisin is the son of the
High Consort Srisudachan.
Not to kill him would go against custom, and he will remain a thorn in our sides.
Is there not enough bloodshed?
If you only cut down the tree and leave the roots the next king and the rest of the dynasty will be under continuous threat.
If not for the sake of the late king, then for me.
I plead with you not to kill the child.
What are you waiting for,
Pudkrong?
Hurry and take Prince Srisin to our boat.
Let Lady Pudkrong take the prince to the boat
As Princess Suriyothai wishes.
Lord lndrathep help my child.
Lord Pirenthorathep has taken the initiative come forward.
I bestow upon you the title of Somdej Pra Maha
Dhammaracha-thiraj.. governor of Pitsanulok.
Princess Sawat-diraj come sit by his side.
I bestow upon you
...the title of Wisut-krasat-tri, the principal queen of Pitsanulok.
I wish to let it be known.. to all sacred beings that from now on should any harm befall the families of
Somdej Pra Maha
Dhamma-racha-thiraj
Lord Sri Dhamma-sokka-raj
Lord Mahasena and Lord Pakdi-nuchit and should there be any bloodshed, that rule will be treated as a traitor against my word.
May he be condemned and perish under the royal tiered umbrella
May all sacred beings bring death upon such a person within three days or three months but no later than three years.
Let him be forever deprived of happiness.
In 1 548, the year of the Monkey, the eleventh month.
The news of the trouble in Ayothaya reaches Hongsawadi
The king of Hongsa decides if they should attack Ayothaya now the Hongsa army should win easily.
The Hongsa king then conscripts a troop of 30,000 men"
700 elephants, 3000 horses.
Assign Bayinnaung as vanguard.
Lord of Prome as supply.
Lord Bassein as rear guard and march toward Ayothaya.
It looks like the black-tongued king of Hongsawadi has ill intentions toward Ayothaya.
The Burmese have prepared their boats so they could cross the Kong River from Martaban shore to Moulmein shore
For the cavalrymen and soldiers to cross easily.
There is going to be trouble.
Bay, Bai.
-Yes, lord.
-You two and Jormia go scout and find out when the Honsa troops are going to cross the river
We have watched for seven days and seven nights.
King Hongsa's troops have successfully crossed the Kong river...
...from Martaban shore to Moulmein shore.
It took them seven nights?
Are there such tremendous numbers of Burmese?
It's just cavalry and soldiers
...not including the elephant troops that crossed the river some eight hundred kilometers above.
King Hongsa assembled his troops at Martaban.
From there, crossed the Kong river which way would King Hongsa's troops enter Ayothaya?
Will it be Tongpapoom, the Three Pagodas Pass or Rahang in Tak province?
I expect King Hongsa would maneuver his troops in the direction of the Three Pagodas area.
Why do you think that?
Capt. Kla mentioned great numbers of Burmese soldiers and King Hongsa has brought many cannons along.
He would need to travel by water to convey the food supplies, cannons and gun powder.
All of you evacuate to Ayothaya immediately.
-Lord Jakri
-Yes, Your Majesty.
Gather some soldiers and set up camp at Lumplee field to intercept King Hongsa's troops from Ayothaya.
Phukao Thong Monastery,
Lumplee Field.
Work faster.
You want the Burmese to be here before you going to work.
Lazy asses!
I think they are doing their best.
Be we have to dig a lot more the distance from Praya Ram fortress to Kue na canal is a long way.
I heard that King Hongsa's troops have passed the Three Pagodas.
Yes.
My spy told me that King Hongsa had assembled his troops at Sam Sob a while ago intending to build rafts to carry soldiers and food supplies down the Noi river?
It is just as well that we have these spies and are able to follow his plans.
But still, we are not beyond the enemy, their spies are familiar with Ayothaya.
Hold on! now that you've mentioned this, it reminds me a monk once told me there's an old man who lives in a hut by Lumplee field always welcoming strangers.
He has homing pigeons in his hut.
The Lumplee Villagers call him the
Birdman " Tao nok "
Does anyone know his background?
No one.
He lives near the temple where I stay yet I have never seen him pay a visit to the temple.
How strange.
That's it.
-Bay!
-Yes, sir.
Gather some men
...to capture this Birdman at Lumplee field,
Yes, sir.
He spotted us.
Let's go!
From Mou Lmein to the Three Pagodas in less than a month?
How did King Hongsa manouvre his troops so fast?
King Hongsa must first assemble his troops at Sam Sob.. before moving further down to Kanchanaburi that should delay him further more.
That could take about two months?
Or less
King Hongsa may reach Ayothaya very soon.
I volunteer. to intercept the troops of the black tongued king at Kanchanaburi.
A handful of soldiers?
How can we repel hundreds of thousands of King Hongsa's troops?
Kanchanaburi's fortress is in an ideal location it stands on the cliff about where the Kwae Yai river that joins Tapern river.
The two rivers form a natural wall..
King Hongsa will find it impossible to cross.
I will be able to resist the Burmese troops until your troops are ready.
You speak as though you will never return to Ayothaya.
Kanchanaburi Fortress,
Town of Kao Chon Kai.
Move it!
Move!
Even though Kanchanaburi is a small town it has cost me many soldiers and three wasted days to reach here.
I must punish these prisoners of war, to set an example to others!
Executioner!
Take these prisoners young, old and behead them.
Burn down their city and all the temples. and make it known throughout the land that any governors of Ayothaya who rebel against me, will be doomed, with their clans, to die like the people of Kanchanaburi.
The Burmese troops have filled
Phukao Thong field, sir!
They have detected us now.
You must be cautious.
We have a huge number of soldiers more than ten to one
It is the recklessness that will cause our downfall.
Might you be too old for this battle, Minye Sihatu?
Give the signal and charge!
Give the signal to fire!
Lord Chakri's camp at Phukao Thong is about to be taken over.
Phra Maha Dhamma-raja has brought his troops from the north to join up with Lord Jakri's
King Prome's troops outnumber us greatly far more than those of Lord Chakri and Pitsanulok combined.
We need to render support for the royal troops.
Go forward!
Go forward!
Command a withdrawal now,
Tado Dhammaraja!
Or we'll lose all our people!
Give the signal to withdraw!
Retreat!
Let's head back to our camp,
Sormeng.
The Burmese troops outnumber the Ayothaya troops ten to one. why can you not overthrow
Lord Chakri's camp?
Instead of withdrawing in haste
Iike a panicky dog running from a lion degenerating the King's honour
You probably think it is because of the cannons
On the fortresses bombarding us?
Absolutely, Your Majesty.
The cannons on the fortress are able to fire across many miles.
Just like Nandasu said.
Those cannons are three way long.
Foot long mortars, Your Majesty.
It would be easier just to destroy the cannons the only way to succeed would be to bombard them with our cannons.
While we are on the elephant's back
This will side track them and we'll have the time to fill up the gulley on the other side.
Then, we can take over
Lord Jakri's camp.
Let it be to take Lord Chakri's camp in the next battle.
I will make up for
Tado Dhamma-raja's failure.
If anyone gets to the camp and opens the gates for our troops.
I will reward that person with 1 000 gold changes.
All cannons fire!
Fire!
Seize this camp!
No one would dare to stand on the rampart.
Their cannon fire is too heavy.
We can resist them a moment longer.
Pra Maha Dhamma-raja is crossing the gully right now.
I am not waiting for his troops!
But I will deal with the Burmese up on the rampart so they know that people of Ayothaya have no fear!
King Hongsa had said a reward of 1 000 gold chang to be given to any person who can open this camp's gate. make haste and do just so.
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Kill them all!
Burn in hell!
Kill them, do not withdraw!
You are here just in time.
The Burmese are full of vigor and vim. competing to open the gates expecting the reward from King Hongsa.
If that is so.
I volunteer to open the gates for
His Majesty King Ta-Beng Shweti.
I need you to carry a message to him.
But you will carry this message on you!
Your Majesty Hongsawadi the great.
For you have declared in public an offer of one thousand changes worth of gold to any brave person who is able to open the gate.
Now, I Maha Dharma-raja
The ruler of the Northern province, has done so.
Your Majesty should make haste and pay such reward.
I and my troops shall await you in front of the camp at Makamyong field.
If you are as mighty as they say then make haste and bring my gold instantly.
Spare me Spare me
Maha Dhama-raja now awaits us in front of the camp.
I will take this perfect opportunity to erase his insult.
You should think this over
Maha Dhama-raja is mockingly provoking us to lure you forward.
Mahathama-raja awaits not far from the camp.
If he blunders, he can retreat conveniently.
My tactic is
Iet Prajao Prae go into this battle with Maha Dhama-raja whom if we are rid of.
Ayothaya will be mine.
Our children and l have thought it over the battle is a most difficult one.
The courtiers, soldiers male and female all need to devote their lives to defend the Ayothaya kingdom.
I thank you dearly but it is a man's job to defend the country.
Leave it to me and my brave men.
This Burmese war may look dangerous. with all of Ta-beng Shweti's men, horses and elephants storming over us like a flood.
Should anything happen to you,
Ayothaya
...will lose its crown and be no more.
Our children and l are ready to fight beside you in every battlefield.
Give a signal to attack
Archers!
Prepare!
Fire!
Prepare!
Fire!
Keep fighting!
Don't let them near the camp!
The royal guards have come to aid us.
Yes, Your Majesty the King.
Yes.
The Royal troop has moved it's force!
He is not as cowardly as they say must be expecting to fight with me
How well suited!
The great spirits of Burma have inspired the King of Ayothaya to emerge and hasten our victory
Great!
We shall trap this King
Signal the King of Prome to withdraw. and bring the Royal troops to our trap.
Look! The Burmese are withdrawing.
Their troops are scattered and dispersing everywhere.
May l?
Give the withdrawal signal!
We have been tricked!
Maha Dhama-raja has fallen for King Hongsa's plan.
Sir Kojasit!
Prepare the royal elephant
Plai Kao Chakarpat now!
But this is walking straight into
King Hongsa's trap!
To take your life!
If I don't go to this battle
Ayothaya's soldiers will be dispirited.
No matter how enormous the enemy's troops are
I still must go into this battle!
Pudkrong! Order Srichaithip to prepare
Plai Song Suriya Krasat...
I will join His Majesty.
Are you sure, Your Majesty?
It is very dangerous!
You will surely be harmed.
But if anything should happen to our King do you think I will survive?
But our lives are not important
I and my husband have no care for our lives our main concern are the people of Ayothaya and Ayothaya itself.
If the King should die we will also die at the hands of the Burmese.
The royal army is here!
Urge the elephant to hasten on!
Kill them, kill them all!
In 1 549, the year of the Cock.
Queen Suriyothai, the
Queen of King Chakkaphat... the ruler of Ayothaya sacrificed her life in the war against Hongsa in order to save her husband from death at the hand of their enemy.
