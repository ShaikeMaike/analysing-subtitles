{365}{415}That can really only happen...
{420}{532}...when a tyrannical system|is so well-established...
{553}{630}...that it can dominate|the entire fabric of society.
{767}{834}And the Germans are good|at organizing.
{1054}{1108}People's consciences too?
{1157}{1202}Yes. You see, that's an area...
{1206}{1304}...where Hitler did|a huge amount of harm.
{1308}{1413}He actually tried to manipulate the|consciences of the German people.
{1421}{1460}He convinced them...
{1465}{1554}...they had a task to do, they had to|exterminate the Jews, because...
{1558}{1632}...the Jews caused all our problems.|lt wasn't Hitler's own idea...
{1636}{1703}...it had been put forward much earlier.
{1708}{1760}That they had to make a sacrifice.
{1764}{1822}And l can remember a writer...
{1829}{1912}...she interviewed a soldier|who had been stationed...
{1916}{1958}...in a concentration camp.
{1962}{2057}He was a guard, and she asked him:
{2080}{2152}''Didn't you feel any pity at all...
{2156}{2220}...for the people|you treated so badly there?''
{2232}{2316}And he replied,|''Yes, l certainly did feel pity for them...
{2320}{2390}...but l had to overcome it.
{2394}{2504}That was a sacrifice l had to make|for the greater cause.''
{2517}{2582}And that's what happened|to conscience.
{2587}{2638}After all, Hitler always used to say:
{2648}{2707}''You don't have to worry, any of you...
{2711}{2791}...you just have to do whatever l say,|and l'll take responsibility.''
{2795}{2892}As if anyone can take charge of|another person's conscience.
{2896}{2980}l do think you can make someone's|conscience more sensitive...
{2985}{3062}...or desensitize it, or manipulate it.
{3560}{3617}Traudl Junge, née Humps,|was born in 1920...
{3621}{3717}...and was Hitler's secretary|from 1942 until the end of the war.
{3721}{3789}She also took dictation|for his last will and testament.
{3794}{3882}For more than 50 years|she kept her memories to herself...
{3886}{3995}...and remained silent about her life,|her adversities and her distress.
{4028}{4084}Frau Junge married|Hitler's manservant...
{4088}{4131}...Hans Hermann Junge, in 1943.
{4135}{4238}Shortly thereafter he enlisted|for frontline service...
{4243}{4346}...and was shot and killed 14 months|later in France during a low attack.
{4350}{4454}Starting in the mid-1950s, she lived|in a one-bedroom flat in Munich.
{4511}{4613}ln April and June 2001|several meetings with Frau Junge...
{4617}{4696}...were arranged|by author Melissa Müller...
{4701}{4758}...which resulted in this film.
{5809}{5887}The longer l live, the older l get...
{5892}{5983}...the more l feel this burden...
{5988}{6080}...this feeling of guilt,|because l worked for a man...
{6084}{6141}...and l actually liked him, but...
{6145}{6206}...he caused such terrible suffering.
{6210}{6283}You see, details came out later|about what really...
{6287}{6335}...happened in the concentration|camps.
{6340}{6438}l read Viktor Klemperer's books,|and it was much later, of course...
{6442}{6531}...but it did give me|the very strong sensation that...
{6536}{6632}...all these problems at least began|for the Jews...
{6637}{6710}...right at the start, in 1933 or 1934.
{6717}{6817}And the feeling that l was so unaware|and so thoughtless....
{6822}{6890}l didn't notice or pay attention.|That feeling...
{6894}{6947}...has oppressed me more and more.
{6993}{7062}lt seems to me|that l should be angry...
{7066}{7184}...with the child l was,|that juvenile young girl...
{7197}{7291}...or that l can't forgive her|for failing to recognize in time...
{7296}{7352}...what horrors that monster caused.
{7356}{7442}The fact that l didn't see|what l was getting involved in...
{7446}{7532}...and above all that l just said ''yes''|without thinking at all.
{7537}{7621}After all, it wasn't as though|l were a fervent Nazi.
{7628}{7705}And when l went to Berlin,|l could have said:
{7709}{7753}''No, l don't want that job...
{7757}{7821}...l don't want to be sent|to the Führer's headquarters.''
{7829}{7903}But l didn't do that,|because l was simply too curious.
{7908}{7973}And l suppose|l couldn't really imagine...
{7980}{8077}...that destiny would drive me on|and leave me in a situation...
{8081}{8158}...that l had never aspired to at all.
{8165}{8213}But nevertheless...
{8217}{8294}...l find it hard to forgive myself|for everything.
{8360}{8459}l mean, of course today|there's no doubt about it. l have to say:
{8463}{8521}He was an absolute criminal.
{8528}{8607}He was a criminal--|lt's just that l didn't realize it.
{8640}{8734}At some point afterwards l began to|wonder if l should have seen that.
{8738}{8848}But then l think l was only 1 3 years old|when he first came on the scene...
{8856}{8958}...and l was quite late developing|in lots of ways...
{9013}{9111}...and after all, apart from me there|were millions who didn't see that.
{9115}{9197}l mean, it's not as though|everyone apart from me...
{9205}{9261}...realized what a criminal he was.
{9313}{9406}And l try to take heart|from those thoughts.
{9641}{9749}And Hitler did somehow embody|something monumental...
{9756}{9818}...at first, when l was a child.
{9842}{9971}The first time l met him|he probably had a kind of paternal...
{9997}{10094}...protective attitude towards me too...
{10100}{10159}...and that's something|l had longed for.
{10214}{10294}l'd never been able to follow|my own inclinations...
{10299}{10361}...and l'd never had that feeling...
{10365}{10445}...of security in a complete family.
{10450}{10525}My mother did everything for us,|it's true...
{10533}{10612}...but l used to envy children|who could say things like:
{10616}{10711}''My father says so and so,''|or ''My father thinks....''
{10721}{10822}l used to think having a father|must be very important.
{10841}{10939}Then l started working for Hitler,|and suddenly l had...
{10943}{10998}...that sense of security too.
{11007}{11106}There really was a certain kind|of security in that...
{11116}{11219}...community, which cut itself off|so much from the outside.
{11270}{11356}l think l matured late, as well.
{11360}{11481}l think l had a very subservient|attitude toward him...
{11486}{11534}...as a father figure.
{11625}{11665}But that can easily...
{11669}{11752}...be transformed into hatred,|if your father disappoints you.
{11874}{11948}Unfortunately,|my family was completely apolitical.
{11959}{12059}My mother brought us up by herself,|and her father...
{12065}{12106}...who was a general...
{12110}{12191}...was really a tyrant in the house.
{12196}{12286}Devil at home and angel in company,|people always used to say.
{12291}{12370}He wasn't at all interested|in politics...
{12374}{12437}...and the subject|was never discussed.
{12467}{12598}We were brought up according to|various other principles:
{12608}{12701}Doing without things,|making sacrifices and backing down.
{12709}{12764}They were all seen as virtues,|although...
{12769}{12836}...today the attitude is virtually|the opposite.
{12840}{12901}And l think l was incredibly|conformist as a child.
{12909}{12972}l always had to do without things|and make sacrifices...
{12976}{13048}...because my mother had|such a difficult time.
{13052}{13118}She ran the household for her father...
{13122}{13220}...and since she didn't have any|money, as a divorced woman...
{13224}{13311}...he always made it clear to us|that he was supporting us.
{13316}{13391}And there was always that pressure...
{13415}{13528}...that mental and moral pressure|surrounding the whole situation.
{13584}{13662}l actually ended up with Hitler|by complete coincidence...
{13666}{13743}...by chance and foolishness,|l'd have to say.
{13774}{13899}When l was a young girl l didn't really|have any exact ideas or plans...
{13904}{13989}...that l wanted to achieve in my life,|or any sense...
{13993}{14051}...of wanting to be something.
{14089}{14141}And l couldn't go to high school...
{14146}{14215}...because the school fees were|a problem for my mother.
{14219}{14300}So l had to leave secondary school|after the first state examination.
{14304}{14371}And then they said, ''You'd better|go to commercial school...
{14375}{14470}..."and get a job in an office, that's"|"the quickest way to earn a living. ''
{14474}{14549}"And so that was to be my fate"...
{14553}{14650}..."and I couldn't see"|"any other chance at all".
{14677}{14764}"I suppose I also felt awkward|"because I was the oldest"...
{14769}{14841}...and l was still at home...
{14846}{14928}...while my younger sister was out|in the big wide world.
{14937}{14993}Then she came up with an idea.|She said:
{14997}{15051}''l know, let's ask Albert Bormann...
{15055}{15138}...if he can get you transferred|to Berlin.''
{15154}{15259}And l said all right,|without any idea at all, of course...
{15264}{15317}...what the consequences would be.
{15321}{15380}l ought to explain something else.
{15449}{15555}At that time, you see,|which was 1941 ...
{15566}{15665}...l'd always thought that as well as|working in an office...
{15669}{15739}...l could satisfy|my passion for dancing...
{15743}{15821}...and l really wanted to go|to dance school.
{15826}{15941}So in 1941 l took the entrance exam|for dance school...
{15945}{16029}...and the result was very good,|so l thought l could...
{16037}{16099}...escape from office work forever.
{16106}{16174}But they wouldn't let me leave|the publishing company...
{16179}{16252}...where l was working,|because during the war...
{16266}{16375}...you could only change your job with|the permission of your employer.
{16395}{16495}And that made me so disappointed|and so cross...
{16499}{16574}...that l poured my heart out|to my sister...
{16578}{16651}...who was a dancer in Berlin|by that time.
{16655}{16743}And then she got her best friend...
{16748}{16830}...to talk to her brother-in-law,|Albert Bormann, and ask him...
{16838}{16891}...to have me transferred.
{16895}{16944}So that was a chance for me...
{16948}{17003}...to get away from home...
{17007}{17105}...and also get back|at them in a way.
{17113}{17179}lt was an act of defiance too...
{17193}{17276}...against my employer,|who didn't want to let me go.
{17287}{17371}l should also say that|when l was in Berlin...
{17376}{17431}...working in the|Führer's chancellery...
{17452}{17539}...l never saw Hitler face to face at all.
{17543}{17602}l used to open his mail...
{17607}{17695}...and read the love letters|women would send him...
{17699}{17771}...but he wasn't there in person at all.
{17775}{17840}None of the others|ever saw him either.
{17845}{17913}He was in his personal headquarters...
{17917}{18001}...far away from his outer office,|you might say.
{18049}{18129}Then one day a typing competition...
{18133}{18250}...was announced, throughout the|whole of the chancellery complex...
{18266}{18314}...and it was rumored that...
{18318}{18397}...Hitler was looking for|a young girl to be his secretary.
{18413}{18537}Albert Bormann absolutely insisted|that l should take the test.
{18549}{18659}So l did, but l genuinely didn't have|any real ambition to get the job...
{18663}{18782}...because l was actually quite content|with my life at that time.
{18789}{18864}Living with my sister was fine...
{18880}{18966}...and the job was quite interesting....
{18986}{19081}Anyway, l took the typing test...
{19094}{19143}...and apparently l was quite good...
{19151}{19210}...even though l had the feeling|that l was awful.
{19219}{19304}ln any case, one day,|l think it was in...
{19308}{19355}...October or November, or later....
{19359}{19432}No, it was much later,|it was early in December...
{19436}{19538}...and the 10 best girls|from the typing test...
{19550}{19613}...were told to board|the Führer's special train...
{19618}{19726}...and taken to the Wolf's Lair,|Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia.
{19766}{19839}At first we stayed|on the Führer's train...
{19843}{19932}...which was in the grounds|of the headquarters...
{19937}{20019}...until Hitler had time to see us...
{20027}{20076}...which took days, in the end.
{20081}{20184}And then, one night we were taken|through a dark forest...
{20188}{20233}...to the Führer's bunker.
{20253}{20381}And that's where the decisive|meeting actually took place.
{20400}{20529}lt was a very unpleasant building,|that bunker was...
{20552}{20613}...and in the anteroom,|the servant's area...
{20617}{20680}...we all lined up.|There were some...
{20685}{20756}...chairs with cork seats...
{20765}{20843}...and we waited until Hitler came.
{20871}{20930}Now, l'd only ever seen him...
{20958}{21028}...in newsreels and public|appearances.
{21033}{21104}So l knew his military expression...
{21108}{21190}...with his arm outstretched.
{21194}{21287}And then a kindly old gentleman|came up to us...
{21301}{21395}...speaking in a low voice|and giving us a friendly smile.
{21402}{21445}He shook hands with each of us...
{21452}{21531}...looked straight into our eyes with|that famous gaze of his...
{21536}{21585}...asked our names...
{21602}{21745}...said a few words to us with|a sort of friendly, paternal air...
{21759}{21827}...and then disappeared again.|When he went...
{21831}{21895}...he just said, ''Good evening.''
{21909}{22004}The experience of meeting him|was completely different...
{22009}{22065}...than l had imagined beforehand.
{22078}{22170}lt wasn't at all frightening,|and there was a...
{22178}{22266}...harmless, peaceful atmosphere.
{22289}{22361}When it was over we said,|''Now we're curious...
{22366}{22448}...to know who he's chosen.''|And then Bormann said:
{22452}{22527}''Not so fast,|now you'll have a trial dictation.''
{22556}{22599}So l went for a trial dictation.
{22603}{22708}But Bormann sent another girl|along with me, just in case...
{22723}{22790}...because apparently Hitler...
{22800}{22866}...had already had a nasty|experience one time...
{22874}{22929}...when he asked a secretary...
{22934}{23007}...to write down something|he wanted to dictate.
{23011}{23134}She was so nervous that she had|a sort of hysterical fit...
{23138}{23200}...and he was afraid of that|happening again.
{23204}{23278}Well, l entered the room...
{23312}{23417}...and l could feel how cold it was.|Hitler didn't like warm rooms.
{23432}{23525}And he was very friendly|towards me, again.
{23529}{23582}''My child,'' he said,|''Don't be nervous.
{23587}{23663}You can't possibly make|as many mistakes as me.
{23667}{23759}Sit over here.|Shall l fetch a heater for you?''
{23764}{23814}He meant an electric heater.
{23818}{23916}We had special typewriters|that were quiet.
{23924}{24009}They were called Silenta typewriters.
{24028}{24106}And then he started|dictating something.
{24111}{24201}Well, l started typing,|but l knew my hands were trembling...
{24205}{24282}...so much that l didn't hit|any of the right keys.
{24287}{24365}l stared down at the paper,|and it looked like Chinese.
{24369}{24459}And then, thank God,|or perhaps unfortunately...
{24464}{24537}...his servant came in, Linge,|and said to Hitler:
{24541}{24604}''My Führer,|Ribbentrop is on the phone.''
{24609}{24692}So Hitler picked up the phone|and talked for a while...
{24700}{24745}...like any other boss would do.
{24752}{24837}And that gave me time to calm down|and rewrite the sentence...
{24841}{24901}...in correct German.
{24912}{24977}Then he dictated some more,|and it was fine.
{24982}{25112}lt was actually quite easy.
{25133}{25207}At the end l gave him the paper,|and l went.
{25211}{25281}He was quite happy,|and l was quite happy.
{25310}{25369}l did find it exciting.
{25377}{25436}l didn't know|what had happened to me.
{25440}{25528}Suddenly there l was,|little Traudl Humps, sitting...
{25532}{25565}...opposite the Führer.
{25569}{25655}And the Führer himself,|whatever you thought about him...
{25660}{25716}...was a great man in those days.
{25721}{25828}lt was such an extraordinary|situation...
{25832}{25901}..."so incredible, such an adventure".
{25965}{26071}"And then he called for me|"a few more times, to take dictation"...
{26079}{26150}..."even though there were other"|"secretaries available"...
{26154}{26208}...the two old secretaries.
{26293}{26388}l really liked being in the Führer's|headquarters, in the forest.
{26396}{26482}ln fact, all my life|l've disliked working...
{26486}{26561}...those rigid office hours...
{26566}{26619}...and sitting at a desk all day long.
{26627}{26689}And there was none of that there.
{26702}{26788}After all, Hitler didn't want someone|in the outer office...
{26793}{26887}...a secretary sitting there all day long,|managing appointments...
{26891}{26989}...and taking phone calls and|making coffee for him.
{26993}{27080}The secretaries weren't stationed|in an office at all.
{27085}{27154}They had their own apartments,|their own rooms...
{27158}{27217}...and were only called|to take dictation.
{27221}{27322}He only dictated public speeches...
{27330}{27387}...or private letters...
{27392}{27470}...or some other personal things.
{27477}{27537}We never had to write anything...
{27541}{27613}...about politics or military matters.
{27642}{27682}Then he called for me again...
{27686}{27787}...and the two old secretaries were|standing to his left and right...
{27794}{27866}...and he said, ''Fräulein Humps...
{27871}{27941}...now l should like to ask you...
{27969}{28040}...if you wish to remain with me.''
{28061}{28103}And then he said:
{28107}{28184}''You know,|it's always a problem for me...
{28188}{28259}...if l take pretty young secretaries.
{28264}{28330}Someone always marries them|and whisks them off.
{28337}{28416}Maybe they should have to wear|disfiguring ornaments...
{28420}{28484}...like Negro women, in their lips.''
{28489}{28610}And l must have been mad,|because l said to him:
{28615}{28687}''My Führer,|you don't have to worry in this case.
{28691}{28782}l've been without a man|for the last 22 years...
{28795}{28855}...so it's no problem for me.''
{28870}{28922}And he just burst out laughing.
{28930}{29041}At the time l didn't realize|what nonsense l was talking.
{29046}{29131}''l've been without a man|for the last 22 years!''
{29185}{29272}Now, l have to confess l couldn't|really say ''no'' at that point.
{29280}{29404}l didn't have any reason to say,|''No, l don't want to stay with you.''
{29409}{29488}To be honest,|l must admit l liked the idea.
{29565}{29642}ln February '43, after Stalingrad...
{29662}{29724}...things were really quite different...
{29732}{29845}...though l didn't notice it very much|because l was so new.
{29860}{29957}But the atmosphere|in the Führer's headquarters...
{29961}{30040}...must have changed at that time.|There was an...
{30093}{30148}...oppressive atmosphere.
{30188}{30256}Up until that time...
{30260}{30371}...Hitler used to take his meals|with his officers in the mess...
{30383}{30461}...which of course meant that...
{30471}{30530}...everyone would talk shop.
{30561}{30658}lt wasn't very relaxing for him.
{30662}{30772}Then it occurred to him that he could|take his meals with his secretaries...
{30784}{30873}...and we were told not to bother him...
{30881}{30947}...with questions about Stalingrad|or other subjects.
{30951}{31021}He wanted to take it easy|at mealtimes.
{31039}{31122}So it was arranged that|of the four secretaries...
{31126}{31195}...two would have lunch with him|each day.
{31200}{31257}The other two would have dinner|with him...
{31261}{31349}...and the two from lunch would have|a cup of tea with him at night.
{31425}{31471}You know, l never had the feeling...
{31476}{31567}...that he was conscious of pursuing|criminal aims.
{31573}{31657}For him they were ideals.
{31661}{31716}For him they were great goals.
{31723}{31808}And human life meant nothing to him|in comparison.
{31819}{31900}But that only became so apparent|to me afterwards.
{31908}{31977}You see, in the inner circle|surrounding him...
{31984}{32044}...in his private sphere...
{32058}{32173}...l was shielded from the|megalomaniac projects...
{32177}{32252}...and the barbaric measures.
{32286}{32351}That was the awful thing,|that's what gave me...
{32359}{32482}...such a shock later, when l realized|what had been happening.
{32618}{32682}When l started working there|l thought...
{32687}{32778}...l was at the source of information...
{32787}{32841}...and in fact, l was in a blind spot.
{32860}{32896}lt's like...
{32950}{33049}...in an explosion, there's one place|where calmness reigns.
{33070}{33188}And that was the great illusion...
{33192}{33267}...the great, not disappointment,|but the great...
{33287}{33343}...lie that l had made myself believe.
{33416}{33528}That same man who made speeches,|when l think back...
{33536}{33625}...with that rolling R|and all that roaring...
{33629}{33660}...and clipping his words...
{33664}{33737}...l never heard him speak|like that in private.
{33741}{33850}He could speak in such a flattering--|Such a modulated tone.
{33855}{33997}ln his private life he had that|gentle Austrian intonation too...
{34001}{34084}...and he used some words|that were typically Austrian.
{34088}{34156}For example, "nimmermehr",|or ''nevermore''...
{34160}{34213}...isn't used in Bavaria|or the rest of Germany.
{34218}{34324}''l heard it nevermore.''|And things like that...
{34333}{34388}...did fascinate me, really.
{34392}{34458}The courteous manner...
{34462}{34536}...he displayed in his private life.
{34590}{34675}Apart from his stomach and|digestive disorders, he gave...
{34679}{34734}...the impression|of being very healthy.
{34738}{34830}And he had to cope with...
{34834}{34884}...an unhealthy way of life.
{34888}{34975}Far too little fresh air,|far too little exercise.
{35002}{35056}He didn't smoke or drink alcohol...
{35060}{35118}...although being healthy|is more than that.
{35128}{35250}But his problems were all connected|with the stomach and digestion.
{35259}{35327}And maybe that's the underlying|reason why he...
{35331}{35451}...had a vegetarian lifestyle,|or such an unbalanced lifestyle.
{35477}{35562}He was very dependent on Dr. Morell,|his personal physician.
{35588}{35661}And the doctor was a very|exotic character.
{35666}{35765}He had been a ship's doctor,|and he'd lived in lndia for years.
{35769}{35874}His approach to medicine was what|l would today describe as ''holistic.''
{35878}{35932}With some homeopathic elements...
{35961}{36028}...and natural remedies.
{36037}{36094}Dr. Morell had to help him a lot...
{36102}{36190}...constantly giving him some sort of|pills for his digestion...
{36194}{36250}...or for gas, and he also gave him...
{36255}{36361}...hormone and vitamin injections.|He used to swear by them.
{36365}{36476}l often used to ask Hitler's servant|about his personal habits...
{36480}{36552}...and he would tell me|some things himself.
{36556}{36631}For example,|he never liked being touched.
{36635}{36725}He didn't think much of massage|or other things...
{36729}{36782}...to do with the body.
{36786}{36877}And one time he said to me:
{36886}{36956}''l can't wear shorts|because my knees are so white.
{36960}{37003}l'm not the athletic sort.''
{37007}{37055}Or he once said:
{37060}{37137}''Eva always wants me to|keep my back straight...
{37141}{37259}...but l always say she should try it|with such heavy keys in her pockets.''
{37277}{37380}He used to talk a lot about|private matters...
{37384}{37437}...and also about|quite personal things.
{37442}{37540}For instance, once the war|had started he never...
{37544}{37637}...wore anything but army gray.
{37642}{37712}Before the war he wore tails|for formal occasions...
{37716}{37810}...or his brown SA uniform.
{37814}{37866}lt was a matter of principle for him.
{37905}{37972}He was a clean, well-groomed man.
{37980}{38018}For instance, he always...
{38022}{38092}...washed his hands when he|had been stroking his dog.
{38121}{38204}His dog Blondie|meant an awful lot to him.
{38208}{38314}Blondie could provide a whole|evening's entertainment.
{38330}{38429}He was convinced that she was|incredibly clever and sophisticated...
{38433}{38487}...an absolutely wonderful dog|all around.
{38491}{38567}And she had a real fixation|with him too.
{38572}{38670}Even though she had been trained|by a dog trainer...
{38678}{38760}...and was very well looked after.
{38765}{38854}l don't think Hitler fed|the dog himself.
{38859}{38971}But l remember now that in Hitler's|small bedroom in the bunker...
{38983}{39082}...there was a big wooden box|for Blondie, as well.
{39087}{39156}lt was very large,|in case she had puppies.
{39161}{39240}lt was crowded in there with us all|gathered around the bed.
{39244}{39309}lf you wanted to leave,|everyone had to stand up.
{39313}{39342}Well, anyway...
{39346}{39429}...Blondie could do|all sorts of tricks too.
{39434}{39493}She could bark|when given a command...
{39497}{39548}...and not just bark, she could sing!
{39556}{39630}She could make a sort of|howling noise, and if Hitler said:
{39634}{39709}''Sing deeper, Blondie,|sing like Zarah Leander''...
{39714}{39786}...Blondie would sing|an octave deeper.
{39790}{39848}He was very proud of that trick.
{39858}{39932}He was also immensely proud|that she always obeyed him.
{39936}{39997}She really did obey his every word.
{40004}{40078}Sometimes he'd go for a walk|with her in the grounds...
{40082}{40130}...where lots of obstacles|had been built...
{40134}{40247}...and he was really pleased|to see how clever she was.
{40255}{40318}Sometimes he'd throw a dumbbell|for her...
{40323}{40444}...but then she'd just pick it up|at one end...
{40448}{40495}...and it would hang down sideways.
{40499}{40565}Then he used to show us|what she would do.
{40570}{40625}He'd put his head on one side...
{40632}{40698}...and imitate Blondie gazing up|at him, to check...
{40706}{40785}...he was looking. And he'd|have to say, ''Blondie, properly!''
{40789}{40857}And then she'd put it down properly.
{40862}{40941}He used to tell lots of stories|like that...
{40945}{41012}...and l think he really enjoyed it.
{41058}{41157}When l think about it now,|and listen to what l'm saying...
{41162}{41209}...all of these...
{41214}{41330}...little stories sound so banal.
{41336}{41391}l think those characteristics of his...
{41396}{41469}...the personal mannerisms he had...
{41473}{41532}...aren't really at all important now...
{41536}{41625}...because the total effect|was so terrible.
{41649}{41760}l mean, at the time it was quite|important for me, of course...
{41764}{41819}...to see his human side.
{41823}{41889}But today it's almost as though...
{41894}{41959}...l'd rather not describe these things|so clearly.
{42040}{42115}Was there a moment...
{42119}{42196}...a certain time,|when you had the feeling that...
{42222}{42322}...the issue of the Jews came up?
{42437}{42548}l'll tell you about one incident...
{42591}{42698}...which took place at the Berghof...
{42702}{42811}...when Himmler was also present,|l think it was the only time.
{42822}{42908}Then he talked about|concentration camps.
{42912}{43057}He said that there was...
{43061}{43145}...what was called a ''method''...
{43151}{43264}...and it was managed quite cleverly.|So for example...
{43268}{43369}...if someone was an arsonist,|he was put on fire duty...
{43373}{43473}...and you could be quite sure|there would never be a fire.
{43516}{43586}That comment was the only time...
{43590}{43710}...that the term concentration camp|was ever mentioned there.
{43743}{43857}The word Jew was virtually|never used...
{43861}{43923}...in everyday speech.
{43928}{43989}The fact that Hitler would,|at times...
{43993}{44076}...say something in his speeches|about ''international Judaism''...
{44083}{44196}...or ''the Jews,''|that was virtually ignored.
{44268}{44352}Nobody ever raised the subject...
{44359}{44419}...at least, not in our presence.
{44462}{44527}Actually, the only time|l can remember...
{44534}{44633}...the subject really being an issue...
{44638}{44695}...was one evening at the Berghof...
{44699}{44785}...when Frau von Schirach|was a guest.
{44789}{44867}l wasn't there at the time,|l only heard about it.
{44871}{44964}l was out of the room|when it happened.
{44975}{45092}She was on fairly cordial terms|with Hitler...
{45096}{45203}...and she suddenly raised the subject.|She told the Führer directly...
{45211}{45273}...that it was quite terrible, the way...
{45277}{45399}...the Jews were treated in Amsterdam.|They were packed into trains...
{45403}{45494}...she said, and it was|an inhumane way to behave.
{45499}{45585}lt must have made him very angry...
{45590}{45645}...and he said to her:
{45650}{45715}''Don't interfere in things|you don't understand.
{45719}{45791}This mawkishness|and sentimentality.''
{45795}{45869}He really was very annoyed.
{45873}{45974}He walked right out of the room|and didn't return.
{45978}{46092}And Frau Schirach was never invited|to the Berghof again.
{46123}{46209}l think my husband told me about it.|He was there at the time.
{46214}{46313}lt's something l often thought about|since then....
{46318}{46430}You couldn't discuss anything|with him...
{46438}{46521}...that was somehow sensitive...
{46563}{46610}...or difficult.
{46614}{46722}lt was one aspect of him.|And that was really the only time...
{46728}{46845}...a conflict situation developed.
{46849}{46900}But l sometimes think...
{46911}{46984}...if l ever had the opportunity...
{46989}{47056}...to meet Hitler again, in this life...
{47060}{47117}...or in some other world...
{47140}{47216}...l really would like to ask him...
{47243}{47344}...what he would have done if he|had found some Jewish blood...
{47351}{47436}...in his own family.|Would he have gassed himself?
{47450}{47530}He didn't think in human dimensions.
{47561}{47627}Humanity was never|of any importance to him.
{47631}{47681}lt was always the concept|of the superman...
{47685}{47757}...the nation,|always this abstract image...
{47761}{47852}...of a vast German Reich,|powerful and strong.
{47856}{47916}But the individual never mattered|to him.
{47920}{47991}Though he always said he wanted|to make people happy.
{47995}{48065}He started a variety of welfare...
{48069}{48163}...and recreational organizations|in the Third Reich.
{48167}{48289}Personal happiness was never|of the slightest importance to him.
{48595}{48654}Love was quite alien to him?
{48733}{48803}He never really spoke about love.
{48842}{48932}ln fact,|l never heard him say the word.
{48990}{49034}That has just occurred to me.
{49144}{49192}His ideas on the subject...
{49196}{49277}...were really what you'd almost|call primitive.
{49313}{49403}The greatest hero deserves|the most beautiful woman.
{49444}{49545}He once said that Robert Ley,|the politician, had a beautiful wife...
{49553}{49602}...and she must have been beautiful.
{49606}{49688}But in the same way that|Brigitte Helm was...
{49692}{49796}...as if she were made of marble,|that amazingly regular, blond beauty.
{49808}{49879}Although l think she was|incredibly boring.
{49883}{50001}He couldn't understand how a man|with such a beautiful wife...
{50006}{50079}...could be unfaithful|with a less beautiful woman.
{50088}{50167}He couldn't imagine that a woman|could have any other...
{50171}{50232}...qualities apart from flawless beauty.
{50243}{50342}l don't think he really|knew very much about women.
{50417}{50534}And l never had the feeling|that his relationship with Eva...
{50546}{50605}...had a very strong erotic element.
{50610}{50710}He certainly exerted|considerable attraction, but...
{50714}{50809}...l don't know whether l'm right|about this, but l had the impression...
{50842}{50930}...that he felt uneasy|about anything erotic.
{51033}{51085}l can't really explain it.
{51123}{51220}l think he wasn't prepared to|let himself go.
{51234}{51339}And that's a very important part|of an erotic relationship, after all.
{51432}{51484}He really liked arranging marriages...
{51488}{51571}...but if he was ever asked|why he didn't marry, he'd say:
{51579}{51685}''l wouldn't be a good husband.|l couldn't allow myself to be.''
{51704}{51797}And he probably wanted to maintain|the image of an unmarried man...
{51805}{51890}...for the sake of the female voters.
{51894}{51957}l mean, women were crazy about him.
{51962}{52005}l really don't know why.
{52034}{52106}He did once say something else|on the subject.
{52110}{52220}He said,|''Children are always a risk.
{52225}{52308}Sometimes the children of a genius|turn out to be cretins.''
{52321}{52410}And even though l was such|a naive young girl...
{52414}{52463}...it struck me as very odd.
{52467}{52537}How can anyone regard himself|as a genius?
{52542}{52610}lt made me flinch inside.
{52722}{52810}The 20 of July, 1944...
{52818}{52891}...was a particularly hot,|oppressive day.
{52935}{53033}Frau Christian and l took advantage|of the weather that morning...
{53037}{53146}...to go for a bicycle ride outside|the restricted area, to a little lake...
{53150}{53238}...where we could swim around|and lie in the sun for a while.
{53242}{53357}We didn't say a word to each other,|we were just dreaming.
{53384}{53464}When the sun was high in the sky,|and we knew it must be noon...
{53468}{53544}...we decided it was time to start back.
{53548}{53633}We didn't know if the|situation report meeting had started...
{53637}{53713}...and we might have been needed|earlier in any case.
{53722}{53782}When we got back to the camp...
{53786}{53896}...the officers' cars were parked there,|so the meeting was still in progress.
{53900}{53959}We went to our room...
{53974}{54070}...and all of a sudden there was|a terrible bang.
{54089}{54126}There were often loud noises...
{54133}{54211}...if a deer stepped on one|of the land mines...
{54216}{54311}...or there was an air-raid exercise,|or a new weapon was being tested.
{54315}{54372}We didn't think anything of it.
{54376}{54487}But then suddenly there was|a huge uproar outside.
{54492}{54539}Someone called the doctor.
{54544}{54648}We raced out of the barracks,|and somehow we could tell...
{54652}{54700}...that something had happened.
{54707}{54781}Then we ran towards|the Führer's bunker...
{54786}{54864}...and there were soldiers|running towards us, saying:
{54870}{54973}''You can't go any further,|there's been a bomb explosion.''
{54992}{55060}But we didn't know whether|the Führer had been hit...
{55064}{55125}...or any details|about what had happened.
{55133}{55218}Then we headed for the building|where the meeting had taken place...
{55223}{55262}...and we wanted to go inside...
{55266}{55318}...but just then someone came...
{55323}{55398}...towards us covered in blood,|General Jodl, l think...
{55402}{55502}...and Major Weizenegger,|one of the staff officers...
{55516}{55565}...and they said to us:
{55569}{55684}''There's no access here, you can't|go on. You'll have to turn back.''
{55721}{55796}lt really was a big shock for us...
{55801}{55882}...because it made us wonder|what would happen to us...
{55887}{55953}...if the Führer really|had been killed...
{55964}{56002}...how things could carry on.
{56010}{56076}There were all sorts of wild thoughts|in our heads:
{56084}{56121}''What will happen to us?''
{56125}{56221}Or, ''Who could continue to lead us|in the war after the Führer?''
{56225}{56319}lt really was an atmosphere|of extreme panic.
{56344}{56435}We went back to our room...
{56440}{56528}...and waited there.|Then Otto Günsche came to see us.
{56542}{56627}He looked very disheveled|and anxious...
{56635}{56716}...but he said, ''No need to worry,|nothing happened to the Führer.
{56720}{56763}He's in his bunker now...
{56768}{56843}...and you can go and see him,|if you like.''
{56863}{56939}So we made our way|to the Führer's bunker...
{56944}{56990}...and he was standing|in the anteroom.
{56996}{57066}He looked so funny,|we almost burst out laughing.
{57070}{57114}His hair was standing on end...
{57118}{57195}...his trousers were hanging|in tatters...
{57200}{57314}...but he greeted us with an almost|triumphant smile, and said:
{57318}{57375}''l have been saved.
{57389}{57475}Destiny has chosen me,|providence has preserved me.
{57479}{57560}lt is a sign that l must see my mission|through to the end.
{57564}{57663}Those cowards were too scared|to open fire and risk their own lives...
{57668}{57697}...they planted a bomb.''
{57701}{57762}He was raging and cursing...
{57766}{57836}...and he thought the|construction squad...
{57840}{57916}...that had just built the barracks...
{57920}{58042}...might have hidden a bomb|in the floor of the building.
{58084}{58131}Then we left him.
{58136}{58180}He told us with great pride...
{58184}{58284}...that Dr. Morell had taken his pulse,|and it was quite normal.
{58288}{58388}He just had some bruises|on his right arm, which hurt him...
{58392}{58469}...so he kept it inside the jacket|of his uniform.
{58493}{58586}At the time we were very relieved...
{58590}{58714}...because after all,|we had been spared a huge change...
{58719}{58787}...that would have affected us|in ways...
{58791}{58846}...we could hardly imagine.
{58872}{58957}We had dinner with him that evening.
{58972}{59085}No, that afternoon Mussolini|came for a visit.
{59097}{59204}Hitler was very proud when he showed|him the site of the explosion.
{59208}{59292}He explained that the building...
{59297}{59393}...had been completely destroyed.|lt was a fairly flimsy structure.
{59409}{59483}And of course he stressed again...
{59489}{59610}...that it was an act of fate,|an act of divine providence...
{59615}{59689}...that the meeting had not been|held in the bunker...
{59694}{59738}...as originally planned.
{59742}{59835}Since the bunker wasn't finished,|it had been moved to the barracks.
{59839}{59908}lf it had been in the bunker,|he said:
{59912}{59963}''l would no longer be alive.''
{59982}{60090}But very soon afterwards|something came to light...
{60094}{60169}...that shocked him to the very core.
{60180}{60257}He was in talks...
{60261}{60345}...to establish how the attack|had been mounted...
{60355}{60453}...when suddenly the telephone|operator came up to him and said:
{60457}{60560}''My Führer, Colonel Stauffenberg...
{60565}{60641}...has left the barracks.
{60646}{60735}He said he was going to make|a phone call, but he didn't.''
{60740}{60828}Apparently he used that as a pretense|to leave the barracks...
{60832}{60914}...but the telephone operator said,|''He didn't make any phone calls.''
{60943}{61031}So straight away suspicion|fell on certain officers...
{61035}{61102}...instead of the construction squad...
{61106}{61204}...and of course the information|was sent to Berlin immediately.
{61208}{61271}Goebbels was informed,|and in Berlin...
{61279}{61334}...the whole apparatus|was set in motion.
{61338}{61444}The Army Supreme Command|stepped in, or was informed...
{61451}{61513}...and Goebbels contacted|Colonel Remer...
{61517}{61601}...who was in command of the|greater Deutschland regiment.
{61605}{61721}They occupied the radio station,|and other important sites too, l think...
{61736}{61847}...so everything went very,|very wrong for Stauffenberg.
{61880}{61914}Meanwhile...
{61947}{62003}...in the Führer's headquarters...
{62007}{62115}...this betrayal by senior staff|officers naturally...
{62127}{62201}...caused a huge panic.
{62205}{62277}Hitler flew into a rage.
{62289}{62376}He started cursing the cowards|who wanted to get rid of him...
{62381}{62420}...and had absolutely no idea...
{62447}{62527}...what would happen in Germany|and throughout Europe...
{62532}{62586}...if he were no longer alive...
{62590}{62734}...if Judaism were once more in power,|full of hatred that would destroy...
{62738}{62828}...Germany, the whole of Europe|and the entire culture.
{62833}{62904}''They have no idea,'' he said...
{62908}{62983}...''what our enemies plan to do|with Germany and Europe.''
{62987}{63059}The Western powers would never|be powerful enough...
{63063}{63156}...to resist Bolshevism, he claimed.
{63161}{63215}Only he had the capacity to do that...
{63220}{63316}...and he would not be prevented|from carrying out his mission.
{63320}{63394}There was no other solution,|Germany had to win the war.
{63398}{63461}By this time he had|worked himself up...
{63466}{63541}...into an almost euphoric mood.
{63566}{63672}And the incident made him feel even|more certain he was on the right path.
{63679}{63731}l have often wondered whether...
{63735}{63845}...it might have been possible before|then, when the situation wasn't...
{63849}{63938}...so absolutely terrible, for him to say:
{63942}{63993}''l can't win the war.''
{64006}{64088}Perhaps he would have said|at some point:
{64092}{64171}''l have to make peace.''|But after the attack...
{64186}{64257}...any hope of that was|completely in vain.
{64261}{64338}He felt so reinforced in his beliefs...
{64347}{64456}...and that evening he made a speech|to the German nation...
{64460}{64544}...saying he had been saved|in a miraculous way and...
{64558}{64697}...telling us we had to stake everything|on winning the war.
{64744}{64817}''We must triumph!''|That stupid, ''We must triumph...
{64821}{64869}...because triumph we must!''
{64895}{64982}Hitler always used to say,|''lt is impossible...
{64987}{65095}...for Bolshevism to be victorious.
{65131}{65218}l am the only one|who can prevent that.
{65223}{65315}Without Germany, the Western|powers are not strong enough...
{65319}{65367}...to halt this avalanche.''
{65371}{65439}He was convinced of that...
{65449}{65535}...but he must also have seen|that victory was impossible.
{65557}{65594}l actually think...
{65648}{65737}...he had lost touch with reality.
{65762}{65810}He simply no longer...
{65972}{66033}...had his feet firmly on the ground.
{66037}{66099}So then he wanted|to make a clean sweep...
{66107}{66167}...and drag everyone else|down with him.
{66263}{66340}As for myself, deep in my heart...
{66345}{66409}...l did have some doubts,|and l wondered:
{66414}{66464}''ls all this absolutely right?''
{66468}{66586}But then to question the situation...
{66590}{66697}...actually to initiate a discussion...
{66715}{66774}...would have taken more courage.
{66863}{66952}And l think it's also the case that|if you value and respect someone...
{66959}{67043}...you don't really want to destroy|the image of that person...
{67047}{67115}...you don't want to know, in fact...
{67134}{67193}...if disaster lies behind the façade.
{67299}{67387}l don't think he considered war|a light-hearted matter.
{67391}{67450}He regarded it as a terrible thing...
{67454}{67505}...although he never said so.
{67509}{67609}For instance, whenever|there were reports of air raids...
{67613}{67715}...and people described the situation,|or if l said something like:
{67726}{67828}''My Führer, you can't imagine|how miserable it is...
{67832}{67957}...for all those homeless people|whose houses have been bombed...
{67961}{68010}...it's just so terrible.''
{68015}{68072}He'd stop me right away and say:
{68076}{68136}''l know exactly how it is,|but we shall strike back.
{68141}{68210}We shall take revenge,|and with our new weapons...
{68215}{68280}...everything will change.|Vengeance will be ours!''
{68285}{68393}He would always say that,|and in particular he'd say that...
{68401}{68502}...we would rebuild everything after|the war and make it better than ever.
{68541}{68611}l think there was a general policy|of denial.
{68615}{68686}He never did see a city|that had been badly bombed.
{68690}{68813}We traveled through Germany in the|special train with the blinds down...
{68827}{68968}...and when he reached Anhalter|Station in Berlin at night...
{68991}{69091}...the chauffeur would take the streets|that weren't so badly damaged.
{69157}{69249}Another thing, he would never|have flowers in his room.
{69262}{69325}He hated to have dead things around.
{69329}{69398}And that's strange,|when you think about it.
{69403}{69475}Someone who kills thousands|of people...
{69479}{69580}...doesn't want dead flowers in|his room, beautiful flowers.
{69690}{69820}With a sort of last thirst for life,|"Eva Braun tried"...
{69828}{69878}..."to organize one final party".
{69882}{69964}She took the people|"who were still there"...
{69968}{70036}..."back up to her old living quarters"...
{70040}{70153}..."and played one single record called,"''Red Roses Tell You of Love. ''
{70158}{70242}There was dancing and champagne...
{70246}{70351}...and she was almost|hysterically cheerful.
{70355}{70491}But there was a forced,|desperate atmosphere...
{70495}{70549}...and it was eerie.
{70554}{70639}The Russian rocket launchers|provided an accompaniment.
{70644}{70756}l was there for a while, but then l left.
{70761}{70841}l was in a very miserable mood.
{70846}{70946}Then l went down to the bunker,|where l had sleeping quarters...
{70956}{71022}...and l tried to get some sleep.
{71053}{71138}The following day,|which was the 22 of April...
{71188}{71277}...Hitler called a meeting|to discuss the situation.
{71281}{71368}All the officers from the general staff|came along...
{71373}{71445}...General Krebs, General Burgdorf...
{71453}{71530}...and all the adjutants.
{71597}{71637}All of a sudden...
{71671}{71742}...he opened the door|of the conference room...
{71746}{71821}...walked out into the anteroom,|to his study...
{71828}{71867}...and sent for us.
{71883}{71940}l mean the women|who were still there:
{71944}{71994}Frau Christian and me...
{71998}{72154}...and the cook, Fräulein Manzialy...
{72169}{72262}...and Eva Braun. And he said:
{72266}{72354}''All is lost.|You must leave Berlin at once.''
{72372}{72449}His face was like|a mask of stone.
{72458}{72554}ln fact, it already looked as though|he were wearing a death mask.
{72579}{72662}We stood there, completely stunned...
{72691}{72753}...and then Eva Braun|walked up to him...
{72758}{72811}...took both his hands in hers|and said:
{72815}{72915}''But you must know l'll stay with you.|l shall never leave you.''
{72920}{72994}And then he leaned forwards...
{72999}{73090}...and for the first time|that anyone had ever seen...
{73095}{73145}...he kissed her on the lips.
{73188}{73287}Then Frau Christian and l both said:
{73292}{73333}''l'm staying here.''
{73351}{73398}l don't know why l said it.
{73402}{73477}l suppose l couldn't imagine|where else to go.
{73481}{73543}And l felt quite anxious, in a way.
{73554}{73631}l was scared of leaving that|secure environment.
{73635}{73733}Maybe l didn't really believe|it was so serious, as well.
{73741}{73813}Then he said,|''l shall shoot myself.''
{73864}{73901}And he added:
{73905}{73982}''l only wish my generals|had as much courage as you.''
{73992}{74039}Then we left the room...
{74043}{74123}...and everyone from the meeting|was standing there.
{74127}{74228}Their faces were either red|or as white as corpses.
{74232}{74275}And they stood completely still.
{74287}{74355}l don't remember what l did|after that.
{74359}{74442}The whole situation had somehow...
{74449}{74514}...left me in a state of shock.
{74656}{74744}But life went on,|at least for a while.
{74757}{74840}Hitler insisted there was|no way of saving the situation...
{74844}{74903}...although the generals|kept on trying...
{74907}{74994}...to persuade him|there were some possibilities.
{75003}{75091}But after the 22 of April...
{75095}{75151}...there was one disaster|after another.
{75155}{75259}Then all personnel who could|be spared left and headed south.
{75307}{75399}Hitler's chief adjutant,|a man called Schau...
{75404}{75486}...was an old warrior from|the early days, a loyal follower...
{75494}{75563}...and he had to pack...
{75567}{75688}...all the private documents|and papers in a box.
{75692}{75757}He burnt some of them|in front of the bunker...
{75762}{75866}...and he put the others|in the last plane to leave.
{75887}{75940}Then he had to get away himself.
{75944}{76070}He had to set off for Munich,|so he could do the same thing there.
{76078}{76176}Sort through all the files|and documents...
{76180}{76213}...and destroy some of them.
{76217}{76304}He parted from the Führer|with tears in his eyes.
{76311}{76403}Fräulein Wolf and Fräulein Schröder|also had to leave Berlin...
{76429}{76561}...and those of us who were left started|to lead a sort of shadowy existence.
{76583}{76651}We lost track of whether|it was day or night.
{76655}{76736}We would have meals without|knowing what we were eating.
{76740}{76819}We still tried to conduct|conversations...
{76827}{76927}...but from that point on,|most of the talk was really about...
{76941}{77028}...the best, most certain|and most painless way...
{77033}{77089}...to put an end to our lives.
{77145}{77265}Naturally we said to Hitler,|''Why don't you try to get away?''
{77270}{77354}His reply was, ''l do not wish|to fall into enemy hands alive.''
{77358}{77431}So we said, ''Why do you insist|on killing yourself?''
{77435}{77504}He said, ''l do not want the enemy|to take me alive.
{77508}{77579}l have no strength to fight|at the head of my troops...
{77583}{77682}...and none of my loyal followers|will shoot me when l ask them to.
{77687}{77736}So l shall have to do it myself.''
{77754}{77894}At that point he obtained some|poison capsules from Himmler.
{77923}{77986}We asked for some too.
{77995}{78104}The stories about|what the Russian troops...
{78108}{78206}...did to the women when they|occupied German towns...
{78210}{78272}...were so terrible and frightening...
{78280}{78347}...that we also asked...
{78357}{78437}...if we could have cyanide capsules|for use in an emergency.
{78448}{78527}He gave us some tablets,|and as he did so, he said:
{78532}{78617}''l would have preferred to give you|a nicer farewell gift.''
{78642}{78728}We were also allowed|to learn to shoot.
{78761}{78866}Although for some time we|had been shooting at targets...
{78870}{78930}...in the grounds of the chancellery.
{78934}{79006}We had requested this before,|back in East Prussia...
{79010}{79085}...but he had refused.|Now he granted our request.
{79090}{79137}Eva Braun joined in.
{79186}{79334}A couple of days later, it must|have been about the 24 of April...
{79348}{79447}...Goebbels happened to see me|in the corridor, and he said:
{79455}{79588}''Frau Junge, my family will now|be moving into the Führer's bunker.
{79593}{79689}See to it that the children|are given somewhere to sleep.''
{79725}{79806}l passed the message on|to the household steward...
{79811}{79889}...or the director of the Führer's|living quarters...
{79893}{79963}...and a room was provided|for the children.
{79967}{80062}There were bunk beds for the children,|all set up.
{80066}{80161}Not long afterwards Frau Goebbels|came along with the six children.
{80165}{80228}The children were in a good mood|and happy...
{80233}{80286}...that they could be with Uncle Hitler.
{80290}{80368}l suppose someone said,|''We'll be safer in here.''
{80390}{80484}l don't think they had begun|to suspect...
{80489}{80589}...that it was going to be a very,|very bad time all around.
{80686}{80742}Naturally all through this period...
{80746}{80829}...there was a terribly tense|atmosphere everywhere.
{80833}{80956}What was going to happen in this|last round of attack and defense?
{80960}{81010}Reports would come from the front...
{81014}{81116}...but without providing any real news.|There were always crisis meetings...
{81120}{81180}...that broke up without any hope.
{81184}{81248}There were no more attacks...
{81255}{81305}...and there was no more defense.
{81313}{81430}Because Hitler had given up|all hope...
{81435}{81510}...and he had withdrawn,|withdrawn into himself.
{81515}{81594}He became completely numb|and apathetic...
{81598}{81683}...and he would just sit in the corridor|with one of the puppies.
{81687}{81760}Blondie had had puppies by then.
{81764}{81838}They lived in a small room|in the bunker...
{81843}{81887}...a washroom.
{81891}{81996}He would sit there with a puppy|in his lap, staring ahead blankly.
{82018}{82080}We didn't know|what he was waiting for...
{82084}{82155}...but the officers kept on trying....
{82160}{82243}Suddenly they came along with|a suggestion that General Wenck...
{82247}{82348}...who was heading west|with his army at the time...
{82356}{82390}...could turn back...
{82394}{82516}...and meet up with General Steiner|coming down from the north.
{82520}{82599}Then it should be possible|to save Berlin.
{82614}{82691}That gave Hitler a new lease of life.
{82695}{82765}He started to show an interest|in the situation again...
{82769}{82864}...there were more meetings,|and we would sit around.
{82869}{82931}By now we didn't know|if it was day or night.
{82935}{82994}There were no more|regular mealtimes.
{83068}{83183}Nothing was done with|any ceremony anymore.
{83192}{83272}People even started smoking|in Hitler's presence.
{83326}{83411}There were still conversations|around the dinner table.
{83418}{83478}And still tea in the evening.
{83483}{83567}Though Hitler was|very apathetic then...
{83574}{83618}...and the mood was very subdued...
{83625}{83688}...which was naturally to be expected.
{83693}{83779}And there were also a few attempts...
{83795}{83915}...at a kind of gallows humor like,|''Chin up while you've still got one!''
{83940}{84009}lt was an awful time.
{84013}{84087}We all acted somehow as if we were...
{84092}{84136}...automatons, without....
{84141}{84217}l simply can't remember|any genuine feelings at all.
{84225}{84288}lt was like drifting...
{84293}{84379}...and not really being yourself at all.
{84453}{84539}You have to imagine|what the situation was like.
{84544}{84588}The deafening roar...
{84592}{84678}...of artillery and air raids...
{84683}{84757}...the completely ghostly atmosphere...
{84761}{84829}...against a background|of constant noise.
{84833}{84875}But despite everything...
{84879}{84954}...sometimes when there was a break|in the shelling...
{84967}{85081}...and it was quiet up top,|l'd go outside with...
{85085}{85176}...Eva Braun and Frau Christian,|into the grounds.
{85190}{85254}And it was spring up there!
{85258}{85338}The narcissuses were in bloom,|there were buds on the trees...
{85343}{85457}...the sun was shining, and somehow|that raised our hopes again...
{85461}{85545}...made us feel alive again...
{85552}{85644}...because nature had not come|to a standstill.
{85651}{85775}Afterwards we would go back down|into the bunker feeling quite refreshed.
{85780}{85840}And everyone|would be sitting around...
{85844}{85896}...hopeless and full of despair.
{85903}{85960}Eva Braun was with us|the last time...
{85964}{86055}...we went up to the grounds|for a walk...
{86059}{86161}...and in the grounds of the next|building, the Foreign Ministry...
{86165}{86305}...she saw a very beautiful statue|of a nymph beside a fountain.
{86311}{86391}She was so impressed that|she went back into the bunker...
{86395}{86504}...and said to the Führer,|''You know, there's a statue up there...
{86508}{86602}...and if you win the war,|l'd like you to buy it for me.''
{86606}{86656}And then he said:
{86660}{86745}''But l don't know who it belongs to.|lt's state property.
{86752}{86839}l can't just buy it and put it|in your private garden.''
{86859}{86943}lt's amazing, the things that went on.|Then she said:
{86947}{87019}''But if you do manage|to triumph over the Russians...
{87023}{87096}...you could make an exception|just this once.''
{87104}{87213}And it was really bizarre, you see,|because conversations like that...
{87217}{87306}...actually did take place, and then|afterwards we would go back...
{87311}{87372}...to discussing the best way|to commit suicide.
{87380}{87452}The surest way is to shoot yourself|in the mouth.
{87457}{87518}lf you shoot yourself in the head...
{87522}{87587}...you might end up like|General Stiegler in Paris...
{87592}{87704}...who shot himself in the head after|the attack and only blinded himself.
{87708}{87790}And Eva said,|''l want to be a beautiful corpse...
{87794}{87832}...so l'll take the poison.''
{87887}{88009}That paradoxical roller coaster|of emotions left you...
{88020}{88114}...feeling completely drained inside...
{88118}{88147}...and quite numb.
{88155}{88230}Being in that situation,|as l remember it...
{88234}{88305}...was like being in a trance|or a state of shock...
{88309}{88358}...where you function automatically...
{88362}{88466}...without analyzing your emotions|or even really feeling them.
{88498}{88586}And some of the situations that arose|were so weird.
{88619}{88698}Suddenly there was a rumor|that Himmler...
{88720}{88869}...had been holding peace|negotiations with Count Bernadotte.
{88895}{88983}Then Hitler became incredibly|worked up and suspicious...
{88987}{89105}...because he thought one of|the liaison officers with Himmler...
{89109}{89207}...General Fegelein or an SS doctor|called Stumpfegger...
{89212}{89294}...might be involved in a conspiracy|with Himmler...
{89298}{89362}...to bring him out of|the bunker alive.
{89366}{89420}He even turned Dr. Morell away...
{89424}{89518}...when he came to give him|his usual injections:
{89544}{89619}''Get out of my room|and leave this place at once!''
{89624}{89673}He was afraid...
{89681}{89759}...that someone might|have been bribed...
{89780}{89862}...to make an attempt to get him|out of Berlin alive.
{89881}{89986}He had told everyone he wouldn't go,|but they had all tried to persuade him.
{90021}{90117}Then Eva Braun, who suddenly|developed a loyalty complex, said:
{90122}{90206}''And where's Speer?|Speer's your friend, isn't he?
{90210}{90288}He should be at your side|during this difficult time.''
{90293}{90342}And he said, ''Listen, my child...
{90347}{90463}...Speer has important things|to do outside.
{90467}{90584}His place is where he has work to do,|not in here with me.''
{90614}{90711}And she replied, ''But he is your friend,|so he's bound to come.''
{90716}{90771}ln fact, Speer actually did come.
{90776}{90813}Yes, Speer came...
{90833}{90919}...and had a long talk with Hitler.
{90967}{91091}l don't know what they discussed.|Hitler didn't say anything about it.
{91099}{91208}But Speer couldn't persuade him|either...
{91212}{91264}...and l don't even think he tried.
{91269}{91360}l almost think that|at that moment...
{91368}{91462}...Speer had decided not to carry out|the scorched earth policy.
{91499}{91575}Afterwards it was said...
{91582}{91663}...that he somehow tried to gas|everyone in the bunker...
{91667}{91744}...with gas in the air shaft.
{91762}{91871}But l'm not sure if that is true|or if he intended to do it.
{91883}{92011}And then there was another|startling turn of events.
{92015}{92119}Göring had been appointed|vice-chancellor by that stage...
{92124}{92169}...and he was at the Berghof.
{92173}{92280}Suddenly he sent a telegram saying,|''My Führer...
{92285}{92416}...since you have no more scope|for action or decisions in Berlin...
{92421}{92509}...l shall consider myself appointed|your successor...
{92513}{92609}...if l hear nothing from you by 2200.''
{92635}{92743}This telegram had been received|by Martin Bormann...
{92747}{92860}...who still controlled the information|that reached Hitler.
{92864}{92978}Nothing ever landed on Hitler's desk|without Bormann seeing it first.
{92993}{93066}Bormann had handed the telegram|to Hitler...
{93070}{93188}...and presumably offered|his interpretation.
{93192}{93315}ln any case,|Hitler regarded it as high treason...
{93319}{93391}...and no doubt Bormann reinforced|that view.
{93395}{93504}He gave the order for Göring|and his entire staff to be arrested.
{93565}{93645}This act of betrayal made him much,|much more suspicious.
{93653}{93706}He even ordered...
{93722}{93813}...his brother-in-law, Fegelein,|to be shot.
{93836}{93962}Although he had released Fegelein|from his duties on the 22 of April:
{93966}{94017}''You may leave if you wish.''
{94021}{94107}The people who had stayed behind|had declared...
{94112}{94204}...that it was their choice,|but one day Fegelein vanished.
{94208}{94285}Fegelein wasn't just liaison officer|with Himmler...
{94289}{94342}...but also Eva Braun's brother-in-law.
{94347}{94415}He had married Eva's sister, Gretel.
{94419}{94515}And Gretel was expecting a baby.|She was in Munich.
{94523}{94611}Fegelein suddenly went missing.
{94615}{94692}Suddenly he wasn't to be found|in the bunker.
{94711}{94804}Hitler wanted to see him,|but he couldn't be found.
{94830}{94893}Then Eva managed to contact him|in his apartment...
{94897}{94969}...and he said to her,|''l'm begging you...
{94973}{95071}...come to Munich with me.|You'll die if you don't get away!''
{95085}{95166}And Eva replied,|''Hermann, you know l'll never leave.
{95170}{95249}l want you to come here at once.|The Führer needs you.''
{95274}{95339}Fegelein didn't turn up...
{95344}{95443}...so someone was sent to fetch him,|and he was completely drunk.
{95455}{95521}Then Hitler had him shot.
{95606}{95693}Eva shed many tears about that...
{95697}{95744}...but she did accept it.
{95748}{95839}lt was one more betrayal|at a time...
{95843}{95946}...when there was no hope left, a time|when Hitler wanted to kill himself.
{96021}{96081}l could hardly comprehend|what was going on...
{96085}{96150}...because it was all so ambiguous.
{96232}{96349}And then, on 26 of April...
{96368}{96434}...when everything was in flames|around us...
{96439}{96485}...with smoke billowing around...
{96489}{96555}...and there were bomb craters|everywhere...
{96559}{96606}...on the main road in front...
{96610}{96681}...of the Brandenburg Gate,|a Storch light plane landed.
{96685}{96797}lt was Hanna Reitsch, the aviator,|and General von Greim.
{96808}{96876}He was wounded.|Enemy fighters had attacked them...
{96883}{96966}...and Greim had a bullet in his leg.
{96989}{97084}Dr. Stumpfegger tended his wound...
{97089}{97191}...and Hanna Reitsch beamed|as she approached...
{97195}{97296}...her beloved Führer.|l never saw a woman...
{97301}{97409}...greet the Führer with such|obsessive devotion...
{97415}{97484}...with such willingness to die for him.
{97492}{97616}She wasn't passive, like Eva Braun.|She was a fighter.
{97638}{97748}Then she sang some lullabies|with the Goebbels' children.
{97782}{97907}Greim was intended|to succeed Göring...
{97911}{98033}...so Hanna Reitsch was ready|to make-- What should l say...
{98045}{98140}...a rallying call when|she flew out of Berlin again.
{98144}{98198}And she got away safely.
{98202}{98320}But it was a macabre incident|at the time.
{98412}{98517}Suddenly someone from|the outside world burst into...
{98522}{98590}...that trap we were in,|and then flew off again...
{98594}{98664}...spreading a message of hope.
{98669}{98711}We were left behind...
{98715}{98808}...and it was only three more days|to the bitter end.
{98937}{99043}l don't really know how we carried on,|it was a shadowy existence.
{99047}{99171}We kept on handing round cups|of tea and sitting there...
{99176}{99266}...still hoping for something,|still waiting.
{99271}{99383}But the counterattack with Wenck|and Steiner never came off.
{99425}{99499}Other things did happen, though.
{99503}{99603}A girl who worked in the kitchen|got married.
{99617}{99716}They fetched a registrar to the bunker.
{99775}{99885}Then someone brought the bride's|parents in from the bombed city.
{99891}{99974}They got married,|and then there was a party.
{99978}{100103}With the thunder of the artillery|and shells bursting all around.
{100126}{100176}l think people were even dancing.
{100184}{100223}Someone had an accordion.
{100228}{100298}lt really was a bizarre moment.
{100318}{100374}And then Hitler...
{100446}{100560}...decided to poison his dog.
{100580}{100653}After Fegelein was executed...
{100661}{100766}...and Himmler's treason became|known, Hitler no longer trusted...
{100770}{100825}...the cyanide Himmler had given him.
{100829}{100936}He wanted to test it on his dog|to make sure it worked.
{100954}{101048}So then poor Blondie was poisoned.
{101053}{101096}The poison worked very well.
{101100}{101225}lt left that smell of bitter almonds|in the bunker...
{101229}{101275}...which was terrible.
{101299}{101390}l remember thinking,|''That is the worst thing of all...
{101395}{101444}...dying down here in the bunker.''
{101481}{101536}But that was only part of my feeling...
{101541}{101653}...because l also felt there might|just be some way out.
{101822}{101900}l was sitting outside the bunker|one other time...
{101904}{101981}...with Eva Braun, in the open air...
{101989}{102065}...and at one very silent moment|she said:
{102069}{102129}''Go on, give me a cigarette too.''
{102137}{102200}And then she said,|''l shall be weeping this evening.''
{102205}{102271}And l said, ''What do you mean?|Has the time come?''
{102276}{102325}''No, no,'' she said, ''not that.''
{102330}{102440}And that evening,|it was the 28 of April.
{102471}{102518}That evening...
{102552}{102644}...was when Hitler....
{102665}{102697}How did it happen?
{102758}{102855}Yes, Hitler married Eva Braun.
{102891}{102963}A registrar was fetched again...
{102967}{103019}...and the two of them were married...
{103024}{103130}...to the thunder|of the Russian artillery.
{103146}{103258}When she signed her name|Eva started writing a B, and then...
{103262}{103313}...she changed it to an H.
{103317}{103467}So she emerged from that inferno|as Frau Hitler...
{103472}{103563}...and walked past the staff,|who were lined up...
{103572}{103672}...saying to them,|''You may now call me Frau Hitler.''
{103684}{103796}Before then the staff had always|referred to her as ''Fräulein.''
{103811}{103943}Then they all went into the room|were Hitler took tea in the evenings.
{103947}{104009}l was going to follow them.
{104014}{104081}But he said,|''My child, have you rested a little?''
{104086}{104116}l said, ''Yes.''
{104121}{104175}And he said,|''Please come into the next room...
{104182}{104231}...l have some dictation for you.''
{104268}{104348}And l thought to myself,|''What does he want to dictate now?''
{104362}{104460}l went into the room,|which was very bare...
{104474}{104536}...with just one big table...
{104540}{104621}...a bench against the wall|and a few armchairs.
{104635}{104731}And he said,|''Fetch a shorthand pad.''
{104735}{104764}That was the first time.
{104769}{104857}l had never in my life|taken shorthand from him.
{104861}{104960}l didn't have a pad with me,|so l had to go and find one.
{104968}{105042}l sat down, and he started speaking.
{105075}{105151}Leaning forward at the desk,|resting on his hands...
{105159}{105262}...and with a blank expression,|gazing into the distance.
{105268}{105343}He said, ''My political testament.''
{105374}{105424}And l thought to myself:
{105451}{105520}''Now l'm going to find out|what really happened.
{105525}{105595}Now l'm going to find out|why the war is lost.
{105600}{105673}He's going to make excuses|and provide justifications.
{105677}{105733}Now he's going to explain everything.''
{105748}{105850}Then he started speaking,|and all of a sudden...
{105859}{105936}...it was all the old phrases,|''The Jews are to blame.''
{105941}{106021}And, ''The struggle was necessary...
{106025}{106118}...in order to prevent a worse fate|and save the world.''
{106123}{106221}And, ''The German people were not|ready for their mission...
{106225}{106320}...so they must perish.''|And, ''National Socialism will die...
{106325}{106363}...and nevermore rise again.''
{106367}{106451}But he also named a government|to succeed him.
{106459}{106537}Even while l was writing l thought|l hadn't heard properly.
{106541}{106685}lt was so incredible,|it made no sense at all.
{106694}{106758}l finished writing that text.
{106762}{106851}And then he made|his private testament.
{106915}{107060}lf we were going to lose the war,|and the enemy was...
{107064}{107123}...going to treat us the way|he always predicted...
{107129}{107218}...then there would be no point|writing either of those documents.
{107237}{107316}But he dictated them,|he remembered his housekeeper.
{107321}{107370}He disposed of his pictures...
{107374}{107504}...he settled a few more details,|and then he said:
{107512}{107616}''Type up three copies as|quickly as possible, my child.''
{107621}{107727}So l went into a room...
{107760}{107861}...which was a sort of office that|the telephone operator also used.
{107865}{107928}l brought my typewriter,|and l started...
{107935}{107985}...typing up my shorthand notes.
{107990}{108063}l made far fewer mistakes than usual.|l don't know why.
{108067}{108112}l was typing so mechanically.
{108116}{108188}Normally l very often made|typing mistakes...
{108192}{108297}...but this time l think there were|only two little mistakes.
{108317}{108389}You must remember there|was no Tippex in those days...
{108393}{108476}...and no correction key,|so you had to rub out any mistakes.
{108493}{108560}With copies you had to|put something in between...
{108564}{108598}...so it didn't go through.
{108602}{108645}l wrote it up...
{108649}{108742}...and l was able read it properly.|He kept on coming over.
{108746}{108874}By now everyone was sitting|in Hitler's little living room...
{108879}{108950}...and celebrating the wedding.
{108954}{109011}They toasted with champagne.
{109021}{109114}l wasn't there,|but it must have been macabre.
{109118}{109195}There was just Goebbels, Bormann...
{109199}{109247}...one of the adjutants who were left...
{109252}{109350}...Frau Christian...
{109354}{109422}...and of course Frau Goebbels.
{109443}{109529}Hitler kept coming over and asking,|''Have you finished yet?''
{109533}{109587}l was working as fast as l could.
{109591}{109636}Then Goebbels came in.
{109740}{109832}His face was almost covered|with tears...
{109836}{109915}...with a completely bleak,|defeated expression...
{109919}{110004}...and he said, ''Frau Junge,|the Führer has ordered me...
{110008}{110033}...to leave Berlin.
{110037}{110095}But l can't do it,|l am the governor of Berlin...
{110102}{110170}...my place is in Berlin,|and at his side.''
{110181}{110268}Then he dictated an appendix|to the testament...
{110282}{110382}...stressing that he was|in a horrible situation...
{110387}{110457}...because he could not obey|Hitler's last order...
{110461}{110585}...acknowledging that he would be|described as disloyal, but insisting...
{110589}{110628}...he couldn't act any other way.
{110632}{110710}He said his place was there,|and he would put an end to his life.
{110714}{110780}But first, l must tell you this.
{110784}{110911}First Goebbels told|the people of Berlin...
{110915}{110970}...that their Führer was in Berlin...
{110978}{111034}...and would take charge|of defending the city.
{111038}{111117}Because it was always the way,|wherever Hitler was...
{111121}{111204}...the defenses held,|and defeat was impossible.
{111322}{111393}That was one of the many big lies.
{111419}{111508}Well, l wrote all that,|and then it was taken away.
{111512}{111621}The three copies were to be sent|by three couriers:
{111647}{111730}One to Dönitz...
{111734}{111814}...one to Schrammer...
{111820}{111877}...and l don't remember|about the third.
{111882}{111989}Anyway, the three copies of|the testament were sent on their way.
{111994}{112122}Then Hitler said as soon as he|received confirmation one arrived...
{112130}{112195}...it would be time for him|to make his farewell.
{112207}{112281}So we were left waiting again.
{112309}{112415}l destroyed the carbons and|the shorthand notes, of course.
{112487}{112568}l don't remember how|we got through that time.
{112572}{112657}There wasn't that much left,|but it was still two days...
{112662}{112693}...and two nights.
{112798}{112842}lt was a nightmare.
{112891}{112954}And the children|were still in the bunker...
{112959}{113037}...with Frau Goebbels wandering|around like a ghost...
{113041}{113083}...with the poison in her bag.
{113087}{113146}At least we only had our own|deaths to consider...
{113154}{113222}...but she went through that six times.
{113232}{113315}She couldn't talk to her children|anymore, either.
{113334}{113411}The children had been told,|''You will have to be vaccinated...
{113416}{113509}...because you're living so close|to Uncle Hitler...
{113513}{113592}...in the bunker, where there are|lots of people.''
{113689}{113785}The oldest, Helga,|was 1 0 years old...
{113798}{113864}...and she had such sad eyes.
{113885}{113955}She was so quiet that l felt...
{113960}{114024}...she somehow sensed|what was going on.
{114031}{114071}That was awful.
{114183}{114270}l simply don't remember|how we spent the last days.
{114274}{114356}l can only remember one day,|the 30 of April...
{114413}{114497}...at about lunchtime,|the children looked so lost.
{114501}{114581}l said, ''Didn't you have any lunch?''|''No, we're hungry.''
{114585}{114689}So l took them to a place|on the stairs...
{114697}{114790}...between the central section of|the bunker and the Führer's quarters...
{114797}{114849}...where there was a sort of platform...
{114853}{114914}...with a round table and a bench.
{114921}{114985}l made some lunch for the children.
{114989}{115049}Bread and butter with marmalade,|l think.
{115053}{115109}They really enjoyed it...
{115114}{115205}...and they started counting|the direct hits...
{115209}{115272}...because they felt so safe|down in the bunker.
{115277}{115366}They knew there was no danger|under 1 1 meters of concrete.
{115449}{115516}l'm sure l remember|there was a bang...
{115524}{115582}...and Helmut said,|''That was a direct hit!''
{115586}{115665}And it seems to me that|was the shot when Hitler--
{115673}{115826}Oh, l forgot, of course,|Hitler said goodbye first.
{115839}{115894}That was on the 30.
{115898}{115959}Suddenly Linge appeared and said:
{115963}{116028}''Frau Junge and Frau Christian!''
{116033}{116148}We went to the big corridor|outside Hitler's room...
{116158}{116204}...and Günsche said:
{116209}{116281}''Come here, the Führer|wants to say farewell.''
{116291}{116363}l walked up to him|like a waxwork doll...
{116367}{116501}...and he was standing there|with a completely distant expression.
{116538}{116600}He had already departed|from this world.
{116613}{116683}He shook hands with me|and gazed ahead blankly...
{116687}{116762}...and then he said something|l couldn't make out.
{116767}{116843}So l never understood|the last words he spoke to me.
{116858}{116948}He turned round and shook hands|with Frau Christian...
{116953}{116988}...and Frau Manzialy.
{116992}{117060}Then Eva Braun|gave me a hug and said:
{117078}{117131}''Frau Junge, try to get back home...
{117135}{117184}...and say hello to Bavaria for me.''
{117203}{117330}l should also tell you|about Eva Braun's maid, Liesl.
{117335}{117392}She said to Frau Goebbels|again and again:
{117400}{117516}''l'll take the children with me|and try to get through!''
{117530}{117613}But Frau Goebbels just said,|''No, that's impossible.
{117790}{117862}ln a Germany,|without National Socialism...
{117866}{117917}...my children would have no chance.
{117924}{117994}l shall not expose them|to scorn and ridicule.''
{118001}{118055}You see, we didn't know...
{118060}{118118}...we simply couldn't imagine...
{118126}{118211}...what life outside would be like.
{118229}{118289}We had been so isolated|all that time...
{118293}{118411}...so cut off from real life,|from the war and everything else...
{118417}{118485}...and we had absolutely no idea...
{118489}{118551}...what would happen|after National Socialism.
{118556}{118643}Apart from the terrible visions|Hitler had portrayed...
{118651}{118713}...although they weren't at all clear.
{118741}{118804}All the men would be castrated...
{118809}{118932}...Germany would be completely|razed to the ground...
{118936}{119043}...reduced to a primitive state|without any industry...
{119051}{119103}...and all the women would be raped.
{119111}{119184}They were visions from Bosch.
{119204}{119308}l was unable to imagine|how life could continue.
{119393}{119465}So Liesl set off|without the children...
{119484}{119538}...and Hitler said his farewell.
{119552}{119638}l was sitting on the stairs|with the children...
{119643}{119728}...there was a bang,|and Helmut said:
{119732}{119790}''That was a direct hit!''|And l was convinced...
{119795}{119852}...that was the final shot.
{119862}{119952}l stayed where l was,|and after a while...
{119956}{120019}...Otto Günsche came up the stairs...
{120027}{120112}...from the Führer's bunker...
{120116}{120166}...as white as a sheet...
{120190}{120306}...and he said, ''l have just obeyed|the Führer's last order.
{120310}{120352}l have burnt his body.''
{120510}{120634}l didn't go down|to have a look for myself.
{120685}{120765}l went off somewhere|so l could be alone.
{120817}{120928}There's a gap in my memory|at this point.
{121012}{121063}Something was finally over.
{121123}{121218}lt's a black hole in my mind.
{121242}{121312}And the first thing l remember...
{121340}{121417}...is coming back to find the others...
{121421}{121523}...and they were all sitting around|in the big corridor...
{121532}{121578}...drinking and smoking.
{121608}{121678}There was Bormann,|General Burgdorf...
{121687}{121736}...Goebbels was still there...
{121769}{121858}...the adjutants, Linge and Günsche.
{121908}{122016}You know,|l felt such hatred for Hitler...
{122022}{122091}...because he had abandoned us...
{122095}{122156}...a very personal hatred...
{122172}{122236}...because he had simply gone off...
{122240}{122315}...and left us stuck in that trap.
{122319}{122385}Suddenly the other people|hanging around...
{122389}{122510}...were like lifeless puppets when|the person pulling the strings lets go.
{122515}{122566}None of us had lives of our own.
{122605}{122709}We all had poison in our pockets,|but that was all.
{122724}{122848}l really had no idea|what my next step should be.
{122949}{122996}Now l must have a break.
{123176}{123278}After Hitler's death, Frau Junge|managed to escape from his bunker.
{123282}{123376}But her attempt to reach her mother|in southern Germany failed.
{123381}{123446}On June 9, 1945,|she was arrested by the Russians...
{123450}{123508}...and remained their prisoner|until December 1945.
{123562}{123642}Under house arrest, she was allowed|to work in the Charité Hospital.
{123646}{123711}With the help of an Armenian|who had served as interpreter...
{123715}{123767}...during her interrogation|by Russian officers...
{123771}{123840}...she managed to escape|to the Western Sector.
{123845}{123935}ln May 1946 she reached|her home in Bavaria.
{123966}{124021}There she was imprisoned|by the Americans...
{124026}{124095}...for three weeks|in the Starnberg Castle prison.
{124099}{124183}After her release there was|no real interest in her story.
{124187}{124294}ln 1947 Traudl Junge, who had never|been a member of the Nazi Party...
{124298}{124373}...was ''de-nazified''|without any charges against her.
{124378}{124498}As a so-called ''juvenile fellow traveler,''|she was granted juvenile amnesty.
{124530}{124583}ln the early days after the war...
{124587}{124684}...the past wasn't an issue,|strangely enough.
{124693}{124765}lt wasn't a subject to be discussed|in public either.
{124769}{124821}And there weren't any books about it.
{124829}{124903}ln politics there wasn't yet|the process...
{124907}{124954}...of coming to terms with the past.
{124958}{125079}Not even the Nuremberg Trials|started that process...
{125083}{125142}...the way it happened later,|in the '60s.
{125147}{125212}l don't know exactly why, but...
{125219}{125307}...suddenly there were|so many books.
{125311}{125383}And lots of voices were raised.
{125387}{125431}We heard about the SS state...
{125435}{125494}...and then the diary|of Anne Frank...
{125499}{125580}...and there were people|who had survived the whole thing.
{125598}{125649}People who had resisted|also spoke out.
{125663}{125747}The thing that made|a very strong impression on me...
{125755}{125861}...was that after the war...
{125869}{125979}...the world wasn't at all the way Hitler|had portrayed it...
{125983}{126023}...and predicted it would be.
{126031}{126098}Suddenly there was|a spirit of freedom...
{126106}{126157}...and especially the Americans--
{126184}{126248}l didn't get home until a year|after the occupation.
{126253}{126289}But especially the Americans...
{126294}{126374}...turned out to be|very good democrats...
{126381}{126430}...and very helpful people.
{126434}{126507}The care parcels started coming.|l suddenly realized...
{126511}{126560}...that none of it was true.
{126571}{126644}So in the early years|it didn't really occur to me...
{126661}{126737}...to come to terms with my past.
{126742}{126882}Naturally all the horrors that emerged|in the Nuremberg Trials...
{126886}{126933}...about the six million Jews...
{126937}{127037}...and people of other faiths|and beliefs...
{127042}{127194}...who lost their lives--|All that struck me as very shocking.
{127214}{127286}But l wasn't able at first|to see the connection...
{127290}{127335}...with my own past.
{127340}{127409}l still felt somehow content...
{127413}{127535}...that l had no personal guilt|and had known nothing about it.
{127540}{127605}l had no idea of the extent|of what happened.
{127609}{127656}But then one day...
{127668}{127757}...l was walking past the memorial|in Franz Josef Street...
{127771}{127869}...to Sophie Scholl,|a young girl who opposed Hitler...
{127874}{127960}...and l realized that she|was the same age as me...
{127964}{128090}...and that she was executed the|same year l started working for Hitler.
{128111}{128156}At that moment...
{128181}{128235}...l really sensed...
{128239}{128301}...that it is no excuse to be young...
{128306}{128461}...and that it might have been possible|to find out what was going on.
{128645}{128723}After the war Traudl Junge worked as|a secretary at the magazine "Quick"...
{128727}{128803}...as a consultant to director G. W.|Papst on his film "Der letzte Akt"...
{128807}{128885}...about Hitler's final days,|on the staff of a literature magazine...
{128890}{128924}...and as a science journalist.
{128950}{129009}Due to severe depression|she went into early retirement.
{129013}{129095}From then on she spent a large part of|her free time reading to blind people.
{129099}{129162}On the day this film premiered|at the Berlin Film Festival...
{129167}{129191}...on February 10, 2002...
{129196}{129247}...Traudl Junge died of cancer|in a Munich hospital.
{129252}{129306}Shortly before her death,|in a telephone conversation...
{129311}{129367}...with André Heller|and Othmar Schmiderer, she said:
{129372}{129416}''l think l'm starting to forgive myself.''

I was at Agenda 2000 and uh, one of the people who was there[br]was Craig Mundie, who is some kind of[br]high mucky muck at Microsoft,
I think uh, vice-president of consumer products[br]or something like that.
And uh, I hadn't actually met him
I, I, I, uh, bumped in to him in an,[br]in an elevator... in an elevator
And uh, I looked at his badge and said,[br]"Oh, I see you work for Microsoft."
And he looked back to me and said,[br]"Oh, yeah and what do you do?"
And I thought he seemed just a sort of a tad dismissive
I mean,  here's the archetypal, you know,[br]guy in a suit looking at a scruffy hacker
And so I gave him the thousand[br]yard stare and said,
"I'm your worst nightmare."

A[br]J.T.S. Moore[br]FILM
REVOLUTION OS
For most its short, but colorful history, the computer industry has been dominated by the Windows operating system.
But that could soon change, as Windows faces a strong challenge from Linux
Silicon Valley has long been the place to develop new technology, start new companies and get really rich.
Now The Valley is the front line in a revolution fighting for that most[br]politically incorrect of ideas: individual freedom
Day and night,[br]a loose confederation of hackers and programmers zaps bits pieces of computer code around the world as it builds the tools to set computer users free using open information and[br]the free exchange of technology to achieve its goals.
This revolution began in the 1980's with the Free Software Movement and GNU project.
And now is most commonly associated with Linux and the Open Source Movement.
What is Linux?
We do have one sector that taking off today.
It is the Linux-related sector.
And I thought this might be[br]a good opportunity to say,
"What is Linux?"
And I'll answer this question for you.
Many of you probably already know, but[br]There are 12 million users out there
A computer Operating System[br]developed by hundreds of programmers collaborating on the Internet
A challenge to Microsoft Windows NT
Very popular for its speed and so this's what the craze is about
To kind of explain what Linux is you have to explain what an Operating System is
And... the thing about Operating System is[br]you, I mean... you're never ever supposed to see it.
Because... nobody really uses an Operating System, people use... programs... on their computer
And the only mission in life of an operating system is to help[br]those programs run.
So an operating system never does[br]anything on its own
It's only waiting for the programs to ask for certain resources or, or, ask for a certain file on the disk or ask for the programs to connect them to the outside world.
And then the operating system[br]comes, steps in and then tries to make it easy for people[br]to write programs
And, What is Open Source?
Open Source is a way for people to collaborate on software without being encumbered[br]by all of the problems of intellectual property, having to negotiate contracts every time[br]you buy a piece of software, have a lot of lawyers involved.
In general, we just wanna get the software to work and we want be able to have people contribute fixes to that, etc..
So we sort of sacrifice some of the intellectual property rights and just let the whole world[br]use the software
Before there could be Linux
There was Richard Stallman[br]and the Free Software Movement.
They think of Richard Stallman as the... great philosopher, right.
And think of me as the engineer
Richard Stallman is the founding father of[br]the Free Software Movement.
Through his efforts to build the[br]GNU Operating System.
He created the legal, philosophical and[br]technological foundation for the Free Software Movement.
Without these contributions, it's unlikely that Linux and Open Source would have evolved in to their current forms today
I joined the[br]MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1971,
I joined... a thriving community of hackers, people who loved programming, loved exploring the what they could do[br]with computers.
And they had developed[br]a complete Operating System, entirely written there.
And I became one of the team, that continued to improve the Operating System,[br]adding new capabilities
That was my job, and I loved it, we all loved it.[br]That's why we were doing it.
And [clears throat] we called our system
"the Incompatible Time Sharing System" which is an example of the playful spirit which defines a hacker.
Hackers are people who enjoy[br]playful cleverness.
Well, it first started going wrong as the outside world started pressuring us[br]to have passwords.
We didn't have any passwords[br]on our computer.
And the reason was that the hackers who'd originally designed the system realized that passwords were a way[br]the administrators could control all the users.
And they didn't want to build tools you know, locks and keys for[br]the administrators to control them, so they just didn't do it.[br]They left that out
And we had the philosophy[br]that whoever sitting at the computer should be able to do whatever he wants and somebody else who was there yesterday[br]shouldn't be controlling what you do today
When they put passwords onto one of[br]the machines at MIT
I and bunch of other hackers didn't like it,
I decided to try a subversive sort of hack.[br][clears throat]
I figured out how to decode the passwords, so by looking at the database of encoded passwords
I could figure out what each person[br]would actually type to login
And so I sent messages to people, saying,
"Hello? I see that you've[br]chosen the password mumble, whatever it was.[br]How about if you do as I do just type Enter for your password it's much shorter, much easier to type".
And... of course with this message I was implicitly telling them[br]the security was really just a joke.
Anyway, but in addition[br]I was letting them in on this hack.
And eventually, A fifth of all the[br]users on that computer joined me in using just Enter as their passwords.
[ Where did the ideas that lead to what is now[br]called Open Source world?
How did that begin? Who began that? ]
It actually began with the start[br]of computers because at that time software was just passed around between people
And I think it was only like in the[br]lates 70's or early 80's
That people started really closing up[br]their software,
And saying, "No, you can never[br]get a look at the source code.
You can't change the software[br]even if it's necessary for you to fix it, for your own application"
And... um, you can actually blame[br]some of that on Microsoft,
They are one of the real pioneers[br]of the proprietary software model.
In the mid 1970's, a group of hackers and computer hobbyist in Silicon Valley[br]formed the "Homebrew Computer Club".
In the club January 31, 1976 newsletter,
Bill Gates of the recently formed Microsoft, wrote an open letter to the community where he made a point by point argument for[br]the relatively new concept of proprietary software up to that point, the practice of computer users[br]had been to freely pass around software with not much thought given to[br]its ownership
Known as An Open Letter to Hobbyists,[br]Bill Gates writes,
"To me the most critical thing[br]in the hobby market right now is the lack of good software courses,[br]books and software itself.
Without good software and an owner[br]who understands programming,
A hobby computer is wasted.
Will quality software be written[br]for the hobby market?
Gates goes on to write,[br]"The feedback we have gotten from the hundreds of people who say they are[br]using BASIC has all been positive.
Two surprising things are apparent, however.
1) Most of these "users" never[br]bought BASIC, and
2) The amount of royalties we have received[br]from sales to hobbyists makes the time spent on of Altair BASIC[br]worth less than 2 dollars an hour
Why is this?
As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software.
Hardware must be paid for but software[br]is something to share.
Who cares if the people who worked[br]on it get paid?
Is this fair?
One thing you don't do by stealing software is get back at MITS for some problem[br]you may have had
MITS doesn't make money selling software.
One thing you do do is prevent[br]good software from being written.
Who can afford to do professional work for nothing?
What hobbyist can put 3-man years into programming, finding all bugs, documenting his product[br]and distribute it for free?
The fact is, no one besides us has invested a lot of money[br]in hobby software.
What about the guys who resell Altair BASIC?
Aren't they making money on hobby software?
Yes, but those who have been[br]reported to us may lose in the end.
They are the ones who give[br]hobbyists a bad name, and should be kicked out of any[br]club meeting they show up at.
I would appreciate letters from[br]anyone who wants to pay up, or has a suggestion or comment.
Signed Bill Gates, General partner, Micro-Soft.
In the late 70's and early 1980's,[br]Richard Stallman was doing Artificial Intelligence research and coding at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab.
Richard had a number of negative experiences during that period which soured him on the whole idea of commercial software.
[ such as? ] uh... some company wanted to work on and[br]wanted to fix was locked up. and he couldn't get the company that owned[br]on the code to let him fix it even though it would have been to their advantage to do so.
And that put me into a moral dilemma, you see?
Because to get one of the modern computers[br]of the day, which was the early 80's, you would have to get a proprietory[br]operating system.
The developers of those systems[br]didn't share with other people,
Instead they tried to control the users, dominate the users, restrict them.
Say, if to get the system, you have to sign a  promise you won't[br]share with anybody else.
And to me that was essentially a promise[br]to be a bad person, to betray the rest of the world, cut myself off from society[br]from a cooperating community.
And I had already experienced what happened[br]when other people did that to us, when they refused to share with us. because they had signed these contracts.
And it hurt the whole lab, it kept us from doing useful things before.
So I just wasn't going to do that.
I thought,"This is wrong![br]I am not going to live this way"
And from experiences like this[br]he developed a profound hostility to the idea of[br]intellectual property and software.
He eventually acted this out[br]by founding the Free Software Foundation.
So, I looked for another alternative[br]and I realized:
I was an operating system developer.
If I were to develop another operating system.
And then as the author,[br]encourage everyone to share it.
Say, everyone, " You come and get it,[br]use this, form a new community"
Not only could I gave myself a way[br]to keep using computers without betraying other people,[br]but I'd give it to everybody else, too.
Everybody would have a[br]way out of that moral dilemma
And so I realized this was[br]what I had to do with my life.
I actually began the project in January of 1984.
That's when I resigned for my job at MIT to start developing the GNU operating system.
Now I should explain the name GNU is a hack.
Because it's a recursive acronym.
It stands for "GNU's Not Unix".
You see so the "G" in "GNU" stands for "GNU".
And what the name means is
I was developing a system that was like[br]the Unix operating system, but was not the Unix operating system.
This was a different system.
We would have to write it completely[br]from scratch because Unix was proprietory.
We were forbidden to share Unix,
We couldn't use Unix.[br]It was useless for a community.
So we had to write a replacement for it.
Throughout the 1980s, as Richard Stallman was building the GNU project, computer scientists from[br]the University of California at Berkeley were developing their own free[br]operating system.
Known as Berkeley Unix, or BSD, it was based upon the Unix kernel[br]which had been licensed from AT&T.
However, due to legal problems with AT&T[br]and fragmentation of the source code, hackers and other non-institutional users[br]were slow to adopt it
Well, Unix consisted of a large number of[br]separate programs that communicated with each other.
So we just had to replace these programs[br]one by one.
So what I started doing was[br]writing a replacement for one program, and then another, and then another, and then people started joining me, because I published an announcement[br]inviting other people to join me to help write these programs.
And uh... and by around 1991,[br]we had replaced practically all of them.
[ What were some of the programs that you ... ]
Well... we had to... to have a complete system, you need to have a kernel, which is the program that allocates resources to all the other programs, you need a compiler, which translates a program from readable source code[br]that programmers can understand into numbers, mysterious numbers[br]that the computer can actually run. you need other programs[br]that go with the compiler to help do this job. you need a debugger. you need a text editor. you need text formatters. you need mailers... you need lots and lots of things.
There are hundreds of programs[br]in a Unix-like operating system.
I saw Stallman's announcement.
Actually I met him in February of 1987.
He came to give a five-day tutorial[br]on Emacs at our company.
And during the day he would explain new ways to think about Emacs and ways to extend it, enhance it,[br]and to use the Emacs source code uh, for better or worse.
But in the evening,[br]he was busily working on this compiler, and he had not yet released it to the public, so he was uh, being a little bit uh,[br]careful about who, who got to see the source code.
But I was very eager,[br]and when he first announced it in June,
I downloaded it immediately.
I, I played with it.
I got some, some pointers from him.
And when I sent the source code back to him, he was very, uh, actually amazed that how quickly[br]I was able to ramp up on his technology.
Whenever we worked on something[br]at Stanford or in the university,
Whenever we worked on something[br]at Stanford or in the university, we would get, mostly at the time we were working off machines[br]from Digital Equipment or Sun, mostly Sun.
Whenever we would get a Sun machine, the first thing we would do is[br]we would spend literally days downloading GNU free software from the Internet, building it and installing it on that Sun machine.
The crucial thing about GNU is that[br]it's free software.
And Free Software refers not to price,[br]but to freedom.
So think of free speech, not free beer.
The freedoms that I am talking about are the freedoms to make changes if you want to, or hire somebody else to make changes for you if you're using a software for your business, to redistribute copies,[br]to share with other people, and to make improvements and publish them so that other people can[br]get the benefit of them, too.
And those are the freedoms that distinguish[br]free software from non-free software.
These are the freedoms that[br]enable people to form a community.
If you don't have all these freedoms, you're being divided and[br]dominated by somebody.
My first experience contributing to free software came in late 1989, early 1990.
I was working as a graduate student[br]at Stanford University on Computer Aided Design tools.
One of the pieces I needed was a tool called a parser generator.
Well, the Free Software Foundation under Richard Stallman[br]created a great tool called "bison".
I needed a tool that worked with C++.[br]Bison worked with C.
I modified bison to create something[br]called "bison++".
And it's a tremendous feeling of empowerment be able to take a piece of software that was available and create what you needed[br]in a very short piece of time by modifying it.
I put it back on the Internet and I was amazed at the number of people that picked it up and started using it.
In fact, I remember going to, uh job interviews,
I, at various times, considered[br]just going out getting a job.
And I'd gone to a job interview.
And I was talking to one of the people, and I started asking them about what tools they used, and they said, "Gee, we used bison++!" and I said, "Oh, I am the author of bison++!"
Free Software generally does have a copyright.
It does have an owner.
And it has a license.
It is not public domain.
If we put the software in the public domain, somebody else would be able to make[br]a little bit of changes and turn that into a proprietory software package, which means that[br]the users would be running our software, but they wouldn't have freedom to cooperate and share.
To prevent that, we use a technique called "Copyleft".
The idea of Copyleft is that[br]it's "Copyright" flipped over.
And what we do is, we say, this software is copyrighted and we, the authors give you permission[br]to redistribute copies, we give you permission to change, we give you permission to add to it.
But when you redistribute it, it has to be under these terms,[br]no more and no less.
So that whoever gets it from you also gets the freedom to cooperate[br]with other people, if he wants to.
And then, in this way everywhere the software goes, the freedom goes, too.
And it becomes an inalienable right to cooperate with other people and form a community.
[ And so, what is that? the license?[br]what was that... ]
Well, Copyleft being a general idea, in order to use it, you have to have specific example.
The specific example we use for[br]most GNU software packages is the GNU General Public License, a particular document in legalese[br]which accomplishes this job.
A lot of other people use that same license,[br]for example,
Linus Torvalds uses that license for Linux as well.
Well, the license I use is the[br]GNU General Public License.
That's the one Richard Stallman wrote.
And I think it is really astounding contribution.
Uh, it's one of the few software licenses[br]that was written from the standpoint of the community rather than from the standpoint of um, protecting a company or um, as is the case with MIT and BSD license performing the goals of[br]a government grant program.
Uh, and the GPL is really unique in that.
It's not just a license.[br]It's a whole philosophy that,
I think, motivated the open source definition.
I don't hide that a lot of what I do came from Stallman.
A crucial step in the growth of GNU/Linux[br]and the Free Software movement was the creation of businesses[br]based upon the software and philosophy.
Grown zero for the beginning of[br]the business phase was the Electronics Research Lab[br]at Stanford University.
Known as ERL, the lab was the place for the first GNU and Linux business founder inspiration.
So right here was where ERL was.
That would have been the entrance[br]over there next to the uh, electrical engineering McCullough building.
As you walk in, you come in,[br]you walk down the hallway, down here.
My office would have been about, about here. and then right across the hall,[br]from that was Michael Tiemann's office.
Michael Tiemann took uh.. and[br]started a company, Cygnus Software with the idea was to sell consulting[br]and services around the GNU Free Software and, well Michael's done very well with Cygnus.
Well uh, I spend a lot of[br]time working out uh, how we were going to make money and in the original GNU manifesto which is the last chapter[br]of the GNU Emacs manual.
Stallman proposed a number of different possible ways to make money.
From the beginning of the[br]Free Software movement
I had the idea that there's room in it for business to be done.
One of the advantages of Free Software is that, there's a free market for any kind of service or support.
So if you are using software in your business, and you want good support, you have a choice of people to go to for it, you have a choice of businesses... that are in the business of[br]providing you with support.
So they are going to have to in general give you good support or you go to somebody else.
With proprietory software, support is a monopoly, there is one company, typically, that has the source code and only they can give you support so typically, you are at the mercy of a monopoly.
That's the case, for example with Microsoft.
So no wonder the support is so bad.
The benefits of Free Software were tremendous but the cost of supporting it internally uh, and made managers very very nervous and so the fundamental idea I had was[br]if we can build a model that could deliver two to four times the support and uh, and uh, and hand holding capability that an internal engineer could provide.
And we could do it at 1/2 to 1/4 of the cost that would meet the test of whether or not people would actually buy.
And by about the Fall of that year, we had all the things worked out about who needed on the technical team, what the terms the sale would be, what the key price point were, and we actually received our incorporation in Nov of 1989.
One of the most difficult things in starting our company was actually finding a name for it.
I explained this to one of my friends
"we're having difficulty" and he returned an e-mail message that basically just had a bunch of words[br]with the name "GNU" in it.
And "Cygnus" was the one that[br]looked least obnoxious and least obscene.
I can say very clearly that Cygnus was the first business that specialized in Free Software.
Cygnus supported Free Software, filled a very essential niche because[br]we had this great software, you could get it for nothing but[br]you couldn't get support - they made their money by charging for support.
The GNU project started by building a toolkit, uh, basic development tools such as[br]a C compiler, a debugger, a text-editor, and uh, other necessary apparatus.
And their intention was eventually to[br]develop a kernel to sit underneath those and be the center of the operating system.
By about 1990 they had successfully[br]developed that toolkit, and it was in wide use on great many variants of Unix.
But there was still no free kernel.
The kernel happened to be[br]one of the last things we started to do and we had started it not long before.
And that's when Linus Torvalds came along.
"Lin-us" or "Line-us"? What's the exact,[br]do you prefer the pronunciation? um.. When I speak Swedish it's "Lee-nus"; when I speak Finnish it's "Leen-ous"; when I speak English it's "Line-us".
And I really don't care how people pronounce my name.
But "Linux" is always "Linux".
He developed a kernel, and got it working[br]faster than we got ours working, and got it to work very nicely and solidly.
His kernel is called "Linux".
The initial goal was my very personal goal to be able to run a similar environment on my computer that I had grown used to at, at the university computers.
And I could not find anything that suited me for that.
So having been doing computers for all my life basically.
At that point I decided that I'll do my own.
Most of the inspiration early on came from, from SunOS which was what um,[br]I was using at the university at the time.
[ Which University? ]
University of Helsinki in Finland.
From 1991 to about 1993 was really
I guess the infancy period of Linux.
That was when it was still only alpha or beta quality; it was relatively unstable.
Although, even then it was a good deal more stable than a lot of what are now called[br]"production" operating systems.
Linus used the traditional[br]tried-and-true method of writing one program that does the job, and he got it to work. quickly in fact faster than[br]I would have thought was possible.
The term for it is "monolithic", which means that basically[br]the OS itself is one entity, indivisible. uh, while in the microkernel, the, the operating system kernel is actually uh, just a collection of servers that do different things and then they have a common protocol for doing communication between themselves.
[ So why is that... the GNU project that's had[br]so much lead-time, that's been doing this,
Why...Why is it that he was able to kinda[br]come in at the tail end so to speak ]
Well we actually started the[br]GNU Hurd not long before he started Linux.
And it happened though we chose a design[br]that's a very advanced design in terms of the power gives you but also turns out to be very hard to debug.
We decided to divide up the kernel[br]which traditionally had been one program, to divide it up into a lot of smaller programs that would send messages to[br]each other asynchronously to, to communicate.
The problem is that, that style of programming has a great deal of potential for bugs, which are often very hard to[br]figure out because they depend on... does this program send this message[br]before or after this one sends that message...
And the result was:[br]it took us years to get the thing to work.
[ What is Linux's relationship to the GNU project? ]
Well there's relationships to GNU[br]on kind of multiple levels.
One is just the philosophical level of thinking that
"making your source open is a good idea".
When Linus developed the kernel[br]he wasn't doing it for the GNU project.
He did it independently.
And he released it independently[br]and we didn't know about it.
But some of the people who did know about it decided to look for what else they could find to put together with that kernel to[br]make a whole system.
They looked around, and lo and behold[br]everything they needed was already available.
They looked around, and lo and behold[br]everything they needed was already available.
"What good fortune!" they thought.
But actually there was no chance about it.
They had found all the pieces of the[br]GNU system which was missing just the kernel, so when they put all that together really they were fitting[br]Linux into the gap in the GNU system.
But they didn't know that.
There's a lot of these programs um, done by the Free Softwares Foundation, and done by other people like Linux.
And there's a symbiosis between[br]Linux and the programs that the programs run on Linux and at the same time and they take the advantage of Linux as a platform, while Linux takes the advantage of the programs by just being able to use them.
[ What...What programs? ] umm...
The main one is actually the GNU C Compiler.
Which... Without a C compiler[br]it would not have been possible to make Linux or most of the open progress available.
Linux uses the GPL, and I agree with a kind of philosophy behind the GPL.
That said the GPL itself is not a very pretty document which is probably just because[br]no lawyerese can ever be very pretty.
I'd been playing around with Linux for actually late '92 or early '93 for about a year. before I decided that it was to the point[br]where actually had everything that I needed to really replace a Sun Workstation.
And I was looking for a way to[br]have a Unix workstation at home at the time we used Sun Sparc Stations[br]in the office at Stanford.
Those machines cost us about 7,000 dollars.
Now I desperately wanted a Unix machine at home!
There's always a this thought[br]you get as a graduate student
"Gee... if I could work at home!
Then I would be so much more productive,
I would graduate sooner because[br]I would finish my thesis sooner"
Well, Well, is it true? Well, you can judge.
You know most people end up spending a lot of their time becoming more productive so that they ever actually worked on their thesis[br]they'd finish it in a day.
It takes a while sometimes.
So I decided that I wanted a Unix machine at home.
And I went out there I was able to[br]use Linux together with the PC.
For about 2,000 dollars, I put together a system.
That was one and a half to two times faster than that 7,000 dollars Sun Sparc Station.
It was absolutely amazing.
I had one and a half to two times the speed, at a third to fourth the price.
Light bulbs went off.
I knew there was an opportunity here.
This was the chance to really do something[br]better than what Sun has done around Open Source and Linux.
I called it Linux originally as working name.
And that was just because "Linus" and the "X" has to be there.
It's Unix. It's like a law.
And...what happened was that...
I initially thought that I can't call it Linux publicly, because it is just too egotistical.
And that was before I had a big ego. Right?
They thought they were taking a whole bunch[br]of components putting them around Linux
So they ended up calling the whole thing[br]"A Linux System" and somehow that term caught on.
And the result is there are now ten million people using this variant of the GNU system... the GNU/Linux operating system.
And most of them don't know it.
[ Some people advocate it be described as GNU/Linux.
I mean what's your thought on[br]that? I would say, justify or... ]
Well, I think it's justified but it is justified[br]if you actually make GNU distribution of Linux.
The same way that I think that Red Hat Linux[br]is fine or SuSE Linux, or Debian Linux.
Uh, because if you actually make your[br]own distribution of Linux
You get to name the thing.
But calling Linux in general "GNU Linux"[br]I think, is just ridiculous.
I got involved in Fall '93.
Because I was sent a copy of the first CD-ROM[br]commercial Linux distribution, which was called Yggdrasi produced by Adam Richter.
And I got a copy because...
I had been myself writing Free Software for[br]a long time since the early 80's.
I was actually one of the[br]early GNU contributors myself.
And I was absolutely astonished,
I was completely astonished.
Because I've been a software engineer[br]for nearly 15 years at that point.
And according to all the rules I knew... about controlling complexity,[br]keeping a project group small, having closely managed objectives.
Linux should have been a disaster, and it wasn't.
Instead, it was something wonderful, and I was determined to figure out[br]how they were getting a way with that.
In order for Linux to grow beyond[br]the world of the computer programmer
It needed a use, an application[br]that made it a must-have technology
That threshold was crossed with the development of a program[br]that made complex websites possible
That program is the Apache web server.
The killer app of Linux was undoubtedly[br]the Apache web server.
If you look at the history of Linux, the adoption curve of Linux and[br]the adoption curve of the Internet exactly track each other.
1993, which was when the Apache[br]web server project really got started, was also the beginnings of the popular ISP explosion when the Internet first became a mass market commodity and the idea of web-based electronic commerce and, and mass communication became real.
I think it was one of the first applications[br]that caused people to go
"Well, if I install Linux."
I get some tangible benefit from doing so, right?
I mean, clearly there were a lot of[br]interesting applications on Linux at, at the time, this being maybe[br]two or three years ago, when the root thing really started to take off but there wasn't a driving, you know, you could almost say business case for someone to use Linux versus using NT until, I think, Apache and[br]a lot of the things that plugged into Apache enhanced Apache
I mean, when you want to go out and build..[br]go out to build a server farm
It was much more cost effective cost effective real dollar returns to build it on Linux and Apache[br]than was to build it on IIS and NT even if it meant that you have to[br]spend a little bit of money to train your staff to learn how to use that or to find people who were knowledgeable.
But the good news was that that knowledge wasn't very expensive because there were all those college students out there who'd been using Linux for a long time[br]and were very familiar with it.
If you look at the trend curves in web servers
Apache has steadily been gaining[br]a market share ever since it's up to something like 66% now
It's steadily clobbered[br]all of the closed source competition
And that's because it's more reliable[br]it's more flexible, it's more extensible
It does what webmasters actually need and the combination of Apache and Linux found its way into a great many commercial shops.
Essentially, Apache became the application[br]that motivated Internet service providers and e-commerce companies to choose Linux[br]over Microsoft's Windows.
It would probably runs best on Linux and on FreeBSD and the reason is the[br]communities around those operating systems are also the communities that[br]contribute the most back to Apache, right?
And there were also the operating systems[br]that Internet service providers started using very heavily as well and Internet service providers really liked Apache because it allowed them to do a lot of different things[br]that some of the commercial web servers didn't such as the ability to host more than[br]one web site on a single box, which clearly if you are an ISP and you would have 40,000 users and they all want their web site, is gonna be pretty important to you. one of the key factors in the growth of Linux was the creation of companies that[br]specialized in the distribution and support of the Operating System itself
Among these companies,[br]Red Hat Software is the best known.
Red Hat started as a product of Marc Ewing while he was working at IBM.
He wanted a little better Linux distribution he started playing around, found out he uh, he spent more time[br]maintaining his Linux distribution than he did uh,[br]than he did working on his new project.
So he uh, sort of started the distribution himself
He met up with Bob Young, who at the time was running company called[br]ACC Bookstore which was a mail-order PC Unix uh, catalog
And Bob kind of knew he wanted something, you know, more his own to market, rather than reselling other people's products
And he was fairly good at marketing, and...
Mark knew he needed some marketing help because he was very good at the technical parts,[br]so they kinda got together
I started working with Red Hat in May of 1995,[br]basically right out of NC State. along with Eric Troan who, me and him[br]combined make up employees #4 and #5.
We actually reported to work in an apartment[br]that Mark Ewing used to live in
We took it over as kind of[br]the development part of Red Hat software and stayed that way till about November of 1995 when... a toilet we had in the apartment kind of exploded, flooded our downstairs neighbor and she got little upset and... the apartment folks found out[br]we were running a business there instead of actually living there the same time
So they decided to throw us out.
So at that point, we had about a week to go find our first office, which we did and get ourselves moved in a hurry
We started going in again '95 or so[br]to the venture capital firms, asking, saying, there's something happening here.
There's a great business opportunity, to build the next Sun for open source.
Well, the venture capitalists looked at this and said
"Gee, you are selling systems the software is free. This is kind of scary.
We're not sure that we want to put money in. And... by the way, we funded other systems companies and it hasn't really panned out. We are scared."
I came to the US about 3 years ago, and the reason really was that I'd been spending like 6 or 7 years at Helsinki University. and decide it was time to see the real world[br]and not just university life.
Especially this area had a lot of the most[br]interesting work being done.
So I just decided that... let's try to move half way across the world, and give this a try.
And it's turned out pretty well.
[ Ah...you see this as temporary or long term? ]
Well, we saw it as temporary at first.
And I think it's certainly looking like[br]it's turning into long term.
Our youngest daughter is[br]both US and Finnish citizen, because she was born here and the older one is speaking[br]both Swedish and English, so...
The next major event was one that[br]I had directed hand in.
I wrote a paper, called[br]"The Cathedral & the Bazaar". which was my observations,[br]my anthropological analysis of what it was that made[br]the open source world work.
We didn't call it that then. We were still[br]using the term "Free Software" primarily.
So it was my observation of[br]what made the Free Software world work and why we were able to[br]produce extremely high quality software in spite of constantly violating all of[br]the standard rules of software engineering
In that paper, I was setting up a contrast between two different styles of development, two opposed styles of development.
One, which is the[br]conventional closed development style, which I called the "Cathedral" style.
In that one, you have[br]tight specification of objectives.
Small project groups which are run[br]in a fairly hierarchical authoritarian manner.
And you have long release intervals
On the other hand,what I identified[br]is happening in the Linux world was a much more peer to peer decentralized,[br]market or bazaar-like style, which has a very short release intervals and constant solicitation of feedback from people[br]who are formally outside of the project.
A very intense peer review process.
And the startling thing was that the more I looked at this, the more it seemed that trading away[br]all the supposed advantages of conventional closed development, for that one single advantage[br]of massive independent peer review actually seemed to win,[br]actually seemed to get you good results.
The reason Netscape is important is that they were the first large company[br]to participate in open source.
We had Cygnus providing support, but we didn't really have much business.
And Netscape went open source essentially[br]as a way to fight Microsoft, which was giving away Internet Explorer, but not letting anyone else have the source code,[br]not letting companies collaborate.
Working as part of the sales force, I got a bit of,
I got a good idea of.. of why people bought our software and what it took to make our software successful[br]in the marketplace against competitive products.
However, the problem was, we were seeing, as that, as time went on, our software was uh, being competed against by other[br]people's software, particularly Microsoft's and as time went on, the price of our software had to drop because other people were giving their software away at no charge or at little charge.
Now the real problem was that they feared
Microsoft would achieve a monopoly lock on the browser market and they would then use that monopoly lock to pervert actually, the HTTP and HTML standards that the web depends on.
And once they had turned those[br]standards in to lock in devices, they could then use that control[br]to drive Netscape out of the server market, which was where it was making its real money.
My concern was that as time went on,
Netscape's business would be threatened, by the fact that we didn't have enough people[br]to do what we needed to do as a company in order to keep our software viable in the marketplace.
The Netscape release happened in early 1998.
And uh, I was told later, I had no idea at the time, that it came about as a direct result of the right people having read[br]"The Cathedral and the Bazaar".
"The Cathedral and the Bazaar",[br]the paper by Eric Raymond, was a significant influence on[br]Netscape's decision to release source code.
It came as a complete shock to me.
I wasn't really ready for the thought that I was changing the world even by accident.
However he was not by any means[br]the only influence on that decision.
Uh, and not necessarily the most important one, when all is said and done.
As I said, Netscape,
Netscape had already been talking about[br]releasing source code for quite some time before anyone ever heard of Eric's paper.
Linux Congress in early 1997, which was the first place that I gave that paper.
And one of the people who heard it was[br]Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly and Associates.
And uh, he thought it was pretty intriguing and he asked me to give it at[br]his first PERL conference, which was uh.. later that year, in Fall of 97.
And apparently what happened, I was told later, although I had no idea that this was happening at the time, uh is that some people from Netscape actually[br]heard the paper at the PERL conference and took those ideas back to Netscape and[br]they kind of lit a fire there.
The role of my paper was essentially[br]to make the internal case at Netscape, uh to make the business case for[br]why Netscape should release its source code.
The paper was called[br]"Netscape Source Code As Netscape Product". uh.. a strange title,[br]essentially what the title meant was that
In my opinion we needed to think of source code not just as something[br]that was used in creating our products, but as something that was a product in its own right.
Something that customers might use, other people might use.
I then looked at what the business models might be if we released source code for our products.
How would we license them?
How do we sell products in this environment?
Then I looked at the competition, particularly Microsoft.
What would they be likely to do[br]if we released source code?
Was there some way they could[br]use our source code against us?
I used Eric's paper as an example of[br]how distributed development could work, how a company could develop software not[br]just using their own people, but also working with people on the Internet.
And that's why I included a reference to[br]Eric's paper in my paper.
Once my paper was circulated, the people who read my paper would naturally enough find a reference to Eric's paper[br]and read that as well.
[ And who was involved in[br]making that happen at Netscape? ]
Primarily the person who made the[br]actual decision was Jim Barksdale.
And this turned out to be important later.
That our big win, the big score that gave us mainstream[br]visibility and credibility with investors came not because of bottom up evangelism[br]from a bunch of engineers, but because one strategist at the top saw the potential power of this method and then essentially imposed that vision[br]on everyone underneath him.
When I completed the paper,[br]I first gave a copy to Mark Andreessen, who was co-founder of Netscape and[br]was at the time one of, on the senior management team at Netscape.
Mark then gave a copy of the paper to several[br]other people within Netscape management, including Jim Barksdale.
I'm not sure exactly when Jim and[br]the other senior managers made the actual decision,
I believe it was in early January sometime.
Netscape actually announced that it was gonna[br]release the source code on Jan 22nd, the same time it was going to give[br]Communicator away for free.
When Netscape decided to release the source code, people sort of got a wake up notice and said
"Hey, maybe there is something to this idea[br]of releasing source code and doing development with people[br]outside your company."
So Netscape's decision brought a lot of[br]public attention to the idea of Free Software, what became known as Open Source, and brought a lot of attention to[br]the Linux operating system, which was one of the most prominent examples of[br]Open Source software at that time.
This is our first office, Mountain View, California.
We moved here in early 1995.
This is 4,000 square feet.
It was an incredible leap of faith for us to[br]move out and take the company to our own office.
Now what's really important about this place is that this is the office[br]where the term "Open Source" was invented.
If you walk in to an executive's office[br]and say "Free Software",
OK, If you're lucky, the response[br]you'll get is something like,
"hmm, hmm, Free Software, must be[br]cheap, shoddy, worthless."
Uh, and if you're not lucky,[br]it has associations with, uh. with the Free Software Foundation's[br]wholesale attack on intellectual property rights, which regardless of what[br]you think about the ethics of that, it's lousy marketing, it's not something[br]that businesses want to hear.
So Eric Raymond knew there was a problem.
We'd been calling this Free Software, but people took the term "Free"[br]and associated with "Free of charge", they thought they couldn't make money or couldn't sell, which is exactly the wrong concept.
We wanted to get across the idea the software[br]was open and that the source code was available.
Very important pieces.
We had this meeting at the VA offices[br]in Mountain View, where Eric, myself, and Christine Peterson from Foresight Institute[br]joined us as well as some other people.
Christine Peterson was there by phone. uh..
Jon "Mad dog" Hall was also there by phone. uh..
And then Todd Anderson, who later worked for[br]SuSE for a while was there.
Sam Ockman who now runs Penguin Computing was there.
He was uh.. He was an employee of VA at the time
Well, we came up with the concept of Open Source, we called Linus in fact and asked Linus if he liked it.
He was interested, He liked it.
Eventually we came up with something that replaced "Free Software".
That was the beginning of Open Source.
[ How did you chose words "Open Source"? ]
You know, I think Christine Peterson was[br]the person who really came up with the idea.
Uh, we wanted, again, the idea[br]that the source code was out there and it was open.
There weren't many choices.
Well, since the fist three recipients have[br]spoken for the Open Source movement,
I think I should speak about[br]the Free Software movement.
The Open Source movement,[br]focuses on practical advantages that you can get by having a community of users who can cooperate on interchanging and improving software.
I agree completely with the points they make about that.
The reason why my views are different,[br]while I am in the Free Software movement rather than the Open Source movement, is that I believe there's something[br]more important at stake.
That freedom to cooperate with other people,[br]freedom to have a community... is important for our quality of life.
It's important for having a good society[br]that we can live in.
And that that is in my view, even more important[br]than having powerful and reliable software.
But I think some of the people in[br]the Free Software camp... are a little scared by the commercialization.
And uh, you know,[br]of course a rebel is put off by success. uh.. I think that commercialization is very important.
We want to mainstream this software, and I work with Richard Stallman[br]who's the gray haired man of Free Software, uh, on a regular basis, and I don't feel
I have any philosophical differences. me as author the Open Source definition and he is originator of free software as an organized thing, except for one thing.[br]Richard thinks that all software should be free, and I think that free software and[br]non-free software should coexist.
That's the only difference we have.
Uh, we decided early on that what we needed, a..a definition, we needed a kind of[br]meta-license to define the term "Open Source". a, a definition, we needed a kind of[br]meta-license to define the term "Open Source".
And what we came up with is a document called[br]"The Open Source Definition".
It's derived from the Debian Free Software guidelines[br]that were originally written by Bruce Parens.
I'd written the original draft of that, uh, discussed it for a month with the Debian developers
Debian is a Linux distribution
And made it their project policy
And Eric and I decided to relabel what we'd written for Debian as The Open Source definition and to say Open Source is a software that gives you a list of nine rights which is in the Open Source definition.
The first right is Free Redistribution
This doesn't mean Free as in no price
It means liberty
Um, you have to be free to redistribute your software to someone else
And actually no price is a side effect
You can charge for that redistribution or not
It has to come with source code
So that someone can maintain a program.
If they go from a PC to a Mac for example they can change the software.
Derived Works have to be possible
If someone has to improve your program um, they should be able to distribute the result uh, There is a provision about integrity of the author's source code which says that the author can sort of[br]maintain their honor and if you make a change you might have to change the name of the program or mark out your change very clearly so that your change doesn't reflect on the author
There is no discrimination against people or groups.
Uh, the example I usually use is
You can't stop an abortion clinic or an anti-abortion activist from using the software
There is no discrimination against fields of endeavor
And that means the software has to be usable in a business as well as in a school
The license has to be distributable
In other words
I have to be able to give that license to someone and that license then should work if that someone gives it to yet a third person
The license can't be specific to a product in other words if I distribute my software on a Red Hat system the license can't say you can't distribute this on a SuSE or Debian system
The license can't contaminate other software
So if I distribute this on a CD with another program
It can't say that other program must be free otherwise you can't distribute my software
And then the only other part of the Open Source definition is a list of licenses that were accepted
And the ones that we started with were the GPL which was actually the example for a lot of what's in the Open Source definition in the BSD license because software for BSD system pre-existed Linux
I think the next moment that I thought[br]was really pivotal was when the database vendors flipped over which happened about three months sooner than I expected to and actually happened in late July early August commitments to do one ports from Oracle and and Sybase and the other key database vendors.
[ And why was that critical? ] because we knew that in order for the open source story to be credible and especially in order for the Linux story[br]to be credible, we'd have to get commitments from[br]independent software vendors to do ports of their applications to these platforms and I was actually kind of worried
I thought that we were in a window of vulnerability between the time that we announced[br]the open source campaign and the database vendors flipped over that was the point at which hostile action by Microsoft or other close-source software companies that was the point in which a serious marketing blitz might have sunk us but once the big database vendors flipped over that opened the way for other ISVs that started the snow ball effect going
Every six months or so
I would come back to the venture capitalists
I would show them the new numbers showing more and more people adopting Linux and new people porting, new users and I'd show them our customer list
And our customer list was getting much more impressive
It was people like Cisco that were beginning to appear people like, you know, those dot-com companies were started to show up on our customer list and eventually the venture capitalists you know, they kept looking at it they kept saying "Oh, we can't quite do it"
Finally, Linus appeared on the cover of Fortune
There was something happening with Open Source
Well, at that point, the venture capitalists[br]couldn't ignore it they just got sick of hearing about Linux everywhere and they got tired of me, just, you know showing it to them every,[br]at that point it was almost every week
So they uh, they decided it was time to invest, that there was something happening
I announced Open Source to the world on the Internet
I did a lot of the early... administrative work of starting the Open Source Initiative and I think six months later
I was reading the words Open Source in the news all the time and was totally astounded
And a year later, I believe
Microsoft was talking about releasing some source code
And someone in the press asked Steve Ballmer if they were going to open source their code and Steve Ballmer said,
"Well, Open Source means more than[br]just releasing the source code"
And I realized that he had read my document and understood it and was now telling[br]the press about this
Now if you are like just a guy on the net who's not doing this for a job at all and you sort of write a manifesto and it spreads out through the world and a year later the vice president of Microsoft is talking about that
You'd think you were on drugs, wouldn't you?
But that's what really happened
The Local Users Groups[br]tend to be more than an issue of building a social network especially getting people familiarized with the issues also just acting as a kind of supporting network for people who, who do not, for example,[br]have the ability to pay for commercial support network
So one thing they're doing in this area for example, is they're making these.
I think it's once a month
They're having install fests, which means that people who have problems getting Linux[br]installed on their machines or have some issue, I mean maybe they've installed Linux but want to set up the network in a specific way can actually bring in their machines to this users group meeting
And there's a lot of people there willing to help who may have seen the same problem before.
Well, actually things aren't so well.
I tried it earlier myself. I had problems.
And so I came to this install fest where all the gurus abound.
Hopefully I'll have better luck getting it in.
Instead of having, uh, sending e-mails, or writing to news groups on the Internet and waiting several days for the answers sometimes it's easy to come here and find other people who might know about your problem and may be able to help you
And hopefully within a few hours you have your machine installed
Originally I wanted to it install on[br]uh, my larger laptop and so I just did a search on the net and found where there were resources to get help
And um, I'm here today cause I'm trying to put Linux on[br]this little guy right here. just a Toshiba Libretto
It's not a easiest thing in the world to do because it's a weird piece of hardware, so...
Any chairs around here?
I think that Department of Justice case has made people aware of the fact that you should at least look for alternatives to Microsoft. and maybe Microsoft isn't the American dream after all and that kind of shifting perception you can very clearly see that people just took Microsoft for granted and maybe they're still buying Microsoft but at least they're kind of more aware of the issue these days
Microsoft actually uses Linux as defense
They used Linux to ground a claim that they don't have a monopoly because Linux could essentially push them off their catbird seat at any time.
It was a very ingenious argument,[br]totally specious because it didn't do anything to answer the charge that they had previously engaged in bullying and various anti-competitive practices. but it was clever of them
And, in an event, the judge didn't buy it
While ordinarily we in the Linux community are[br]rather worried about letting Microsoft become the issue, but there was a Slashdot article[br]about December of '98 where a fellow named Matt at the noodle[br]had pointed out that... the, a gentleman in Australia has managed[br]to receive a refund for the unused copy of Windows that[br]came with his computer.
So he declared the 19th of January, was it January? err, no, It was February. It was February.[br]Oh, I'm sorry, the 19th of February... he declared 19th of February[br]Windows Refund Day. and he encouraged everyone to go to[br]the computer manufacturers, and return their unused copies of Windows... as it was specified in the[br]Windows End-User License Agreement.
It's important to remember that[br]in the License itself, it says that you can receive a refund if you don't use the software, and that the manufacture is bound by law to do this... or it was bond by contract. and we found if you called up[br]these manufactures, they basically said...
"Stop bothering me kid." and hung up on you.
We didn't really wanna sort of giving out our location, or where we were going to meet, until... you know, the very last seconds.
What we did is, we have people meet[br]at the place where we could control in the different towns around here.
So I was the San Jose marshal, and I believe Nick you were...
I was..., Rick Moen and I did San Francisco.
Right and so we had maps there and we[br]handed them off everybody who was coming.
Well, we actually met at a Denny's[br]That's just outside the Foster City limits...
Foster City city limits, which meant also just outside of[br]Foster City Police jurisdiction, which meant any, any incidents[br]that happened at the meeting point happened in the jurisdiction of San Mateo, and if they told us they get lost, we'd say,[br]"Fine, we are going to Foster city. Bye."
It's sort of the Dukes of Hazzard method of[br]avoiding the cops, so...
Well actually, originally we marched[br]on the other side of this building.
We marched around and up onto the parking[br]structure that's up there, and that's where Microsoft had a reception[br]laid out for us with drinks[br]and a big sign that said...
"Microsoft Welcomes the Open Source Community". and the local news cameras got shots of[br]Eric Raymond and Microsoft representative.
Microsoft's story seems to mostly be that...
...this was not an issue for Microsoft,[br]rather from the OEMs.
So we all needed to go back to our[br]computer manufacturers and try yet again to try and get refund from them.
We responded to them saying, you know, that we tried that and it's not possible,[br]we need Microsoft to take action at this point.
And they just repeated the tag line[br]over and over again...
"you need to go to the OEMs and manufacturers[br]and get your refunds there."
We had about 150 people,[br]probably half of which had signs and such, so..
Well, we ended up actually right[br]in this courtyard here.
Basically we originally met, gathered outside, various people sent groups in,[br]people from FreeBSD camp sent a couple of folks in.
We had Eric Raymond and Chris[br]actually tried to go up eventually.
They had blocked the elevator off to us.
[ Where are the offices? ]
The offices are right up here on the 9th floor.
We got some really nice press out of it. and we think as a result
Toshiba made it possible for you to buy[br]laptop without the operating system on it.
So, it's a small victory, but...
Well, even now, companies such as IBM and... a lot of other computer manufacturers[br]are allowing you... now to buy machines that don't have[br]Windows on them.
When I was a kid and I went to school, the teachers were trying to teach us to share.
They said if you bring some candy, you can't eat it all yourself, you[br]gotta share with other kids.
But now the administration says teachers[br]should be teaching kids to say yes to licensing.
If you bring some software to school,[br]"Oh! No, don't share it...
...sharing means you're pirate,[br]sharing means you'll be put in jail."
That's not the way society should work.[br]We need the good will, the willingness to help other people[br]at least when it's not too hard, because that's the basis of society, that's the fundamental resource,
That gives us a society instead of[br]a dog-eat-dog jungle.
[ So what about people say if that if you have rampant piracy and eliminate[br]the profit motive and...
...and creative works, software.[br]Will not... ]
Well, they were on both counts. For one thing, people are making a profit from[br]developing Free Software, but for another, the freedom to[br]have a community is more important.
[ People that look at, casually look at[br]Open Source Free Software and think...
Well, because you are supposed to[br]share and do it for people's good will,
Doesn't that seem someone communist.[br]What's your response? ]
Absolutely nonsense,[br]it makes me really angry when people do that.
Well, back in, back in 1989,[br]actually communism would have been a compliment. the word people were using at that time[br]was "crazy", and I want them to use capitalism.
Communism is an ideology that forces people to share.
If you don't share, you get thrown in jail or killed.
In 1990, we got a visit from a director[br]of an institute in uh, Moscow University, and actually I saw him in Helsinki just 2 weeks ago, but in any event, he came by, and Richard Stallman had suggested[br]that he visit Cygnus, because he was interested in and[br]understanding how the Free Software model... might apply to stimulating entrepreneurial[br]innovation in Russia of all places, and we had been kind of secretive[br]about our business plan, because you know, we were'nt really[br]sure it's gonna work, we didn't want to look too stupid if it failed.
But I was very very open with him.
The more I told him,[br]the more he started to shake his head like this, and I finally said, you know, "What's wrong?"
And he said, "This sounds to much like communism[br]to be successful in Russia."
You got to go a Gulag and end up in a mass grave[br]with a bullet in the back of your head.
Open Source is not communism[br]because it does'nt force people.
Carl Marx did not invent helping your neighbor.
It's not communist to have a commons,
A commons existed long before communism as[br]a philosophy of government. there are many commons in our lives,
For example, we drive on the highway, something that is maintained for our common good.
Actually labeling our business model... means that it misses the point a little bit. whether it's communist, or whether it's capitalist, the label doesn't matter, the real question is, how much value can you deliver,[br]how scalable is the business, what kind of problems,[br]what kind of of rate of innovation can you sustain. and then, however you want to label that,[br]it's really up to you.
The Revolution goes Prime Time.
A lot of people described, that August LinuxWorld as[br]"Linux's coming-out party",
Linus Torvalds was very funny about this,[br]he said, "What? Was Linux gay?"
But some people said[br]"Yeah, that was our debutante ball."
That was when the...
Linux Gods, and the hardware hackers[br]really got it together with the suits.
At 3pm on August 10th 1999,
Linus Torvalds delivered the keynote[br]address at LinuxWorld.
The crowds of 6000 people began lining up at 12 noon.
Ladies and gentlemen,[br]please welcome Larry Augustin...
LinuxWorld Conference Chair and President and[br]CEO of VA Linux Systems.
These guys have to clap, I pay them.
Thank you all for being here,[br]looks like it's been a great show so far.
If you'll indulge me for a moment, I'm going to[br]try to avoid the glare of the lights.
I still think there's lots of people,[br]even though this is the 2nd show,
I still think there's lots of people[br]who don't quite get...
...what it is that's so exciting about Linux.
So there is a great show going[br]on next door, there's huge exhibits and everything, but it's the people out here[br]that are real contributors, not those companies.
The person on next I know you all know, so I don't have to give anything in the way[br]as introduction.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you, Linus Torvalds.
Linus
Thanks.
Calm down.
Calm down.
Say "oooo". yes.
I don't want to just give one[br]of my normal talks, because I find them boring, probably by now most of you find them boring[br]too because you've heard them like 10 times.
But after the technical updates,[br]we will actually try...
...whether we can do a question and[br]answer session with 5,000 people, or how many of you there are there. and it may not actually work out, because one of the 5,000 people is really loud.
The one thing I will do, which I always do in all my talks is[br]the gratitude thing,
I want to kind of acknowledge the fact that...
...I'm obviously not been alone in doing Linux.
RHAT IPO: On August 11, 1999
Red Hat Software became[br]the first Linux company to go public.
Red Hat, up 228% this is the IPO that everybody was waiting for.
They of course are behind[br]the Linux operating software.
R-H-A-T, I know
All I've gotten today, are comments about[br]what the stock price is, all morning, you know it was[br]at 41, it was at 42, it was at 47, it was at 53, it was at 51...
Every machine as far as I can tell[br]on the show floor is pointed to their e-trade accounts or their[br]broker accounts, they know the Red Hat's price
I can't believe this.[br]47
I just heard 53.
Oh, boy.
Hang on, I didn't buy it.
You didn't buy?
No, no, I didn't buy.
I should've bought, but uh...
No no, that's great.
If it's... if it's....
You guys don't know?
Well, you know
Red Hat being successful as just means that
It legitimizes Linux[br]So it's much easier for us to go out
Rob Malda (CmdrTaco) ...[br]on the Red Hat IPO
It's kind of been a little bit divided.
You've got a lot of people that are pretty hardcore and
And they're kind of offended by that you know, cause they work really hard,[br]they are not really getting... maybe they fair share out of that.
Some people do get ticked. and you know the thing that you see that on a lot of mailing lists[br]or on Slashdot you'll read, you know
This guy is really mad because he didn't[br]get chance to, he's didn't get a chance to do... to get stock from Red Hat
He didn't get a chance to get...[br]to get a job from this other company, you know.
But the, the kind of the shocking secret[br]there is that,
Most the really hardcore guys,[br]you know, they don't care so much.
The guys that are kind of really down in trenches.
They're writing this code because[br]they need this code.
If we could invite Richard Stallman who's the founder of[br]the Free Software Association and Tim Ney, who's the managing director.
There we go.  Hahahahaha
Ah, here it is.
Now, Richard, I saw you playing your recorder[br]at, in Paris at that Linux conference
But I didn't have audio tracks.
So would you them to add audio to their, uh...
Video downstream next time
Uh..I don't have any control over that unfortunately those things can[br]only be done with non-free software.
We'll give you the award, and before you say a word, we'll have a Tim and yourself hold up[br]a little representation of the contribution towards the Free Software Association.
So, very ironic things have happened, but nothing to match this
Giving the Linus Tovarlds award[br]to the Free Software Foundation is sort of like giving the[br]Han Solo award to the rebel fleet.
You see, some of you may not realize how far[br]that analogy goes.
But actually let me tell you[br]how this, how we got here. see what happened is,
15 years ago, if you wanted to use a computer, the only way you could do it[br]was to, was with proprietary software, software that divides and subjugates the users.
And most people just...
A lot of people didn't like it.
But they saw no alternative.
But some of us were determined[br]to make an alternative.
And we said we're gonna develop[br]a free operating system, a free software operating system that will give users the chance to have freedom[br]while they use their computers.
Now a lot of people said, "Well, it's a nice idea but it's so hard, you'll never get it done, so I don't wanna participate,[br]I don't believe you can ever get it done."
But luckily not everybody said that.
And clearly, we knew[br]we would eventually get the kernel done.
But as it happens. somebody else did a better kernel before we did.
Now in the old days, we had an overall strategy from calling people's attention[br]to the importance of freedom
To the freedom they can have, or not have,[br]when they use a computer.
Well what can we do about it?[br]As far as I can tell, the only workable way of trying to[br]change this make that strategy work again is to, spread the word that the operating system[br]you're using is actually the GNU system.
Somewhat modified of course.
And when people know this, they'll take a look at the reasons[br]we developed this system.
They'll think about these issues.
And some of them will decide they agree.
So I ask people,[br]please tell the people this is the GNU system.
It's the combination of GNU and Linux[br]so we can call it GNU/Linux
[ So Larry, when you were at Stanford[br]8, 9 years ago during your Ph.D did you ever think you'd be in this position? ]
No
[ All kidding aside. ]
No I had no idea honestly
[ What did you think you would be[br]when you were finished up with your Ph.D? ]
You know that's a good question,
I really didn't have a good idea, I mean.
Here we are, on this huge show floor.
There are people just going crazy about Linux.
We had 6,200 people crammed into a room to see the Linux, Linus speak last night.
Here we are, with, you know, all of these huge venders all over the show.
I..It's, just, you have no idea that[br]this is gonna happen.
I mean this is just this little operating system[br]that we're happy with. that a few people cared about, you know,
I thought I'd have a nice little[br]consulting business.
And here I am suddenly, with all of this huge show going on.
It's just incredible.
I mean, a year ago, you could look and say,[br]you know, this is gonna be big and everyone standing at the show going
"You know the show was big last year, is it gonna, is it gonna be as big as this year?"
The you remind them
"You know, last year was only 6 month ago."
And then they go "Oh, , Linux time".
So leading up to the IPO, uh... we had arrived actually in San Diego[br]on Tuesday night
We spent Wednesday morning meeting investors[br]in San Diego.
We flew up to San Francisco spent Wednesday afternoon meeting[br]investment firms in San Francisco
VA Linux Selected[br]December 9, 1999, as the day[br]for its stock to begin trading. then on the Thursday morning of the IPO is when our stock would be traded publically.
So it was nice we had ended[br]the tour in San Francisco because we could go to the credit suite's[br]trading desk the next morning to watch the public offering.
And in San Francisco being close[br]enough to the company, and to our families, we could invite people up to[br]actually join us in the first trade.
So I invited my wife and we invited Linus and Tove, and a number of other friends and people[br]who worked in the company in to join us.
Whenever we invite Linus and Tove, they have uh, two young children, and I have a daughter, Andrea.
And we always bring the kids along so we went in to the credit suite's trading floor with all these traders and there are these 3 year old kids running around and chasing each other[br]around the show floor, around the trading floor.
So Linus and I walked in and[br]we walked up in to the trading floor and everyone was very excited.
And we kept asking them, well[br]"Hows it going? Are things going ok?".
And they said, "Oh, it's.. uh, we're really excited,
I think things are going well.
We don't wanna, We don't wanna say,[br]We don't wanna jinx anything."
We walked in and it was a big screen TV showing CNBC.
And it was amazing to us,[br]but the theme for the day was Linux.
Now we have an IPO that's gonna go today.
And when I mean go, it is going to go.
The estimates I'm hearing are staggering.
But watch VA Linux Systems. It goes at 12:40 today.
The symbol is L-N-U-X.
A provider of large scale computer[br]servers and workstations, specially designed for the Linux operating system.
The original range on this IPO was[br]11 to 13 dollars, then 21 to 23, then 28 to 30.
Priced at 30, and the estimates I'm hearing[br]I don't wanna repeat because I don't have a confirmation.
But if they're true, they will blow you're mind[br]when this stock takes off at 12:40.
I turned to Linus and I said "Gee, did you ever think, you know, you'd walk in here some day and[br]Linux would be THE theme on CNBC?". and Linus said in his joking way said "Oh Absolutely!".
So we walk in and they show us[br]the buy and sell orders coming in.. and it's incredible.
We're seeing numbers like[br]320 dollars, 340 dollars a share.
And I'm just in complete shock.
You know, this is over 10 times[br]where we priced the offering. It was incredible.
And I remember Linus just kind of,[br]sort of patting me on the back and saying, you know "Relax..." and it was[br]pretty exciting to see that.
We were, it was just amazing. We were stunned.
We were lucky that we were able to[br]get back to the offices, we'd been in San Francisco[br]so we could come back to VA's offices to, to see everyone in the office for the IPO.
When we got back, we had uh,[br]everyone was obviously very excited.
The IPO had done just tremendously well.
We had a little party that we put together.
It was interesting, while we were celebrating there were plenty of people that were still trying to work.
I recall cries of "Be quiet!",[br]"We're on the phone!", "We're Working!",
Uh, as we uh, as we went in to the offices.
One of the things I did was[br]I gave the road show presentation for the employees back at the office, so they could have an idea of[br]what we'd been telling investors, and understand exactly what we'd uh,[br]put together for them.
But again the story of the day is VA Linux,[br]now up 766% to 235 dollars to 265.
Sue, the best performing IPO ever.
Here it goes, Sycamore Networks was uh,[br]priced at 38 dollars, surged to $270.
This has just beat it. And by the way..
[ How do you feel about potentially billions[br]of dollars of wealth being created from your creation,[br]that you're not directly cashing out? ]
So, if I hadn't made Linux available, I mean,
I wouldn't have gotten any money that way either.
So I mean, It's a win-win situation.
Uh, just the fact that there are[br]a lot of commercial companies means that there are a lot of Linux people[br]who used to work on Linux kind of on the side.
And now they get paid for[br]doing what they wanted to do.
And that helps me in the sense that[br]I wanted them to work on Linux anyway.
The whole GNU project is really one big hack.
It's one big act of subversive playful cleverness, to change society for the better, because[br]I'm only interested in changing it for the better, but in a clever way.
Hi, we're the GNU/Stallmans, and this is[br]"The Free Software Song"
Join us now and share the software;
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
Hoarders may get piles of money,
That is true, hackers, that is true.
But they cannot help their neighbors;
That's ain't good, hackers, that's ain't good.
When we have enough free software
At our call, hackers, at our call,
We'll throw out those dirty licenses
Ever more, hackers, ever more.
Join us now and share the software;
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
Join us now and share the software;
You'll be free, hackers, you'll be free.
Oh, you'll be free
I let you know.
That you'll be free. [ repeat ]
I let you know
That you'll be free. [ repeat ]
That you'll be free. [ repeat ]

"What sport do you play?"
I'm just like, "I do spring break.
I play spring break, " you know?
They're like,
"What are you training for?"
I'm in the gym like riding the bike five times a day, you know?
- What are you training for?
- Spring break.
I don't have to be
"Mr. Personality."
I don't have to go up to girls and like buy drinks, you know?
'Cause girls go on spring break to find guys like me.
So what about this whole nudity thing?
I heard you hate seeing each other naked.
- Yes, we hate it. She's gross.
- It's gross.
- Hold hands for me right now.
- No!
- Did you share a room last night?
- Yeah. Separate beds.
We've done that before.
We have sleepovers. Sleepovers!
My parents love me.
It's never like,
"You should get together with Heidi," but it's always like,
"Who's this girl?
Where's Heidi?
Bring Heidi back.
Where did she go?"
How's your modeling career going?
Good actually. I did a fashion show for Joan Collins.
I did some stuff with "JAG"-- it's a clothing store in Singapore.
- Do a pose.
- I guess just-- all right.
Don't laugh.
I'm from Brandon,
Wisconsin,
I'm 20, and I don't go to school.
All right, and what do you currently do?
- I'm a waitress.
- You're a waitress?
Yeah. I need to get out of Brandon.
What is your reputation in your hometown?
In one word-- if I would say one word, "naughty."
How do you feel when you're around people that are drunk?
A lot of times
I feel kind of left out, because, you know-- because I don't drink.
You don't drink at all?
You don't have a beer or anything?
I've never drank alcohol.
Most times if I'm in a party, and you know, I kind of feel that left out feeling,
I'll go and get like a glass of milk.
The guys that are willing to like... do whatever it is and treat me like their queen and shit, those are the ones
I'm pretty much like,
"Eh." Like, "You're a great guy, but for someone else."
The ones I usually fall for are ones that have to challenge me and that I have to sit in the bed at night questioning,
Iike, "Where are they really?
Are they really at home?"
I'm only 20-- 21 years old.
I'm not ready to be married.
I've been married for the past, like, year-- is what it feels like.
And I don't--
I don't want that.
I just kinda wish we would break up so I could go and be single.
She has an ex-boyfriend.
I always find it a challenge,
'cause the ex-boyfriend always has the upper hand against the new guy.
- Right.
- "Let's see if I can weasel in."
Okay, I want to let y'all know that everybody wants to be a star.
He wants to be a star.
I wants to be a star.
Whoever else is here, they want to be a star.
But there's only going to be two stars-- me and Paul.
- That's cool.
- Stars.
- Remember the face.
- Remember the face.
- Remember the name.
- Remember the name.
Paul, Jorell.
Cancun, baby!
Who's coming with me?
 This song is dedicated 
To everybody out there that's a virgin 
 God bless you 
 I feel like it's my first time 
I feel like it's my first time 
 You know what I'm saying?
Go like this 
 Now this is what
I'm talking about 
I'm stuck inside but I'm letting it out 
I'm struggling just to keep my poise 
Then I don't stop screaming till I lose my voice 
Keep on doing what I feel the most 
One last hit and then I'm ghost 
It's not my fault, it's how it has to be 
That's how I'm keeping my chastity 
 lfl had it all
I would give it away 
No idea how I'm living today 
Line by line, show by show 
I got these ladies toe to toe 
A couple ofdrinks and I'm ready to go 
Ask me again and I'll still say no 
Don't be hating on me, baby 
Give me that sweet stuff all night long 
I feel like it's my first time 
 Feels so good 
I feel like it's my first time. 
I'm a virgin, but I'm on the verge... 
- Now it's shot time.
- I'm a member.
Hell, yeah.
- What's your name?
- I'm Casey.
- I'm Amber. What's up?
- Amber, nice to meet you.
Y'all have boyfriends?
Do you have a girlfriend?
- Boyfriend.
- You have a boyfriend?
I came with a girlfriend, but it's a rocky situation, trust me.
Okay, my situation is weird.
Like, he's just like,
"Go and have fun."
- So it's a booty call?
- He said that?
- Yeah.
- Oh shit.
- That's exact opposite for me.
- "Go have fun," as in, "Have fun," or as in like,
"Screw whoever you want to"?
I won't screw whoever I want to.
Like, I won't, like, screw everybody-- but-- not everyone.
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I'm ain't happy,
I'm feeling glad 
I got sunshine in a bag 
I'm useless, but not for long 
The future is coming on 
 I ain't happy,
I'm feeling glad 
I got sunshine in a bag 
I'm useless, but not for long 
The future is coming on 
It's coming on, it's coming on... 
Think I should just tune up my guitar before I go out?
- Heidi?
- Can I see your room?
- Yeah, come in.
- This is crazy.
- I got to tune this business up.
- Right.
Oh my God!
How can you be sitting?
I can't even sit.
I have to walk around.
Oh my God, you have a kitchen?

I know, that isn't mine.
But it's some nice shit though,
I'll tell you that much.
- Get out that boy's shit, man!
- "Okay, Daddy. Okay, Daddy."
You'd be as hot as a mug if somebody rummaged through your shit

- "Whose is it? Whose is it?
Whose is it, huh?
Say it, say it."

That's not even a waterfall.
Oh, look.
And I'm like, "Hey, hey!
Get up on that ass!
We can go outside!
It don't make no difference.
You gonna take it like I give it."
Hey, give me some water, dawg.
And I'm not talking about this kind.

Exactly. Take a lime.

Too many shots!
How are you going to segregate yourselves from us and get drunk?
- You guys did it.
- I'm sorry.
That's not okay.
Can I have a shot with you guys?
- Yeah, you're more than welcome.
- I know.
- You're not drinking anymore?
- We're going to the beach.
- Let's go.
- I'm not getting in the water.
You are the sexiest woman
I've ever seen.
- Yeah, you really are.
- Truly, you are the sexiest, truly.
Thank you. I try, you know.
I'm the "token black girl."
You are a tool.
I know, I'm the biggest dork ever.

We're your tour guides while you're here in beautiful Cancun, Mexico.
My name is Jay, this is Chris.
We'd like to officially welcome you.
This is your paradise for the next week.

You know, take this all in.
Live the dream.
Anybody want to get naked with me?
- Are you talking to your boyfriend?
- I am.
Are you?
Tell him I said, "Whassup?"
- That's Casey, right?
- That's me, dude.
Y'all want to get naked or what?
God, I got to take a shower before I go out, you know?
Somebody give me a gun so I can shoot myself.
I don't think that's a good idea, but--
Oh, my God!
That's Brittany?
You look different from earlier, dude.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- I'm going to jump in with you.
- All right.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hey, you want to get in the shower with me?
You know what?
I took a shower.
- Look at my hair-- it's all wet.
- Damn.
So none of you girls want to make out or anything?
- You don't want to make out?
- That is so romantic.
- Why not?
- My God. You're a fucking nut.
- So nice.
- I just want to see some boobies.
No, these are my clothes, Casey.
- Get up, you're all wet!
- He's-- he--
- You've had too much to drink.
- Casey!
So you'rejust going to go to the clubs all week and not drink anything?
I don't know.
Not anything?
Not even a fucking shot?
Don't you ever feel like sacking up and taking a fucking shot, you know?
- Not really.
- It's like a manly thing, you know?
You just take a shot.
I don't know.
I've gone so long without doing it.
You should just do it and say, "Fuck it."
See-- I don't know.
It's not that big of a deal to me.
So what's your goal for this week?
To come here and--
- I feel like I don't have to drink.
- Like ever?
- Ever.
- Wow.
- I'm like-- "no pressure."
- Yeah.
- Whatever happens, happens.
- Yeah, exactly.
Where's the music?
You know, dude,
Alan, dude-- we are gonna--
- Alan is so--
- I told him straight up.
Hey, here's the story on Alan, dude.
I'm not going to make him drink, but he's going to drink.
- Oh, dude, he will.
- No, he won't.
- I don't think he will.
- You don't think he will?
- No, I don't think he will.
- Seven days in Cancun...
I'm going to find Alan some girl, and he's going to drink.
Wait, he hasn't drunk since he been here?
- He hasn't drank ever!
- In his whole life!
- In his entire life!
- In his lifetime, dude.
He said, "One time someone slipped me a little Malibu."
Me and Jaz are like,
"Why are you here?"
Hey, let's put money on it.
I bet I give him his first shot.
- Oh!
- Oh!
 Dirty dog 
 Oh, I'm,
I'm a dirty dog 
Oh, l, l, I'm a dirty dog 
 Dirty dog 
 Oh, I'm,
I'm a dirty dog 
 Dirty dog 
-  I'm an outlaw 
-  I'm an outlaw 
-  Quick on the draw 
-  Quick on the draw 
Something you've never seen before 
 Never seen 
And I dare a -- to come in my face 
-  I've got something chrome 
-  I've got something chrome 
-  And I got it from home 
-  And I got it from home 
-  And it ain't a microphone 
-  It ain't a mic 
And I dare a -- to come in my face 
 It's so real 
 It's how I feel 
It's this society that makes the -- want to kill 
 I'mjust straight ill 
Riding my motorcycle down the streets 
 While politicians 
ls sounding like strippers to me 
They saying but I don't want to hear it 
"Ooh, baby, you want me? 
Ooh, baby, you want me? 
Ooh, baby, you want me? 
Well, you can get this lap dance here for free 
Ooh, baby, you want me? 
Ooh, baby, you want me? 
Ooh, baby, you want me? 
Well, you can get this lap dance here for free 
You can get this lap dance here for free 
Well you can get this lap dance here for free. " 
Aw, shit, naw.
 Sí, senor... 
Don't get me wrong, you guys are great.
It's just really early.
That's good stuff.
I wonder who all hooked up with who last night?
'Cause I lost track of a bunch of people.
- Me too. Where do you live?
- You be like, wasted--
In Wisconsin.
Wisconsin, wow.
- You gonna be like--
- A town of like, 800 people.
No stoplights, nothing.
- You never been to a club before?
- Not really, no.
- Wow.
- How was it?
- It was good. It was hot.
- Yeah.
Usually it's not that hot.
- That was your first time?
- Mmm-hmm.
- You never been to a club, right?
- No.
You're going to be deprived going back home.
All right, all right.
All right.
Yay, welcome to the game.
- Come on, Vegas.
- What you know about Vegas?
I don't know too much about Vegas.
It's like, I've gone a couple of times, but--
- You've been to Vegas a few times?
- Yeah.
But that was only when I was a little child.
Well, you know to holler at your girl.
'Cause I got... all the hook-ups in that city.
Yeah, 'cause... yeah.
- What?
- That'll work.
It'd be good to see you again, too.
How's it going to be good to see me again and you're still seeing me?
Well, you know.
You miss me already, huh?
Yeah, yeah,
I miss you already.
- Move up!
- Yeah, what up, Casey?!
I don't know.
It's kind of weird, because... me and her, we've been best friends for a couple years now... and it never evolved into anything.
But, like, ljust kept thinking that ifit did, it would be something serious, you know? That can't happen with her going to California and me staying in Boston.
What is she going to California for? School?
She's going to UC Santa Cruz.
What are you going to do?
Right. I mean, we'll still hang out, but it couldn't be like, anything serious, you know, relationship-wise because ljust-- you can't do that 3000 miles.
So I think-- I think it's for the best.
- You know, we're just friends.
- Right.
I think both of us are, like, really happy just being friends.
Don't you ever just want to get it on, though?
I don't know.
You're like, "Fuck yeah, but she won't get under me."
- Yeah.
- No, no, it's not like that.
That's how
I fucking tried.
We need some positive vibes 
 For these rainy days 
 Let the sunlight in 
 Brighten up your day 
Let the vibes blow like the ocean breeze 
Mama always told me there'd be days like these 
Keep your head right, just do as you please 
Don't ever interfere with an evil man's schemes 
Keep your heart pure, conceive your own dreams 
Respect your fellow man, the earth and the trees... 
If I actually have a girl come on to me, or say something like--
Iike last night at the club, a girl came up, she was like,
"Hey," and she was pretty hot.
She was like, "Hey, me and your friend were just thinking you were the most gorgeous guy in this club." I was like, "Okay."
- Thanks!
- "I'll be over here."
That's my biggest thing.
I can't talk to girls.
Don't feel bad, I've never been able-- I want to so bad.
- You're so cool about it, like...
- Yeah, yeah!
I'm trying to read those little subtle hints
- to figure out ifthey like me...
- You and me both!
I do that for 30 minutes.
Then finally I'm like, "Okay. "
Then maybe I might try something.
-Yeah.
- But until then, I'm just like--
Girls might like me, but if they don't show it or say it
I won't pursue it.
For the simple fact that I don't want to get turned down.
Do you get turned down a lot? Or at all?
- Yeah.
- You lying ass!
He never gets turned down.
You know why?
He always starts as "friends."
He never approaches them as like, "Let's hook up."
It's always, "Can I call you?"
Then he works it from there.
- Damn.
- You got to show them comfort.
"I'm just here to talk to you," you know?
"Come to me.
Talk to me."
You come off all strong and shit, they're gonna, like, "Whoa, back up.
Be easy."
You know? "Whoa."
Give her the "Joey" from "Blossom"--
- "Whoa!"
- "Whoa!" Be easy.
I just want to see some boobies.
Ifyou guys came to Cancun to have a good time,
Iet me hear you say,
"Fuck, yeah."
Fuck, yeah!
All right, we're going to start this wet T-shirt competition, so we're gonna need some hot ladies up here.

I don't have to pee though.
Maybe... borrow, and then...
Pour pee on it?
I have to pour pee on my-- my own pee on my leg?

Go pee in something.
Go take a pee in something.
I cannot believe

There's a deal, though.
The way I get paid is like, that I stay in school.
You don't work?

I work my ass off.
Truth is coming out, huh?
Let me guess--
Mom and Dad pay rent, too.
- Yup.
- Oh, you're fucking spoiled!
- I'm not spoiled.
- Bullshit.
I'm a little spoiled.
If I said, "Dad, pay my car payment, pay my rent," he'd be like, "I love you, but not that much.
You're 21 years old.
Pay your own shit."
Hey, man.
You don't pay credit card bills then either, I take it?
No. Till then I'm rocking the "A's" and everything else.
That's some bullshit.
You're so fucking spoiled.
I made sure college was paid.
My dad didn't-- I got a scholarship.
- Worked my ass off for it.
- I'm not school-oriented.
I'm just not into school.
Like, I'm into other things.
- Like what?
- Shop.
Oh my God.
You said, "shop"?
Yeah, dude.
I give all my stuffto my mom.
- You're a-- one of those.
- "Pretty boy"?
You're a pretty boy. "Can I say that without pissing him off?"
- A "mama's boy"?
- You are such a mama's boy.
- Oh-hh.
- I love my mom.
That's her name, that's the hotel number that she's staying at, that's the hotel--
Oasis Hotel.
She wrote all that on my hand.
- Meredith.
- Yeah, you need to call her back.
She wouldn't have went through that for no reason. Seriously.
- Hello? Meredith?
- Hmm?
No, hold on.
Hello?
Is there a Meredith there?
- Yeah, we're striking out.
- You got it.
We're one yard from the touchdown, and we're pulling a "Tennessee Titans."
The one number I got, I called, and she hung up on me.
We're pulling a "Sacramento Kings"-- what did you say?
The one number I got, I called, and she hung up on me.
- "Alan?"
- I'm serious.
You don't admit that shit.
Youjust like let it go.
It's like, "Yeah, this is Alan.
Hello? Hello? Hello?"
They're like, "cha-chick. "

- Can we go swim with dolphins?
- We have a date.
We have a date.
I found my date.
I found my date.
I just got asked.
- Who's your date?
- Matt.
I had to ask my date.
That's kind of sad.
- That's sexy.
- Roxanne, rephrase that.
I like when girls do that.
Here's to the good life, or so they say 
All those parties and games that all those people play 
They tell me this is the place to be 
 All these beautiful people 
 And nothing to see... 
Maybe it doesn't breathe.
Look, it is alive. Motherfucker,
I'm like, "It's dead."
 Something is wrong here,
I don't belong here 
Sometimes I feel like a stranger in town 
And I've lost what I've found 
 It'll all turn around 
 ln a little while
I'll be thinking about you 
 ln a little while
I'll still be here without you 
You never gave me a reason to doubt you... 
Go, go.
Go fast.
There's another one, look! Ah!
Baby, I'll be thinking about you... 
Go fast, go fast!
Whoa, hey! Oh no, whoa, whoa, you're going--
God damn, shit!
Yo, my horse is fucked up or something.
I caught you a couple times looking at me, and I'll be like, in some secluded corner.
- I know, I'm like--
- But you've seem to caught me.
Don't even try.
You be watching me.
- And I know you be watching me.
- I know, I'll be like...
- Suit yourself.
- No, no, I'm gonna be honest.
I'll catch you. I'll catch you.
I'll try to, you know...
It's all good. Nothing wrong with observing. I'm very observant.
Yeah.
You be watching me?
If you're in my view.
I hate the games.
Like, when they tell you,
"If you want a girl to like you, then just blow her off."
You know, 'cause girls--
"People like what they can't have."
That's bullshit, you know?
If I like a girl,
I'm not going to blow her off.
If I like a girl I'd want to spend more time with her, but I'm not saying it would be all about the physical aspect of it, but I just hate everything you have to go through.
I wish people were a lot simpler than they are, you know?
Wish you didn't have to be a psychiatrist to get a girlfriend.
Is it true that guys like head better than sex?
Sex is like kind of guaranteed always.
Getting head is not a guarantee, you know what I'm saying?
There's no good way to ask--
Iike, "You want some head?"
"Since you're down in the vicinity...
- I was wondering if maybe...
- "You want to 'bob my knob'?"
...by chance you can swallow--?"
I can't bring myself to do it.
- Why not?
- I can't.
Honestly, like, my face can't even be in the vicinity.
I'll be play fighting with my boys and I'll be like,
"My face! My face!
Pick me up, God damn it!"
And Paul's, like, really trying hard with Sky.
Oh, really?
Yeah, but Sky likes fucking Jeremy.
- Sky likes Jeremy?
- Sky likes Jeremy.
Why, do you take your girlfriend out a lot?
Yup.
She'd probably rather go out more than I take her out, but...
- She's gonna be mad at you.
- Oh yeah, like you don't even know.
I think you're gonna be single after this.
I'm positive.
Are you gonna tell her anything?
I haven't-- I'm trying not to think about it, seriously.
I'd rather just be here.
It's like, my fucking vacation.
We're both so out of it.
They're really sensitive on their beaks, so when they-- when you touch 'em, they like it.
It's like scratching someone's back.
Look, it's "Ace Ventura,
Pet Detective. "
Kisses.
He tried to hook you on the lip.
Dude, the bird gets more action than I do.
I'm so picky when it comes to guys.
I figured this'd be a challenge.
Am I the only one that hears 
The tears run down my face? 
Would anybody recognize at all? 
 'Cause I know 
 I'm so slow 
 But I'm trying 
And I'm still dying to know 
Say you won't leave for the rest ofmy... 
I can't have you leave for the rest ofmy... 
Say you won't leave for the rest ofmy life. 
Do you have a crush on anyone?
I'm not vibing with anyone, really.
Do you want to get a piece of ass while you're here, though?
Well, I've never had casual sex and I never will, ever.
Not meaning sex.
You don't have to have sex.
- Make out with someone?
- Yeah, like just play.
Yeah, for sure, but I don't like anyone like that,
'cause I don't-- I know.
Who do you have it with?
Jaz?
Jaz?
Yeah. But he's so nice and cute and everything, but if I could dress him the way I want to dress him, then he'd be even cuter.
I feel like everybody seems to have their little clique or something.
You and me both, dude.
I hang out with Sky and Paul but...
- everybody's starting to pair up.
- Yeah, exactly.
I'm not worried.
It's not like I'm jealous.
It's just like, you walk around and you don't want to just interrupt two people that are chilling and doing their thing.
You don't want to just join the conversation.
It's like, "You're annoying, motherfucker, get away from me."
This is what kind ofkicks it together, as far as female-male.
You got Paul and Sky.
- You got Sarah and Matt.
- Yeah.
You got Laura and Jeremy.
I keep feeling like--
Iike I'm holding myself back.
Don't worry about not being paired up, dude.
I so wish I could just completely fuck everything and do whatever I want and not seem like a jackass.
Truly, what I really want right now, is I want a girl to have a crush on me.
I don't want to have to try.
I want a girl to come up to me.
- I feel you, 100%. Who doesn't?
- I know.
It's okay to want that, but don't get mad 'cause it's not happening.
- I know.
- You feel me?
- Yeah.
- No girl has a crush on me.
- I'm not sweating it. Like, "Okay. "
- Yeah.
Don't worry about it, dude.
Seriously, don't let it get to you.
Honest to God, do y'all think there's any virgins here?
- I'm a virgin.
- I'm a virgin.
- Are you really?
- Are you a virgin?
- Oh my God.
- I called it! I called it!
Shut the fuck up!
- I called it!
- No fucking way!
What the hell are you guys talking about?
High five, Dave.
I admire the virgins.
- Dave, are you a virgin?
- Yep.
- You're a virgin?
- I called that shit!
- By choice, by choice.
- Are you a virgin? You're not.
- Only with one, though.
- Only with one guy?
So we have virgin, virgin, slut--
Why haven't you two guys hooked up?
Yeah, you guys should have sex.
- Honest to God, why aren't you?
- You guys would be money!
You've always been friends?
That's it?
Could it ever be anything more?
I mean, honestly, could it ever be anything more?
You guys are shy.
You can't even look at each other.
- You are shy with each other.
- We're never shy.
- We're not shy.
- We're not shy about each other.
Me and Heidi, no.
If anything, me and Heidi-- there's nothing you can do to embarrass me and Heidi.
- All right, let's see you kiss.
- Oh my God.
Stop it.
You're so stupid.
- I am not.
- Someone's horny, yup.
- This is how you love it.
- It only takes two days.
Speaking of that, I heard you took a shower with the twins.
I took a shower with one of them.
- There was no fucking hot water.
- I heard twins.
No, no.
It was just one.
- Who, Nicole?
- Yeah.
I hear she can't stop talking about your dick.
- She's lying.
- That's what Nicole said.
Well, I'm the only person that hasn't heard.
Maybe you should ask her.
Nicole said you have the biggest dick she's ever seen.
See, it's not long, but it's got width.
So, you know, it's kind of thick.
I don't want to know about your dick.
- It's thick, I got that motion--
- Ugh, shut up!
I got that "motion in the ocean," you know what I'm saying?
What kind of dicks you like?
You like them short?
- What the fuck?
- What?
What kind of questions are you asking me?
So if a short-dick dude came at you-- you found out he had a short dick, would you still go ahead and get active with him?
Come on, now.
Tongue-tied? Come on.
Well, if you have a little dick, my favorite position is with another motherfucker.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.
Ow, just hit my knee.
- Thanks.
- Good.
You can't even do it.
This is underwater.
Yeah, you like spit in my face when I hit my knee.
I saw you sliding out the bar 
I saw you slipping out the back door, baby 
Don't even try to find a line this time 
It's fine, darling you're still divine 
 You don't love me at all 
But don't think that it bothers me at all 
You're a bad-hearted boy trap, baby doll 
 But you're so damn hard 
 Yeah, you're so damn hard. 
Oh God.
Whenever I write my own songs
I'm very protective ofit.
Some people are like,
"Let's put a drum solo in it,"
I'm like, "No. It needs to be this way. Waah. "
Let's do a body shot!
All right, suck that up.
Suck it up.
No, no, no, no.
He officially did that wrong.
- How'd I do it wrong?
- Lime in her mouth.
Lime in her mouth?
My bad.
- Hey, you're the expert, man.
- I'm sorry.
All right, go, go.
Suck it up. Suck it up.
Take the lime out of her mouth.
Yeah!
That was awesome.
- That was manly right there.
- That was my first body shot.
- Really?
- Yeah.
So you wouldn't have a shot with me?
- Huh?
- No?
- I don't know.
- What about--
You wouldn't just have one?
Alan, Alan, Alan...
You're doing it.
- I'll do one.
- Yeah, Alan!
- Oh shit! Oh shit!
- Here we go.
Take your lime, get a little juice on your hand.
- Sky, you're losing the bet, baby.
- Y'all ready?
To Alan. To Alan, the man of the hour.
Cheers.
Lick. Lick.
Shoot.
Yeah, baby.
I'm proud of you.
- Water?
- Fantastic.
- Oh my God.
- You know what I deserve?
- Some boobies.
- Some what?
Boobies?
I want some titties!
Lick her.
Lick her right there.
Lick her right there.
Watch out.
- Where?
- Right here.
- Like right there.
- Okay.
Just lick.
Just lick.
I'm the good kid.
- Don't worry about it.
- There's no salt.
You got to lick it first.
- Put a little salt right there.
- This'll look good.
- You don't mind, do you?
- So?
All right.
Now stick that lime in her mouth.
Stick that lime in her mouth.
There you go.
- It's all you now.
- Everybody do shots together.
Here, hand me that shot over there.
- I'm still the good kid, right?
- Yes you are, of course.
You are here to be corrupted, young 'un.
- All right, everybody, salud.
- Salud.
- So I lick that, drink this.
- Yeah, you lick that.
- Lick, drink, bite.
- Okay.
- On three.
- This is the Texas way, right here.
One, two, three.
Wow! Get it.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Son of a bitch!
 Raise your hand 
 Raise your hand... 
Hello?
- Hey, Mom. Hi.
- Oh my gosh. Hi.
Last night we went clubbing and that was so much fun.
- We go clubbing every night.
- You do every night?
Last night there was one with a hot tub in it and we all got in the hot tub and got totallyjust soaking wet in all ofour clothes.
I mean, my gosh.
The things you're doing.
- Who would need any alcohol?
- It's just crazy.
Take your stand.
Hold to who you are.
It's really important to keep it right to the end.
I'm the only one, so it's difficult.
Good ifyou're the only one.
You can represent another choice.
- Represent.
- Your call will be disconnected.
I have to go, okay?
Hello?
Yeah, yeah.
He pushed me in.
No, no, no. I'm already wet.
 Mr. Boombastic 
What you want is some boombastic, romantic, fantastic lover

Soft and cuddly hug me up like a quilt 
I'm a lyrical lover, no take me for no filth 
With my sexual physique you know me well built 
Oh me, oh my, well, well, can't you tell? 
I'mjust like a turtle crawling out ofme shell 
Girl, you captivate my body-- 
What happened?
Got a sensual kiss in the pool over there.
And shejust bailed out on you?
She bailed out on me.
What the fuck?
Girl can't give it up, nigga!
Sarah, Amber and Matt yesterday were sitting around trying to figure out who was gonna hook up with who in the house.
- Yeah?
- Sarah was like, "I think, Jeremy."
So what do you think?
That's for me to know and you to find out.
I guess, huh?
You are hard to figure out.
I'm so good at figuring people out, you know? I'm a bartender--
I read people all day, you know? You're different.
- Different is a good thing.
- It definitely is.
- What's your sign?
- Virgo.
Get out of here.
Are you serious?
"Whut"?
Yeah, I'm a Virgo.
I don't know why I find myself attracted to Virgo men.
- You guys suck.
- That's the answer, huh?
What? Oh-- I did just think out loud, didn't l?
That Jeremy guy,
I don't know him at all.
Some girl was calling him out on his bullshit. It was funny.
She goes, "Is that hat
Burberry?" He goes--
His response is, "Yes, and my sunglasses are Gucci."
She told me that and I started laughing so hard.
Please don't tell me that.
How's shit going with you guys?
Whatever. He's hot.
You know, like normal.
Like, he goes and flirts with other chicks.
To make you jealous or to flirt with them?
Probably not to make me jealous.
I don't really think he gives that much of a shit about me.
But, you know,
I mean, maybe.
That could look mean.
This all could just look mean tonight.
Maybe I should wear a cool getup since I'm refreshed.
"Refreshed"?
I think I'm gonna go jeans.
Dawg, where should I throw my "bandeezy" on, my fucking arm or my head?
What are these?
- She creased my jeans.
- What the fuck is that?
You're never gonna meet these girls again, so don't be shy.
Just be like, "Look, you want to come back to a phat-ass crib?"
I don't think I can say
"phat-ass crib"
- and be taken seriously.
- Just be like--
"Phat-ass crib"? "Yo, bitch, welcome to our phat-ass crib.
Meet my dawg
Paul and Jorell. "
She'll be like,
"He's a thug."
She'll start laughing--
She'll be like, "Damn, he's fucking hard. "
Everybody's down here for the same reason.
Yeah, everyone's down here to meet people.
When you see them that first time and thought they was hot, then you see them up at "V.I.P."
Iike, "Can I get in please?
Bless me, please?
Please bless me."
Take her like,
"Are you down?
Like, "Can you ride?"
You know what I'm saying?
"Are you down for this shit?
Are you down? Let me know."
Well, that's all
I want to do.
I just want a girl who's right there so I can butt fuck them.
Not really "butt fuck, " but "butt fuck-dance fuck."
You don't got to explain.
We know what you're saying.
He's like, "Wait, wait.
Let me clean that up."
We know what the fuck you're trying to say, dawg.
I was like, "Good gracious, ass is bodacious" 
Flirtatious, trying to show patience 
I'm looking for the right time to shoot my steez, you know 
Looking for the right time to flash them keys 
It's getting hot in here 
So take off all your clothes 
 I am getting so hot 
I want to take my clothes off
It's getting hot in here 
So take off all your clothes 
 I am getting so hot 
I want to take my clothes off
Why you at the bar ifyou ain't poppin' the bottles? 
What good is all the fame ifyou ain't -- the models? 
I see you drivin' sports cars, ain't hittin' the throttle 
And I'll be down to do 100... 
Casey making out with a girl's cooter.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
...Ashtray, flip gate, time to spark it 
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it... 
- Is that me?
- Yeah.
Oh fantastic.
It might be the alcohol talking, but you're hot.
What's that?
- You are hot.
- Thank you.
I got secrets, can't leave Cancun-- 
So take it off like you're home alone 
You know, dance in front ofthe mirror while you're on the phone 
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend 
Like, "Girl, I think my butt gettin' big" 
-  It's getting hot in here 
-  So hot 
So take off all your clothes... 
I want to put my feet kind of in the water.
- Like sit on the edge.
- Want to get stung again?
- I don't want to get stung again.
- All right.
My voice is kinda like, easily coming back now.
I want to get this stupid tattoo off me.
Why'd you do that?
I didn't mean-- the guy's like, "Come here"--
Every time some guy says,
"Come here," you do it?
I didn't even pay attention.
I was like, "Okay."
- God.
- Oh, look at your fucking attitude.
If I was your boyfriend and some guy was like, "Come here,"
I'd be like, "What are you--?"
I got to meet your boyfriend.
- He's a sweetie.
- I need to talk to that guy--
He's in Vegas right now.
He's a good guy.
"Dude-- you have a great girl.
Like, if you don't-- if you don't treat her right,
I'm going to date your girl."
How can you seriously...?
Oh, "Mandingo"!
I'm just kidding.
Give me a hug.
I thought he like found some girl.
I saw him talking to some girl,
I was like "Oh, it's a skank ho."
Sky's sad?
No, Sky's fine.
Sky's doing great.
Oh, yes!
Yes, yes, yes!
Solid, buddy.
Hi, beautiful. I'm Matt.
Shit.
- Huh?
- At least the twins aren't in here.
We'll change-- we'll change together.
- Hi.
- What's up?
Why are we all in here?
Why do you look at him?
You got to ask him for advice?
No.
Hell no.
We need music.
It's essential.
I need music.
Why are you so quiet?
Are you going to pass out soon, or what?
Are you still excited for our date?
It'll be rad.
Laura, come here.
Totally fun.
What?
Sorry...
Yo, give me one!
Give me one.
Give me one.
Take one for the team!
I've got one in my backpack.
Okay, cool, cool.
Cool, cool.
I'm going to do her on the beach.
I've never did a girl on the beach.
You are so fucking lucky today, dude.
You are so lucky today.
I only had like two left.
Let me put this away before she comes in,
Iike, "What, you think, you're going to get lucky?"
This is so fucked up.
This'll be interesting-- you taking off your socks.
- Let's film that one.
- I want to take off my pants.
Oh, man.
Yeah. Oh!
Whoo!
Hey, party pooper, what you doing?
How much have you had to drink, my friend?
- What's your name again?
- Natalie.
Come swim down there.
We're wearing clothes.
It's okay.
It's not naked.
It's not anything more.
- It's okay.
- No, I think I'm good.
- Sorry, "Too Cool."
- No, I'm not too cool...
I'm just too... drunk.
- Too what?
- Drunk.
Too drunk?
You can't be too drunk.
Not possible.
- But I am, Natalie.
- Not a saying. It's not a word.
No such thing as "too drunk."
Natalie, nice meeting you, but I'm going upstairs in my room.
All right, well,
I don't think so.
Looks like you're going in the ocean. Come on!
No, it's not going to work.
- I said no.
- Uh-huh.
Jen!
I'm going to bed.
No!
- Natalie, I'll pay you money.
- Good, give me the money.
Let's go.
I just-- I don't know if Matt and I will end up kissing.
Sometimes I feel like I want to.
When you're used to sex three times a day and not getting any, you're like, "I will fucking hump anything."
You're like,
"Give me a pole, baby."
- You're like, "Look at this rail."
- "Look at this railing."
But, I'm so sick ofpeople being like,
"You guys hook up yet?
When are you going to hook up?"
I'm like,
"We have not hooked up."
That's 'cause everybody thinks you'll make a cute couple.
We're just really good friends.
We have so much to talk about because of Arizona-- we go to the same school.
And, yeah, he's gorgeous.
I'm not going to lie.
But at the same time, like...
I don't know. I can't.
I'm not going to do that.
Oh, God.
You gonna sleep on that bed tonight?
"Will you get out of here?
I need to bone Sarah."
Not going to happen.
I'll need a ring, a date, a place and time.
That chick you brought home-- was she in the titty contest?
- Yeah.
- Was that the girl?
- Was she the one that won it?
- Yeah.
Oh, nice. Damn.
I like the classy ones.
I love her.
You said Laura saw you last night?
Wait, you and Laura have a thing going on?
Is she kind of jealous of you
'cause you're hooking up with--
She doesn't say anything to me.
I swear I'll give you 50 bucks ifyou hook up with Laura again.
- 50 bucks?! Do it.
- 50 bucks to hook up with Laura.
I'm so good at lying
I could be like,
"Let's just spend the last night together."
Want me to bury you in sand?
I'm mad at you.
Don't talk to me.
- Why don't you talk about it?
- What?
'Cause you're phony.
I don't see how you do it.
I thought you were different.
- That's all.
- I mean--
I didn't think you were the "pick-up
-a-chick-at-a-club-and-fuck-'em."
I just think it's gross.
I think it's fucking disgusting.
'Cause you don't know what-- we don't know what she carrying.
You can go off, but you don't know shit about her.
Baby, that's why
I wear protection.
I just got a different impression about you.
- That's cool.
- So...
That's cool, but don't be like snobby and shit.
- I can do what I want.
- Then it's like, okay.
- I can do what I want.
- Yeah, 'cause it's like--
I could ignore you the rest of the trip if that's what I feel.
It's like this. The average guy that say they like me, they just going to keep trying.
They will be persistent.
You gave the fuck up.
You said, "I quit.
Sky doesn't want me, let me find somebody else."
Sky, I can't be with you for four days!
I do play hard to get.
It's people that stick into it long enough for the chase.
I asked you that shit.
I was like--
I'm not going to tell you everything. Trust me that.
- But see--
- I'm a fucking mystery.
You're not going to know everything.
It's your job to find out.
But, you gave up.
You said, "Fuck it, I quit.
I don't know where this is going.
- I'm getting mixed signals."
- And I asked you!
What did I just tell you?
I'm not going to tell everything.
I'm not with the game, Sky.
I'm not with it.
That's cool. Like I said,
I got a misunderstanding of you.
But--
I don't know.
I might be looking too deep into it.
- Can I ask you a question, though?
- What?
Had he pursued you for the whole trip where would it have got him, honestly?
All right,
I don't know.
You have to back me up on the chorus.
- I love every song.
- Are you ready for the '80s song?
- Yes.
- Okay.
There was a time in our lives 
That I know we all miss 
A time when girls would slap 
Snap bracelets upon their wrists 
We'd listen to tapes because we didn't have CDs 
And the guys would fantasize 
 About Ally Sheedy 
 Life was simpler then 
 With Michael Jackson 
 And the Jackson 5... 
I love that.
And we'd meet at the pub to watch "The Breakfast Club" 
 And we'd feel alive 
 Back in the '80s 
When all the gentlemen and ladies lived life-- 
Lived life how it was meant to be 
Watching "Three's Company" on TV 
And wouldn't you agree to sell your soul 
 To live back in 1983? 
 Back in the best decade 
 ln history. 
Yes!
Dude, you're my hero.
Does it kinda suck?
You don't have to answer-- but does it kind of suck being the only one that's not drinking?
It does suck, because, you know, like,
I feel like there's this big wall--
Iike the drinkers and then there's me.
And literally it will be like everyone around a table drinking a margarita or shots or whatever and then there's me sitting there going like "Yeah."
- Do you want me to stop? I'll stop.
- No!
No, no, no. It's not that bad, seriously. No, no, no, no.
- I'm so glad you're here, too.
- Same.
- It makes all the difference.
- Truth.
Truth!
Do you know how it is after you break up with someone?
You're just in a weird place.
Especially after a year and a half.
My first heartbreak was my boyfriend cheated on me with my best friend.
I was destroyed.
Not only had I lost my boyfriend, but I lost my best friend.
And so-- talk about depression--
I was there at the same time exactly.
Yeah, honestly,
I have never ever experienced something that intense.
- Yeah.
- In my entire life.
I really wish-- Iike people used to ask me before-- you know, "Wow, so have you ever been in love?" because I'm the kind of guy that would love someone.
And I'd have to say no, because
I've never had that opportunity.
- I thought I had two choices.
- Yeah.
I could either continue having relationships and just like-- just have relationships purely for the physical aspect of it...
- Yeah.
- and never open my heart up-- you know, anything like that.
This is-- every decision
I make is exactly my own--
I'm not living my life the way that I would like to live it, but... I mean, l--
I'll probably go through life miserable, you know?
No emotion-- I mean, no attachment, yeah.
So, in order to be happy
I have to open myself up to the opportunity that I might one day be sad.
The only way you're ever going to succeed or eventually be happy is if you take a risk.
Exactly.
I mean, if you go through life not-- trying to protect yourself and be defensive against anything that will hurt you, then you live a boring sheltered life--
Yeah, you're not living.
Alan, are you quite the ladies' man?
- I'm the anti-ladies' man.
- No, you are the ladies man.
We talked about that last night.
That the girls love you-- that you just need to-- improve your--
- Confidence?
- Exactly.
I was thinking about it
'cause I was talking to Matt...
- Um-hmm.
- ...he was like, "Girls like guys with the biggest balls. "
The first girl I go up to
I'm going to try and just like-- be as confident as possible and I'll say,
"What's up?"
Let's get this party started!
Whoo-oo!
Look at Case, that kid never stops partying.
The kid's going to die before he stops partying.
Whoo!
Hey, you guys,
I'm recruiting females for you.
Are you guys ready to have some fun, or what?
- Yeah.
- Are you guys sisters?
- Are you guys friends?
- Do we look like fucking sisters?
I don't know, man.
I want to kiss her.
You want to make out?
You want to make out?
God, someone get my name right!
I am Roxanne, not Nicole!
Are you ready for a shot?
- I don't-- I don't know.
- Yeah.
Diet Pepsi and about to do a body shot!
Welcome to the world of drinking, my friend.
Down there. Down there.
You got some. Yeah!

Fuck!

Alan in the house.
- One more shot.
- Yeah!
I'm not drunk.
You're not drunk?
You can't open your fucking eyes.
You need to slow down!
- You'll party with me, right?
- Definitely.
- I will party with you tonight.
- Then fucking seal that on a kiss.
You've got to seal it on a kiss.
You won't make out with me, why's that?
I can't just make out with someone.
- You know me now, though.
- No-- yeah, I know you--
We're here.
We're here.
Me and you, we're here.
You know me,
I know you.
I got hair on my finger.

That's bullshit.
A "peck"-- yeah.
No, you did, dawg.
Don't corrupt him.
Look at him.
Alan's fucked.
You are so drunk.

"Sally sells seashells by the seashore." See?
Wow, that was impressive.

Feeling my nipples.
You know, I want to spend the last couple of hours with you before you leave.
Just enjoy the last bit oftime...

Do you feel the same way, or are you like,
"Whatever"?
Where's the love?
Where is the love?
Let me whisper something to you.

- Bend down.
Oh yeah.
Tonight-- tonight we have to party.
I won't even sleep tonight.
That was my last meal since I'm here.

It's cool.
We talked about it. We settled it.

I don't know.
I got to ask Alan.
- Is he up there?
- Yeah.
I fucked up, you know what I'm saying?
So I understand where she's coming from.
I respect that.
We did it all.
Who cares, man?
I think he will ask me, but I don't know.
Are you ready?
We want Snoop!
We want Snoop!
All the way from Long Beach,

Snoop Dogg.
Yo, I'm gonna do this notjust for the ladies, but for all of the beautiful ladies in the house tonight.

That's "Ooh-whee!
Preach!"
"Preach" is what the prophet said.
This next record is for all the beautiful ladies.

And if you haven't heard it, it goes a little something like this.
 Oh-oh-oh-oh...

Y'all know the words to this shit right here?
 Oh-oh-oh-oh...

 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... 
Well, if you know the words to it, sing it like-- sing it like this.
 Beautiful 
Just want you to know you're my favorite girl... 
Can we get some ladies on stage right now?
When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish 
I'll smack a nigga that tries to pursue it 
Homeboy, she's taken, just move it 
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it 
We just blow 'dro and keep the flow moving

 Body rag interior blue 
And have them hydraulics squeaking when we screwing 
Now she's yelling, hollering out "Snoop" 
And hooting, hollering, hollering, hooting 
Black and beautiful, you're the one I'm choosing 
Your hair long and black and curly like you're Cuban 
Keep grooving that's what we're doing 
And we gonna be together until your moms move in... 
Everybody sing this shit for all the beautiful ladies. Come on.
 Beautiful 
I just want you to know that you're my favorite girl... 
I can't hear you!
 Beautiful 
ljust want you to know you're my favorite girl 
There's something about you, you're so beautiful 
 See, I just want you 
To know that you are really special... 
Everybody clap your hands to this, come on.
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why? 
Everybody clap your hands.
Everybody just clap your hands.
Come on.
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why? 
 See, ljust want you 
To know that you are really special 
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why? 
I want to thank all the beautiful ladies that's going to come and holler at me when I get off stage.
Love, y'all.
I'm done.
I'm so trashed, man.
Paul!
- Paul.
- Hi, Paul. I'm Cindy.
Hi, you look fly, Cindy.
Get the hot tub cracking, Matt.
Where's it at?
You already fucked up.
- Don't push the things, though.
- Yeah, I know. Cindy!
I think Matt and that girl went into the shower together.
Ooh-whee!
Smoke it and stroke it and shake it like I broke it 
When I drop my funky booty on the ground 
 I like, get down! 
Sarah. Sarah!
Fuck!
- Is it cold?
- It's warming up.
Let me see.
You know what?
Did you ever take a bath in the sea at night?
Me either.
- Yeah, I don't know.
- What do you think?
What, naked?
- Naked.
- Naked?
Sure.
You got to go naked.
No, nobody gets naked.
That's ridiculous.
I feel stupid for even trying to fucking-- it's not like anything would have happened ever between us, but-- fuck.
What a fucking skank is he?
You know, I have the best fucking boyfriend at home.
The best fucking boyfriend who treats me like a fucking princess, and who is the best person in the whole world.
And, you know, it's like--
I never would have hooked up with Matt anyway, ever, and I'm glad, thank God,
I didn't do it.
I thank God.
I thank fucking God that I didn't do anything with Matt.
Not a goddamn thing.
I don't feel bad.
I'm going home to the best person in the fucking world tomorrow.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna put some clothes on.
I'll be downstairs.
I misplaced where you put your e-mail address.
I think the girls put it here. Yes.
Okay. I'm gonna leave you mine.
Here, this is my street.
My name, my street, my zip code, my e-mail address.
- How do you pronounce this?
- Julia.
Do you say, "Joo-lia," or do you say, "Hyoo-lia"?
- Julia.
- You say "Yoo-lia"?
- Yes, very good.
- Okay.
Okay.
- "Yoo-lia. "
- Yeah, cool.
Baby, when I've fallen asleep 
I think about you, do you think about me? 
Tell me ifyou want to get close 
Closer to the fire, closer to me. 
Sarah. Sarah.
Come here.
Just talk to me.
- It's different.
- It's not different.
Five minutes?
Don't like what I have to say, you don't have to talk to me again.
- Five minutes.
- You know what I'd do, honestly?
- Five minutes.
- Just start talking now.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
Okay, that's fine.
So you know I had five minutes.
Fuck!
- Where you from?
- Arizona.
Sarah. Sarah!
- Please talk to me.
- Matt.
I know, I know.
Please.
- No.
- Please.
- Two minutes.
- What?
What the fuck does that mean?
Sarah. Sarah!
Case, stop.
- Don't touch me.
- I'm not going to if you stop.
- Come back.
- Move. Matt, move.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
I don't care. She has a boyfriend.
That's her fault.
- But still--
- I know I fucked up.
You played the game the whole week, then the last day--
You know what, dude?
I can't fucking wait that long.
Casey, I cannot wait that long, dude.
I've been watching you guys all fucking week.
I can't do it.
I just need to talk to her...
- There's nothing you can say...
- ...for five minutes.
Nothing you can say.
She doesn't want to talk about it.
Shit, dude-- 24 hours, that's all I need.
I punched a hole through the fucking thing.
 Looks like
I'm out ofluck 
'Cause she's got me so damn stuck 
Wish I never met her just want to forget her 
But she keeps coming at me... 
Matt, you are such a fucking asshole.
- No, fuck you.
- No, fuck you, Matt.
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
You see that?
 ... Till I open my eyes 
Now ljust want to get away from her... 
Oh, wait-- "I have a boyfriend"?
Okay, yeah, exactly.
Yeah, I do, and he's 100 times better than you, Matt.
Matt, why are you treating me like this?
What did you say to me when we were sitting outside?
I said, I'm tired of your fucking boyfriend.
I don't care, Matt.
You don't say "fuck you" to somebody you spent a week like we've been doing night and day
- for a piece of ass.
- Fuck you.
Matt, for a piece of ass you're never going to see again.
You had 24 hours.
Ooh.
...ljust want to get away from her. 
There's two people down there.
There's a couple people down there.
There's a couple people over there.
This is so cool.
Because you told me that you like the Celtic language and stuff like that, these are
Celtic symbols and a bracelet.
- Are you giving this to me?
- Yeah.
Don't lose it.
- I won't.
- Okay.
 Yeah 
 Whoo, yeah 
 Whoo-- yeah 
 Whoo, yeah 
It takes two to make a thing go right 
 Whoo, yeah 
It takes two to make it out ofsight 
 Whoo, yeah 
It takes two to make a thing go right 
 Yeah 
It takes two to make it out ofsight. 
That's a French kiss.
You never heard that?
I'm doing with tongues.
Yeah, you use your tongue.
That's a French kiss.
- That's a tongue kiss.
- You call it a "tongue kiss"?
- Yeah.
- You call a French kiss "kissing"?
I do, yeah.
What about French fries?
Do you call them French fries?
I want to rock right now 
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down 
I'm not internationally known 
But I'm known to rock the microphone 
 Because I get stupid--
I mean, outrageous 
Stay away from me ifyou're contagious 
'Cause I'm a winner, no, not a loser 
To be an MC is what I choose-ah. 
You don't call them
French fries?
Yeah, we call them
French fries, but--
It takes two to make... 
 It takes two to make... 
It takes two to make-- it takes two to make 
It takes two to make... 
One, two, three-- get loose now. 
I never did that.
That's so cool.
I know.
I think it's just so cool here because the water's turquoise.
Look at the moon.
Wow.
- It's amazing.
- I know, look at that.
Wow, what an eventful night.
I think it was, like, it was all the emotions that have been pent up this whole week just fucking-- exploded.
Stupidest thing
I've done in my life, man.
You win some, you lose some.
That was a fucking great one to lose.
I did some things that I might have otherwise not done unless I was in this situation and this setting.
If I could live this week over again,
I wouldn't change anything.
Why you all in my
"get ready" area?
You have your own room.
All good things must come to an end.
It's not the end.
It's just the beginning, homie.
Just the beginning.
You guys, best goddamn spring break ever.
Hell, yeah.

The image ofyou shaking your ass in that fucking bikini, man--
It will always remain in my head.

 She walks away 
 She talks away... 
Thanks.
- This is Julia?
- Yeah.
Everybody left.
Everybody left.
She thought we weren't going to leave till 12:30.

 All around the world 
 Hey, girls, hey, girls 
Your zippers and your pearls 
 Hey, girls 
 All around the world.
Art, for me, is a form of nourishment.
I... I need... I need the land.
I need it.
I want to understand that state and that energy that I have in me that I also feel in the plants and in the land.
The energy and life that is running through the...
Flowing through the landscape.
You know, that intangible thing that is here and then gone.
Growth, time, change, and the idea of flow in nature.
There's two big influences in my work...
The sea and the river...
Both water.
You would think that time would be more compatible with the tide.
Time and tide...
This daily up and down.
But somehow, I think there's a lot to be learned about time by the river.
There are always these obsessive forms that you cannot get rid of.
I don't like the sensation of traveling.
I feel dislocated, uprooted, and it takes me time to re-establish roots again.
And when I arrive at a new place
I have to begin work almost immediately.
There's no period of research or resting.
I go straight to work.
The tide is quite extraordinary...
To have that liquid movement backwards and forwards.
And the cold, and its relationship to stone and fluidity.
But I'm a stranger here.
I'm a stranger, so...
I am so out of touch with it.
I've shook hands with the place... and begun.
And the work's going well.
I feel warm, but...
Then there's a collapse.
I think I've got this cold, and it's right through me.
Yeah...
I think good art keeps you warm.
I've mistimed it today.
I got up early, very...
You know, 4:00.
And I couldn't see anything.
The moon was out, but...
But it cast a shadow down here.
And then once you lose your heat, it's gone, you know.
Have to get it back.
And I have to work with my bare hands.
Because my gloves stick, and I don't have the sensitivity to do it with gloves.
I lose feel of it.
I always like to touch, you know...
You never shake someone's hand with a glove on.
It is hard... hard going.
And it is cold sometimes on the hands, and I do get up very early.
And all that effort is ultimately going into trying to make something that it is effortless.
I wish I had reached this point about an hour ago before the sun had risen.
What is extraordinary that I didn't expect but I would have... could only have dreamt of happening is that the sun coming from there shines completely on both sides of the rock.
So all that icicle is illuminated and against that cliff.
And I never had any idea that that would happen.
So the potential...
The potential here is fantastic!
You know, it is water.
The river and the sea made solid.
And there's so many works that I've made that the thing...
The very thing that brings the work to life is the thing that will cause it death.
My first view of the beach was a river, and a pool that was being turned by the river.
So I'm trying to touch and understand that motion...
The flow and the meeting of the river with the sea.
I mean, these two waters meeting.
- Hello.
- Fantastic!
- Do you need any help?
- No, I'm done for the day.
When I was a boy, we used to stand on those rocks and dive in.
- The water was a little deeper then...
- Yeah?
I think.
Must have been.
Do you have a name for this?
This a salmon hole. Yes.
- So, you caught salmon from here?
- Yeah. Well, many times.
Many times. Salmon.
They were touching each other, they were so thick.
Yeah.
But I'll need such a strong connection to Scotland.
You know, we have a lot of salmon holes, too.
I like that. I like that feeling of the fish there underneath.
- Yes.
- You know that?
It has a sense of a whirlpool, you know.
And that's exactly what I wanted.
So I fed off that motion into this piece.
So, what's gonna happen?
What do you expect is gonna happen when that tide hits that?
- Don't worry.
- It's just gonna float away!
It's gonna float away.
It'll move into the...
- Will it stay intact?
- It'll move into the pool there.
No, it won't stay intact.
- Absolutely not.
- No.
It feels like it's being taken off into another plane, taken off into another world or another work.
It doesn't feel at all like... destruction.
That moment is really part of that cycle of turning.
You feel as if you've touched the heart of the place.
That's a way of understanding for me...
Seeing something you never saw before that was always there but you were blind to.
There are moments when it is extraordinarily beautiful in a piece of work.
I mean, though it happens, that is...
Then those are moments that I just live for.
Well, it's quarter to 8:00.
And I think the tide's due in at around 3:00.
And, well, you know, there's not a lot of time.
And I think you should stop filming and collect stones instead, you know.
Do something useful.
The stone is not so bad.
But the...
We're having to walk quite a distance to get it,
So, all the time we're losing...
Losing time.
And...
So that makes for an interesting work.
Maybe I quite like that, that tension.
And there's a risk, you know, that maybe only this half way up, and the tide's here.
And, you know, it's like a marker to that time that's coming up behind me.
I began working on the beach.
It's where I began.
And it was a great teacher.
About time.
I think the relentlessness of it...
There's no getting away from the fact that sea is going to be here.
I was at Art College at Lancaster, and all the students were in their cubicles, as they are, and in that cramped space.
And every day I'd catch a train to Markham, where I was staying.
And you get off the train, and you see this big expanse...
The space...
In such stark contrast to the Art College.
And one day, I went off and worked on the beach.
What struck me was that sense of energy when you were outside of the Art College.
It was very secure in the Art College.
As soon as you made something outside, there was this almost breathlessness and an uncertainty.
Total control can be the death of our work.
Oops.
The stone's speaking.
I've never had one do this before.
And I think it possibly...
It's either the sand that's settling, and...
Or the weakness of the stone.
Or even the combination of the two.
But I don't think this is going to...
I think that I'll make this the widest point and just try to get some weight back in the middle to start securing it.
Damn it all.
Shit!
This is my work, you know.
Too many unknowns.
I think its chances of survival are a bit slim.
Shit!
No.
Let's go.
We need a very heavy stone right here.
Can you bring me a very heavy stone, a kind of lumpy squarish one?
Maybe I shouldn't have put that one on.
- Can you get one end down here?
- Yes.
Just put it gently on this.
- Ready?
- Down.
You okay?
That's the fourth...
The fourth collapse.
And the tide is... coming in.
I think it would be better to wait.
The moment when something collapses, it is intensely disappointing.
And this is the fourth time it's fallen, and each time I got to know the stone a little bit more.
I got higher each time.
So it grew in proportion to my understanding of the stone.
And that is really what one of the things that my art is trying to do.
It's trying to understand the stone.
I obviously don't understand it well enough yet.
People make small piles of stone to mark pathways in hills, mountains in Scotland, and I think all over the world.
So all the cones are related in some way, and they have become markers to my journeys and places that I feel an attachment towards.
And then it has a quality of this guardian, the way that it stands and feels as if it is protecting something.
I like the connection the form has with the seed...
Very full and ripe.
I think to look at stone and find growth, and is expressed in the seed within stone is a very powerful image for me.
The sea came in and the cone just disappeared.
And then it was gone.
But it was still there.
The work that I had only just finished making, so my contact with the stone was still very, very strong.
So I was with it down there, but I still couldn't see it.
What I have touched on this time is that I haven't simply made the piece to be destroyed by the sea.
It is... the work has been given to the sea as a gift.
And the sea has taken the work, and made more of it than I could have ever hoped for.
And I think that if I can see in that ways of understanding those things that happen to us in life, that changes our lives, that causes upheavals and shock...
Can't explain that.
That deeper rhythm of change
I can't see other than in my home.
And, well, this is why my homeplace is becoming more and more important to me.
Bracken is a material that I have always enjoyed working with.
But it's a very hard...
It's a very tough plant to work with.
It's very aggressive on your hands when you're pulling it.
It's like razors.
And I always associate the material with bleeding hands.
And it's one of the few plants
I use a knife on.
And it's a very toxic plant, too.
When it's sporing, you shouldn't really inhale at that time.
And I think we misread the landscape when we think of it just being pastoral and pretty.
There is a darker side to that.
Where they've been in the ground, they've gone black.
And I really like that idea that the contact between...
The alpine cows with bells.
I like the idea, that feeling that the contact between the plant and the...
Sorry.
The flavor of the fire makes the energy of the fire visible.
Well, it's the same with this black.
It's like a result of the exchange of energy that has taken place between the plant and the earth.
And that... through that process there is an exchange of heat that gives it this...
Well, it looks charred.
It looks painted, but it's not.
That's just the root as I find it.
And I think at this time, when spring is beginning, that it doesn't begin on the surface, it begins below, you know?
So this idea of finding evidence of that heat within the ground is something that I... in a way, is my way of understanding what's going on at the moment.
And even though these are stalks from last year's plants and will not grow again this year, they are still connected to that root system underneath the ground.
And the idea of what happened last year is being repeated this year, and it's going to come through this.
I am fascinated by those processes that are happening in nature over time and connected to the sun, the light, the tide, growth.
The real work is the change.
Bacon will be ready.
Okay.
Want some?
Yes?
No, it's a surprise.
Yeah, it's cooling out.
Probably you guys can get it.
I called you stupid.
Guys, you don't say that.
Will that do?
Yes.
You want some bread?
Here we've been cooking...
Frying bread all morning.
The rabbits.
Don't forget to give him some green leaves, Holly.
I won't.
No, thank you.
Pull it out then.
Fun.
Pete, come on. Pete.
I'm coming.
- Pete!
- This is a little...!
I'm gonna hold you. You sit.
- I'm gonna hold your fingers.
- Okay, hold my fingers.
Pete, Pete! Come on!
The pupil is dropping.
Floppy. Floppy ears.
Yeah, I think we're good.
And then there's the...
I do my first one of the day's two.
Each are underneath here, and these all turned out.
Check them for spelling.
The images are coming from Charlie Sorkin.
Okay.
I began taking photographs when I was a student at Art College when I first began working outside, and I had to explain to my tutors what I was making.
And the way to do that was to take photographs.
So it still is a little bit like that.
Photography has become the way I talk about my sculpture.
And Brancuzzi once said about sculpture,
"Why talk about sculpture when I can photograph it?"
It's the language through which
I talk and describe what I've made.
It's also become the way that I understand what I have done.
When I've worked all day in the rain, and I'm tired,
I get visually and physically numb to what I've made.
And I need that time between the making and the return of the images to be able to see afresh what I've really done.
And I have in here everything...
Good work and bad work.
Everything is put into here.
I'll see you later, then.
Just to work with the tree, if you want to.
The tree. Okay?
- Okay?
- All right.
See you later.
What you going to make?
Where are you going to make it, the tree on, Dave?
Who are you working for?
You know, but what are you going to make at the tree?
I work intuitively.
Most days I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I have no idea.
I haven't worked there for a while, so...
Is Wallis going to help you?
I think Wallis is there, yeah.
So we'll see.
I came here I think 12 years ago.
All my children have been born here.
Most of my good friends are here.
I make my best work here, and I think those are indications of how strongly I feel for this place.
Yeah!
Take the ball away!
Fine, Johnson!
- Hey, Audrey.
- Hello.
I've lived in places for four or five years and moved on, and that is not enough time.
It really isn't enough time to understand the changes that happen in the place.
You have to live on the same street, the same village for a long period of time, and seeing children when they're waiting at the bus stop grow into adults and have children of their own.
There was an old lady in the village who since died.
She was quite a doer Lady.
And she'd had a tough life.
And she used to walk up and down the street that I lived on, and I said, "Well, you know, think about it this way."
Since I've been on this street, my son...
Well, all my children were born there.
My eldest son was the first child
"to be born on that street for 21 years."
And she said,
"Well, you see only births, and I see only deaths."
From her perspective, she just knew all the people who had lived in those houses and who, you know...
Who had died.
And I hope I never forget either those people who have been born, and those people who have died.
Somehow the river is that line that I follow.
The river has an unpredictability about it.
It really is unpredictable.
And that line running through, yet, at the same time, having its own cycles related to the weather and the sea.
It...
So if I had to find something that would join the year together, it would be something like the river.
The river is a river of stone, a river of animals, a river of the wind, a river of the water, a river of many things.
A river is not dependent on water.
We're talking about the flow.
And the river of growth that flows through the trees and the land.
And here's the other lamb on its own.
Just place it up there.
Make sure it's most clear.
Check that her udder's okay.
And that was all over very quick and painless.
And if we just retreat, and they'll get back to the lambs.
Can you bring the lamb to drink?
I think this one would be safe here.
The sheep is very brutal to any young growth.
And the way it rips and tears the grass.
They are, at times, like a river of sheep.
The flow and movement in their own way.
The reason this landscape looks as it is, with no trees, is because of the sheep.
So the sheep have had this very deep impact on the land.
And...
So I do feel this need to work with the sheep.
And, yet, our perception of sheep is so different to the reality of the sheep.
You know, we...
In that it makes it an incredibly difficult thing to work with because we perceive it as being a wooly animal.
And to get through that wooliness to the essence of the sheep is very, very hard because sheep are incredibly powerful animals in their own way.
They have been responsible for social and political upheavals.
The Highland Clearances, when people were put off the land, the land lords put sheep on the land and moved the people away.
And they've left their story behind them.
And it's written in the place, in the landscape.
But there's an absence in the landscape because of the effects of sheep.
People have lived, worked, and died here, and I can feel their presence in the places that I work.
And I am the next layer upon those things that have happened already.
I don't think the earth needs me at all.
But I do need it.
To just go off into the woods and make a piece of work roots me again.
And if I don't work for a period of time, I feel...
I do feel rootless.
I don't... I don't know myself.
And it's very odd if I've not worked for, say, two, three weeks, and then I give a lecture and I'm talking about my work, and it feels like I'm talking about somebody else.
I do need to be on my own at times.
I enjoy being by myself.
There are people's company
I do enjoy.
And there probably is a social nature, too.
And that I feed from that to some extent.
To be honest, I think I do.
I am tired. I am drained by... people.
But of all the subtleties that I am aware of, like the fact the wind has just now got a little bit stronger, and although, you know, I look as calm as I did 30 seconds ago, there's these little warning bells inside going.
When I make a work,
I often take it to the very edge of its collapse.
And that's a very beautiful balance.
Oops.
Dear.
Well, that was close.
I am so amazed at times that I am actually alive.
Well, that happened occasions.
Well, on occasion, when someone very close to me died.
It was my younger brother's wife.
Very young.
And the image of...
The image of somebody dying...
Julia dying...
Was just very burnt in your mind.
And the day after Julia's death,
I worked with the tree.
It seemed the right place to go.
And made, the work...
La work with a hole on the tree.
I've become to see it as a kind of entrance, a visual entrance into the earth, into the tree, and stone.
That entrance between which life both ebbs and flows.
Looking into a black hole,
I've often described as like looking over a cliff edge.
There's this sense of being drawn into the black as you're drawn into the depth, the distance.
But the other side of that is out of that comes growth also.
And that was my way of trying to understand that...
And not just the death, not just the absence, because the black is the absence.
It's the...
It's the intangible, but it's in a context of a tree that I know will come back to life.
And there's nothing more potent to me than a black hole that I've made, and returning later, and seeing a little finger of growth...
Growth, a blade of growth growing out of that black.
That is such a potent image.
You and Maxwell were saying that Scotland's a lot better than England.
I have never, ever said that!
When have I ever said that?
I'm not going to...
There's a brilliant rock.
The first wall that I made with a waller...
You know, my idea was that I would work with him, to make the wall.
I used to gap... that's repair, broken walls a little bit.
But he kept taking my stones off the wall.
And, you know, he was right to do that.
I've learned that I have to respect their work, their life, you know.
And when I work with a waller, it's not just the time they spent with me, but they bring their lives to it.
They don't want me to touch the walls, playing at being a waller, just like I don't want them to start playing at being artists.
That we both each have our roles in this.
And my role is to find the line of the wall.
And I work the space.
Their dialogue with the stone is what makes the wall.
The stones are laid on, and on, and on, and the work makes itself to some extent.
And it's that fluidity of working that gives the sculpture a sense of movement and energy.
When I was asked to make a work at Storm King...
And I spent a lot of time walking around, just getting to know the place.
And I see these walls, that's now derelict, that are a link back to my home.
Because these walls were probably made by people who came out from Europe, possibly even Scotland...
Who came out here as settlers, made farms, made walls.
So that was the first interest.
I wanted to redraw the line, remake the wall, so that it talked about the place as it is now.
The walls here came out of that process of cutting down the trees and turning the forest into farmland.
But then farming has shifted away from this landscape.
And trees found shelter in the wall and grew.
So it was this dialogue that was of interest to me.
That each bast of wall is a line that is in sympathy with the place through which it travels.
And that sense of movement is very important to understanding the sculpture.
While the movement, the passage of people, the movement of the wall, the river of stone, as it runs round the trees, the river of growth that is the forest.
And it has made me aware of that flow around the world, the veins that run around the world.
The reason why the stone is red is because of its iron content.
And that's also the reason why our blood is red, too.
I do feel a...
There is a special energy about the red.
I mean, it's probably its relationship to blood.
But probably something that I can't really explain entirely.
I think it's the color is an expression of life.
Even though things die, they're part of that flow still.
You know, they become part of the river of red.
In Japan, you'll see a red maple tree against a green mountain and this incredible red.
And it's like a wound.
It's like a wound in the mountain.
There's such an energy and violence about that color.
And I will al...
I am in a continuous pursuit of the red.
And I have this feeling that as I approach its source, the more I begin to understand the color.
You know, there are many lessons to be learned by that color.
And I think that when the realization was that I...
The color is also in me, you know, then it's this feeling of both a color and an energy flowing though all things.
I must have worked here several times before realizing the red here.
You know, it's not so obvious.
And just looking underneath stones, you find these small, red, soft iron stones.
That something so dramatic, so intense, could be so...
At the same time, so hidden.
It's so underneath the skin of the earth.
And there's a real shock at seeing that color.
Something very alien to the river.
In fact, it is so rooted and about that place.
You know, here I am working with the stone, grinding them down, and...
You know, I spend all this time...
Several hours...
Making a little pile of pigment that I will make into a ball, and throw into the river, and there'll be a splash.
And that's just an instant in that cycle of stone as it goes through its process of solidification, of then becoming fluid again, and then being solid...
Made solid once again.
And I think it's one of the...
It's a little memory in the life of a stone, but very much in the spirit of that...
In the nature of stone.
We set so much by our idea of the stability of stone.
And when you find that stone itself is actually fluid and liquid, that really undermines my sense of what is here to stay and what isn't.
When I work with a building,
I try to use the whole wall...
To touch on a landscape contained within and behind the building.
It's almost a memory of the building's origin contained in the walls, and it's drawing out that memory.
I wanted the clay either from Dean or a clay from Scotland.
What I didn't want was a sort of anonymous, processed clay that came from some ceramic shop somewhere.
The clay is dug raw from the ground, and I sift out some of the stones.
It's dried, then it's crushed, and mixed with human hair, and mixed with water...
Reconstituted.
And the hair is necessary to bind.
And I could use sheep, cow, horse, but I do like that feeling of people being bound up in there.
The hair came from the hairdresser's in the village near to where I live.
So my village is in this work.
I discovered when I made the first clay walls that the architectural geology of the building where beams were affected the drying rate and formed cracks and patterns within the cracking.
So what lies bellow the surface affects the surface.
Of course, it feels alive, yeah.
If anything, it's an expression of the stone alive...
Almost back to its origin as in a volcano, you know, when the stone was alive.
I mean, it's always alive, but that visible evidence of movement and eruption of the stone.
There's that feeling of energy within it.
And that's life.
I cannot then explain beyond that, but I know that there is more than just a simple collapsing and arrival of material.
I struggle to say these things, and I know I can just about get them out, but there's a world beyond what words can define for me.
Words are... do their job, but what I'm doing here says a lot more.
I play men. You see I have a moustache.
I play men but I also play women.
Taxi driver: Then you put a wig on?
Bridge: Yeah.
TD: How do you like it when you play men?
I like it a lot. It’s fun.
Driver: It is, right?
It’s fun because I’m not a man.
So it’s fun to put on that other gender.
Driver:   Did you ever think to be a man?
No, it’s more fun to be, to play than...
I don’t want to be a man. No.
Interviewer: When you play man you play like husband role?
Like husband role?
I: Husband or boyfriend.
No. Actually, I don’t play husbands really.
Sometimes maybe when I play with a drag queen.
Some years ago
I set out on this journey in search of women who live in between who also live the man within whatever that means be it for a night, be it for a lifetime.
The young King movement in New York City had just got on its feet.
Here I met Mo B. Dick and his friends.
Mo was co-initiator and moderator of Club Casanova, the first king meeting place.
Mo B. Dick: It was a variety, a total mixture of people that went.
You didn’t know who’s who, what sexuality anybody was.
Nobody cared.
Brothers and sisters,
I’m Reverend Jimmy Johnson and I came here as a special messenger,
I came here as a special messenger to tell you to the people of New York city, that the drag kingdom has come.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Amen.
And on the 8th day the gods realised there must be a third sex.
[With the participation of]
Oh drag kingdom come, drag will be done.
Brothers and sisters,
I have many many people ask me:
"Reverend Jimmy Johnson, what is a drag king? I wanna know."
I’m here to tell you, brothers and sisters:
A drag king is a person who wants gender euphoria.
A drag king is a person who has accepted their female masculinity.
Amen.
Bridge: I mean I just come from Berlin, and in Berlin, actually the last few weeks the weather has been like almost Hawaii, maybe St. Tropez or something like that.
So I really have to cover up so I don’t get a cold or something.
I already feel it coming.
[Written and directed by]
(German) I always had my eye on pinstriped suits.
I had my first one at 17... because I had seen David Bowie wearing them.
And then I also wanted to wear one.
I always wore
androgynous and crossgender make-up.
And I have been collecting pinstriped suits for several years.
Hey Garland, this is Bridge.
I told you about this drag king night that we’re doing on Tuesday the 23rd.
You know, there’s going to be so many great drag kings in one show.
I hope you come.
Talk to you soon. Bye.
Society is more aware of drag queens than they are of drag kings.
No one even really knew what a drag king was.
And so we really wanted to introduce that to the New York scene and we wanted people to see that gender is really undefined.
It’s what you make of it.
It really helped us to sort of get full circle come from drag queens all the way around to drag kings.
(German) Biologically, I am a woman.
I don't want to change that, but the point is... that there are different forms of femininity.
And mine is definitely very androgynous.
I can be feeling bad.
I can be feeling like a nothing.
(German) I can be feeling bad.
I can be feeling like a nothing.
But then... when I put on these trousers.
(German) When I put on these trousers.
Particularly from a pinstriped suit.
(German) Particularly from a pinstriped suit.
And I put on a nice dress shirt.
(German) And I put on a nice dress shirt.
And I button it up slowly up to the collar.
(German) And I button it up slowly up to the collar
And I tie the tie.
(German) And I tie the tie and I put on my jacket
Every time I put on the suit jacket,
I feel a little bit more powerful.
(German) I button my fly
Every time I button my fly
I touch myself a little bit to kinda stay hard.
And I put on a moustache.
(German) And I draw a moustache.
And I think...
(German) and I think...
I am fucking hot.
(German) I am fucking hot.
(German) Alter ego is that part of me that wants to scream out:
"Here I am, the whole world belongs to me."
And I can conquer any man or any woman I want to.
I also enjoy playing assholes, because then one can release these asshole qualities which every one of us has.
Hey, dig me! I can punch you in the nose and you can't do a damn thing about it.
[music]
(German) Karl, for me, is a very positive figure.
He's a cuddly old man.
He couldn't hurt anyone.
He's very sweet and also helpless.
I created him after. my father and my oncle.
They were both bald-headed, had a tonsure and were fat, ageing men.
But Karl is good natured compared to them. And nicer.
He would never harm anybody.
He's a truly kind man.
The kindest man I play.
[opera music]
(German) Ever since I've been bald,
I've noticed that female sexuality, for many men, surely not all of them, but many, is strongly linked with hair, and as soon as you shave your hair off, they think you deny your sexuality.
I feel it as a liberation.
[water running]
[water running]
For women... it's more natural for them that I am bald.
But I prefer men.
I fancy women, but men turn me on more.
[music]
(German) I am a chameleon.
I am really Bridge.
You could say I am at home on the bridge.
I live on the bridge.
Interestingly enough, the bridge is moving.
So I also go to wherever it's going... and then I'm back on the bridge.
Again, going wherever the bridge takes me.
But even if you say drag king some people don't know that.
They don’t know what a drag king is.
When I say I teach drag king workshops.
They ask: "What are dry-cleaning workshops?"
Dry cleaning is so fabulous.
They don’t know any better.
I think the Gap and
Calvin Klein and television, and everything that‘s around us in advertising and sitcoms and movies teaches us so much about wanting to be like everybody else, wanting to conform and to be the popular girl or the cool guy in school.
I think what they don’t show is that it's all the geeks and nerds, the people that were rejected and that felt like shit in school who really try 200% more to make something of themselves.
The final step.
Well, I’d like to stay, hang out with the drag kings all night long, but I’m off to LA to see Hugh Hefner to be the first drag queen ever pictured in Playboy magazine.
But I wanna tell all those hot sexy studs tonight:
Good luck, drag kings, you rock New York.
The hottest, the cutest, the finest boys in this room tonight.
The Backdoor Boys.
Please give a round of applause to Shelly Mars.
I’ve been doing drag for a long time, 20 years.
It’s very erotic for me to be a guy.
My name is Damien Corson.
I’m an independent digital filmmaker.
He’s a young guy, he’s into film and poetry and it’s like very now, the dotcom film digital guys.
Film.
I’m making a film.
I’m making an independent film.
I’m a filmmaker.
I’m writing a film.
I’m writing an independent film.
Read my script you idiots.
I think I started out in a political way but not consciously
"I’m being political".
Any artist that breaks boundaries it’s a political thing.
It’s saying like why not?
Why can’t I do this?
This is actually one of the first times
I ever did him as Martin in this act.
People either were screaming,:
"Oh my god, this is fabulous, I love him", or were like
"Get off the stage, booh", basically throwing tomatoes at me.
I think some women really have the biology to be like totally female and some don’t.
And it’s the ones that don’t that are made to be like
"I’m supposed to be a girl" that have the problems.
Same with guys.
Everyone is a little different with what’s comfortable for them.
What we or our society just doesn’t allow more than... either you’re a blond nice girl or you‘re a guy like that.
I mean there are many degrees in between, and that’s what we don’t allow and that’s the problem.
Yeah you look good.
You look good babe.
Her name is Bridge Markland.
All the way from Berlin, darling.
There she is!
Oh, my god!
Ladies and gentlemen:
Bridge Markland.
(German) It makes me happy to be on stage, where everything just flows, where I am at home, within myself and I can draw creatively from my own energy.
[music]
Basically, when I deconstruct this sex bomb, Angela, she's called Angela, and approach the audience, androgynous, sexy, self-confident, half-naked...
I choose my own sexual objects.
Sometimes, I have the urge to shake people up, to get very close to them and say:
"Here I am, and you can't avoid me.
And I stick my tongue out at you, as if you were my father.
You can't escape.
Maybe you’re being filmed or watched.
You can't get away, you're here and you have to look at me.
I really enjoyed her performance because it was Weimar Germany, kind of Bertold Brecht, kind of feeling to it.
And I’m glad I got to do the little tongue dance with her.
That was really fun.
Philly: Hello?
Hey it’s me.
Hi babe.
Come on in.
Are you coming down?
I identify with Brandon a lot, because Brandon was stuck in that small town insane mentality and that’s really really scary.
Brandon Teena, born as Teena Brandon was killed in Nebraska, 1993, for living as a man.
Well I went back down to South Jersey where I lived and when I was like 16
I went to my brother’s wedding and I got beat up by 7 guys on the board walk in New Jersey.
They started beating up my friend calling him a faggot and I jumped in and
I was pulling people off him and they started like punching me,
I got punched in the face.
The cops weren’t doing anything either, and this Italian woman from behind the sausage stand jumped out and just ran over and grabbed me and ran me off the board walk. but it was like an angry mob mentality.
It was really scary.
I’ve always been gay and I’ve always been butch or transgender even, you know what I mean.
Growing up I identified as a little boy.
I liked girls but
I was really happy that...
I didn’t want a dick, you know what I mean.
And I remember my brother teasing me saying:
"Oh, we’re gonna send you to Denmark". when I was little because
I was such a boy.
They don’t want women looking like men.
That’s the crossover.
Because I think it makes them feel that they might be queer if they like a butch version.
I would say that my male is all drag queen and my female is all amazon.
You know it’s an everyday thing for me.
When I take this off
I don’t assume a different role.
It’s very hard to find anyone here who will identify with the term butch.
Whereas in London, a lot of people would say that one of the reasons they are interested in dressing up in drag is because they are butch, and they love... this is just part of what they love to do.
What is then butch exactly for you?
- What is it?
- Yeah, for you.
Butch is masculinity as an identity in women.
I’m not butch or femme.
I’m just whatever I’m feeling.
I can be one way one day and another way the other.
I can’t put myself in a category.
So you would sleep with a woman in drag and you do drag.
I would sleep in drag with a woman.
Well you’re just very versatile.
But for me it's not whatever I’m feeling.
For you it’s different.
I would never wear a dress.
I only go out with feminine women.
I consider myself butch,
I can’t change it.
I admire that you can do that, Dréd.
But for me I can’t.
I can’t switch today and tomorrow
I’ll be something different.
You gotta be yourself.
And it’s this very strict thing.
[rap music]
I was inspired by seeing a bunch of drag kings.
I thought it was very empowering.
And it made me wanna do the drag.
I was like, I wanna give this a try.
The transformation was definitely amazing.
And surprising.
I was like wow,
I look like a man.
A good looking one too.
I feel so natural that one time
I said that in my past life...
I definitely felt like
I’ve lived as a man before.
I’ve lived it in previous life times.
I believe in all that stuff.
I definitely feel like
I was a ladies man, definitely.
I’m not sure exactly how it was.
But, you know, sometimes having all the women and all that stuff in line waiting, but it’s...
I’m not really like that.
Not in this lifetime anyway,
I’m not like that.
When I was growing up
I was very, very feminine.
I had big hair and red red lipstick and all that stuff.
A lot of people think that
Dréd have all the women every night a woman and all that, but it’s not even like that.
I’m very shy and Dréd is shy too.
But Dréd is very respectful I feel, like I perform and the ladies are all screaming, sometimes they throw heir bras at me and stuff.
But that’s as far as it goes pretty much at the shows.
This one is real.
Time to get dressed.
I love shoes.
Like the drag queens oh my god, you see the shoes that Luscious wears?
Oh they are so sexy and I like the pretty toes and the nail polish and the long heels...
It turns me on.
It’s very exciting and sexual for me.
Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a pleasure to bring out an old time friend.
Ladies and gentlemen: Dréd and Luscious!
[music]
I feel everybody has a male, a masculine and feminine side.
But not everybody chooses to explore the other side.
Stay just like that.
We met on Christopher Street, which is in the west village in NY where a lot of gay people are up in the area, specially men.
I was walking and in front of me there was this beautiful ass
Beautiful butt hanging out of these really tight white shorts.
So she’s like "Excuse me".
I was like "Yes?". I had my moustache so I didn’t want her to see my face.
So she’s like: "Excuse me",
I say: "Yes?"
She said: "Oh, how you doing?"
You know, cause she sees that I’m a man.
Looking still good.
Still... she played herself.
No I didn't play myself,
I still liked how he looked.
You know how the queens are, you know what I'm saying.
She still spoke to me but then again...
... still I wanted the digits.
She still didn't want me to know that she knows I am man.
Real honey, real.
Jiggle baby jiggle.
Well, she’s so nasty.
But doesn’t it look real?
Yes, I like it.
Gay mean happy.
As long as you don't bother nobody.
Do what you want.
You wanna go to town now....
Well, got the pussy boots on.
The kings are coming along.
Dréd she’s the powerful one.
She keeps me on my feet, you know.
Oh we’re good good friends, really good friends.
She thought she could be my girlfriend, unfortunately I was a man,
I definitely wanna be a household name.
Dréd or Mildred.
But it’d be nice to be more well known.
But it’s a step by step process and I'm working on it.
So it doesn’t happen over night.
When I was going to the gym before work,
I would get up at 5:30 or 6, go to the gym, tak a shower, go to work, go to class after long very long days, and this drag thing, in the beginning,
I was always performing like
3, 4 times a week, just to get my name out there.
I have a full-time job working on computers, doing data processing and creating computerized questionnaires for a research institute in Manhattan.
My dream one day is to just make a living of my creativity.
She’s always been the same person.
I think that’s what’s so great about her.
It’s like Dréd and Mildred are two different people because when  you’re watching her perform she’s like uninhibited, she entertains you, she’s great.
But when you’re just with Mildred she's a very shy person, very sweet, soft spoken and everything.
So it’s like she’s two different people.
I don’t think she’s changed at all.
It’s definitely helped me to be more expressive.
Dréd has helped me to open another sides of myself that I didn’t know I had.
It has also helped me to feel that it’s okay to try new things, to be different.
It’s so different from when I was growing up.
I was very shy, I was teased a lot and I was very sad.
I believed people said you're ugly and all that stuff, little kids could be so cruel.
And I believed them,
I didn't know how to deal with it.
I didn’t tell anybody.
I kept very quiet,
I didn’t really have any friends.
And so now it’s kind of totally opposite
I feel I've bloomed and
I can look at myself and say yes you’re beautiful, you’re strong and you gotta do your thing.
And it’s hard sometimes, it takes time to heal from those wounds.
I feel I have my angels, my guarding angels,
I am not really alone.
This is like my family portion of this whole wall.
Because I have my family I’m born with and I have my drag family, so I mixed the pictures together.
And that’s me.
I’m so short compared to all the queens.
They’re like towering over me.
I have a lot of friends, my family is very lovable... and supportive.
That’s me as a little girl.
I think I was in junior high school then.
That’s me and my mummy again.
I love my mummy.
I would like to have a relationship and a serious one.
I hope one day to have one, but that takes time.
[door bell]
[knocking]
Hi there!
How are you doing?
- Good, and you?
- I'm good. Come on.
- Did you bring that book?
- Yes, I did.
All right, come on.
I was walking down a block and you said good evening and first I wasn’t sure.
I didn’t say good evening, I said:
"Good evening".
Well, I’m sorry I didn’t get your fabulous voice and all.
It’s different.
Good evening.
[laughter]
I turned back and saw you and said "Is that a man or a woman?"
Because if I thought it was a man,
I would be like "please".
[laughter]
No offense to men and all that.
We dated for a little bit, but we’re definitely better as friends.
Sisters.
We’re family.
You meet your family and sometimes you’re confused at first, you think it's your lover, but it’s your cousin or in Mildred's case, she's my granny.
And you’re my grandson.
Now that we know who each other is we get on much better.
When we were trying to date we fought a lot.
Oh god, I don’t even know how stupid was.
You was trying to be the man.
Oh no, you know that’s not true.
You'd better take that back.
So you have [incomprehensible]
[chatting]
Let's see.
And you got here.
On the side it looks kind of cute.
I have a large head and a lot of hair.
You're just wrong.
Need any assistance?
Let me see here.
Let me go back.
I’m right here, granny. right here for you.
I’ll fix that tag.
Come here, come here.
Let me come out.
I feel in some way it’s different... for black or white kings, because  a lot I know don’t like to show their womanhood.
They stay in male drag during the whole show and I like to mix it up.
I like to do a little stripping and I show cleavage and stuff.
You know Dréd’s not here.
Dréd would be feeling it more, because I got the make up on and all that stuff.
Bring out your inner Dréd.
[music]
Storme: This is one of my favourite songs in the world.
In some ways most of us we all kind of make fun of the characters we’re doing but also I‘m paying tribute to the music, our music.
It’s music I always loved growing up and listening to.
A lot of this seventies stuff,
Isaac Hayes, and... the Commodores or...
I’ve even done Little Richard before.
Isaac Hayes, he’s the man, he’s the legend.
A friend of a friend of mine gave me a poster cause he said we look alike
And when I met him
I had some of my breasts showing and he didn’t know what was going on.
The first time Dréd was,
I was trying to catch a cab, it was night time... and just waiting for a cab, it took like a good hour before I caught the cab.
They would slow down and then run off.
This white woman comes in front of me and is trying to catch a cab,
I’m like "You don't see
I’m trying to catch a cab".
She’s like "Oh I’m sorry man".
And then she walked away.
But it’s just very frustrating.
So that felt really bad when I realised... the stereotypes they have in their heads of black men.
Like they won’t pay, they’ll rob them or something alike which is really stupid.
Sometimes it’s really hard for me, for Dréd to catch a cab and even as a woman
I experience that too at times.
You do have to be ready to carry something when you decide to define yourself.
When you decide to be different than what the mainstream society says is normal.
You may have to fight.
I think we’re very much in the tradition too because in African societies and in Native American societies there were always crossdressers, and there were always people
who played both roles, both gender roles.
A lot of times... they were the spiritual people, the medicine people, the healers.
And somehow I think by demonstrating this comfortableness within ourselves with both aspects of our gender identity, that’s something healing for people in general to see.
I’m a stranger here, Lord,
I‘m a stranger everywhere.
I think I just realised this year that I’m transgender.
[background singing]
Without intending to
I find that I live my life as a passing woman and that I’m very often perceived as a man.
Very often.
And it’s interesting.
I’m not flat chested.
This is only natural.
When I was in my twenties, there was maybe one.
I’m 40 now.
And it’s just growing, I don’t know.
I think it’s interesting because it’s different.
That's why I like it.
Because you don’t think a woman should have it.
Before they didn’t think we should have trousers, before they didn't think we should drive cars.
They didn't think so.
I think that the world is changing.
That’s me and my mum.
This believe it or not is my father.
There’s my father after he joined the navy.
(poem) A slash of brilliant tropical color
I was very fortunate to grow up in a queer environment.
My mother is a lesbian, my father was bisexual.
So I remember when I was a child and I saw a man and woman kissing in a movie it seemed so strange and unnatural for me.
Because what I knew was lesbians and gay men, relating with each other.
I think that it was challenging, but I do think that it was a blessing.
Because I came into the earth on so many margins, because already my mother’s family is Alaskan Indian and European, my father’s family is African and Choctaw.
So there was already such difference within my mother’s family,
I’m the only black child.
My mother’s a lesbian, we were quite poor.
I’ve always been on the margins... of race, of gender, of sex, of class,
I think it gave me a lot of strength.
Because I had to become aware of how to move in each world.
While at the same time realising
I didn’t really belong into any of them.
My father died of... carbon monoxide poisoning
He was in a car and he was cold, he turned on the engine to be warm and he fell asleep.
And he never woke.
He was 45.
(poem) I understand some things.
Like how life hurts sometimes every moment and how wearisome it gets always trying to numb ragged feelings.
I don’t know any of his dreams.
I know that he ached inside sometimes and sometimes he sent that anguish outward
 just like a real man.
I know everybody wanted him that green eyed sexy smile somebody.
I know that filled a lot of hours but in the end made nothing better.
(singing) If you ever... change your mind... about leaving me behind... bring it to me bring your sweet loving... bring it all home to me.
Hey, sailor.
There he is once again, ladies and gentleman:
Storme Webber!
[singing]
... like a chain, like a chain...
I’m always intrigued in any form of art with the concept of negative space, the concept of what is around a thing which defines that thing.
So with masculinity it’s the same.
It’s what’s around it.
It’s always the dichotomy.
Moving forward and holding back, being strong and being vulnerable.
And this is what is interesting,
What makes any performance good is... passion.
(singing) ...like a train...
Masculine, I don’t know what masculine means.
That’s the thing.
Yes, what does masculine mean?
What is femenine?
One of my dolls she's matching me today, we're wearing green today.
This beautiful feminine doll.
A spiritual thing of my people, gave her a little bell.
It’s hard. I can’t really define what’s a man and what’s a woman, who's a man and who’s a woman.
And I don’t wanna define it.
I think it’s great to just express it and be what you wanna be and be seen how you wanna be seen.
God have mercy if I ran into my mum right now.
I share you with nobody.
First of all, what do you think makes a good man?
When somebody is just there for you.
One is gonna hold you through the thick and the thin.
Someone who is on your side.
It doesn’t matter for sake.
Somebody is gonna be there for you.
Accept you for who you are, no matter what.
Would you think I was a man or a woman if you saw me walking down the street?
I definitely think you’re a man.
Definitely, definitely.
That’s what I look like.
[incomprehensible]
First she has to become a lady.
And present herself right to other people.
A lot of things make a good woman.
What does make a good man?
- Treating a woman right.
- All right.
If he treats a woman right he’s a good man.
And if he believes in God, too.
We were just talking about that.
God comes first is the only judge.
What makes a good woman and a good man?
The thing for me is not what’s defining that but what’s defining the shifts of mind involved in that.
So whether you‘re defining yourself sexually as female or not, it’s what happens with expectations in people’s minds.
Once I knew you're a woman...
[music]
[song] Are you a boy or a girl?
The moto that I always have said is:
Instead of being an angry woman
I became a funny man.
A drag king is camp.
There’s a whole camp aesthetic.
So there’s parody.
Mo B. Dick as John Sex and his beautiful sidekick Bob.
[music]
Camp is hard to define.
But generally, it has a kind of kitschy element to it, and also a certain amount of foolishness.
Camp is a way to subvert sorrow also.
Diane Torr begat...
Buster Hyman...
Pretty much, yeah.
...and Johnny Science.
I first heard of the drag king workshop when I was in Boston.
And I did the workshop and it changed my life.
I got so high off it.
On the trail with Diane Torr from Zurich to Hamburg to New York, 1997.
I enjoy the experience of being a man.
People would step aside when I walk down the street.
It felt different.
Very different.
I could at last get my share of the seat on the subway.
Even learned to pee in a urinal.
I have these three separate identities: wife, mother and man.
But my husband and children couldn’t embrace my fantasies, and so I had to leave.
I was interested in exploring what it would be like to live as a man.
And find another territory for myself.
There are times when I go out as Danny King or Jack Sprat or Charles Beresford, who’s my gay man, and I really get a vacation from Diane.
You have a lot more credibility as a man... in the world.
It’s just the way it is.
You walk into the room as a man and people immediately pay you attention.
You walk into a room as a woman and they check you out if you’re sexy.
That’s the first thing.
Men and women, and if you’re a certain age, once you’re over 40 or 35, forget it.
Unless you’re particularly elegant looking woman and then people could be curious.
Mum.
What? What?
[music]
That could work.
[music]
Oh my god, I used to gogo dance to this song.
[city noises]
I came to this Aikido Dojo in 1977.
I have a third degree black belt.
Aikido has been a way for me to think about an ungendered situation.
It’s really about energy, redirecting that negative energy into a place where it’s not causing you any  harm.
Thank you.
A lot of Aikido is about being able to extend, not to withdraw.
Once you withdraw it’s over.
You have no more power.
So when I walk,
I have a sense of ownership, a sense of belonging.
So that with each foot that I take, you have a sense that
I could own that piece of floor, for the minute that my foot rests there.
I have this 360 degree boundary around myself.
Something that I learned in Aikido that you need to stand very solidly on the ground, on the earth.
Tony, Eric and Larry, let’s see you occupy the space let’s see how you can own...
 the floor.
You’re a bit of a loss aren’t you?
- As a human being.
- Yeah.
I'm just very like...
It’s all right Larry, you can hide behind that hair.
You have to remember that boys grew up in playgrounds where they always had to defend themselves.
So you need to develop more armour actually in your physicality.
How would this guy protect himself?
Every 3 minutes a woman is being abused in America, something like that.
If you think about that, that’s astronomic.
As a woman I’m really communicating and my gaze is on the edge, is on the surface of my eyeball.
I’m like looking out into the world with a lot of curiosity and a desire to communicate.
As a man, as this man,
I’m a lot more reserved.
I expect the world to come to me.
So I’m much more withdrawn.
- You've got some hair.
- Mhm.
So do you have an idea of who this man could be?
Do you think an Argentinean man for instance?
Cause you’re Argentinean.
Do you think they’re very different from American men?
The way that they behave, their gestures?
Yeah, it will make a difference.
Men in Argentina I think they have a lot of style.
They pay attention to the way they look a lot.
[tango music]
(Spanish) Se cabreó el varoncito.
[tango music continues]
There are many ways to construct a penis.
When you fill it up with cotton wool, then you have your penis.
That’s one way you can do it.
You can imagine the rest.
This is another method that you can use.
I don’t work with dildos necessarily.
We just use this sausage, that’s kinda like the fake penis and it’s really just for packing, for you to have this kind of lump in your pants.
This is something that you can use and when you use it you say
"I’m packing".
- It’s cold I know.
- It's clammy.
It’s clammy but it’s got a nice sticky quality to it.
It looks good. Do that again.
It’s stuck to my pants.
It wants you...
The penis wants you.
It stretches.
The arousing reconstructions.
That was the first time I was in drag.
We also developed this androgynous movement vocabulary.
It was 1981, and nobody was really investigating these ideas in performance.
This is me as the Jean Paul Belmondo character.
Now she only almost exclusively does male characters.
She got a bit more fanatic and hooked into it.
It fits her change in the physique that she had over the years.
She used to be a little boy and now she looks like... a stubby man.
I lived in Amsterdam for a couple of years and that’s where I met the father of Martina, my daughter.
This is during the birth, where I screamed at Marcel:
"You did this! I hate you!
You did this!"
I was so angry.
You have all this extra emotion.
I asked her.
I thought she could never get pregnant.
When she told me three weeks later, she was surprised and I was surprised she was.
It was a bit confusing because
I didn’t know her at all.
So it wasn’t really very planned.
Sorry Tinkiu.
Martina was totally demanding.
It was very easy to be involved with her.
It creates beautiful children, if you’re involved throughout.
He’s been very, very supportive.
He’s a very special, wonderful man and I know that
I will know him all my life.
We’re parents to Martina.
But in terms of our relationship... we’ve reached an impasse.
I went to Manchester in 1996 and I taught a workshop there and that’s where I met Jane.
And Jane became my lover.
I was having this relationship with her in Europe and having this other kind of relationship here, which is as a mother to Martina, and living along side Marcel.
Eventually, these things are very hard to sustain and Jane decided that she couldn’t deal with this anymore.
And I feel heart broken.
Each of the characters
I create are composites.
They’re not just one person.
Like Danny King is a composite of... a number of ghastly men
I’ve seen and known from a young age.
I grew up in Aberdeen in Scotland and I had these uncles who were towering above you and you’re so impressed by them.
They jingle change in their pockets.
And you think:
"Oh my god they’re rich".
But of course it’s just coins.
But you’re 5 or 6 years old and you’re so impressed by all this malebehaviour.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Welcome to the American society of men.
I am here tonight to train you how to gain and retain respect... as a man.
I’m much more controlled.
My shoulders become more rounded and so the breathing is deeper.
Rule number 2:
Stop smiling!
It’s very nice when women smile, it’s very appealing, very unthreatening.
Makes them very friendly.
But when a man smiles that could be conceived as a conceding ground.
Allowing you a possibility to be exploited.
Rule number 3:
Stop apologizing!
Cause as a man in a man’s world you are right.
And even if you’re not.
Who goes around saying
"I’m sorry!" all the time?
As women it’s like we’re open for access 24 hours a day.
People have to like us.
That’s like the ruling thing in our psyches.
What does it mean to be a woman?
What kind of a woman am I?
I want you... to like me.
I want you... to hold me.
I want you... to fulfil my dreams.
[sound of kisses]
I want... to be part... of you.
I created this character who starts off being someone who pleases everybody but then have her transform.
I don’t particularly like Danny King.
It’s more dealing with a reality of how most men are.
It is a kind of a parody but people have told me that he’s real.
And I know he is, unfortunately.
What I’m saying is that if I can do this, from this female who’s like the woman who lives next door, and I can become this man who’s Mr Macho, then anybody can do it.
And if that’s the case then so much for masculinity being sacred.
We can have a penis any time we want, any size and any shape or form.
I actually think that it’s men who have penis envy of other men.
A particular favourite of the housewives, the women who stay at home and all they have for company is their dishwasher, their vacuum cleaner and I call this one vacuum gigantum.
You can think of them as props, not necessarily as phalluses.
I don’t think there’s anything wrong with something looking like a phallus anyway.
Because who is the person who’s handling it.
You don’t need to have a man attached to it.
It’s just there, it’s available, why not use it.
And you wanna maintain the impregnability at all costs.
Keep your movements... minimal, guarded, repetitive.
I would always use my father as an image of like my male in my life.
And he is so gentle and kind and he’s really sweet.
He’s so different from Danny King.
I’d always say to her:
"Mum, you’re totally stereotyping.
I don’t want the whole world to think that you think this is the only type of guy or this is the real kind of guy".
A pleasure,
My name is Jack Sprat.
It’s really great to see you all here tonight to come see me perform.
I know it’s a lot of other people but it’s really nice you can see me perform.
[music and singing]
I know I’m somebody who has been doing this a long time.
So obviously I have a certain amount of authority.
I know they think of me as a daddy drag king.
[harmonica playing]
It’s much easier to be a powerful woman behind the mask of a man.
And it's much more socially acceptable to express anger when you’re a man, and the aggressive behaviour as a man.
As a woman people go:
"Ah bitch!
What’s the matter with you?"
That’s exactly true because
I was always punished in a female form because I was too aggressive.
Now I have permission.
People just see me.
I don’t perceive myself as a man, nor as a woman for that matter but people perceive me as a man.
I can be invisible as a man, whereas for some reason as a female I never was.
No, it really is a subliminal absence of hostility.
Men relate to me as a man and they are not guarding themselves.
Men look after men,
I’m telling you.
See how that works.
You want me to look right into the lens?
Yeah. Let's rehearse that.
Give me that look.
Yeah that’s it.
There was so much great discussion last night.
I felt like I wanted to talk more.
Should I try the other side?
What happened was,
I was doing drag so much like 4 and 5 times a night.
And people always were: oh Mo. B. Dick, Mo. B. Dick.
And then Mo Fisher’s getting lost.
I felt my inner man overtook my inner woman.
As a result I lost sight of my female self.
(singing) Are you a boy or a girl?
What I did was, it’s difficult to explain, but so it’s like I said: that is my male side, now what’s my female side?
I became confused and I said:
"Wait a minute.
I am a very aggressive woman and I will remain an aggressive woman."
What is interesting is that they say, spiritually your left side is your female side and your right side is your male side.
And I’m reversed in the outfit.
[jiggling]
That's it. I have to change film.
That’s interesting because... it was my left side that overdeveloped as female in the chest and my right breast didn’t develop at all.
These are photographs of Mo that I took in New York.
When Mo was wearing the fabulous half man, half woman costume.
[water dripping]
I think gender is performance and I think gender is more than performance.
I think that people subconsciously perform whatever gender role they’ve been assigned, but people might subvert that.
Generally people conform, generally men don’t go around wearing make up and dresses and generally women don’t go around... scratching their balls.
We don’t as individuals reinvent the meaning of gender.
Each person individually, one person at a time.
We come into genders that have already been constructed for us. within political, economic, social, cultural contexts.
So what we do when we’re in a gender is perform an already socially constructed script.
A medically accepted clitoris is between 0 and 1 cm, and a medically acceptable penis has to be between 2,5 and 4,5 cm.
If you fall in between the 1 and the 2,5, they usually cut it off because they deem it would be very very bad for a man to have a penis that was too small or for a woman to have a clitoris that was too large.
So generally they just whack it off and give no thought to the sexual pleasure of the child when they become an adult.
They still do that?
Yeah, they still do that.
In my everyday life
I’m probably perceived as a man.
It's fine for people to perceive me as a man.
Photo exhibition for
The Drag King book premiere by Del LaGrace Volcano
That doesn’t mean that’s how I perceive myself.
I perceive myself in the same way that I always have, which is something that is a combination of both.
Sometimes maybe more female than male, sometimes maybe more male than female.
I know five men personally that also have vaginas,
I know lots of men that also have breasts.
And I know lots of women who have beards.
Accompanying
Del LaGrace to a Drag King performance in Cologne, 1997.
Being a drag king for me was a way to begin this journey.
But it isn’t necessarily.
It’s not like you go:
I’m gonna be a cross-dresser, then I become a drag king then I become a transsexual.
No. No. No.
That’s what people are afraid of and for maybe some of us, yes.
Meine Damen-Herren,
Herren-Damen.
Ich bin Herr Doctor Delman.
Now most of you here are what I call monogendered, some are bigendered, and some are omnigendered.
Myself I’m transgendered.
This is me with my family.
Can you show a little bit of your stomach?
When I was born I was assigned to the female gender.
My first conscious realisation that I didn’t quite fit as a girl came when I was about 5 years old.
I never behaved appropriate for a female.
But I really didn’t see myself as anything other than a girl until puberty.
I always thought I was ugly.
This was...
This one here
 was me right before
I had my hair cut.
I guess I was about 22 there.
I have a silicon implant that I never wanted.
I too always wanted a flat chest.
Being female is what I construct.
Naturally if you have a default, my default is masculine.
Being a drag king, once
I was  performing as a man that did not feel as a performance, that just felt pretty natural.
It wasn't as much fun and it still isn't.
I still far prefer to be a drag queen than a drag king.
Right now I'm in the process of trying to get my gender amended on my American passport to ‘O’ designation.
They have male, female and since the beginning of this year in the software you can be ‘O’ for other or it could change to ‘I’ for intersex.
Right now on my passport it says female.
I had to pluck my beard out every morning from late teenagehood.
And it was so cute, the natural one was just these two little horns coming out of the side of the chin.
And some moustache as well.
Basically she told me:
"If you don't stop plucking your eyebrows,
I don't think I'm gonna be able to go out with you.
I couldn't stand it.
It was like such a relief.
I didn't have to pluck my eyebrows,
I didn't have to wear make up or skirts.
I didn't have to perform as a female anymore.
I came to get my prescription.
I do testosterone injections.
It's a deep muscle injection.
-... for the other two.
- Tomorrow.
Give it to me, give it to me.
Your voice lowers, your period stops, fat redistribution, clitoral enlargement.
They say those are irreversible.
We don't know what the long-term consequences are of a female born person taking male hormones over a long period of time.
You have to bear in mind that there could be health risks that you're not aware of or that haven't been recognized yet.
Finding Simo for me was so amazing because she was the first woman
I had been with who had a really positive, healthy attitude towards men.
She wasn't anti men at all and we were both attracted to the masculinity of each other.
We've been together and not together for about 6 years.
I said: "Would you like to come home with me tonight or would you like to wait for a proper date?"
And I was very impressed by that.
I've never been asked that way before.
It has always been:
"Would you like to come home with me tonight?" or something like that.
Never giving me a choice like that.
I was so impressed that...
You said: "Can I think about it?".
I did say:
"I have to think about it first".
I think our relationship is really a lot in some ways like some successful gay male relationship.
They're together, they're devoted.
Yet they know that after a while the sex with only one person gets boring.
And I'm not threatened by Simo going and having sex with other people.
I totally understand that.
I would like to have still a more masculine body.
I'm waiting for a chest operation and I think that once I have that
I'll feel much better in my body.
I feel that I'm less aggressive now than I was before
I started using testosterone, because I no longer have to be as aggressive to get what I want.
Because people perceive me as a man, they're more likely to give me what I want without a fight.
It was only when people started seeing me as a guy that I realized how much of a man's world it really is.
Because, I am treated with more respect.
It's amazing how friends of mine, who I'm sure are not aware of it, but that have known me before and know me now, just because it's like women are trained and totally socialised to look after men.
And I'm telling you it's so amazing how they do it.
And men talk to each other different than they talk to women.
We all know these things, but actually experiencing it can be really sad.
It can be really really sad to see how great the sex war is between men and women.
How much fear and anger and hostility there really is.
The one thing that I have lost is...
I can't indiscriminately flirt with anybody.
I used to flirt with people, mainly to get a discount.
And I would flirt even as an obvious dyke,
I would flirt with straight guys and I would usually get a discount, just by being funny or flirtatious.
If a man looks too long at a man, he's probably gay or trying to pick that guy up.
So that's what happened to me in Austria.
I was just looking at this guy thinking how beautiful he was... for too long.
And he came up with his fist saying:
"What the fuck are you looking at me for, faggot?"
I said: "Excuse me,
I thought you were gay."
And then I really got in trouble, but never mind.
I've always been since I was 16 open to all sexual possibilities.
I wouldn't say I'm a Casanova, but I have had a lot of sexual adventures.
The film is called Pansexual Public Porn, also known as
The adventures of Hans and Del
Pansexual is how
I describe my sexuality and how Hans describes his sexuality, in that we don't discriminate on the basis of gender.
We don't choose our sexual relationships depending on if they're male, female or other.
Usually this is called bisexuality, but to me to say bisexual reinforces the binary idea that there is only male and female.
We had planned to do something like that together for ages.
I was just being a model which was great.
It was just getting stoned and... having sex with these people in the woods.
It's very difficult for each one of us to understand that other people have such a different life.
That seeing a film like
Pansexual Public Porn is very strange for them.
But to me this is actually my everyday life.
To experiment, to have different projects.
That summer the project was to see if we could have gay men having sex with us.
And it was very very exciting.
Because we didn't know if we would be accepted or rejected, and mostly we were accepted, which was really cool.
[background music]
You can't look at this with your perfectionist eye for now.
Ok.
I'm really changing everyday so much that the moment you tell someone
"this is how it is, this is how it was before", the next day that's not true... so you fictionalise all the time.
I've lived as a so-called woman for 40 years so if I'm lucky and I live until 80,
I can live the rest of my life as a man.
It’s a balancing act.
In these times I don't go out a lot to have sex, because I'm painting now.
I'm so into the painting.
I'm more interested in general about transformation.
How can we learn to have a non-discriminatory mind, or how can we learn to use our discriminatory mind for practical things, but not to judge people or to judge ourselves.
Whatever I am, I am.
I try to be as much myself as I can, negotiate with life and with other people so that's possible, to live as lively as possible.
[laughing]
With all the flaws that one has... and the cruelties and... difficulties.
I wouldn't describe it as a dream coming true.
In a way it's living the reality.
It's living a reality of more completeness.
[bar noises]
[peeing sound]
If I always had to use the cubical,
I'd often have to wait a long time and hang out in the main men's toilet while everyone else is using the urinal and that can be a bit weird.
But because I have my prosthesis then I just get on with it.
They're not as clean as the female toilets, generally speaking.
It's a prosthesis and it's actually a device for people with female genitals to piss standing up.
So it's a sort of a funnel and it's called a pisser-packer because it's nice and soft silicon so you can actually put it in your underpants and keep it there for when you need to go.
Just start the game.
I think it's Orlan who says
"My body is my software".
I would say that mine is actually my hardware.
It is like a complete reprogramming.
I'm a sculptor so I'm used to transforming matter but of course my own human body is another matter, entirely.
I have a cyborg identity.
I will consider myself a cyborg but as I am a human being...
I mean there are so many plurals of identity.
A cyborg is somebody who's... using that sort of the consciousness of machines and prosthetics, using machines as a prosthetic as well.
Just their identity isn't confined to their own human body.
It's something to do with a broader consciousness of the self.
Am I just a cyborg when I'm  online?
If I'm gardening, am I a cyborg?
Would you do a phalloplastic?
If you would have a functioning cock.
What would you do with your cunt?
Oh, I'd leave the cunt. Definitely.
I don't know what
I'd do with my breasts though.
No, I know.
I would change them a little bit.
I would become a hermaphrodite.
You can actually grow from a cell of your body, you can grow a dick.
Maybe not nowadays, but soon, very soon.
Yeah. I mean I don't know.
I always wanted the genitals
I have now, so I'm quite happy.
You're quite happy.
I think it would be wrong to assume that it's like a group of people all shooting up testosterone together.
That's a kind of... tabloid fear mongering way of putting it, because we all did come to our individual decisions.
And we all were going through the experience alone.
[chattering]
Somehow we are a bit of family in that sense, an alternative family.
People who are around if you really have a problem, you know you can call them.
[chattering]
Happy birthday to me and everybody else.
[eastern music]
I had a dream about me in a sari.
[eastern music]
In a sari it’s good to have a bit of flesh.
Right, that's considered sexy.
I've always wanted a sari and I like to do female drag so I thought I'd work on a few different outfits.
If you don't mind, if you're patient with me,
I'm gonna try and see if I can remember what you told me and you're helping me.
Just put it on heavy.
Pour it on, be a bit exaggerated.
You're being a bit too subtle, give it to me.
I'm relying on your skill.
[laughing]
I'm putting more eyeliner on.
I'll do the mascara, ok?
It'll be quicker.
Hey, you look cute.
So do you.
I thought you didn't like me as a girl.
Well, I do.
Ok.
For a change.
Turn.
Turn.
Put your arms up.
Brixton, doesn't that hurt?
Yes, it hurts, that's why I didn't wanna do it... today.
It does hurt.
Ok now.
Do you need any help?
That looks good.
It looks good.
Yeah. Check out these muscles.
(shouting) It's coming.
We're never gonna get it.
Yes, we will. Come on.
[underground noise]
Look. No fingernail polish.
Happy Birthday!
What are you doing?
Just checking.
Don't mess up my make up.
I'll keep my eyes closed.
- Keep your eyes closed. Ok?
- Yes, ok.
Keep your eyes closed.
What's going oooooooon?
Make a wish, make a wish!
[clapping]
(someone) Yeah!!
Everybody did it.
[music]
Yeeha!
[breaking waves]
The reason I became a photographer is I never ever saw my world, my reality reflected in an accurate and beautiful way.
This picture is a wider shot.
This was the centre piece of the grid of nine and it's called Hermaphrodite torso.
When I take a picture of someone it's almost as if they become part of me.
I don't consider that
I have a clitoris anymore.
I call it a 'dick clit'.
A cross between a dick and a clit.
So it is a 'dick clit', because it is small.
But that is exactly what I wanted.
Women were raised to feel ashamed of their bodies.
Particularly, their genitals.
Women don't have a lot of pride in their genitals.
Probably because of the way in which they have been portrayed in pornography, in very invasive, intrusive, ugly ways.
So I wanted to make my genitals and other people's genitals look good.
This is another one...
I think some people might think that it's quite shocking.
I find them really stunningly beautiful.
But I'm the first to admit
I'm out of touch with what the person on the street might think or feel.
I'm not so worried about what people think of me and because I'm surrounded by people that I respect and admire who I hope respect and admire me,
I'm really... that birthday thing.
I'm gonna start crying again, cause the birthday thing was just...
Having felt so unpopular in junior high school.
And feeling like people really didn't like me and then to have all my friends get me that beautiful bicycle.
It just made me feel so good and so loved.
I'm really, really lucky to have that.
Anyway.
Mo B. Dick: Tonight is a legendary night.
Not all these drag kings have been on the same stage all at once,
This fellow came all the way from London.
All right. Yeah, ok.
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm round of applause for Del LaGrace Volcano.
[music]
I like myself and having come from really hating myself and having a really bad self-image, it's important to me now to have a good self-image and I guess in a way to show people that you can make that transition.
[music]
Be what you gotta be, be who you wanna be, you can't let what people are gonna say, what people are gonna think about you, get in the way, you just gotta live it.
[music]
[cheering]
Ladies and gentlemen:
Dréd and Luscious.
Luscious get out here.
Hooooooly shit.
Oh my god, Luscious and Dréd.
Oh shit!
[music]
[Song]
["This is a Man's Man's Man's World"]
[big cheering]
[lyrics: This is a man's world...]
[...but it would be nothing...]
[...without a woman.]
[clapping]
Drag kingdom has come.
Can I hear an amen?
Reverend Jimmy Johnson,
I'm a heterosexual and I wanna be a part of your drag kingdom, and what do you think I say?
I say amen to heterosexuals,
I say amen to homosexuals,
I say amen to bisexuals,
I say amen to transsexuals.
I say amen to anybody's sexual.
[cheering and clapping]

We weren't looking at this as some kind of future.
There was no promise in it.
There was no nothing in it.
People were really living in the moment.
There were no goals.
There were no aspirations.
It started here, in this area.
That's where it all started.
You know? That was the beginning of the revolution.
♪ Something is forever ♪

We were all punk kids, man. We were tough kids.
And we wanted to be something.
It turned into, like, a rock star thing, you know?
♪ We got freedom comin' our way ♪
We were treated like kings at places that we went to.
I was on summer vacation for about 20 years.
It was cool to be in the magazines and stuff, but, you know, the bottom line was all we wanted to do was skate.
Craig understood that, like, children took the ruins of the
20th century and made art out of it.
I was, like, 12 years old and
I'm reading these articles, and you don't know where your place is in the world yet.
And you read these words and the things that he had to say and the way he said them and the photographs that accompanied them and it was like,
"Wow, I'm really a part of something incredible, something important."
In 1975, the second issue of the recently reincarnated
SkateBoarder magazine would feature
"Aspects of the Downhill Slide," the first of what would become known throughout the skateboarding world as the "Dogtown" articles.
These feature articles chronicled the adventures and exploits of Dogtown's Z-Boys.
They were the badasses. I mean, they were the freaks of the sport.
There was a scary thing about it, like, "These guys will kick your ass."
They didn't seem like they were a part of the rest of skateboarding.
It seemed like they had their own thing going on.
The Dogtown articles were the brainchild of 26-year-old artist and photojournalist Craig Stecyk.
Using a handful of pseudonyms,
Stecyk would conceive, write, photograph and design the aesthetic that would come to define the Dogtown movement.
When we saw you guys in the magazines, it was, like,
"This is full-on. They're living this."
No one skateboarded, no one rode a board, no one was as aggressive or as radical as they ever were.
The Zephyr team had guys with all different styles, and, really, it sparked a revolution.
I think the Zephyr team was straight-out the most influential skateboard team ever, ever to be assembled.
The Zephyr Skateboard Team was comprised of 12 individuals from an area in West Los
Angeles known as Dogtown.
They were Shogo Kubo, Bob Biniak,
Nathan Pratt, Stacy Peralta,
Jim Muir, Allen Sarlo,
Chris Cahill, Tony Alva,
Paul Constantineau, Jay Adams,
Peggy Oki and Wentzle Ruml.
<b>DOGTOWN and Z-BOYS</b>
<b>NARRATED BY
SEAN PENN</b>
There is a place where
America's manifest destiny collides into the Pacific Ocean.
A place where the fabled Route 66, the roadway of American dreams, terminates.
This is Dogtown.
There's an invisible line of demarcation from the north side of Santa Monica to the south side of Santa Monica.
You're looking at one side of town that had trophy houses and lots of money.
And you're looking at the south side that wasn't like that geographically.
It was actually a visible financial line, where, if you lived above
Wilshire, you had money, and, if you lived below
Wilshire, you wanted their money.
Dogtown was a territory encompassing the three beach communities of South Santa Monica,
Venice and Ocean Park.
This was the last great seaside slum.
This was not the beach that people came to vacation at.
It was Dogtown, and Dogtown was a place where you had to have eyes in the back of your head.
It was dirty. It was filthy. It was paradise.
Dogtown was a faded blip on the radar screen of popular surfing, a rundown coastal resort inhabited by surfers infamous for their aggressive localism and outcast behavior.
Surfing in 1972 or 1971 was outcast, period.
Surfing was antisocial, generally speaking, in the world of things.
It wasn't the thing you did to build your self-esteem in society.
It was like... If you were a surfer, it was like saying you were a dropout.
It was not necessarily like it is today, where you've got Kelly Slater making millions of dollars.
In 1972, 23-year-old surfboard shaper Jeff Ho,
24-year-old surfboard builder Skip Engblom and 21-year-old artist Craig
Stecyk joined together to form
Jeff Ho and Zephyr
Surfboard Productions.
In reaction to what they felt to be the mundane world of commercial surfing, the three scraped together what little cash they had and set up shop on the corner of Bay and Main
Streets in the heart of Dogtown.
They were dedicated to being anti-mainstream, and they were proud to be anti-mainstream.
I think that we probably started it because there was nobody else building surfboards of a certain type that we kind of envisioned could be built.
They were a specialist surf shop.
If you wanted the most high-performance surfboard, this was the shop to come to.
It wasn't like you were going into a standard surf shop by any stretch of the imagination.
There was other surf shops, but they didn't have the "bad boy" image as it came out of the whole P.O.P. culture.
They created a whole new identity, a totally separate, unique identity in terms of the kind of surfboards that they made, the color of the boards, the way they were shaped, what Jeff Ho was doing was kind of revolutionary at the time.
He was exploring all kinds of design concepts.
Jeff Ho was the most intense person I've ever worked for in any business environment my whole life.
Jeff was a madman.
I mean, Jeff would lose it.
He'd lose his temper.
He could just erupt on a moment's notice and put you through just the ultimate Chinese water torture on any little thing.
Jeff Ho was recognized throughout the coastal region as an eccentric surfboard shaper who pushed the boundaries of conventional surfboard design.
The boards that were coming out of the
Jeff Ho Shop were a different design.
Constantly, Jeff would shape something, develop it, try it, and then go on to the next level.
I mean, he was, like, a guy that was like Howard Hughes.
I mean, he'd make something and actually fly it.
He was making it, and he was surfing it.
So, he was exploring it as an engineer and a designer, and also actually riding it.
We just wanted to create something that was different than the other boards.
I was trying to develop something that was new, unique and different.
Inspired by the wall art tradition of local gangs and the vivid colors of the area's vibrant car culture,
Craig Stecyk airbrushed the Zephyr surfboards with a look reminiscent of Dogtown's culturally mixed neighborhoods.
It was to personalize stuff for the user, to make something that wasn't a mass-media, garbage, piece of junk that had been designed in some factory for everybody else.
Because we came from a little bit different environment.
It was graffiti art. It was full-blown, you know, urban graffiti art on surfboards.
It was very much an identification of an environment, like where we live.
"This is who we are."
Our history is based on lowriders and hot rods and Latinas.
Like, I'd fantasize about chicks with huge hair and lowriders.
You know what I'm saying? Like, you know, little blond girls named Buffy just weren't my scene.
So, therefore, that wasn't what we were at.
The average surf look at the time, the aesthetic of surfing, was very clean, very powder blue, very beige, you know, rainbows and sunsets and sandy beaches kind of a look.
What we were doing was
"the debris meets the sea."
Using the shop as their front, Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom formed the Zephyr surf team, a group made up of the best surfers in the Dogtown area.
We were in the midst of rebar and concrete, airbrush saying, "Go home."
It was a statement saying,
"Nothing's gonna stop us,
"and we're gonna do whatever the heck we want.
"And screw you if you don't like it. We don't care."
And that was the attitude, and that was the attitude in the water,
"We're here and look at us.
If you don't like it, split."
We weren't really surfers in a traditional sense.
You know, we're from Venice.
♪ Freedom fighters sent out to the sun ♪
♪ Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution. ♪
♪ Leave the earth to all its sin and hate ♪
♪ Find another world where freedom waits. ♪
One mile south of the Zephyr shop, lying directly on the border of Venice and Santa Monica, was Dogtown's epicenter, the Pacific Ocean Park pier.
Around the turn of the century, visionary land developer Abbot Kinney set out to create a
European-like community, geared towards art, culture and amusement.
Kinney's dream would become Venice,
California, replete with canals, gondolas, and a full-scale replica of the colonnaded square of its Italian inspiration.
The coastal zone that ran from Venice through Ocean Park and Santa Monica became the home to so many amusement park piers that it earned the reputation as the Coney Island of the West.
Eventually, only Pacific Ocean
Park, known to the locals as P.O.P., an amusement park atop the old Lick Pier, remained.
They had this park with all this celebration of humanity and people having a good time, and they're free, and they're out in the ocean and, you know, the ocean breeze.
And then, all of a sudden, it turns into the worst nightmare you've ever imagined.
The party ended in the mid-'60s.
The beachfront expanse running from Venice through Santa Monica had become run-down and seedy.
Attendance at the once-magnificent
Pacific Ocean Park plummeted, and in 1967 it closed, and soon thereafter became a no man's land.
A place where pyromaniacs, junkies, artists and surfers could excel in symbiotic disharmony.
It was kind of like the circus had left town. It was a little scary for some people.
It was like this dead Wonderland.
I mean, you know, you've got this carcass of all these rides that are rusted and falling apart.
And it's like, you can hear the voices and the ghosts of the people that were having so much fun there, and kids like me that were making out in the sky balls that were going across at 13, you know.
It's like everything that was wonderful and fantastic suddenly has gone to death in this decrepit way.
And everybody had to live with that every day.
Burrowed deep within the derelict pier and shielded from view was the cove, a secret surfing spot wedged between a jail cell of broken and decayed pilings.
This was the most dangerous place I surfed in California. There's no question.
You're taking off basically in front of piers. You're riding through piers.
There's wood floating around. There's debris.
You could get impaled on, like, a fallen roller coaster track or, like, a piling.
You knew if you made a mistake that you were gonna pay in flesh.
I mean, you could easily hit your head underwater, go unconscious and drown.
There was one piling in the beginning that had fallen, called the angle piling, which you could go through it.
That was a tricky thing to do.
It was one takeoff spot, and you had to be an aggressive,
"This is my wave. I'm going. Don't cut me off," because, if you did get cut off, you were in the pilings, you broke your surfboard in half.
I'd never seen that many surfboards break in my life.
♪ Oh no, there goes Tokyo go go Godzilla ♪
Adorning the ruins surrounding the cove were spray-painted signs, warning intruders to keep out.
<b>POSITIVELY
NO VISITORS</b>
You didn't go near that place if you didn't live there or know the people, because you were gonna get hurt.
That was an extremely heavy local spot.
There was a lot of fights.
You know, people would just physically stop you and say, "You can't surf here."
It wasn't that we didn't want other people to surf the place, but just that other people would come in and do stupid things to jeopardize your life.
There's limited resources here, man.
There's 10 waves every 15 minutes, and there ain't enough for you, pal.
You had to earn your rights of passage on the land by your actions on the land and in the water.
You had to go up on the pier with a wrist rocket, hang out and shoot Vals that came out there, you know.
We would just fly things at people that we didn't know.
They saw guys that came to the pier that weren't from the area, they threw down pieces of concrete on them.
We'd start firing tiles at them.
All kinds of shit, you know?
People'd throw glass, rocks, whatever you could get your hands on.
It was really kind of neat because the water all around was, like, exploding, as shit was flying at them.
If they didn't want anybody else surfing there, nobody was going to surf there.
That's all there was to it.
Best thing I ever saw was someone paddle out in the water with the guy's carburetor on top of his surfboard.
And goes, "Hey, does this belong to you?" And dropped it in the water.
You weren't just gonna drive up, pull your car up and go,
"Wow, what a nice left. Look, the T's breaking. Let's go out."
You had to earn your way into that, man.
Working their way up through the rubble and rebar of P.O.P. was Dogtown's next generation, a group of aggressive young surfers who were all eager to make their mark in hopes of becoming part of the Zephyr team.
It's almost like a Mafia, you know? You get good enough surfing in the water, and, all of a sudden, you're a made man now.
And once you got on the
Zephyr team, you had entrée.
You're part of their group.
The Zephyr Team
Getting sponsored by the Zephyr team as a kid was nirvana.
It was, like, "Yeah, man!
"They like my moves. They like my...
I'm doing it. I can do it. I'm doing it."
If you were wearing the navy blue Zephyr shirt, you were the shit in the neighborhood.
When we were out here, it was reflecting more the hardcore urban side of the fence.
You know, the Zephyr crew was more street kids.
Most of us came from broken homes, living with our mothers.
Jeff and Skip were like the parent symbol in the equation.
Skip and Jeff really nurtured the kind of discarded kids that wouldn't have had a place to go.
♪ Gimme danger, little stranger ♪
♪ And I'll give you a piece ♪
The shop provided identity.
It was more like a place where you can go and hang out and be in the Bay Street environment.
It was much more like a clubhouse.
Everybody, like, had a little job.
You had to either fix dings or sweep the floor or, you know, roll joints for Jeff in the back.
You also knew that behind that door, there was stuff going on that no one talked about.
It was lowbrow and wild and "screw you."
♪ There's nothing in my dreams ♪
♪ Just some ugly memories ♪
♪ Kiss me like the ocean breeze ♪
I think there was a lot of family dysfunctionalism going on, and I think some of that came out aggressively in their surfing and in their skating.
The Zephyr team, in a weird way, because of the financial insecurity of the area, people looked at this and went,
"Man, I got to make it now."
We were all hungry for recognition.
So we all put out maximum effort.
We all... That's all we did.
It was a performance-based environment.
It was a very, very demanding group of people because they knew what performance was.
If you didn't come out and really perform,
I remember Jeff just, like, leaving.
We worked. We... worked.
You know, creating new moves, new this, new that.
Everybody brought something to the team.
Everybody did something different.
Everybody had a different style.
And that's what the whole thing was all about.
The aggressive performance ethic infused into these young skaters by Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom would eventually result in the undoing of the entire Zephyr organization.
<b>A BRIEF HISTORY</b>
<b>NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES
NO FIRES</b>
In the late '50s, skateboarding became the popular after-surfing activity of the Malibu beach crowd.
Early on, skateboards took their shape in the form of small surfboards, and the maneuvers performed on the boards were strictly surfing-inspired.
♪ Grab your board and go sidewalk surfin' with me ♪
♪ Don't be afraid to try the newest sport around ♪
Then, beginning in 1963, skateboarding began to emerge as an alternative sport for American teenagers.
California manufacturers, such as Makaha, Hobie and Jack's, began forming teams as skateboard competitions began springing up.
Many of skateboarding's early champions, skateboarders such as Danny
Bearer, Torger Johnson,
John Fries, Woody Woodward,
Bruce Logan, and the Hilton brothers, Davie and Stevie, were among the first to give the sport a stylistic aesthetic.
For a brief, fleeting period, skateboarding gained national popularity, but this popularity would be short-lived.
<b>Few Youths Entering
Skateboard Contests</b>
Skateboarding crashed in 1965.
Virtually overnight, the young sport disappeared.
Back then, if you skateboarded, the first thing that came out of someone's mouth is,
"Isn't that just like the Yo-Yo? Isn't that the same thing as a Hula Hoop?"
By the early '70s, skateboarding was viewed as just another passing kiddie fad, and only the most hardcore enthusiasts practiced it as it became nearly impossible to purchase a commercial skateboard.
If you wanted a skateboard back then, you had to go to the thrift store, buy a pair of roller skates with clay wheels, cut them in half...
Then, go out in your garage and try and find an old drawer out of a dresser that was a nice, half-inch or three-quarter-inch oak, if you were lucky.
Or go down to the hardware store, and we'd buy, like, a solid piece of oak or maple or whatever.
Borrow a Skilsaw or band saw...
Make it like a surfboard shape, you know?
And whip it out.
We used to go to Sears, like the sporting goods section of Sears, and we'd go in with tools with just our deck that we made custom, and we'd put all the new parts from the stock boards on the shelf.
- Right.
- One guy would be watching.
Two guys would be just taking all the parts.
And then we'd just cruise out of there.
Boards were equipped with clay wheels, the pinnacle of Stone Age technology.
You had to worry about hitting rocks, sliding out.
Any crack in the sidewalk is a hazard to your health.
Or a pebble... You hit a pebble, and the wheel would instantly lock up.
Your board would come to a screeching halt and you'd fly and you'd smash cement.
In 1972, East Coast surfer Frank
Nasworthy came upon a great notion, that the petroleum-based product urethane might make a good substitute for clay.
So, he created Cadillac Wheels, which would pave the way for the coming skateboard revolution.
These urethane wheels would just...
It was almost like a 4-wheel drive now, where the car would just grab the ground.
And you could really, really make hard turns.
It was the whole beginning of what skateboarding is today, period.
<b>STYLE</b>
We were just getting into surfing then, and you could only surf in the morning around here because it blows out, the wind blows out the waves around 10:00.
So, you have the rest of the day to do something, so we skateboarded.
We used to skateboard at this place called Bicknell Hill.
I mean, it ran right down the street from the Zephyr surf shop.
We started skating outside the shop at first, 'cause we were all surf rats and we were hanging around the shop, and then they decided to put this team together and we all started skating on Bicknell Hill there.
And we were trying to get real low and, you know, we would, like, be looking at the surf and riding this hill and dropping in and sliding and doing cutbacks, like we were riding a wave.
We'd work on our Berts, and then we'd set up cones and do our slaloms.
And, you know, it was really fun practicing on Bicknell together.
♪ Wake up Maggie
I think I got something to say to you ♪
♪ It's late September and I really should be back at school ♪
♪ I know I keep you amused but I feel I'm being used ♪
♪ Oh Maggie
I couldn't have tried any more ♪
Surfing had everything to do with everything, and skating just kind of went along after, when the waves weren't good.
That's when you skated.
Surfing was it, and skateboarding was just an extension of our surfing.
I remember being in the
Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, watching Hal Jepsen's surf film, Super Session.
And a young Hawaiian surfer named
Larry Bertlemann came on the...
Larry Bertlemann was the fundamental impact on the Z-Boys thing.
The Z-Boys thing was,
"Larry Bertlemann on concrete."
That's what we were all trying to do, because Larry Bertlemann just blew doors on everybody.
He, like, put his hands on the wave.
He was one of the first guys that I remember doing that.
So we started copying that on the ground.
Larry Bertlemann exploded the status quo of surfing upright and redefined the idea of what could be done on a surfboard.
When I saw Larry Bertlemann in a movie do a cutback, I wanted to copy that more than anything in life itself on a skateboard.
If I couldn't do it in the water, I'll do it on a skateboard.
We were surfers, first and foremost.
And the low, pivotal style in surfing is really functional.
It also has a beautiful aesthetic.
We used to call them, "Do a 'Bert."'
And we'd do that on the banks.
Even on the flat ground, we'd do it.
Five miles northeast of the Zephyr shop, located in the elite neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, was Paul Revere Junior High School.
Three miles east of Paul Revere Junior
High was Kenter Canyon Elementary School.
Four miles east of Kenter was
Bellagio Elementary School.
Three miles south of Bellagio was Brentwood Elementary.
And four miles further south of
Brentwood was Mar Vista Elementary.
These five schools were built at the base of steep hillsides or burrowed within deep canyons, with walls of banked asphalt constructed to level out the sprawling playgrounds.
I think skaters were significant because they actually took those environments and they reworked them and made them into something different, that was more human, I think, than what the architects originally had planned.
<b>SKATEBOARD RIDING
IS PROHIBITED</b>
That was where it started for us.
That was like our original skate park.
We would just ride bikes there, with our skates on our handlebars.
Skate all day and break our boards, and then ride back, fix our boards and come back the next day.
These perfectly-tapered waves of black asphalt would allow for the virtual transmission of surfing-born maneuvers to concrete.
We were surfing these asphalt waves.
That's what we were doing with the skating. So we had a surf-skate style because we had the waves to ride it on.
We were, like, riding really hard and low and really doing a lot of sliding, and, like, thrusting kind of moves.
We were always touching the pavement.
It was all about feeling what you're doing.
Feeling your wheels grinding and pivoting around your hands.
I just wanted to ride more banks, go faster, do better turns.
We were totally emulating all of these surfers that we idolized, on skateboards.
Instilled within all the Dogtown skaters was a devotion to style.
Going big worked only as long as you looked good doing it.
You could get all the maneuvers, but having great style was what you were really shooting for.
Style was, like, the most important thing.
Style was everything.
♪ Watching him dash away, ♪
♪ swinging an old bouquet
- dead roses ♪
♪ Sake and strange divine ♪
♪ you'll make it ♪
I think that was one thing that really bound us all together, too, was that we all possessed a surf style.
There was no one in our group that wasn't fluent.
Individual style was who you are as an individual.
Whatever flair that you were throwing in, that's just an extension of you as your personality.
And everybody's personality is different, so everybody's style was different.
There were surfers with good style, and there were surfers that we would call
"cockroach style," or no style, you know.
And if you had a bad style, right there you had one mark against you.
'Cause you had to look at it. You had to watch someone.
If they were skating with a funky style, they were stinking up the area. You know?
So, after a while,
"Hey, you can't watch that guy.
"He smells." You know?
I mean, the blues are three chords, but every guy that plays the blues plays the blues differently, because that's their own style, right?
♪ The over- indulgent machines were their children ♪
♪ There wasn't a way down on earth here to cool 'em ♪
♪ 'Cause they looked just like humans at Kresges and Woolworth ♪
♪ "Generation Landslide close the gap between 'em" ♪
♪ And I laugh to myself every man and the ladies ♪
♪ Who never conceived of those billions dollar babies ♪
We weren't making money off of it, we didn't think there was any future in it, and we were doing it because we loved doing it.
<b>THE BIRTH
OF VERTICAL</b>
"Skaters by their very nature are urban guerillas: they make everyday use of the useless artifacts of the technological burden, and employ the handiwork of the government/corporate structure in a thousand ways that the original architects could never dream of." - Craig Stecyk, 1976
In the '70s, California experienced the worst drought on record, and the city government wouldn't allow you to water your lawn.
You weren't even allowed to serve water at a restaurant.
And so, what happened is, all these swimming pools, which are abundant in Southern
California, were drying up.
California's drought served as a midwife to the skateboard revolution, as hundreds of pools across the Los Angeles basin were left empty and unused.
Once pool riding came in, you know, that's like all that we wanted to do.
We were, like, the first people that were riding these empty swimming pools, and we had no idea what you could do.
I remember the first goal, the first day, was to make it over the light.
That was the first accomplishment in the pool, was to "over the light" successfully.
From there, we started doing double carves and hitting tile on both sides.
Our goal was to get to the lip and to actually hit the lip of the pool, so...
It was, like, completely foreign, mentally and physically.
But the fact that we were surfers, we knew which movements needed to be done.
We just didn't know if they were possible yet.
Then it got to the point where we were getting on one wheel.
All the other three wheels are out of the pool.
That one wheel's on the coping above the tile and flying back in.
We were definitely the first guys,
I mean, the whole Dogtown crew to really take it to the top, to the lip, and actually grind and pivot on the lip.
You have to understand that, what they were doing on skateboards, it just had never been done anywhere else before.
There was just no such thing.
In a covert convergence, skaters would come from miles around to savor the fleeting, illicit thrills of skateboarding inside a recently-discovered backyard pool.
Once we found a couple of good spots, we knew that there was more of them available, and we just kept scouring the neighborhood.
We did extensive searching, looking for backyard pools.
We would drive up and down the alleys in the Valley, standing on the roofs of the cars.
Jay got on the top of my car, and we're driving down alley after alley in Beverly Hills, and Jay is on the top of my car, going,
"No. No... Wait! Wait!" You know.
We'd go up and down the alleys on our bicycles and jump up and look over the fences.
We'd go up and down canyons, and take vantage points, and we had binoculars.
We went to places where the pool was completely filled in with dirt.
We dug out an entire swimming pool so that we could skate it.
We would find some that were full of water, but they had to be emptied one way or another.
I mean, they just had to...
The water had to go and they had to be ridden, man, you know what I mean?
At one point, we were so guerilla about it, we had electric pool pumps, gasoline-operated pool pumps, hundreds of yards of drainage hose, brooms, everything you needed.
♪ You're not supposed to do that ♪
There was plenty of times we found pools and we'd throw the pump in there, throw a wire over a wall, find a live socket.
Didn't know the house, didn't know any of the neighbors, any of the people.
Water would be running out...
And we'd drain a 30,000-gallon swimming pool in less than four hours.
♪ Bad boys get spanked ♪
Any house that was up for sale, that had a pool, nine times out of ten it was drained, or maybe it had two feet of water in it.
We'd drain the rest out, and we'd skate until the cops came, and then we'd split.
The tension was really high.
And you had to do what you had to do here and now.
It didn't come later.
When you have an empty swimming pool that you know might only be open for a day, or a day and a half, and that's it, you've got to skate it for as long as you can.
You had to almost, like, time yourself to be in there, trying to get there early in the morning, trying to get a few runs, and get out of there before the cops came, you know?
It was totally just illegal barging sessions.
And as soon as we heard either sirens, screeching tires, someone would yell the magic words,
"Bail!" and we were out of there.
You could definitely get arrested.
I mean, you could probably get charged a lot of money, because, let's face it, the pools weren't the same after we got done with them.
My dad would have killed me, bro.
He would have killed me if he had to pay that kind of money.
Part of it was the thrill of knowing that the police could come anytime.
We got caught skating in the Canyon Pool, and I was hiding up in the tree looking down, and there was cops below me looking for us.
And I was afraid I was gonna drop my skateboard and nail them in the head.
And then I thought,
"God, I'm gonna be arrested for," you know, "assault and battery."
If we got caught at a location, we'd go back the next day, and we would figure out how to not get caught that way.
So, if they came in the front, we'd post a lookout in the front.
If they came in through the back, we'd post a lookout in the front and back.
We'd go through the side yard, you know?
You got to understand, man, this is concrete warfare we're talking about.
This is... You know, you might find a pool, and it's here today, maybe gone tomorrow.
If you're gonna ride it, you'd better get on that shit.
♪ I see there ain't nobody out there ♪
♪ that even wants to be a little bit mellow, now is there? ♪
♪ Anybody wants to get mellow, you can turn around ♪
♪ and get the... out of here, all right? ♪
With the drought in full effect, there was nothing to prevent invading skaters from turning someone's backyard paradise into a riotous ensemble.
No pool was left untouched, and any kid could be king for a day.
There'd be five or ten guys really rocking and rolling in the bowl.
Each pushing each other's limits.
It was an incredible scene.
You could feel the energy coming out of the pool. It was intense.
Just to be there standing on the deck was hardcore, because you were privy to something that you don't readily see anywhere else, you know?
If you were in the pool, standing in there, getting ready to take a run, you were even badder. But if you were an actual player, you know, busting moves and pushing the limits of the session going on, you were a straight-out punk rock star. I mean, big time.
We pushed each other all the time.
We pushed and praised. You'd come off of a heavy grind, and then all your bros are hooting.
We were getting each other's adrenaline levels so high, that's how the stuff evolved.
On any given day, anybody was the best.
It was almost like a daily competition between all of us to see who could pull off the hottest shit.
And then we'd look up into the shallow end at each other and go, "Wow!"
When Tony Alva, or Stacy Peralta, or
Jay Adams, or Shogo, or Biniak, or Muir, any of these guys steps into a pool, it's like, even if they didn't know them, as soon as these guys rode, other people would just want to sit down and watch and learn.
I mean, that's what it really was. You talk about special.
<b>ZBOY'S
RULE</b>
So many other sports are so derivative of something else.
Even what Michael Jordan does, you know, other people play basketball, and he took it to another level.
And skateboarding, in a very great sense, comes from surfing.
But when Tony and Jay and Stacy started doing it, it was like it was coming from a whole new realm.
We really didn't know what was possible.
It had never been done before.
I think that people sometimes think that we were thinking about all this when it was happening.
Nobody was thinking about it when it was happening.
I think we talked about it afterwards, after, like, actually trying these things,
- but it was pretty much spontaneous.
- There were no precedents.
They set precedents every single day when they went out and rode.
We worked so hard to get those pools that we didn't want other people going there, because we knew if we took other people, they'd bring other people, and eventually, the pool would be lost.
We'd just keep them really, like, low profile.
You know, we wouldn't let anybody know about them.
It was almost like a local surf spot where, you know, you're not coming in.
And if you came in without our permission, you were gonna get whupped.
You didn't show up with somebody at the pool.
You had to have a meeting about that kind of shit.
You had to have a meeting, and that had to be voted.
You could argue about it, do whatever you want.
Bottom line was, you didn't clear it with the crew, and you brought someone to the pool, you know what'd happen?
You couldn't skate the pool.
I'm not shitting you.
Almost happened to me.
<b>Let's hold it one second.</b>
With the invention of the urethane wheel and the ability to ride new terrain came a groundswell of enthusiasm as skateboarding once again began to grab the attention of teens across the country.
Rumors of a national contest began circulating, prompting Ho and Engblom to build and equip their team with boards and a ragtag uniform.
We had these shirts, we had
Levis, and we had dark blue Vans.
And that was our uniform, and everybody complied to that.
That's what we wore. That's just what came up from the neighborhood.
Well, we all pretty much had grown up together, you know, and we had all been riding together, so there was a lot of camaraderie there.
And yet, at the same time, there was a competitive drive.
You know, from that P.O.P. energy, where everyone was riding each other.
If you're not gonna do well, you don't deserve to do this, right?
That's what made us, like, a step above everybody, is that we were used to competing with each other.
One of Z-Boys was always with one of Z-Boys.
And, like, we were so tightly knit as a group that we sort of used each other's different qualities to come up with a style which, in the end, ended up being unique, you know.
We each had our own style, but it was really a combination of all of us flowing together.
And Skip and Jeff sort of assessing our moves, and saying,
"Yeah, that looks good, man."
I remember Skipper coaching me on how to hold my hands.
And that I was holding my hands wrong, and that it looked bad, it was bad style.
The skateboard team was good because it gave everybody a sense of regimentation.
You know, something that you did from
3:00 till 5:00 every day or, you know...
You know, it's like daycare.
Skip would really hassle you if you screwed up, but, at the same time, he would take your time and give you the gentle pat on the back. A little advice.
He kept us in line. He wanted us to be radical.
He wanted us to be out there in the limelight. He wanted us to be visible.
He wanted our moves to be recognized.
He wanted all of that stuff for us.
But what he didn't want was, he didn't want us in jail, he didn't want us getting run over by the buses when we were doing Berts under the back wheels.
You know? But, at the same time, he wanted us to be rad.
If you looked at the story of
Peter Pan and The Lost Boys,
Pan took the children and they defeated Captain Hook, right?
But in my world, and in the world of the Zephyr shop,
I would be Captain Hook.
And we, essentially, defeated Pan, and we've turned them all into pirates.
<b>DEL MAR,
CA 1975</b>
In 1975, Bahne skateboards, the leading manufacturer of boards and wheels, resurrected competition by spearheading the first major skateboard contest since the mid 1960s, the Del Mar Nationals.
The competitive setup was based on a classic '60s model.
A plywood ramp with a top coat of urethane was built for slalom racing, and a small wooden platform was erected for freestyle.
Attention all skaters, please report to the freestyle area.
All skaters to the freestyle area.
The dated contest format did not end there, as many of the top competitors were performing the upright maneuvers made popular during skateboarding's brief boom in the '60s.
"...the world wasn't ready for the Z-Boys."
"...there was so much aggression,
"they were more like a street gang than a skate team!"
We get to Del Mar and there's this little freestyle area that's about 12 by 12, with plywood and some urethane coating on it or something.
And we're looking at each other, going,
"What the hell are we supposed to do with this?"
Del Mar would be the Zephyr team's first introduction to the world of organized skateboarding.
Their unconventional skating and disorderly presence marked them as outsiders right from the start.
It was like a hockey team going to a figure skating contest.
The difference between us and them felt very real.
♪ Now I wanna be your dog ♪
Inspired by Larry Bertlemann's low, pivotal style and the vertical walls of pool riding, the Z-Boys took skateboarding's traditional upright approach and drove it right into the ground.
They didn't like us from the first part they saw us, because, you know, we weren't of the status quo, for what they were into.
People were just looking at us, like, "Wow, what is this?"
"I mean, these guys, man, Zephyr guys, this isn't skateboarding."
And I remember me and Jay were, like,
"What are you talking about?
This is skateboarding, man."
"What the hell are you guys doing, you know, nose wheelies and all that?"
We were the rock 'n' roll, heavy metal of Dogtown.
We came prepared to kick these dudes' ass.
And we got inside their head instantly.
Man, I put on my best pimp gear, walked up there, pushed these moms and dads out of the way, threw down our entry blanks and asked for our trophies.
We had the ammo, and we knew we were just gonna bust out and blow minds.
Our purpose was to go there and shut these guys down.
Shut down Ty Page, shut down
Paul Engh, shut down Hester, shut down Skoldberg.
All those guys, dude.
♪ No you won't fool the children of the revolution ♪
The first skater from the Zephyr team to enter the competition was its youngest and most naturally gifted,
13-year-old Jay Adams, whose explosive energy and bold moves epitomized the Dogtown style.
♪ Foxy, Foxy ♪
♪ You know you are a cute little heart breaker ♪
Jay Adams went out for his first freestyle routine, the first guy they've seen of our whole group... and we knew that they didn't know what they were about to see.
And boom! Their world had changed.
It would never be the same for skateboarding again.
He was doing tricks he'd never even done before.
I remember Jay doing Berts off the side of the platform. Remember that?
Off the platform, down onto the ground, and hopping back up on the platform and skating.
People were just flipping out.
They couldn't believe that.
And I remember just looking at him, bugging out.
He was spinning nose 360s crouched on his board. He'd never done that before!
Many of the competitors, accustomed to the more upright classical form, were not impressed.
♪ You got a bad reputation ♪
♪ That's the word out on the town ♪
♪ It gives a certain fascination ♪
♪ But it can only bring you down ♪
♪ You better turn yourself around ♪
They were unconventional, and they didn't care if they were judged well, you know?
They were just there to, you know, skate and get rowdy and have fun.
Bruce Logan, Russ Howell and Ty
Page, these guys were great skaters.
But the skating maneuvers were based on a '60s paradigm.
And we decided to do it like surfers from the '70s.
They had never bent their knees and done, like, a Bertlemann turn on their skateboards.
There was not a single soul that was skating our style.
They were all riding around like stick men, man, and we were like slipping and sliding and jamming, getting in every little pocket.
They didn't know how to judge it.
They didn't know how to put it in their criteria and spit out a first place.
Some of the girls didn't like the fact that I skated like a guy, and so they protested me to the judges.
And one of the judges said that I skated better than some of the guys!
Peggy Oki took first place in the Women's Freestyle.
Jay Adams and Tony Alva took
3rd and 4th place, respectively, in the Junior Men's Freestyle.
And Nathan Pratt took 4th place in the Junior Men's Slalom.
The Zephyr team's infectious presence and abundant talent pool whet the appetite of the industry's most prominent skateboard manufacturers.
All the other companies decided they needed one of you guys to be on their team, so they went after all you guys.
Six months after the Del Mar event,
Jeff Ho and Skip Engblom would lose the very skateboard team they'd worked so hard to build.
A year later, because of mounting business problems, they would close the Zephyr shop. It would never again reopen for business.
Jeff Ho and Skip didn't have money to try and compete with people that were trying to buy us out, you know?
And, you know, I think it's kind of sad that we were bought out, on one hand. On the other hand, you know, it's like, what does a kid do when you put a candy bar in front of him?
That's sort of what was happening.
That was, you know, a hard one for me to deal with.
Because I could see that things were just gonna cave in.
It was real easy for any company to come along and just go, okay, cherry pick what they needed.
There's no way that it could hang together.
There was no way that the band could remain together.
It had to go elsewhere, because there was so much energy inherent in what was going on, it had to blow itself up and go out.
We all started to branch off in different directions.
And we represented different companies that were competing against each other.
What happened is, after Del Mar, these contests started to pop up, and every weekend we'd be going to another contest.
And then, all of a sudden we said, "Wait a minute.
"There's something more to this."
It just became obvious that something more was gonna happen here.
That it looked like skateboarding was gonna get really popular.
<b>Skating away in the ol' SA</b>
By 1975, skateboarding was on its way to a national comeback, prompting Surfer magazine to resurrect SkateBoarder, which had had a brief run in the '60s.
The magazine's second issue would feature
Craig Stecyk's first Dogtown article, his personal account of the guerilla adventures of Dogtown's Z-Boys.
Stecyk's words and photographs became the template for the attitude and aesthetic that would come to define the culture of modern-day skateboarding.
Craig had a way of looking at a situation, photographing it, writing about it, and then giving it to kids and sparking kids' imagination.
You know, some kid in Ohio could look at this and go,
"Man, there's like a dream out there, and I can have my own dream."
It certainly was something that spoke to me, and everybody in Washington.
That kind of Venice, Santa Monica, vato, wild-style writing that you guys would incorporate.
That was something, growing up in
Montana, that I just didn't know.
I didn't see it as a "being
Hispanic" thing at all.
I just thought that it was this crazy style of art, you know?
Stecyk, of course, was the master of, you know... He wrote a great story.
He was writing it in a way that it was confrontational.
It was like Hunter Thompson.
It was like, "We're... with you.
"We like to... with you. And you know what?
"We're good at it! How's that?"
"The one certain thing is: when you hit the pavement at 70 plus, it's not gonna matter who you ride for, or what your name is."
You're reading this 3,000 miles away, in a town that has snow.
So, we're living through it vicariously.
And we would live for that magazine. It was our radio station.
'Cause you're not seeing any of these people move.
You're just seeing the photos in the magazines.
♪ Act! While in delirium, ♪
♪ I no longer know what I say, ♪
♪ or what I do! ♪
♪ And yet it's necessary... make an effort! ♪
♪ Bah! Are you not a man? ♪
The photos really translated the velocity of the move, the way you guys were living.
They said way more than,
"Here's a guy on a skateboard."
They showed a lifestyle.
They showed an attitude.
They showed a code.
It was aggressive and it was stylish. It wasn't mechanical.
You'd see a Dogtown article, with, like, some, you know, torn-up pants, just ripping, and you were just like, "I want that."
Dogtowners get to go to Hollywood parties and they get to hang out with rock stars.
They break into people's backyards and skate empty swimming pools.
I'm in! Sign me up!
Everyone was into the Dogtown thing,
'cause there was no other skateboard crew that we saw in magazines doing that.
We mythologized you. We read so much about it, and we talked about it so much, while we were skating.
As hard as it might be for some people to believe, in the '70s,
SkateBoarder magazine was the biggest-selling magazine in 1978 for the entire
Southland Corporation.
That's all 7-Elevens. It was the biggest-selling magazine they had.
There were a lot of opportunities to make money.
With the Dogtown articles came international recognition and fame.
For the first time in history, teenagers were being offered huge sums of money to compete in something previously considered a rogue activity.
We were being paid to ride skateboards.
Imagine a kid today being approached by Nike, and Nike saying, "We're gonna pay you $10,000
"to spray graffiti all over the city."
"We're gonna sponsor you to, you know, spray paint graffiti."
That's what it was like in the '70s to get paid to ride a skateboard. It was crazy!
♪ I'll give you money ♪
♪ I'll give you lovin' ♪
It seemed like free money, you know?
And it just happened that we were in the right place at the right time, and we were in the magazines and...
People are looking at these magazines, you know?
And they're seeing us.
We were treated like kings at places that we went to, you know?
It was, like, just red carpets. Everywhere.
And the greatest thing about it is, we were not the valedictorians of the school.
We were the guys that would have been chosen last to succeed.
And for some reason, by doing something that everyone said was a waste of time, we ended up influencing kids all around the world.
It turned into, like, a rock star thing, you know?
I mean, I went to London,
England, in 1976 or whatever, they had a bowl named after me inside an abandoned theater in London, England.
I was like, "Wait a second. This is crazy."
Tony was the first person we knew, he was becoming famous.
And there were articles on him in People magazine and US magazine and Rolling Stone, you know, and SkateBoarder, he was the skateboarder of the year.
In 1977, Tony Alva was voted skateboarder of the year in SkateBoarder magazine's first worldwide reader's poll.
Tony's first place, along with four other places in the top 11, thrust the Dogtown skaters even further into the limelight, prompting big offers from deep-pocketed sponsors eager to ride the sport's growing popularity.
There was only a few guys that were really making some good money at it, and Stacy being one of them. I mean, Stacy, you know, he was making some good money.
I started bringing home these checks. And my parents were looking at this, going,
"What's going on here? Where's this money coming from?"
Stacy was the most commercially successful skateboarder in the world.
More of his model Warptail skateboards were sold, I think, than any skateboard ever produced.
Stacy, you know, handled himself a little bit more mature than we did.
I got to give him, you know, credit for that, because he represented himself a little bit more professionally than we did, I think, at that time.
He toured the world a lot.
I mean, every time you'd call Stacy's house, oh, he's somewhere, Australia, England,
Germany, Japan.
I wanted to go out and show the world skateboarding.

I grew up in Santa Monica.
A lot of drugs ran through the beach that I surfed at.
And I saw a lot of guys that I knew were going to stay on the beach for the rest of their lives.
And I wanted to get something out of this. This was my ticket.
Finally, I was good at something in my life, and I didn't want to let it go.

Lord I just can't go out the door. ♪
In 1979, Stacy Peralta would be the second Dogtown skater to win SkateBoarder magazine's worldwide reader's poll.
♪ Cause there's a man down there, might be your man I don't know. ♪
He stopped skating professionally, and then he hooked up with George Powell, and they started Powell Peralta, and he began the Bones Brigade.
And he picked all the talent, and the few guys that he picked at the time were just revolutionary.
It was just this amazing group of skaters who were doing for skating what the Zephyr team did in the '70s, and he was the mastermind behind the whole thing.
In a relationship that would span three decades,
Peralta would hook up with Craig Stecyk as his creative partner and early mentor.
Through a series of pioneering skateboard videos,
Stecyk and Peralta showcased the remarkable talents of the Bones Brigade to skaters the world over.
They turned that into the biggest skateboarding adventure ever.
I don't feel I came into my own until I was behind the scenes.
That's when I flourished.
♪ I hate fast cars ♪
Although Peralta would become the most financially successful skater to emerge from Dogtown, the two skaters who best personified the Dogtown spirit, and who won the most acclaim, were Tony Alva and Jay Adams.
Jay and I, the thing that we had so much in common is that we were both completely out of our mind, like, mischievous, you know?
We were all crazy, but Jay, Jay could instigate some shit, man.
Man, Jay was nuts! He would be screaming and making these goofy faces at... old ladies on the bus.
Giving her a big rat face, and he's right in there. Oh, man, it was unreal.
And it got to the point where the bus wouldn't even pick us up!
- They wouldn't even stop.
- They'd accelerate,
'cause they didn't know whether they were getting rocks or they didn't know whether Jay was gonna pull a wig off some lady's head.
They didn't know what the hell was gonna happen.
♪ Old man look at my life
I'm a lot like you were ♪
Jay was from a broken home, too.
And he had a stepfather in his life that treated him well and really pushed him both in surfing and skating, and took us places to skate and pushed in a loving way.
When you're six, seven years old, you're not thinking "pro surfer" too hard, but just be a surfer, be a kid, you know?
I didn't really think much about future.
- It just kind of came along, you know?
- Right.
And then, by the time I was 12 and 13, it was kind of already set, what I was gonna do, you know what I mean?
I'd just be a skateboarder and a surfer, you know?
You know what I mean?
Some kids are born and raised on, like, Graham crackers and milk.
He was born and raised on surfing and skateboarding, you know.
♪ Ah, one look in my eyes and you can tell that's true ♪
When God decided to create skateboarding, he said, "Let there be Jay Adams."
Jay Adams was the most spontaneous skater that you ever met.
Absolutely, incredibly gifted.
Jay was the most talented, natural skateboarder, surfer, athlete...
He had an energy like no one I ever met.
There's nobody like him, as far as
"skater" is concerned. He's the original.

That's what I want now ♪

When he skateboarded, you were watching something happen.
That's why Jay's so great, is 'cause nothing's ever the same, before or since.
You know, Jay doesn't practice. Jay doesn't redo it.
He doesn't do it twice. He doesn't do it three times. He doesn't even do it one time.
He's over it before it happens.
He will be in the middle of a maneuver and have the whole thing collapsing on him, and somehow in the center of that disaster, he will make something else out of it completely, which becomes art.
Jay Adams' skating was an athletic stream of consciousness.
Through a seemingly reckless approach, he attempted a series of aerial maneuvers that would presage what skaters would be doing in years to come.
When skateboarding finally blew up and people were able to make money, he really didn't care.
♪ Keep on pushing straight ahead ♪
Everybody cares about money a little bit, just...
Things don't always work out how you kind of wanted them to, you know what I mean?
He didn't give a shit about it, and I don't think that's why he did it to begin with.
He never was interested in any of the material rewards that came from skateboarding.
I think that he just basically had a total "f-you" approach to the whole commercialism of skateboarding.
It was just fun. You know, before it got too serious.
You know what I mean? Like in the amateur contest days, it was just kind of fun and stuff.
And then when it got to the, like, pro pool-riding and stuff, it just got too serious and...
What do you mean, "Too serious"?
Just guys didn't seem like they were having as much fun.
It was more of a job, and a lot of tension, you know what I mean?
But when things got commercial, I think it kind of freaked Jay out.
You know? There was responsibility.
You got to show up at a certain time.
You got to do a demo. You got to... You got to fly here...
If you had people coming to you, promising you something, making you sign contracts when you're a minor, you know, telling you what to do, telling you where to go, telling you how to act...
Those people didn't care about Jay.
He would be so naive in dealing with these people and these situations that he would believe what they said.
People just wanted to have what he had.
You know, they just wanted a piece of him.
It opened a lot of doors to do a lot of things that I probably shouldn't have.
Like quitting school and buying weed and partying, and just that kind of stuff.
But it also did good things, too, like helped me pay the rent for my mom and stuff like that.
- Do you have any regrets?
- Yeah, there's regrets, like, just doing drugs and stuff like that. You know?
Not skating as much as I should have, partying too much.
You know, I missed a lot of good times by doing things that I shouldn't have been doing.
You know what I mean?
Like, just going out, getting drunk and partying, and stuff like that.
You know? Where I could have done a lot of other things.
Or the business side, where I could have taken it more seriously and marketed myself, or had someone market myself differently, you know what I mean?
Right.
So I guess that's some teeny regrets, but nothing to cry about.
Right. You're stoked about what happened, though.
Yeah.
I mean...
There's certain mistakes that I'd like to change, but I don't trip on it too hard, you know what I mean?
Right. Do you want to say what they are?
- I kind of just did.
- Oh, okay. No, I... Okay.
Jay's probably lived one of the hardest lives I know for someone who's still alive, you know? And...
You get one chance at doing this.
And if you miss it, you don't get it again. And that's...
That's the hardest part of it.
That's the hardest part. And it's hard for me to even see it, because I see it in a guy like Jay Adams, and I go,
"He should've had it all."
Jay should have had it all, and it makes me so sad that he didn't.
Because he was... He was better than all of us.
My father was like a really hardcore, you know, real...
He was a pretty strict guy, you know, and I think that a lot of the things, a lot of the aggression that came out, you know, when he communicated with me,
I kind of transferred that to dealing with people and stuff, too.

Tony made it really known that, "Hey, man.
"I'm gonna be number one, and that's it."
Tony was Mick Jagger.
He was the radical.
He was the front man. He was preening. He was doing the show.
He was the Michael Jordan of skateboarding back then.
And at the same time, he was Dennis Rodman.
Tony had a real strong personality.
And when you hung around Tony, you were pretty much hanging around the Tony Show.
Tony was probably the first person who taught me what the word "ego" meant.
We all had big egos, but Tony's was bigger than all of ours put together.
If a person has a big ego, they better be able to back it.
And, like, Tony could back his ego.
You don't achieve those levels of your art unless you do have an ego.
Now Hackett said, when he used to go to pools with you, he said that you'd show up at the pool, and you'd walk right up to everybody sitting in, you know, the shallow end and say, "That's it, guys. I'm here. Out."
No, not necessarily. I might have done that a few times, but usually I just let my skating do the talking.
His timing and balance and speed and agility were far beyond everybody else's.
It was just a known fact.
When you saw Tony skate, he was so far above everybody else.
His style, and the way he flowed, and the lines that he drew, he was just a little more advanced than other guys at the time.
He could carve a pool fluently and effortlessly.
And then, at the same time, every turn was attacked as though his life depended on it.
He was a really fierce competitor, and Tony wanted the prize.
I've always wanted to be the best.
I've always been very competitive.
My goal was, I wanted to be a world champion.
I wanted to be the best in the world.
In 1977, on ABC's Wide World of Sports,
Tony Alva became modern skateboarding's first overall grand national champion.
At 19 years old, getting that title, the men's overall world professional skateboard champion, that was a big thing for me.
You know, that was like
Muhammad Ali, you know, kicking Joe Frazier's ass or whatever, you know.
Six months after winning the world championship,
Tony would shun the sponsorship world, and in an unprecedented move, go it alone and form his own skateboard company,
Alva Skates.
That was the turning point because
I'd done everything that I could do
- riding for other companies.
- Right.
And I was making them a lot of money without even having a model.
In that way, he was professional, and he wanted money for everything that he did, at some point, because he saw he was getting exploited.
So, I started my own skateboard company at 19 years of age.
I mean, I was pretty... self-centered at the time, man.
My deal was, like, "I'm gonna make some money.
"I'm gonna capitalize. I'm gonna travel around the... world.
"I'm gonna get laid every... night, you know?"
Like, you know, I'm gonna do it all, right now.
When Tony Alva came out with his first ad for his first company, it was a complete revolution in the skateboarding industry.
People were just up in arms.
Because here's this guy, standing just, like, really tough, and it was...
All of a sudden, the advertisement was no longer about skateboarding.
It had nothing to do with the product. It was about attitude.
There's just no two ways about it. Tony was a rock 'n' roll star.
He was so in love with the fame.
He was so in love with himself.
He could jump barrels, he could race downhill, he could do freestyle, he could do street style, he could ride vert. He did it all better than anybody.
He was one of the pioneers of the progression of skating.
I think that he really helped show what was possible on a skateboard.
Tony Alva's an icon that
I could look up to when I first got into the sport.
He is the most important skateboarder of all time, in my opinion.
You could look at the photos, you could look at the film, you could look at the guy talking back then.
So far, since I was, like, the innovator of vertical skating, and I'm, like, the oldest one and I'm only 21, we're saying that there's really no limit yet to the, I think, "oldness" that you can be.
Tony is the Chuck Berry of skateboarding.
He developed a style of playing, and Tony's gonna play that style his whole life.
That's what he does, and that's what he's always done, and that's what he'll always do.
There's no way that you can really say that, "He's over the hill," or anything, until the guy just totally drops out of the whole scene and isn't recognized as a, you know, person of high esteem in the world of professional skateboarding, or whatever he's doing.
I mean, if there was a skateboarding hall of fame,
I think Tony Alva is the first name that should go down.
<b>SKATEBOARD RIDING
IS PROHIBITED</b>
<b>THE
DOGBOWL</b>
We lived...
We lived at a place called the Dogbowl.
We were there every day, just about, skating all day.
In an ironic twist of fate, it was on the grounds of a posh estate in the affluent neighborhood of North Santa Monica where the Z-Boys came together for their final sessions in what they considered to be their crown jewel.
There was a kid, Dino, that lived there.
He was dying of, like, brain cancer, and he was a skateboard enthusiast.
You know, the kid's gonna die. He went to his father and said, "Hey, listen, for me,
"empty the pool. Let my friends skate here."
The next day, he was there with the pump.
Two days later, we were in there skating.
Every afternoon, after surfing and hanging, we would go to his house, hang out with him, and just skate his pool.
At a place you cannot even imagine, people can't imagine, the huge pool, in a beautiful property, you're allowed to skate it.
Dogbowl was the only place where we could skate in peace.
That was like a skate park to us, because the owner would let us skate and watch us skate.
There was all these dogs that lived around the pool, and they would always hang out and just stick their mugs right in like Friedman's camera lens or in like...
That's how it eventually got called the Dogbowl.
The Dogbowl sessions were definitely the heyday, like, for all of us.
Guys used to go there every day and just skate, and skate, and skate all day long.
We perfected a lot of things and had a lot of time to spend in one pool.
♪ In the attic, lights ♪
♪ Voices scream, nothing seems ♪
♪ Real's a dream ♪
Almost the entire original team would be at that pool in one day, which was, like, kind of weird.
It's kind of like it was back to the old Zephyr shop in a way.
'Cause you had this whole group of guys, and it was in Santa Monica, and it was the most incredible pool ever, and you didn't want anyone else there.
The crew, like, in a way, probably was not like that maybe ever before.
'Cause all of a sudden, everyone is famous and they know it.
- But we're still pushing each other.
- But that's it.
You're pushing each other. No one else is around. It's just the original crew.
♪ Woh, welcome to my town ♪
♪ High energy is all around tonight ♪
♪ Woh, you best beware ♪
♪ There's violence in the air tonight. ♪
♪ Well, Detroit city, she's the place to be ♪
♪ This mad dog town's gonna set you free ♪
Eventually, we were hitting the top so hard, and just grabbing the sides of our boards, just the rail and stuff, we started to pop out and actually do aerials.
It just changed the whole ballgame.
That time, fall '77, is when T.A. did the frontside air in the pool.
I mean, everyone is there, and people were doing little bits of aerials in different places.
But what Tony did one day, I think it was in September, he goes up, pulls the board up, turns in midair, comes back down into the pool, and makes it.
It was fucking unbelievable. It's something that you... It could be described today, but you just don't understand because it's a given, and it's seen.
Now, other people have said that people did aerials at other places, other times.
No one did it like Tony did, and no one did it as well.
And no one did it with style for many years to come, outside of that crew.
There are points of evolution in every sport and every art form that center around significant events which define all that follows.
When the Z-Boys began skateboarding inside empty swimming pools, they destroyed the status quo and challenged the idea of what was possible.
Tony Alva followed this line when he propelled his body and board above the coping and into the air as aerial base maneuvers would become the departure point for the next generation of modern skateboarders.
Dogtown was the actual beginning of all of vertical skateboarding and modern skateboarding as we know it today.
That was the beginning.
If you look back, you don't see a skateboard contest like you did in Del Mar today.
You don't see a flat ground, you know, some guys doing 360s and pirouettes.
They're all doing it in pipes. And basically, a half-pipe was what a swimming pool was, but we just hadn't figured out how to build a half-pipe back then yet, so we had to empty swimming pools and ride them.
There wouldn't be any X Games, there wouldn't be any vert skating, there wouldn't be anything at all if it wasn't for most of the boys that I skated with and competed against, and that whole scene.
That's where it all started.
Craig Stecyk saw what we were doing before anybody else did, and he believed in it as a culture, and he presented it as a culture.
People thought this was some, like, stupid thing that little kids did.
Right? Craig Stecyk understood it as more of an extension of society.
I think it was an act of significance.
I think you guys were doing some profoundly different things.
And I think nobody appreciated that at the time I got involved with dealing with it.
Skateboarding could have easily, without Craig Stecyk, become little league baseball.
It would have just been a novelty.
But, you know, the way Craig presented it, and the way he wrote about it,
I mean, it really brought it to another level, and it gave it a significance.
The whole Dogtown thing said,
"It isn't a ball-and-stick sport.
"It isn't about winning or losing. It's about the process.
"It's not about the ends.
It's about the means."
You know what? This sport isn't just a stepchild of another sport.
It's really, almost, an art form.
I think we were all looking for the best time.
The best ride. The best grind.
The best carve. You know?
The best barrel. Yeah.
Not to outdo each other, but just to aim for the best, you know?
'Cause the feeling you got from that, it's indescribable.

Finding an empty pool like that was like finding a secret, you know, like a secret surf spot or something.
It's like finding the most beautiful virgin woman.
There was like a sensuous, kind of like, exciting feel to it.
It was like having, you know, sex.
I mean, that's what it was like.
So it was like, every time we found a pool like that, we had the experience that, you know, here's somebody who's unridden.
I mean, I don't know how else to explain it.
I remember one time, Jay said, "Come check this out."
And there was an alley right across from his house on Highland, and I went down there, and I hear this, "Tink, tink, tink, tink."
I'm like, "What is that?"
And Jay's in hysterics.
He goes, "Just watch, man. Just watch."
All of a sudden, I see this cat come out of this under car parking garage, and it's got a 3-foot piece of string tied to its tail with a tin can with rocks in it.
And I'm like, "You got to be shitting me!"
Back then, we weren't wearing all these pads, and if you take a look at some of the still shots from back then, you'll see that I'm on the wall with nothing on.
I mean, if you fall then, you're gonna get hurt.
We didn't care. We just wanted to get radical.
Okay, really quickly. It was
August, the dog days. It was hot.
I was drunk. I was drinking papaya juice and vodka.
I was sitting on a bus bench in front of the store with Craig.
I went to Craig, "Hey, Craig, you know, these are really the dog days," and he went, "Yeah, this is really a dog town."
And I went, "Yeah, it is a dog town," and he went,
"'Cause you know, we live in Dogtown."

# I can spend three dollars #
# And sixty-three cents #
# On Diet Coca-Cola #
# And unlit cigarettes #
# I wonder why we listen to poets #

You know, there are two kinds of potential.
There's artistic potential, which I think for them is unlimited, and there is commercial potential, which is really quite mysterious to us because there are so many factors that are out of your control, and we try not to think about it too much and just... try to make a great record, and hope and push the label to make the right decisions and do the right things promotion-wise and so on.
This is an interactive band.
These are four or five people, you know, who make music together, and the music wouldn't sound the way it does unless these five people are together in the room at the same time, making the music.
It's a constant process.
I mean, we make records, and they're, um...
Like, that ends up being a thing that you're making, and you have a million options as to what that thing can be and what shape it can be.
We generally go for a pretty straight, definitive version of what the song sounds like it should be and then deconstruct it a little bit and see if there's some more exciting way to approach it.
# Echoes in my heart #
# And gravel in my palm #
There's no reason at all not to destroy it.
You know?
We made it, so it's ours to destroy, and that's liberating and exciting in a really creative way.
# I need a camera #
# To my eye #
# To my eye #
# Reminding which lies that I've been hiding #
# Which echoes belong #
# I'm counting on #
# Two days in Central Park #
# With gravel in my heart #
# And echoes in my palm #
# Phone my family #
# Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk #
# And no, it's not okay #
# I smashed a camera #
# I want to know why #
# To my eye #
# Reminding which lies that I've been hiding #
# Which echoes belong #
# I'm counting on #
# Two days in Central Park #
# With echoes in my heart #
# And gravel in my palm #
I think this record's more of a leap for the band.
This is probably the closest to pure collaboration
Wilco has ever got.
Personally, I'm really happy
'cause Jeff and I have done a lot of this stuff together.
This is the first time that Jeff and I have made a conscious effort to get together at the loft and write songs.
Not that things don't happen spontaneously, um, with the Wilco recordings, but there is a lot of conferring with each other, a lot of deliberation, a lot of, like Jeff was talking, destroying what we've done, trying it from the back door, turning it upside down.
# I'm counting out #
# The days to see how far #
# I've driven in the dark #
# Echoes in my heart #
# Phone my family #
# Tell 'em I'm lost on the sidewalk #
# No, it's not okay #
# No, it's not okay #
# No, it's not okay #
Uh, okay.
It's the first record where we've really done everything ourselves.
We're engineering it ourselves, and we're doing it in our space.
We're doing two seemingly contradictory things... we're making a record in a very relaxed environment with no outside input, but at the same time, we're accepting a certain kind of pressure that we're putting on ourselves.
It's nice not to have a producer for Wilco because we're all, any one of us, perfectly capable of... directing or shaping a musical moment.
Everything is just kind of set up to just keep making records.
I know it's cool to bitch about your record label, you know?
But, I mean, they're letting us make a record in our loft, and they haven't heard a word of it.
They're giving us $85, 000, and they haven't heard a word of it.
You know, that's trust, right?
They trust us.
You're always playing the...
You're pretty much doing
1, 5, 6, 4 on all the...
A lot of times, when you're playing, if you don't have any, like, sonic landscape behind you, everything turns into a folk song.
That's pretty much what you do, right?
Yeah.
We just wanted it to not sound like a little folk ditty, you know?
So we wanted to have just, like, some kind of sonic weight under all of that and, uh, just something kind of weird and fucked up.
# It's my father's voice dreaming #
# Of sailors sailing off in the morning #
# To fight the war #
That picks it up some.
# For the air-conditioned rooms at the top of the stairs #
# They head to the table #
Tune the "A" string to a "B" flat and it...
# And it makes no difference to me #
And then you put them together and you'll get some really magical moments.
# They cried all over overseas #
# And it's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
And we thought that might be rhythmic enough to play to.
# There's bourbon on the breath of the singer you love #
It's kind of along with some of the more noise tracks, but it's rhythmic, so it's something that they can play along to.
# He takes all his words #
# From the books that you don't read anyway #
It was about 3:00 in the morning.
We were either gonna get something great or lose our fucking minds.
All these things are just blaring in here, you know?
That's when it all kind of exploded.
# They cried all over overseas #
# And it makes no difference to me #
# When it's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
# And it takes all the breath out of me #
# When they cry all over overseas #
# When it's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #
# It's hot in the poor places tonight #
# I'm not going outside #

Hey.
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.
Now, the Latin voice.
We're going to do something with Jeff Tweedy, who plays rock 'n' roll.
# One, two, three, one, two, three #
# Gonna rock and... #
So, with the community that you are doing now, did you play music, uh... porque...
Do you think that your music, uh, reaches out to children who don't have a fighting chance?
Um...

# It's not even half as nice as you #
# Set my sights on one whispery kiss #
I'll sign that.
If you know how to spell
"Simón"... go for it.
S- I-M-O-N-E?
That sounds like right, yeah.
"Real pal"...
Do your record... My...
I have an idea.
Does it come out on... compact disc?
M m-hmm.

# And it felt all right to me #

Let's just do a lot of good crowd control tonight and, you know, bring up the whole political thing, just fuckin'...
The whole thing about women's rights, lesbians' rights, and stuff like that.
I'm gonna play to it.
I'm gonna play to the crowd.
Cool.
'Cause, you know, the Dow is down about 30%, you know.
And as soon as I looked at that,
I just knew what kind of position you're in and stuff.
I've got to kiss some major ass to, you know, to get it... my portfolio back together.
Totally. I know. I know.
I have...
I hear you, man. Totally.
I totally... I canned my stockbroker two weeks ago.
How's the place out in the Hamptons? Good?
M m, it's a fixer-upper.
I mean, the pool is shit.
Yeah.
Spielberg told me... He's like,
"I went over to Jeff's... "
'Cause he knows your fuckin' music is a big bullshit thing... and he was just like,
"I saw his fucking pool," you know, and he was just, uh... he's funny.
You know, he reminds me a lot of you.
You are stupid.

...from our upcoming
Wilco record.
They sound nothing like that on the record.
Poetry?
Are you saying that my lyrics are poetry?
I like you.
Here's some more... poetry for you.
I wanted to go out and play some shows acoustically.
It seemed like the good time to do it.
We haven't really toured for a while.
The record's still being made.
And take a little break from the record, go play some music, and see how things go.

Jeff, do you remember Scott from Reprise?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Hey, great job, man.
Well, thanks. Thanks.
You know my friend Sarah?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, excellent.
# In a sea #

I work at WEA.

- All right.
# Try to fold it over #
# If I had a boat #
# I'd probably... #
# Roll over #
Hey, is the new record more like...
Is it gonna be more like "A. M.," or is it gonna be more like...
"Summer Teeth"?
Uh, it's really not that much like either one of those records,
I don't think, so...
Ooh. Really?
# Surely there is somebody #
# Who needs #
It sounded like it was a trip-hop album or something.
There were tape loops and samples and...
There are those things, but it's not like a trip-hop record.
Tricky.
# I am so #
# I am so #
# Out of tune #
# I am so #
# Out of tune #
# With you #
I'm happy with it, and we're almost done with it, so, uh, you just have to wait another month or so.
A month or two months.
And you guys are gonna tour on that straightaway, then?
Maybe.
I don't know.
Well, hopefully it'll come out in July.
It's, um... it's got a lot of the drums and holes... and holes in the songs in it.
That's...
So you're like...
Is Courtney Love in there?
No.
Sorry.
A lot of big, open spaces between what's supposed to be, like... the music part.
I don't know. I'm gone.
# We all return #
# Music is my savior #
# I was maimed by rock 'n ' roll #
# I got my name #
# From rock 'n ' roll #
Uh, it's Jeff.
Cool?
- Yeah, it seems fine.
- Great.
That's exactly the mix you'll have out there.
# How can I convince you it's me I don't like #
# And not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes #
# When I've always been distant #
# And I've always told lies for love? #
# I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say #
# How can I be closer and get further away #
# From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie? #
# I've got reservations #
# About so many things #
# But not about you #
And then maybe...
Something... I don't know.
You know, it's...
Sure.
Yeah.
It's only a single.
It's the first time, where he goes,
# I got a reservation... #
Yeah. Yeah, the first one is the double one.
Okay.
I think he's gonna stay away from...
What's that?
Uh, I guess the next... four or five days.
Yeah. We're mixing.
I'm not at the loft.
I'm at the studio.
Tony's here.
# I... #
All right.
#... got a reservation #
All right.
Well, I'll call you later.
Pajama day?
This is, like, this is the record that needs to take the band to another level.
If that didn't happen, it would be a tragic sort of missed opportunity and that it would damage the band.
I think every record I've ever made, somebody has said,
"This is the big one. "
"You guys are gonna be huge. "
And when I saw the reality of the situation,
I felt a little dumb for believing it.
# Make no difference ever known #
# Make no difference ever known to me #
We do have a new A&R guy, M io, who's really, like, younger and cooler than our last guy.
So who knows?
Maybe he'll come in and say something really cool.
Maybe he'll be great.
# I'm the man who loves you #
# I'm the man who loves you #
I think this sounds great.
Yeah. It's a song.
Do you want to hear the new one again?
Can you guys tell me what it is about the drum sounds on this that's not happening?
You said you can't get a good snare sound?
You can't brighten them up.
I think that's what's kind of cool about it.
They're murky-sounding, you know?
- This is all you can get out of them.
- I think it's great.
If the overall song feels good to you, you're gonna fall in love with the little parts of it that are fucked up.
To sum up what I'm thinking...
- You can't change one piece of the puzzle.
- Right.
I don't think well-defined, bright drums with presence and definition would serve the feel of that song.
You know, it's a $ 150-an-hour argument, but that's okay.
Whatever they lack
I say are actually a virtue in this cut.
If we go with this new one, there is more redoing than...
Jeff thought before he left, for instance.
What is coming up right now is exactly what came up when I first started talking to Jeff about it, which was, "I think this does create a domino effect. "
Did anyone have any problem with this song
- until last night when you tried to E. Q. The snare?
- Yes. Absolutely. Always.
Always since day one.
Maybe we should mix stuff that we know is done.
There is no fucking pressure, man.
This is day two in the studio for this record.
- Three.
- Three. Okay.
There's still no pressure.
I just know if we mix both of these, we're gonna go,
"Neither one's it. "
I just know it.
I think it'd be great if we just mixed and leave all tracking for the loft.
Honestly.
Jeff's on his way down.
Oh, his... Alert the media.
Has he...
Has he been... Was he alerted to the situation?
No. He just called for a status report.
Oh, and you said,
"Status not good. "
We had a little bit of a work stoppage... a grinding... grinding to a halt, like, "Well, hold on.
What exactly... How are we supposed to do this?"
It was like really readjusting to how things are gonna work when we're in a different environment from our luxurious... little dreamworld.
We're spending $ 1, 000 a day to be here.
Anytime we get stumped from here on out, we should just... move on.
That's what we're deciding.
I think we've all kind of decided that.
Like, I don't want to mix them both.
At the same time, I don't want to get too hung up on this.
It's an important decision.
Oops. We happened to make it the day we were here.
Or not make it.
You know, whatever.
Let's move on.
You know, we've spent $ 1, 000 in stupider ways in this band.
Like all that blow in Amsterdam. That was...
Well, I must have missed out on that.
There's more pressure on Jeff, you know, externally and self-imposed, I think.
He is aware that the success or failure... artistically, primarily, of the record reflects mostly on him.
Cut to the real mix to "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
Why couldn't we do that when we're mixing
"Heavy Metal Drummer"?
Well, why not do it now?
Because we got to go off-line, unmute everything to find out what track that thing's on.
Can't you just look and see what track it comes up on?
Yeah.
But I don't know if it's just one track or two or what part of the kit it is.
Okay, how would we do it...
How would we overlap it mixing it separately?
We'd just say the orchestra at the top of
"Heavy Metal Drummer" is there.
It wouldn't have to be a, like, mastering thing?
Well, no, 'cause the orchestra is in "Heavy Metal Drummer"... in the top of "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
But it seems...
That seems backwards to me.
Why not mix it up to the cut point instead of trying to mix the other one from a new starting point?
Why not mix it... mix it to the edit?
Do you know what I mean?
Instead of, like, making a new edit for the... when we mix
"Heavy Metal Drummer. "
All right. I guess...
I- I... to me, it's the exact...
There's...
It's the exact same thing.
You mix one up to here, or you start the other mix here.
M ix, start.
Right there.
All right.
I didn't know that you wanted it to sound exactly like it does here.
I thought you wanted it to be the noise going over whatever was really on
"Heavy Metal Drummer" there.
I don't want the orchestra to go into "Heavy Metal Drummer. "
It cuts right there.
Right. And I...
Okay, okay.
Let me try to explain myself.
Um... what I...
I didn't know that...
This is taking a lot longer than doing one mute.
I know, but can I explain myself, please?
I didn't know until now that you wanted it to start with a little kit...
Big kit.
Well, we can do it both ways.
No, I don't...
I don't give a shit.
You just... I just...
You misunderstood what I was saying.
I- I assumed, apparently wrong, that it was noise until "Heavy Metal Drummer" started.
But now I understand that it's orchestra until a subset of
"Heavy Metal Drummer" starts, then, two measures later,
"Heavy Metal Drummer" really starts, right?
- Sure.
- Okay. I didn't know that.
I thought we were just saying,
"Hey, that would be cool if the noise went right up to
'Heavy Metal Drummer. "'
Does that make sense?
Well, whatever.
I don't know.
I don't know what the problem is.
I don't.
I just want you to understand me, like understand...
Why is that so important?
I don't have to understand you all the time.
It's okay.
Like, we found it, and... and we can do it.
Okay.
It... It seems to me like you're making a-a big deal out of not wanting...
Not wanting to... Okay.
I've just been sitting here trying...
I've been listening to you explain yourself.
And do you understand it?
Sure. I understand it.
Why couldn't you just say,
"I understand what you're saying"?
I did.
Two seconds ago, you said,
"Why is it so important that I understand you?"
Well, because it doesn't seem like you were gonna let me understand you.
You were gonna have to explain it to me again and again and again.

I used to throw up like 30 times in a night and get put in the hospital for dehydration.

That feels better.
You're right. It's six of one, half-dozen of the other.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, I-I guess
I wasn't explaining myself...
See, now we have to do all our outro mutes on everything else.
Why?
Well, because we have a bunch of other things open.
I mean, it just cuts right there.
No, but up to there.
You know what I mean?
- Oh, right.
- Up to there.
Well, we would have had to do that anyway.
Yeah, some of that we would have, yeah.
But I was... I was... Yeah.
I was just thinking it'd be...
We'd just start
"Heavy Metal Drummer" that way was what I was thinking, you know?
I'm cool. It's...
I'm totally cool, all right?
It's over.
Right now, um,
Reprise Records is in a pretty serious state of flux, which I'm a bit nervous about.
I mean, I'm not worried about the record not coming out.
The record will come out, but you don't know whether we're gonna be getting the... same sort of enthusiasm out of whoever the replacement person is.
It's just a mystery.
What about "M ust be High" or "Casino Queen"?
Nah.
I'm just thinking in terms of rockers, man.
Yeah.
If we got easy rockers, we should probably...
I don't want to do that anymore, man.
You don't want to rock?
No, I don't want to just fall back on a bunch of easy rockers.
No, I'm just thinking with four days to practice and four shows.

When this record ended up being finished, it actually felt fresher to me than it had felt for months.
After... We did a bulk of the recording in a, you know, over a year or so, and somewhere towards the end of that year, it got to be kind of nit-picking and going back and retracking songs and knowing exactly what we were going for... less exploratory.
And... And that was starting to get kind of rough by the time we went to CRC to mix.
We got bogged down in certain things like, um, redoing drums or, you know, certain calls that were good that helped us later on.
But for whatever reason, it... it just bogged down.
Doing the record... the final mixes... at Soma and hearing them through Jim O'Rourke's ears, actually hearing it with someone who is coming at it with some fresh perspective and being able to collaborate on the final mix is kind of like...
Well, we're kind of throwing everything out the window, but we're also kind of getting back to what the original thing was.
When it went to Jim with completely fresh ears, he heard them a little differently, and right away, as soon as we heard how he was mixing... like "Trying to Break
Your Heart," the first thing he mixed, then it was like,
"Oh. This really works. "
That's why bands don't mix records.
Definitely it was like a...
It was a final stage of collaboration.
Like mixing the record...
That's what I always felt like mixing should be... like it should be the last stage of, uh, of inspiration.
I think we tried to make it powerful, like with two guitars.
Can you beef up your tone a little, then, or something?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, okay.
This is so steady now.
Yeah. I thought it was feeling great, man.
God, I thought it felt great.
No, I mean, we can try the two guitars again if it feels too weak.
I just think that we've tried the two...
I think the two-guitars thing is, like...
M ight be obsolete, you know?
Uh, I'm not sure what that means, but I'll try.
No, I just...
It's just that it was...
What's that?
That felt great to me.
That's all.
It just felt fuckin' rockin', you know?
That's all.
# Jesus, don't cry #
# You can rely on me, honey #
# You can combine anything you want #
# I'll be around #
# You were right about the stars #
# Each one is a setting sun #
# Tall buildings shake #
# Voices escape singing sad, sad songs #
# Tuned to chords #
# Strung down your cheeks #
We actually officially delivered the record... or sent them the final mixes of the record.
I must have had 50,
60 definite possibilities for magazine features, let alone television appearances, which were starting...
Offers were coming in.
And I just thought like, "Boy, this is gonna be so great, you know, it's all set. "
I think the press has always loved Wilco, but now we're gonna take it even to another level.
When we delivered the record, though, we didn't hear from them for like two weeks, you know?
So we... we thought that was probably not a good thing.
I knew that I was sitting on something that people were gonna beat down the door to get.
And then the advances didn't get made.
So June is rolling along, and I'm going like,
"Well, we're losing time,
"we're losing... we're losing people to deadlines.
"They're not gonna be able to cover this record if we don't hurry up. "
And then, about the third week in June,
I'd heard, "There's a problem. "
Next thing I heard was that... they asked us to change the record.
I don't know how they... what they wanted us to change.
And Tony told me that... that was their response, and... and I told Tony that we weren't interested in changing the record.
Their A&R representative was M io Vuchovich, and what I had heard...
Like I said,
I never talked to Wilco about the way this chain happened, but what I heard from my side was that M io had some ideas about changes to the record or additional recording or mixing or things like that, and the band had felt like,
"That's the record.
We're finished, " you know?
"We're not really in the mind to make changes, and it's sort of a take it or leave it. "
And I think it went up to M io's boss, David Kahne, the head of A&R for Warner's and Reprise, felt like M io was right and that changes did need to be made, and if the band wasn't interested in making them, then they should probably be on another label.
Next thing I heard was that they wanted to know if we wanted to leave.
Well, I just think we've been jerked around so many times and that this is the ultimate jerking-around.
You know, like this
"We're gonna drop you" shit or whatever it is or
"You can get out of the deal. "
Either way you want to look at it, it's still... majorly being jerked around, and... you know, why should I think that things are gonna change?
Actually, when Tony first told me that this was a possibility...
I have to be completely honest... it hurt my feelings.
It's like a feeling of rejection.
It's got to be more than some sort of promise of, you know,
"We love you and we're going to take care of you. "
Do you know what I mean?
Because we've heard all that before, and I just think that the wound from this episode of making this record, delivering the record, and getting, basically, nothing but headaches in return is pretty deep and gonna be pretty tough to heal, and you're not just dealing... you know,
I'm not the only person you've got to make feel good.
We never got too specific about what exactly, uh, made them hate it.
Okay, but I just want you...
I want you to understand one thing.
This is really important.
Right now I believe that the best thing for the band... for the band... the present and future of the band... is to be away from Reprise Records.
It was at a weird time in the Reprise inner circle because Howie Klein, who had been president of Reprise for a long time... since Reprise was reactivated... he'd also been at Sire when Uncle Tupelo was on Sire and a big fan of the band... had just left the label.
In fact, I think the day that the band turned in the record... the end of June... right around then, he... that was his last day.
A day or two after I retired,
I got a phone call from one of Wilco's many, many, many, many fans at Warner Brothers... and that was the first of many phone calls I got... telling me that Wilco was dropped.
I would guess that if I was an executive at a record company... high-up executive.
I don't mean the people working in the trenches, but I mean the guys with, you know, the gold-plated cellphones, you know?
If I was up there and I listened to "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,"
I probably wouldn't get it.
Why don't I get it?
Because it doesn't tell me exactly who it's for, it doesn't tell me exactly what it's about, and it doesn't tell me exactly how much it will sell.
From what I gather, I think that they didn't even think there was a single to work on.
There's pretty stuff in there, there's hard stuff in there, there's mystery in there, there's... there's really sweet... tunes.
And there's, you know, an abrasion in there as well.
But it's all there, and you really have to kind of sit with it.
You have to allow yourself the time to get something out of it.
There's no chance that Wilco would have ever been dropped when I was president of Reprise Records.
We're now in a... a culture... not just a business, but a culture... in which we expect everything to happen
Like that.
You know, you have people outside, standing around talking on cellphones.
You know, the gist of the conversation is,
"I'll be there in five minutes. "
Who gives a fuck?
Just be there in five minutes.
Don't talk about it.
You know, it's... You get...
People are just so impatient, and as a result, you know, we're looking at things in ways like,
"Well, how much time do I have to devote to this?"
And it's really sad because, you know, music, art, literature, poetry, you know, even great technical... technological inventions... they're not meant to be
Done and done with that quickly.
It was, like, kind of just a shock to be, like, slapped in the face with, um... um... this calculated world of... international, multinational... whatever... corporation.

I see a band here that is really ambitious artistically.
It's not a VH1
"Behind the Music" story.
It's not a drugs-groupies- celebrity kind of story at all.
This band's story is the music.
Twenty years from now, they're probably gonna get more of their due than they are now.
I don't think they're a band that fits in with a lot of what music gets played on the radio.
The appreciation for its records is going to increase as time goes on.
In the making of this record,
I felt like I got no support... zero.
Emotional, financial... whatever.
Then, at some point in the process, you start asking yourself, "Why are we... What are they doing?"
We don't need the money.
You know, the band can go out and play gigs and make the money to pay for the records, so...
They're not getting the band on the radio.
Um... you know, it's really... at this point, to me, their value is really, really questionable to us.

I'm stealing the band's pizza.
Oh, I got busted!
I'm sorry, dude.
- Is that cool? Is it cool?
- Does anybody have a pen?
I don't have nothing for you to sign!
Tell him to sign your ass.
I'm just kidding.
Yeah, I can do that.
You'll have to sign my boobs.
Actually... Would I?
I don't know.
I've never...
Someone in our band did that once, actually.
You can sign my ass.
I have nothing else to sign.
- Really?
- Do you wanna?
If you sign her ass, you have to sign my ass.
And if you sign her ass, you have to sign my ass.
You can sign my chest.
That's what Jimmy...
Oh, we saw Jimmy in the, uh...
- Are we on the lighting stage?
- Sound check.
...with Straitjackets in the elevator last night.

- Jimmy Lester?
- What?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This is a...
I met Bob from
"Sesame Street" yesterday... last night.
- Bob?
- Oh.
Do you know Bob?
Does anybody know who Bob is?
- Yeah.
- I can't remember that.
- How'd you meet him?
- He was in our hotel.
He's doing a kids' show right now as we speak.
Oh, man.
He's like, "Yeah, I got...
Big Bird's coming in tomorrow, and we're... "
There's Jay right now as we speak.
So also, although it's already been blown, but J. P. Asked if we could sort of steer clear of the stage for a little while.
Until...
Until sound check is over?
Until Jay gets, uh, done?
Has Jay been here since like 6:00 in the morning?
Gentlemen, we have about
35 minutes to do all of this.
Yeah, we're going Glenn, we're gonna go... Jay Bennett, the entire keyboard world and Jay Bennett electric rig.
Keep him there.
After Jay, we'll do Johnny real quick,
M r. Tweedy, let Leroy get his world sussed out.
We're only gonna have time to do about two songs.
Check. Hey, hey, hey.
Yeah, the delay's not working.

Let's talk about Jay.
All right. I probably won't have much to say.
- Okay.
- Just warning you.
Okay.
It's my understanding, from what I heard in the grapevine, that that was sort of an amicable separation and that, um, I...
And I don't know that this is true, but the hearsay is sort of that he didn't feel that he had had as much a role in the songwriting as he wanted to have or, uh...
I think that there's some truth to that, and I think there's an effort... there's an effort made for it to be amicable.
Since Jeff's solo tour and Glenn joining the band, uh, some dynamics in the band had altered in... many different ways.
I think Jay's contribution to the band over time and our collaboration was important and was valued in the band.
As for the circumstances surrounding him leaving,
I really think that that's up to Jay to define.
And as far as my, uh, feelings about it,
I couldn't be happier.
Jeff was convinced that he really needed to tell Jay directly and he needed to be the guy to do it.
We sat down, and he said,
"I don't think I can make music with you anymore. "
And I said, "Why?"
And, uh...
I'm not sure I ever got an answer that made any sense.
Jay wore out his welcome in a lot of ways.
It's hard to be working with somebody, uh... that... that needs more than you can... than you can give him.
And, um, you know,
I'm more interested in being... playing music with people that I can share with than give things to.
Jeff was threatened by me.
It's clear.
By the attention
I was beginning to get.
Um...
He wanted the band back.
That's simple.
That's a simple answer.
You know, Jeff went into this big, long analogy about how a circle needs a center, you know?
Well, he was gonna be the center, right?
I wasn't gonna be the center.
It's hard for me to talk about.
Um, I mean, I've known Jay for... 16 years?
17 years?
And... our friendship had, uh... run its course.
There's a lot of power-related issues in Wilco, and people are...
They don't want to lose their gig, man.
And so they don't want to step outside of their little, uh, um... uh... scripted role.
'Cause if they do, this is what happens.
I think we all knew everyone would be happier in the end, and I think Jay would totally agree with that.
It did not come as a total shock to me to be asked to leave Wilco.
It had been in the back of my mind.
In fact, I'd talked to Leroy about this extensively... that, to quote myself, "My days in Wilco are numbered. "
I had thought very, very seriously about leaving the band.
I just happened to be beaten to the punch.
When you're Jay Bennett or whomever and you leave the band, you have to kind of start over.
You're going back to playing for 35 people or 100 people or whatever from sold-out theaters.

They delivered a great record, and I think it's a record company that, for whatever reason, can't handle that type of great record.
And so, fantastic.
Let's go do something else.
I don't know how to make
I don't know how to make something other than the record we made, and I think to entertain any of their half-assed, fearful, frightened bullshit would be to compromise something that is a big part of my soul.
You know?
Like, it's a part of my heart.
And I don't have any interest in doing that anymore.
I think it's a really, really, really strong record.
I think it's a statement.
I think it's the right record for them to make... now in their career.
And I think there are dozens of labels that would be ecstatic to have it and who, if you delivered this record, would call you up and, you know, be excited about it.
That's all.
You know, that's what I'm tired of is, like, no enthusiasm.
Why is Wilco dropped, uh,
24 hours after they deliver a record like
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"?
Um... I mean, we've contemplated that question at great length over the summer, and in the end,
I think Tony and I both just sort of put our hands up and said, "I guess we're glad that it just happened,
"and we won't try to overintellectualize it any further. "
But I really think, looking back on it, it's because of marketing.
And it's because you have an artist like Jeff Tweedy who's put out, uh, you know, four or five records in a row with a record company and they haven't been able to bring sales up to a level where it's really significantly affecting their bottom line.
They, uh, I guess, stop thinking about it from a pure artistic level and just say, "We don't make money on this guy. "
And then he delivers a record which, for whatever reasons, they evaluate as being difficult to raise to the next level of public appeal, so they say, "Well, okay, we're not going to... "
I guess, to use a phrase...
"throw good money after bad.
"We've spent $ 200, 000 recording this record,
"but it's gonna cost us another $300, 000 or whatever
"to launch a marketing campaign for it, and we just don't think we're gonna make our money back. "
So they drop the artist.
Um, this, of course, creates a situation for us where we have a finished record and we want to put it out.
"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" has actually turned into a kind of metaphor.
It's now a measure of what record companies... or not even so much record companies, but the corporations that own record companies... are willing to put up with.
Ultimately, what it came down to was they had told Jeff Tweedy,
"We don't like your album.
We don't want to release it. "
In the end, you know, it doesn't really matter who puts the record out.
Eventually, either in the near future or in the way-far, distant future, someone's gonna get it.
As long as music is available, someone will hear it.
The record label must have found it to be something of a public-relations problem, because the press really latched on to the situation as something of a... using Jeff as a poster boy as to what problems were going on in a lot of record companies... and in particular
Warner Brothers... with their artist rosters.
And they didn't want it to blow up any further than it did.
So they, um, after a certain amount of, uh, anxiety-ridden conversations, said, "We think the right thing to do
"is let you take your record somewhere else... wherever you'd like. "
Every time we put out a record, the length of time that a record company is willing to actually even, uh, humor you about, like, working on your record has gotten shorter.
Music is not limited to what happens in a business quarter.
And...
You know... this is a record, okay?
This is something that, probably, someone will buy.
They'll pay, 15, 16... whatever... bucks for it.
And that's cool, but, you know, what's encoded somewhere in the bottom of this thing... this dopey little disc... you know, that's what matters.
This... the artifact, the actual object... is not.
What's encoded in here, if it's any good... you know, you'll hear it.
And you'll either get it or you won't, and just as... as a... as a writer, as a fan, as a guy who just listens to music a lot... you know, if you don't get it... you know, I just think that's kind of too bad.
# There's a magazine called Sunset #
# And a tape machine that won't let #
# Me ever forget this impossible longing for you #
"Yankee Hotel
Foxtrot" has been finished now for about six months.
The band have done a little bit of touring, um... word got out that the band were out of their deal, and we started getting a lot of calls, um, and basically started talking to people.
I think we were dealing with about...
25 or 30 labels initially, and then, as time passed, we have been whittling the list down, and we're now talking to five or so and hope to have that resolved in the next week or two.
I don't have any money.
I don't have very much.
Oh! I only have $6.
You want something to eat,
Sammy?
Yes.
I want something to eat.
What do you want?
Soda.
Soda.
Honey, I don't have enough money.
I know.
I'll go get some money.
Never in my wildest, most optimistic moment did I think that we'd be sitting here in the position we're in right now, which is with a finished record that... is ours to take wherever we want.
You could certainly say that they fucked up by letting the band go and walk away with a record.
It's really an opportunity that maybe comes along once in a career.
The claw machine ripped him off.
It wouldn't play?
No, it... it went by itself.
Tony, smell Sam's butt.
No, thanks.
I need to know if he needs a diaper.
I think he does.
I was surprised at the number of record companies that were willing to pay a large amount of money to be sort of in the Wilco picture.
# Oh, yeah #
Recognize it?
What is it?
- Guess. It's one of your songs.
- It's one of my songs?
"I'm Trying to Break
Your Heart"?
No.
Uh, "I Need a Camera"?
No.
- "Dreamer in my Dreams"?
- No.
No?
- "Casino Queen"?
- Unh-unh.
- "California Stars"?
- No.
Tell me.
It's something with a drum in it.
"Heavy Metal Drummer. "
Yes!
How's that go?
# I sincerely miss those heavy metal bands #
# I used to go see on the landing in the summer #
# She fell in love with the drummer #
# She fell in love with the drummer #
# She fell in love #
# Shiny, shiny pants and bleached-blond hair #
# A double kick drum by the river in the summer #
# She fell in love with the drummer #
# Another, then another #
# She fell in love #
# I miss the innocence

# Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned #
# Unlock my body and move myself to dance #
# Into warm liquid, flowing, blowing glass #
# Classical music blasting masks the ringing in my ears #
The record had started to leak a little bit from labels and so on, and copies were starting to float around.
And initially we tried to slow it down... we knew we couldn't stop it... and then, at some point,
I think we just decided,
"You know what? It's out there.
"Let's embrace it and make it available through our website if people want to hear it. "
A lot of people were really aware of the new songs, to the point where, I think, a lot of people, in the front rows, at least, knew all the words.
# Playing Kiss covers, beautiful and stoned #
# I miss the innocence
I've known #

# Whoo-hoo, hey #
# Whoo-hoo #
# Whoo-hoo #
# Whoo-hoo, hey #
After months of... discussions and ruminations, we have decided to sign...
The band's gonna sign to Nonesuch records.
We've agreed to all the major terms, so the record will come out on Nonesuch in April.
I do find it ironic and a little humorous that Time Warner is the parent company of both of these labels...
Reprise and Nonesuch.
- Are you Jeff?
- Yeah.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.
One way to put the reason for picking Nonesuch is that they were the best combination of sort of the business deal and a creative home.
In hearing the record, you know, in the first 30 seconds,
I felt that there was something going on with this record that I hadn't heard in a Wilco record before and that it, you know, was... it sounded brave to me.
Um, you know, it may have been the same 30 seconds that convinced Reprise that they didn't want to put out the record.
Okay, you ready to start signing things?
M m-hmm.
Yeah, it looks good.
Hold on.
One more.
This is to get paid.
Definitely sign that one.
And I sign here.
You sign there.
And you're back in the fire.
Thanks.
It's a deal.

It all begins now.

That's like the coup of all time for us.
To basically get, you know, one of the biggest entertainment corporations in the world to release us from a contract essentially scot-free with a record that they had already paid for and then sell it back to them for three times the money.
They just liked the record so much that they paid for it twice.

{5631}{5685}for probably 10 years now.
{5687}{5711}What do you got?
{5714}{5822}We got bots, slimy bots, and|"A" deck, "B" deck, "C" deck.
{5825}{5878}Huge rusticles,|like this big around.

{6386}{6452}LYNCH: I'm Don Lynch,|and I studied the "Titanic"
{6454}{6536}based upon the testimony and|accounts of passengers and crew.
{6539}{6601}The people who were there|and witnessed it.
{6633}{6680}MARSCHALL:|My name is Ken Marschall.
{6682}{6776}I've been studying the "Titanic"|for over three decades now.
{6778}{6851}I checked it out.|The Straus suite.
{6853}{6896}Through those years and study,
{6898}{6960}I've sort of become|a visual historian
{6962}{7048}about the ship and her structure|and appearance.
{7095}{7145}PAXTON:|It was an amazing expedition
{7147}{7246}in terms of all of|the state-of-the-art technology
{7248}{7335}and engineering we were using,|in terms of the camera system.
{7338}{7397}The R.O.V.s were amazing.
{7398}{7456}On the cutting edge|of technology.
{7458}{7533}Just try to keep the light in|right where I've gone in.
{7534}{7573}I'm gonna explore these cabins.
{7574}{7637}There is no script. We don't|know what we're gonna see.
{7639}{7705}We don't know|what we're gonna encounter.
{7706}{7785}The crucial thing|about deep-sea photography
{7787}{7824}is lighting.
{7826}{7902}Just come up over and light|all this business down here.
{7904}{7950}-You see what I mean?|-Yeah.
{7967}{8071}So we had a sister ship on|the expedition called the "EAS."
{8091}{8150}The "EAS" had|this giant lighting chandelier
{8153}{8188}called Medusa.
{8214}{8304}The theory was to lower the|chandelier down over the wreck
{8306}{8404}and do this overlighting,|almost like moonlight.
{8406}{8457}There was no manual|for any of this.
{8458}{8514}Nobody had ever combined|this many elements
{8516}{8602}into a single-dive operation|before at these depths.
{8646}{8718}We were pushing the limits|of technology,
{8720}{8755}which was a little eerie
{8757}{8829}given the fate of the ship|we had come to explore.
{8974}{9046}This is where it all happened.
{9049}{9089}It could be any other part|of the ocean,
{9090}{9126}but there's something special|about knowing
{9128}{9198}this is the spot|and the wreck's down there.
{9199}{9279}Why this shipwreck?|Why not the "Lusitania"?
{9281}{9350}Why not the "Moro Castle"?|Why not the "Atlantic"?
{9351}{9377}LYNCH:|They're all good.
{9378}{9426}They're all good,|but why is this one?
{9427}{9471}Look at the stuff|that comes with this.
{9473}{9541}You've got the biggest ship|on its maiden voyage,
{9542}{9598}the president of the company|onboard that owns it,
{9600}{9635}the builder onboard.
{9637}{9704}And it hits an iceberg,|and it sinks so slowly
{9706}{9783}that you've got all these hours|for drama to be acted out.
{9786}{9833}You don't get that|with other shipwrecks.
{9834}{9906}It's really a Greek tragedy|for real.
{9909}{9985}She was so cheated.|She was so beautiful.
{9986}{10059}So much energy went into|building this creation.
{10061}{10130}You know, the epitome|of human engineering
{10132}{10205}and architecture, maritime|architecture at that point.
{10207}{10273}And to have it taken away,|stolen,
{10274}{10346}just four days out of England.
{10347}{10465}And that's part, I guess,|of the odd attraction to it.
{10466}{10541}The fact that you could never|have such a thing happen
{10543}{10584}before or since.
{10586}{10658}The ship remains|at the bottom of the sea
{10659}{10701}as an eternal memorial.
{10702}{10753}And we can visit that memorial.
{10754}{10827}We can bear witness|to the event.
{10829}{10888}And if we're gonna do|interior exploration,
{10890}{10949}we have to do it now,|because five years from now,
{10950}{10983}there might not be anything.
{10985}{11040}Five years ago,|the technology didn't exist.
{11042}{11105}We had to will it|into existence.

{39914}{39966}PAXTON:|Copy that.
{39968}{40028}MARSCHALL: The grand staircase|on "Titanic"
{40030}{40112}was, in my opinion, the most|beautiful feature of the ship.
{40114}{40148}And the dome,
{40150}{40253}the wrought-iron dome overhead,|was just beautiful.
{40255}{40288}It's really a blessing
{40290}{40366}that this staircase|did break apart and float out,
{40368}{40490}because it allows easy access|to the interior of the ship.
{40570}{40608}What's Elwood's 20?
{40610}{40643}CAMERON:|Right above you.
{40645}{40713}Getting ready to start|our descent. Over.
{40781}{40815}Okay.|We see him.
{40817}{40843}That's them.
{40845}{40868}Okay.|We see you.
{40870}{40893}Okay.
{40895}{40947}Proceed slowly.
{40950}{41005}PAXTON:|Proceeding slowly.
{41150}{41223}This is so much|like flying a helicopter.
{41436}{41517}PAXTON: We knew the beauty|of the grand staircase was gone.
{41518}{41602}But no one knew what we'd find|deep inside the ship.
{41670}{41713}MARSCHALL:|Continue down one.
{41715}{41786}You're crossing the floor|of "B" deck right now.
{41788}{41842}You're looking|into "C" deck right now.
{41844}{41910}-Do not go into "C" deck.|-Awaiting instructions.
{41912}{41972}"C" deck. "D" deck.|There's "D" deck.
{42046}{42125}All right. He's in position|to enter "D" deck.
{42127}{42173}Stand by there, Jeff.
{42174}{42253}Your first move|would be to enter "D" deck.
{42254}{42302}Roger that.
{42304}{42354}You getting ready|to go down there?
{42356}{42430}Do I want to be pointed aft|or what?
{42432}{42462}Yeah. Okay.
{42464}{42502}Okay.|Tell him to move ahead slow.
{42505}{42554}Move ahead slow.
{42571}{42618}Moving ahead slow.
{43063}{43147}Tell him to move|real, real, real, real easy.
{43149}{43236}Move real, real,|real, real easy.
{43238}{43284}Real easy.
{43286}{43329}Moving real easy.
{43390}{43462}Believe we are heading|toward starboard.
{43534}{43597}We're looking|at a light fixture.
{43598}{43673}Looks like it had|four or five bulbs on it.
{43675}{43725}We should come to the right.
{43727}{43761}Come to the right, Jeff.
{43762}{43825}And we'll head|for the boiler uptake.
{43827}{43884}Copy that.
{43886}{43957}So far, the vehicle|is handling like a champ.
{44100}{44173}It's performing beautifully.|How much tether do we have out?
{44176}{44224}Just shy of 200 feet out.
{44227}{44249}Okay.
{44251}{44327}[ Sagalevitch speaking Russian ]
{44379}{44443}CAMERON:|Move forward to that doorframe.
{44536}{44603}We are inside the "Titanic."
{44651}{44713}-Tell him to slow down.|-I still can't get over it.
{44715}{44747}CAMERON:|Slow down.
{44749}{44782}PAXTON:|Copy that.
{44784}{44860}I still can't believe|that we're actually here.
{44934}{44981}I keep waiting for somebody|to yell, "Cut,"
{44983}{45040}and I'm gonna go back|to my trailer.
{45059}{45136}I don't think I can get out of|this and get back to my trailer.
{45138}{45174}My trailer!
{45194}{45241}I need to call my agent.
{45288}{45358}CAMERON: It's getting|a little skinny right in here.
{45360}{45457}Looks like Carlsbad Caverns|in there.
{45458}{45489}Is he pinned?
{45491}{45562}Is there no way forward|from there?
{45564}{45594}Go left.
{45596}{45620}Go left.
{45622}{45669}Making the turn.
{45766}{45833}That's too close to the bottom.|Tell them to come up.
{45834}{45882}You're too close to the bottom.
{45883}{45913}PAXTON:|Copy that.
{45915}{45953}Oh!
{45975}{46024}Boy, this is nerve-racking.
{46070}{46143}There's something there.|See what that is?
{46145}{46180}Windows, windows.
{46182}{46220}Dining-room windows.
{46222}{46293}-We're going for the window.|-We're going for the windows.
{46294}{46318}Look at that.
{46319}{46364}-Unbelievable.|-That's amazing.
{46366}{46397}Take it real slow here.
{46398}{46457}Those are|the lead-glass windows.
{46458}{46530}Try to get your light up|on those.
{46545}{46585}-Amazing, huh?|-Yes.
{46588}{46624}Turn off his spotlight.
{46627}{46663}Turn off your spotlight.
{46666}{46713}Make a nice image|of the windows.
{46714}{46787}Make a nice picture|of the windows in front of you.
{46789}{46836}PAXTON: Look at that.|Look at that.
{46838}{46865}Oh, boy!
{46866}{46946}Beautiful.|Still intact.
{46948}{46980}Very much intact.
{46982}{47016}Looks like the glass,
{47018}{47064}all the leaded glass,|it's all there.
{47066}{47101}It's not broken.
{47331}{47413}MARSCHALL: The first-class|dining room was beautiful.
{47414}{47484}Among the passengers who|ate here were John Jacob Astor
{47486}{47565}and his wife, Madeline,|who were on their honeymoon.
{47566}{47636}She would be widowed|before the end of the voyage.
{47673}{47749}We are not in Kansas anymore.
{47846}{47891}I think you got a friend.
{47893}{47977}Oh.|There's Sam.
{47979}{48029}Sam stopped by to say hello.
{48031}{48093}He's giving us the tour.
{48150}{48200}"Follow me," he says.
{48663}{48737}CAMERON: It's like a fantasy|in here, isn't it?
{48739}{48816}MARSCHALL: The craftsmanship.|The delicate beauty.
{48818}{48869}That human hands created|these windows,
{48871}{48942}that human eyes looked|at these windows.
{48943}{48990}And then you realize
{48993}{49097}that you're 12,500 feet|beneath the sea.
{49126}{49184}Oh, look at that woodwork.
{49186}{49283}That's all wood, Genya.|That's all carved wood.
{49285}{49343}But these things created by man,
{49345}{49433}in this dark abyss,|where they just shouldn't be.
{49435}{49480}They're not supposed to be here.
{49482}{49511}CAMERON:|Unbelievable.
{49513}{49571}Who would've thought|that would still be there?
{49573}{49625}It's the dream come true for me.
{49702}{49771}LYNCH: What's significant|about the reception room
{49773}{49832}is that this is where|Elizabeth Lines
{49834}{49866}overheard a conversation
{49868}{49911}between Captain Smith|and Bruce lsmay,
{49913}{49954}the owner of the "Titanic."
{49956}{50008}And she heard lsmay|telling Smith
{50010}{50095}to have the "Titanic" arrive|in New York a day early.
{50097}{50148}I think we're going to beat|"Olympic's" time
{50150}{50204}and arrive in New York|Tuesday night.
{50502}{50555}PAXTON: We're holding|at the first-class entrance,
{50558}{50603}starboard side.
{50681}{50755}Isn't that beautiful?|Gosh.
{50757}{50843}It looks like it's just been|made more beautiful by time.
{50845}{50913}LYNCH: "Titanic's" main|first-class entrance
{50915}{50944}was on "D" deck.
{50946}{51023}And she had|two large gangway doors
{51025}{51087}on both the port|and the starboard side.
{51089}{51145}Through the eyes of the R.O.V.,
{51146}{51229}we could see the wrought-iron|gates just inside the doors,
{51231}{51309}which were unknown to historians|until this expedition.
{51311}{51381}We had no idea what was inside,|and now we know.
{51382}{51441}CAMERON: This is the way|they boarded the ship.
{51442}{51535}They came in through that door,|and then this inner door.
{51687}{51747}MARSCHALL:|And in this entrance vestibule,
{51749}{51812}there was a large sideboard|against the aft wall
{51814}{51871}where lots of first-class china|was stored.
{51873}{51952}ABERNATHY: The dish cabinet|had more or less rotted away.
{51954}{52023}But you could see the teacups|and the little dishes
{52025}{52060}stacked perfectly there.
{52062}{52120}I wish I had those dishes,|you know?
{52122}{52170}Give it up on eBay.
{52202}{52262}CAMERON:|There's the elevators.
{52310}{52336}There's...
{52338}{52396}There's the shaft.
{52446}{52493}Look at that.
{52529}{52597}I thought they called them|"lifts," but you know what?
{52598}{52662}The ship was owned|by an American company.
{52685}{52719}Hmm.
{52721}{52775}Like you could|just call them now.
{52777}{52841}MARSCHALL: Whenever you're|looking at the elevator grilles,
{52843}{52905}try to remember to turn|and look forward and see.
{52908}{52968}There may still be paneling|right amidships,
{52970}{53019}and there will be|brass letters that say
{53022}{53074}"A" deck, "B" deck,|"C" deck, or "D" deck.
{53076}{53112}When you come out|of the elevators.
{53115}{53185}Most likely that paneling|is down. But you never know.
{53186}{53219}That would be a classic shot
{53221}{53273}to have that lettering|still clinging.
{53274}{53325}Ken loves this stuff.
{53327}{53457}I feel like I'm making a film|for one person. Ken Marschall.
{53458}{53522}And there it is.|Bingo, baby.
{53524}{53585}-Tell him "bingo."|-LEDDA: Bingo.
{53587}{53669}MARSCHALL: The "A" had recently|fallen from its own weight.
{53671}{53767}That brass letter was heavier|than the "D," "E," "C," "K."
{53786}{53857}Okay. I see where we are.|We just peeked into "D" 35.
{53859}{53928}PAXTON: We were methodical|exploring the interior.
{53930}{54023}We had to be because the wreck|can be very disorienting.
{54025}{54065}It was spooky.
{54116}{54150}"D" 33 was the cabin
{54152}{54222}of Henry Sleeper Harper|and his wife.
{54224}{54293}Sitting on the remains|of the wardrobe cabinet
{54294}{54357}is Henry Harper's bowler hat.
{54359}{54460}Just the idea|that we know whose it was.
{54545}{54606}CAMERON: Hey, look.|There's some kind of glass.
{54609}{54689}Maybe a mirror.|Let's see if that's a mirror.
{54692}{54772}It is.|We're gonna go see ourselves.
{54859}{54935}PAXTON: "A" 1 1 was occupied|by Edith Russell.
{54937}{54983}Before getting into a lifeboat,
{54985}{55051}she went back to her cabin|to lock her 19 trunks
{55053}{55121}because she didn't trust|the stewards onboard.
{55260}{55329}LYNCH: Jim was looking|for Molly Brown's stateroom.
{55331}{55397}We had a good idea|where that stateroom would be.
{55400}{55477}And he was searching|for a forward-facing window.
{55479}{55547}The R.O.V. is narrow enough|to scoot through that.
{55549}{55648}And I saw there was jagged glass|at the bottom of the windowsill.
{55650}{55723}That could sever the tether,|commit suicide.
{55725}{55763}Ken says we can do this.
{55765}{55797}LEDDA:|It's a gamble.
{55798}{55835}Don't do it.|Don't do it.
{55837}{55915}You're gonna be laying your|tether right across the glass.
{55917}{55983}CAMERON: There he goes.|He's in there.
{55985}{56038}That's what I'm talking about.
{56040}{56134}LYNCH: Okay, now that you're in,|it's not that bad of an idea.
{56137}{56205}That's not a brass bed.|That's a wooden bed.
{56207}{56243}It's kind of creepy.
{56246}{56264}I don't know.
{56266}{56331}Molly Brown said|she was in a brass bed.
{56333}{56381}I don't see a brass bed.
{56383}{56429}PAXTON:|Molly Brown was a character.
{56430}{56502}She and her husband had made|their fortune mining out west.
{56504}{56591}And she was desperate|to be accepted by high society.
{56593}{56663}The "Titanic" tragedy|made her a legend.
{56770}{56813}Uh, Genya?
{56815}{56837}Yes?
{56839}{56889}Um, I need to pee.
{56892}{56983}I don't think I can hold it|much longer.
{56985}{57010}-No problem.|-Okay.
{57013}{57046}PAXTON:|For me, personally,
{57048}{57145}I've always been kind of|a nervous, you know, pisser.
{57147}{57190}[ Laughing ]|I need a little privacy.
{57192}{57254}But when you got to go|and you're 2,5 miles down,
{57256}{57304}you got to go.
{57336}{57368}It's okay?
{57682}{57722}Um, I'll turn around.
{57725}{57761}-Can you turn around?|-Okay.
{57764}{57825}Thank you.|Thank you.
{57828}{57861}Let's see here.
{57914}{57967}Point your lights|straight into "A" deck.
{57969}{57997}My God.|Look at that.
{57999}{58027}Look at that, Tolya.
{58029}{58097}A brass bed sitting|right in there.
{58161}{58227}Maybe Molly Brown did stay|in a brass bed.
{58229}{58269}But which one?
{58374}{58441}ABERNATHY: They've built|bigger ships since "Titanic,"
{58442}{58529}but I don't know that they'll|ever build one as luxurious.
{58531}{58561}And even now,
{58564}{58629}after 90 years of laying|on the bottom of the ocean,
{58631}{58689}its beauty came to light.
{58875}{58923}Okay.|We're in.
{58925}{58993}Okay. Tell them|we're in the promenade.
{58994}{59033}LEDDA:|Jake's in the promenade.
{59035}{59093}MARSCHALL: We did get into one|of the millionaire suites
{59094}{59128}on "B" deck.
{59130}{59156}Private promenade.
{59158}{59204}They call them|"private promenade."
{59206}{59289}These were the fanciest, most|expensive lodgings on the ship.
{59292}{59324}And in April 1912,
{59326}{59424}you would have paid over $3,000|to book your passage.
{59426}{59501}This must be some of the facing.
{59502}{59566}Yeah, it's some|of the Tudor facing.
{59746}{59785}We are in the room.
{59787}{59821}LEDDA:|Jake's in the room.
{59822}{59865}This is Bruce lsmay's suite.
{59867}{59913}This is the guy|that left the ship
{59914}{59988}with 1,500 people still onboard.
{59990}{60029}Ooh, that's a beauty.
{60030}{60098}We are in the sitting room,|looking at the fireplace.
{60101}{60195}Isn't that amazing? That|ribbon design is still there.
{60197}{60249}These little touches|of elegance.
{60251}{60334}You can almost feel the hands|of the guy that made that.
{60470}{60497}LYNCH:|J. Bruce lsmay
{60498}{60556}was managing director|of the White Star Line,
{60558}{60625}and he vetoed the idea|of having 48 lifeboats.
{60626}{60661}He felt fewer would be fine,
{60662}{60741}that as long as they met|the law, they were okay.
{60879}{60922}CHERNAlEV:|It is Smith's bathtub.
{60925}{60964}ABERNATHY:|Oh, Captain Smith.
{60966}{60996}Wow.
{60998}{61036}The captain of the "Titanic"
{61039}{61114}used to take his baths|right there.
{61116}{61205}His little pink butt|sitting right there in the tub.
{61207}{61271}PAXTON: Captain Smith was called|"the millionaire's captain"
{61273}{61353}because he was so popular|with the first-class passengers.
{61354}{61426}30 years at sea.|Perfect record.
{61428}{61490}This voyage was to be|his crowning achievement.
{61492}{61585}He was going to take|the biggest, most beautiful ship
{61586}{61697}across the ocean on her|maiden voyage and then retire.
{61734}{61769}PELLEGRlNO:|In archeology,
{61770}{61842}we carry these ghosts|of the imagination with us.
{61845}{61905}And I was kind of imagining
{61907}{61973}Thomas Andrews|out there on the deck.
{62012}{62068}MARSCHALL: Thomas Andrews|was managing director
{62070}{62130}and president of|Harland and Wolff Shipbuilders.
{62132}{62197}He designed and built the|"Titanic" from the ground up.
{62198}{62236}He knew the ship better|than anyone.
{62238}{62306}He put davits on the ship|that were designed
{62308}{62377}to take a lifeboat from here|and lift it outward
{62378}{62430}and then go inward|and pick up a second lifeboat
{62432}{62469}in a second position and go out.
{62471}{62510}In his own hand,
{62513}{62584}in his notebook,|he has the number of lifeboats
{62587}{62665}that are supposed to go on the|ship that he designed it for.
{62666}{62702}He was overruled
{62704}{62770}and forced to comply|only to the minimum
{62772}{62853}of the Board of Trade|requirement.
{62885}{62944}MARSCHALL: Andrews cared|about the ship and crew
{62946}{63018}and was onboard to make|last-minute improvements
{63019}{63070}and make sure|everything ran smoothly.
{63072}{63132}PELLEGRlNO: If only there were|a way to let him see
{63134}{63225}these submersibles sending|these incredible robots
{63227}{63283}into his creation.
{63782}{63834}MlKE: Move a little right|to avoid the arm.
{63836}{63869}There you go.|Okay.
{63870}{63929}We're good.|We're coming out.
{63930}{63987}It's coming out, folks.
{63989}{64033}-Okay. Ease it forward.|-Okay.
{64035}{64110}MARSCHALL: We explored|all three forward cargo hatches
{64113}{64181}and made it into several crew|and third-class spaces
{64183}{64237}that had never even been|photographed before.
{64238}{64286}CAMERON:|Is that the "D" deck?
{64288}{64310}MAN:|I think so.
{64312}{64353}Yeah.|I think you're right.
{64355}{64421}All right. That's it.|There's the other hatch.
{64423}{64504}So just ease on in there.|Ease it on in there.
{64570}{64605}Okay.|Here's our stairwell.
{64606}{64649}It should go right up to it.
{64721}{64760}LYNCH:|So we got into third class.
{64762}{64850}We were in the general room|in the bow under the well deck.
{64852}{64933}There wasn't a lot of detail|in this room,
{64935}{65017}because it was never|a well-decorated room.
{65019}{65095}The bar at one end that|still had the little tap there.
{65097}{65162}There were table bases|still there in place.
{65164}{65238}The tables and bench bases|rising up from the floor.
{65240}{65283}It was neat to see those.
{65285}{65339}That's a very big table.
{65341}{65383}The place where they all ate.
{65385}{65438}They would've sat here|and played cards.
{65440}{65491}MARSCHALL: This was where|there was a party held
{65493}{65565}by many of the third-class|passengers on Sunday night.
{65567}{65640}And it really was moving|to be able see this room
{65642}{65720}where so many of them spent|their last few happy hours.
{65854}{65933}MlKE: There was a brand-new|Renault, beautiful car,
{65935}{65990}that was strapped down|in the cargo hold.
{65992}{66080}And we have some fairly good|historical projections
{66082}{66124}of what it would look like now.
{66126}{66203}CAMERON: Going from "F" deck|to "G" deck.
{66234}{66312}A solid hatch cover,|as advertised.
{66314}{66341}But it's open.
{66342}{66405}And it would be|barely recognizable as a car.
{66407}{66502}Only a few items would show up|recognizable as a vehicle.
{66505}{66573}We were on "G" deck.|We went through the hatch cover.
{66574}{66626}We are now on the orlop deck.
{66629}{66653}Correct.|You are.

{67804}{67846}All right,|the best thing to do

{67974}{67996}There's a car.
{67998}{68032}That's a car.
{68034}{68125}No, those are...|That's a trunk right there.

{68155}{68188}That's a tire.
{68190}{68282}There were some pretty|interesting-looking structures,
{68284}{68320}obviously man-made stuff,
{68323}{68406}but nothing clearly|identifiable as a car.
{68456}{68537}Yeah, we should be able to get|all the way forward.

{68692}{68721}Oh, baby.
{68746}{68841}That's awesome.|Oh, dude, this is so cool!
{68842}{68915}Count doors on the right. That's|how we'll orient ourselves.
{68918}{68965}There should be|two doors side by side.
{68968}{69040}The first door should take you|into the firemen's mess.
{69042}{69081}You want to go in there?
{69083}{69127}Yeah.
{69129}{69201}That's definitely|the firemen's mess.
{69203}{69267}Oh, look at that.|Table after table.
{69269}{69322}You can see the bow tapering in.
{69324}{69347}Exactly.
{69349}{69380}Shape of the ship.
{69382}{69453}You can imagine exactly|what this place looked like.
{69479}{69524}LYNCH:|The firemen were segregated
{69526}{69559}from the rest of the crew,
{69561}{69625}probably because they had|the dirtiest job.
{69627}{69684}So their quarters|are in the tip of the bow.
{69686}{69721}They had two staircases,
{69724}{69790}which took them|to the very bottom of the ship
{69793}{69841}and to the boiler rooms.
{69862}{69909}PAXTON:|lmagine spiraling your way down
{69910}{69972}to the furnaces|of this hungry leviathan
{69974}{70038}to join hundreds of men|shoveling coal
{70040}{70110}into the gaping maws|of the boilers.
{70207}{70258}That's kind of spooky.
{70696}{70763}And when you finish your shift|hours later,
{70765}{70835}you climb back up into|your little world below decks
{70837}{70925}at the very bow of the ship,|where you eat, you sleep,
{70926}{70985}then you do it all over again.
{71025}{71117}Even here, we could feel|the hand of Thomas Andrews.
{71119}{71177}At the top of one|of the spiral staircases,
{71178}{71232}we found a drinking fountain.
{71234}{71297}I'm sure that even|this small kindness
{71300}{71360}must have been|greatly appreciated.
{71474}{71600}Here we've got a plan|that illustrates pretty well
{71602}{71641}what happened that night.
{71643}{71754}The "Titanic" was divided into|1 6 watertight compartments
{71756}{71834}separated by|1 5 watertight bulkheads.
{71836}{71887}That's these white lines here.
{71889}{71977}And the ship was designed to be|as unsinkable as they could.
{71979}{72029}The worst they could imagine|is a collision
{72031}{72067}at the juncture|of two compartments,
{72069}{72130}which would flood|two adjacent compartments.
{72133}{72205}The ship would only sink so far|and still be safe.
{72208}{72272}She was also designed to float
{72274}{72369}with any three of the first five|compartments flooded.
{72371}{72449}Or the first four in a row|could still flood
{72451}{72496}if they were in some|traumatic...
{72498}{72551}That was|the worst-case scenario.
{72553}{72624}Run into a rock or something|like that, just full-on.
{72626}{72690}She'd buckle back,|and the ship could still float.
{72692}{72776}With all of this combination|of safety factors,
{72778}{72817}she was considered|virtually unsinkable.
{72819}{72903}What they didn't envision|is what happened that night.
{72990}{73034}"Titanic" struck the iceberg,
{73036}{73091}a glancing blow|along the starboard side,
{73093}{73168}scraped along and ruptured|plates or split the seams,
{73170}{73219}moving along into|this cargo compartment,
{73221}{73290}into this cargo compartment,|and this baggage and cargo,
{73292}{73325}into Boiler Room Number 6
{73326}{73389}and two feet|into the coal bunker
{73391}{73428}of Boiler Room Number 5.
{73430}{73459}And as the ship sank,
{73461}{73525}just at the point where it was|about ready to stabilize,
{73527}{73588}it reached the top of this|watertight subdivision,
{73590}{73648}and started flowing up|the stairways, across the deck
{73650}{73697}and down into|the next compartment.
{73699}{73751}It was just|a mathematical certainty.
{73754}{73812}There was no way,|no matter how you slice it,
{73814}{73867}that the ship|is going to make it.
{73915}{73964}So where exactly did it split?
{73966}{74044}Well, it broke in two|right back here.
{74046}{74132}Just right about at|the third funnel and after that.
{74134}{74232}There's a natural weak spot|here in the hull
{74234}{74284}right above|the reciprocating engine room.
{74286}{74358}There is a large air shaft here|for light and air
{74360}{74428}to ventilate|the reciprocating engine room.
{74447}{74489}PAXTON:|My God.
{74491}{74569}What that must have|sounded like, looked like.
{74571}{74639}What that must have been like.
{74641}{74733}What a deathblow|to this great ship.
{74866}{74960}Imagine the vortex to create|that kind of twisting.
{74962}{74989}That's what gets me.
{74990}{75060}Seeing the end of the stern|piece, and seeing how...
{75062}{75177}Can't you just see one|of those fish swimming along?
{75179}{75215}And then...
{75217}{75272}[ lmitates crashing ]
{75274}{75329}And you know|what the fish would've done?
{75331}{75379}"Whoa," you know?
{75410}{75425}Exactly.
{75428}{75500}Our best shot is probably|of the reciprocating engines
{75503}{75548}on the starboard side, right?
{75550}{75579}That's the guts of it.
{75581}{75610}Starboard side.
{75612}{75692}CHERNAlEV: Sometimes I see him|come here and come up.
{75694}{75729}Yes.|That's good.
{75731}{75761}-Good.|-Like that.
{75762}{75901}And I lose, sometimes, good|shots when Victor stays here.
{75902}{75928}Right.
{75930}{75995}But the thing is|that Victor can't face us.
{75997}{76065}He can't, otherwise his lights|will hit the camera.
{76067}{76145}He has to be above|with the lights down,
{76147}{76189}or like this.
{76192}{76261}Yes.|Maybe here.
{76279}{76381}So sort of this.|This sort of thing.
{76383}{76444}See, if the water is clear,|that'll make a good shot.
{76446}{76498}The engine room,|where those guys were fighting
{76500}{76536}to keep that thing alive.
{76538}{76629}They were "Titanic."|They knew it was dying.
{76630}{76677}They didn't die|with a brandy glass in hand.
{76678}{76789}They died with a monkey wrench,|trying to stop the bleeding.
{77001}{77072}PAXTON:|That is the starboard engine.
{77074}{77109}Look at that.
{77110}{77162}Oh, man!
{77164}{77234}Look at the size of that thing.
{77388}{77477}Okay, keep panning, because I'm|gonna be coming around this way.
{77571}{77608}Oh, man.
{77610}{77677}It does give you the scale,|seeing that little bot
{77680}{77749}next to that giant sphinx|of an engine.
{78141}{78230}PAXTON: When you see the stern|section where it tore in half,
{78232}{78286}and there are|the two reciprocating engines
{78288}{78345}standing four stories high,
{78346}{78445}they really do look like|these twin sphinxes
{78446}{78524}that are guarding|the forbidden tomb.
{79059}{79122}JOHNSTON: When the historians|look at "Titanic,"
{79124}{79207}they think of the lives|that were lost.
{79209}{79268}When I look at the ship|as a scientist,
{79270}{79367}I look at the life|that still is on "Titanic."
{79370}{79435}"Titanic" is very much alive.
{79485}{79618}Rusticles are bacteria --|microscopic organisms, bugs --
{79620}{79683}that are actually eating|the steel
{79685}{79732}and the insides of the ship.
{79734}{79859}I look at a rail and think,|"Oh, look at the bacteria.
{79861}{79949}They're breaking 'Titanic' down|and taking her back to nature."
{79950}{80010}But then you immediately|go back and think,
{80012}{80072}"Who touched this railing last? "
{80151}{80235}PELLEGRlNO: Helen Candee is one|of my favorite passengers.
{80238}{80320}She had written one of the|century's first best sellers.
{80322}{80358}Basically, the theme being
{80360}{80429}how a woman can get along|in life successfully
{80430}{80458}without a man.
{80460}{80553}And that's how she was traveling|first-class on the "Titanic."
{80554}{80622}And on the very last sunrise
{80624}{80670}that the "Titanic"|would ever see,
{80672}{80753}she snuck out|to the very point of the bow
{80754}{80809}just to greet the sunrise alone.
{80810}{80854}And she wrote about it
{80856}{80931}and how she felt the power|and the beauty of this ship
{80934}{81009}and that it was stronger|than nature itself,
{81012}{81072}maybe even stronger|than God itself.
{81074}{81129}And then, suddenly,|she felt very darkened,
{81131}{81225}as if she had thought|something sacrilegious.
{81546}{81590}Mmm. It's good.|What's in borscht?

{82182}{82235}about the blue sky that you see
{82237}{82318}when you return to the surface|and the hatch opens.
{82320}{82395}And I think that's very apropos,|because it's something
{82397}{82492}that you didn't think|you would miss, but you do.
{82724}{82793}It's very difficult to wander|through the "Keldysh"
{82794}{82899}and not think of the "Titanic"|and draw some parallel.

{83006}{83037}hadn't stayed at their station
{83039}{83129}when the "Titanic" had gone|dark, say, an hour earlier?

{86634}{86752}has really allowed us to do|a great deal of research.
{86754}{86793}You could actually see

{86892}{86940}and fingerlike structures

{92132}{92208}it really looked familiar.
{92210}{92284}A long, sweeping, open deck.|Half of it was open.
{92287}{92363}The forward end was enclosed|by large glass windows.
{92365}{92428}CAMERON: This is right where|they walked, you know?
{92429}{92495}John Jacob Astor put|Madeline Astor into the lifeboat
{92497}{92561}right through one|of those windows right there.
{92589}{92632}LYNCH:|Because she was pregnant,
{92634}{92681}he asked|Second Officer Lightoller...
{92682}{92715}May I accompany my wife?
{92717}{92764}No, sir.|Women and children only.
{92765}{92779}Come on.
{92781}{92828}Here, darling.|Take these.
{92829}{92897}And so he told her|he'd be seeing her in New York.
{92900}{92941}No, sir.|Step aside.
{92997}{93092}I've been thinking about|my family a lot being out here,
{93094}{93137}and we're going on these dives.
{93138}{93200}There's an element|of risk involved.
{93201}{93231}It's a calculated risk.
{93233}{93304}But I think the idea|of suddenly being on the deck
{93306}{93369}and saying, "l love you,"|you know,
{93371}{93410}and trying to bear up.
{93412}{93453}"Now, just go in the lifeboats.
{93455}{93507}Daddy will be along|in a little while."
{93509}{93552}That's just torturous.
{93553}{93625}Trying to make your family|think that it's okay.
{93627}{93701}You're just keeping up|a brave face.
{93704}{93727}Exactly.
{93729}{93791}Also, it's the question|of personal character
{93793}{93836}that you keep going back to.
{93837}{93907}For me, ever since|I was a teenager,
{93909}{93989}the whole idea|is the question of,
{93990}{94036}how would I have beared up?
{94037}{94094}Would I have had the character|to stand back
{94096}{94177}and shown that kind of nobility,|shown that kind of courage?
{94179}{94306}And as we romanticize|the image of "Titanic,"
{94308}{94369}and it's such a romantic time|and everything,
{94371}{94406}you want to put yourself
{94408}{94457}with the men|standing there with dignity.
{94459}{94537}But you really can't assume
{94540}{94606}what your character would be|in that moment
{94608}{94671}unless you've been through|that kind of thing.
{94673}{94716}Absolutely.
{94717}{94789}SAGALEVlTCH: You see the doors,|the entrance to first class?
{94791}{94825}Yeah.|That's the entrance.
{94827}{94913}This is where the band played.|This open area right here.
{94915}{94953}The orchestra|would have gathered,
{94955}{95012}and they started playing|ragtime.
{95013}{95106}[ "Alexander's Ragtime Band"|playing ]
{95108}{95185}LYNCH: You think of the band in|terms of how heroic they were.
{95187}{95245}They played,|knowing that everyone else
{95246}{95300}was getting into a lifeboat|except them.
{95302}{95351}But how calming|that band music was
{95353}{95413}to the people who were onboard.
{95533}{95561}Okay.
{95563}{95669}This right over here|should be the Marconi Room.
{95670}{95732}MARSCHALL: Everyone knows|the important role
{95733}{95805}that the Marconi Wireless played|that night.
{95806}{95879}Senior Marconi Wireless Operator|Jack Phillips
{95881}{95959}and Junior Operator|Harold Bride worked in tandem
{95961}{95993}until the very end.
{95994}{96064}You should try S.O.S.|It's the new signal.
{96066}{96157}Yes, it might be|our last chance to use it.
{96160}{96220}During the final moments|of the sinking,
{96222}{96291}the ship's power|was becoming unstable.
{96293}{96349}Harold Bride|was in the Silent Room,
{96351}{96454}trying to compensate|for this loss of power.
{96456}{96537}To our great astonishment|are the handles,
{96539}{96624}the settings still visible|on these two field regulators.
{96625}{96730}They are in the final settings|that this man manipulated.
{96732}{96762}Hey, that's better!
{96764}{96820}They have the human touch|to them.
{96948}{96981}MAN:|Pull!
{97004}{97033}Pull together!
{97035}{97091}PAXTON: Many of the boats|had been launched half-full.

{97199}{97268}-Boat 6! Return.|-We need to go back!
{97269}{97301}No!
{97318}{97395}It's our lives now.|Now, row!
{97397}{97478}The suction will pull us down|if we don't keep going.
{97480}{97535}ABERNATHY: "Titanic" was|a stage where God says,
{97537}{97623}"You have 2,5 hours to|act out the rest of your life.
{97625}{97667}What are you gonna be?

{98288}{98339}I think it's fortunate|that most of us

{98746}{98807}He's the guy|who was responsible.
{98809}{98897}And yet he did survive,|when others died.
{98898}{98940}Right and left together!
{98941}{99014}PAXTON: I don't know which man|would've felt worse that night.
{99016}{99102}Bruce lsmay,|for vetoing more lifeboats,
{99104}{99130}or Thomas Andrews,
{99132}{99196}for not having fought|that decision harder.
{99325}{99381}PELLEGRlNO: There was|absolute pandemonium,
{99382}{99453}just chaos as those|last boats went down.
{99455}{99495}Get back, I say!

{99543}{99625}Get back!|Link arms! Form a chain!
{99627}{99687}Women and children only,|please!
{99717}{99741}It was precarious.
{99743}{99851}There was one lifeboat where|they weren't letting adults in.
{99853}{99903}This forced women to decide
{99905}{99960}whether they were gonna be|separated from their children.
{99961}{100008}They were trying to take|children only.
{100009}{100072}There were so many people|and a few lifeboats.
{100074}{100171}Several women said, "l am not|going without my children.
{100173}{100219}They're not leaving without me."
{100221}{100261}They overcrowded that lifeboat,
{100263}{100306}but the water was so calm,|it made it.
{100308}{100386}It had over 70 people,|but the water was calm enough.
{100388}{100431}It must have been up|to the gunwales.
{100433}{100476}It was that far above the water.
{100477}{100557}You could've put your hand over|and trailed it in the water.
{100582}{100619}PAXTON:|At the very end,
{100621}{100685}Murdoch was trying to get|collapsible "A" off the roof
{100687}{100747}while the ship|was sinking out from under it.
{100749}{100786}Get back!|Get back!

{100935}{100969}Crank this down there, men!
{100970}{101005}They cranked the davits in
{101008}{101061}to drag the collapsible|over the side.
{101062}{101121}But by then, it was too late.
{101167}{101219}[ Water rushing ]
{101333}{101424}The number-one davit remains|in that cranked-in position,
{101425}{101457}an unspoken monument

{101561}{101601}LYNCH:|After the lifeboats had gone,
{101603}{101665}we have evidence of some|third-class passengers
{101667}{101709}just going back to their cabins.
{101711}{101801}They had no hope of surviving,|and they took it gracefully.
{101803}{101885}[ Creaking, rattling ]

{102662}{102729}To me, it must have been tough|for the people who survived,

{102792}{102856}and rescued some of the people|in the water
{102857}{102904}once the ship had gone under.
{102905}{102956}To go in there|would have been suicide
{102958}{102984}and nothing less.
{102986}{103048}We've got 1,500 people|in the water
{103050}{103120}all screaming for help,|fighting for their lives.
{103121}{103177}You could easily have|50, 100 people
{103178}{103225}trying to climb onboard at once.
{103226}{103309}They're sitting|in a lifeboat, safe.
{103312}{103389}To not row back or to have that|not in your mind,
{103391}{103440}I can't believe that|of somebody.
{103443}{103488}How safe are you in a lifeboat

{103712}{103747}Heroism and character
{103749}{103830}will always be the domain of|the individual, not the group.
{103832}{103892}That's what will never change.
{103974}{104008}LYNCH:|On one of the later dives,
{104009}{104094}Jim decided to go back into the|first-class spaces on "D" deck
{104097}{104136}and have "Mir-2" shine lights
{104138}{104200}through those leaded-glass|windows from the outside.
{104202}{104249}-Getting ready?|-Yes.
{104250}{104289}Here comes the light.
{104291}{104338}MARSCHALL:|Nice.
{104341}{104380}Perfect.
{104623}{104689}MARSCHALL:|Not since April 14, 1912,
{104690}{104752}had human eyes seen light
{104753}{104836}pouring through|these beautiful windows.
{104933}{105005}LYNCH: A lot of the washstands|have fallen over,
{105006}{105072}yet here was one|that was still upright.
{105073}{105124}And so someone took|a drink of water,
{105125}{105195}set that glass down,|and walked out of that room,
{105197}{105287}and 90 years later, that glass|and that carafe are still there.
{105289}{105386}CAMERON: In the middle of this,|you see this perfect object.
{105388}{105430}It really ties you|to the people.
{105432}{105469}It does.

{106404}{106452}Uh-oh.|Are we gonna lose this thing?
{106453}{106479}Oh, Jesus.

{107113}{107164}PAXTON: The whole thing|was melting down.
{107166}{107238}The batteries, they|were melting down and venting.
{107240}{107264}It was very bizarre.
{107266}{107335}It was like,|"Houston, we have a problem."
{107386}{107459}They flew beautifully|right up until the point
{107461}{107565}that we had an absolute, total|major-malfunction system crash.
{107625}{107664}CAMERON:|I've had a debate with myself
{107666}{107727}as to whether I would|even ever try a rescue,
{107729}{107777}because better to lose one|than two.
{107779}{107811}It's almost a straight shot,
{107813}{107866}except there's a couple|of columns in the way.
{107868}{107925}I think there's a way|to bring it back.
{107927}{107994}Yeah, it's not too far|from the stairwell.
{107996}{108018}No.
{108020}{108106}But the first thing we got to do|is get some weight on it.
{108109}{108160}The weight with a piece|of Velcro on top.
{108162}{108200}I want to fly up underneath it
{108203}{108250}and stick the weight|to the bottom,
{108252}{108281}sink it to the floor,
{108282}{108341}then come up, dock with it|and carry it out.
{108343}{108395}That's the only way to do it.
{108397}{108456}Let me know|if I'm going too fast.
{108566}{108613}PAXTON:|We had to rescue Elwood,

{109415}{109461}See, we're thrusting|up against it,

{110796}{110848}"Say goodbye to Jake"?
{110902}{110940}What's happened?
{110941}{110984}Hit our own tether.

{111086}{111131}He goes through|a range of emotions.
{111133}{111237}He loses one robot.|Then he loses a second robot.
{111271}{111320}Well, we got|our ceiling scenario,
{111323}{111370}and we got our kite scenario.
{111409}{111513}The two ways we thought we could|actually lose these things.
{111605}{111669}LYNCH:|And after a quick exchange,
{111671}{111732}we noticed the tether|coming up past our sub.
{111733}{111828}Genya grabs the joysticks that|control the sub manipulators.
{111829}{111904}And he grabs the tether|and starts winding the tether up
{111906}{111952}around the arms|of the manipulators.
{111953}{112009}This is scary.|See what he's doing?
{112011}{112079}If he breaks it|before he gets a wrap on it...
{112117}{112204}Oh, my God.|I can't watch this.
{112206}{112259}You're scaring me now, Genya.
{112261}{112325}To wind up this tether,|it took 30, 35 minutes
{112327}{112385}of the same motion|over and over and over,
{112387}{112413}winding this up.

{112747}{112800}and slap it on top of the robot
{112801}{112902}with the manipulator arms|and pull the robot in that way.
{112905}{112955}-You got him.|-Still got it.
{112994}{113037}As Genya is pulling up on it,
{113038}{113109}the Velcro rips off the robot,|and for this brief second,
{113111}{113181}the entire robot was free|and starts floating back up.
{113183}{113230}There's no tether holding it.
{113232}{113292}It's free. Grab it.|Grab it any way you can.
{113293}{113368}Genya, the most amazing operator|of any machinery
{113369}{113456}I've ever seen in my life,|grabbed these manipulators.
{113457}{113526}He pulls it back in|and hugs it tight to the "Mir."
{113528}{113573}I'm going gray over here.
{113622}{113670}I think he's got it|in that garage.

{114308}{114377}The R.O.V. department|was almost out of a job.
{114378}{114411}Was that amazing?
{114413}{114499}That was the most amazing|thing I've ever seen.
{114501}{114549}I think I aged a year.
{114551}{114609}And we sat there,|and we just watched him
{114610}{114664}just fly up|out of the grand staircase
{114665}{114692}and keep on going.
{114694}{114797}Genya wound it all in like|a kid winding up a kite string.
{114798}{114836}Great job, man.|Good job.
{114838}{114888}So we got the rescue half done.
{114890}{114969}We installed the weight,|and then we had a problem.
{114971}{115050}We saw it with the weight|hanging on it.
{115052}{115100}I don't know|if it came down or not.
{115101}{115184}I think metal hooks would work|if you get a fishing lure
{115186}{115233}that you can stab|into the screen
{115235}{115294}and pull it out by the screen.
{115562}{115622}CAMERON:|I told you we'd nab him.
{115648}{115686}LEDDA: Just remember,|when you hook up,
{115688}{115742}peel away to your right.
{115857}{115887}Come on, baby.
{115947}{115984}-We're in.|-We're in.
{115986}{116020}-ln?|-We're in.
{116021}{116110}Now I'm gonna sit for a minute.
{116165}{116214}Take a little break.
{116217}{116293}Very good.|Excellent. Excellent.
{116295}{116330}We're halfway.
{116358}{116413}There's nothing in front of him.
{116415}{116500}Push him a little bit,|and I think we busted loose.
{116502}{116554}-Hooks pulled out.|-Put him in the cage.
{116556}{116580}Hooks pulled out.
{116582}{116671}And I think|we knocked him off his weight.
{116703}{116772}Yeah, the weight would've|come off anyway, though.
{116809}{116836}All right.
{116838}{116892}The question is,|do we have another try?
{116894}{116929}Something's right over me.
{116931}{116981}Oh, there we go.|Got rid of that.
{116984}{117008}Now we're rising.
{117011}{117077}All right.|Time to go for the kill.
{117079}{117128}Okay.|Not the center.
{117130}{117175}We could bend our hooks|on the --
{117177}{117204}Oh, that looked good.
{117206}{117309}Push him a little bit,|then all back full, yaw right.
{117311}{117341}The hooks still there?
{117343}{117368}Negative.
{117370}{117392}It looks good.
{117393}{117461}Let's go for a drive|and see if he comes with us.
{117509}{117590}Oh, I'm yawing in a weird way,|so that must mean I have him,
{117592}{117644}so I'm just gonna|keep playing him.
{117645}{117708}I'm gonna play the hand.
{117711}{117781}I think the door is down there.|Tell him we're here.
{117783}{117841}"Mir-1," we see the door.|We're on station.
{117842}{117885}There's the light.

{118334}{118438}We are hung up solid.|Absolutely solid.
{118440}{118471}Nothing.
{118526}{118569}I think we lost it.

{120905}{120926}Whoo.
{120929}{120962}Great job.
{120964}{121000}Everybody did a great job.
{121003}{121076}MARSCHALL:|Elwood is safe and sound.
{121078}{121262}And the time is 6: 16,|September 1 1, 2001.
{121295}{121325}See you later.
{121454}{121496}What's this thing|that's going on?
{121497}{121559}The worst terrorist attack|in history, Jim.
{121561}{121626}CAMERON: We all were wrapped up|in what we were doing
{121628}{121673}and thought it was important.
{121675}{121750}Hit by two separate|hijacked commercial jets...
{121753}{121803}And then this horrible event|happened
{121805}{121854}and slammed us|into this perspective.
{121857}{121881}God.
{122037}{122109}LYNCH: The morning after|the attack on September 1 1th,
{122111}{122200}I kept thinking how trivial|this expedition suddenly became.
{122201}{122278}It just wasn't a big deal|anymore.
{122451}{122548}MARSCHALL: The emotional|parallels came first.
{122551}{122598}We now understood|what it felt like
{122601}{122669}to be a witness to tragedy.
{122670}{122730}The sense of shock and numbness
{122733}{122833}and the disbelief that|the unthinkable has happened.
{122834}{122872}It does happen.
{122874}{122935}Occasionally,|life sits on your head.
{123005}{123105}But, hey,|I've been knocked down before.
{123107}{123153}We all have.|We get up.
{123155}{123189}We go on.
{123284}{123347}I think|that's what makes us great.
{123482}{123573}PAXTON: Everyone decided|to continue the expedition.
{123574}{123649}I think that after we'd|gotten over the initial shock,
{123651}{123717}"Titanic" did seem to become|important again.
{123718}{123785}Not so much for itself,|but as a symbol
{123787}{123854}of what can happen|when warnings go unheeded
{123856}{123920}and how I think|we all hope to face death
{123921}{123956}when it comes.
{123997}{124093}PELLEGRlNO: Archie Frost was|in the engine room that night.
{124096}{124161}Just barely into his twenties
{124163}{124226}and had worked|with Thomas Andrews
{124229}{124276}when the ship was being built.
{124278}{124363}After a certain point, Andrews|had come down and told them,
{124365}{124431}"The ship does not have|much time to live,
{124433}{124529}and if you stay here,|you will die."
{124531}{124565}Archie Frost said,
{124567}{124664}"We'll stay here as long|as we need to be here."
{124666}{124712}Those are the everyday heroes.
{124713}{124761}The people|who ran those machines,
{124762}{124800}kept the generators running,
{124802}{124865}and kept power|for the telegraph going,
{124867}{124957}who kept the crowds calm.
{124960}{125078}You find the ordinary hero|that was standing next to you.
{125357}{125431}PAXTON:|When you see the stern
{125433}{125507}where 1,500 people had died,
{125509}{125564}I don't really know|how to describe it.
{125753}{125812}MARSCHALL: You can't help|but be emotional.
{125813}{125878}There's no doubt|people were taken to the bottom
{125880}{125911}in the stern.
{125913}{125952}But they're no longer there.
{125954}{126007}Every trace|of their human existence
{126009}{126065}has been dissolved|into the ocean.
{126101}{126132}CAMERON:|Okay, "Mir-2."
{126133}{126220}Get in position|to lay the plaque.
{126221}{126315}LYNCH: Jim, getting into|position to lay plaque.
{126441}{126531}PAXTON: "The 1,500 souls|lost here still speak,
{126533}{126628}reminding us always|that the unthinkable can happen
{126630}{126756}but for our vigilance, humility,|and compassion."
{126785}{126833}Goodbye.
{127161}{127227}We had been at sea a long time.
{127229}{127324}I was thinking about|being home again.
{127504}{127559}On the final day, as we left,
{127561}{127629}at the stern of the ship|was a white rainbow.
{127630}{127752}It was almost like a halo effect|over the wreck of the "Titanic."
{127753}{127845}And it had an ethereal feel|to it.
{127870}{127960}I think you leave "Titanic,"|but it never leaves you.
{127961}{127999}It's always there.
{128001}{128072}And many times,|when I close my eyes,
{128073}{128216}I'm suddenly back there,|floating over the wreck,
{128218}{128295}and I feel like I am|a ghost of the abyss.

Mini, you see, set a particular trend of every freedom fighter... for our country that... it's freedom or death.
He had this incredible bass voice, he was an incredible composer of song... and that every week seemed to produce a new song.
And that, uh, that--
He was also, probably because of this amazing bass voice, was one of the best organizers in the liberation movement.
So, song had become an organizer, and I think he was the embodiment of this reality.
[ Woman ] If you meet somebody who knew our father, he will tell you that your father was the greatest.

Do you think that when they report... cases of ill treatment of Africans... that they're really exaggerating?

There are, here and there, a little whipping, you know, and that sort of thing.
That you find everywhere, perhaps, in the world.
Our policy is one... which is called by an Afrikaans word,

Apartheid was schizophrenic.
If you look at apartheid as a-- as a character, uh, this individual, he was a very schizophrenic character.
One minute smiling, but by the very same token--
uh, the very same-- the very same minute, murdering.
We don't even know how deeply this affected us, because apartheid has affected all of us.
You know, white, black-- across the board.
The only thing is that we-- maybe we don't want to admit it, you see?
[ Ibrahim ]
Here's a mother, a black mother, standing with her child, right?
Little black child at the bus stop.
Okay? The bus comes, and the bus stops, and the mother lets the bus go.
The bus is empty.
Now, this child wants to know from the mother, why did they not get on the bus?
What they actually did was they created the laws, but we had to execute them.
[ Ibrahim ]
The thing that saved us was music.
So the music was actually-- is not even what we call
"liberation music" or what.
It was part of liberating ourselves.
[ People Singing
In African Dialect ]
It's not a revolutionary song, as we would call some of the songs that we sang.
You know, it's a prayer.
"Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika".
It's a very g-g-genuine, soothing, very unthreatening prayer.
[ Singing In
African Dialect ]
[ Ndlovu ] You know, it has survived the times.
I think it was written in somewhere in the late 1800s, and it's still here with us today.
-Amandla!
-Awethu!
"Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika" became the alternative anthem... for people who were opposed to the apartheid regime.
So it was a song that was sung at the beginning of meetings and at the end of the meetings.
You had mothers trying to instill... a sense of fear.
"You will not sing
'Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika'... because the state does not like it".
At schools, it-- it stopped.
Somewhere from the cracks of all of that repression, you'd find the song permeating.
Because a schoolteacher in the schools... would refuse to just think that this is a subversive song, and you'd hear that song being sung.
And you would know that it was a sign of protest.
And everybody would feel very great just by listening to them.
[ Kwaito ]
Second segment of "Youth
Crossfire" now in full effect.
Talking about freedom songs.
Liberation songs that were sung by activists, protestors.
Looking at just how these songs were used to mobilize... and to strengthen the community at large.
Well, I suppose times where... they were mostly used when people were very angry.
-Mm-hmm.
-Irrational.
-Right.
-Facing bullets with stones.
The freedom songs evoked a kind of pride in me, which kwaito does not.
There was no age-group boundary for freedom songs.
Absolutely not. You could be standing next to a 60-year-old woman... who would be singing
"Senzenina" or whatever.
[ Singing In
African Dialect ]
And there would be a bond and an immediate kind of acknowledgment... of commonality in what we were about.
Now, now, now, do you think older comrades appreciate, um--
-Are you talking to me?
-I'm talking to you, yeah.
-I'm talking to you.
-I'm not an older comrade.
[ Laughing ]
However, I do believe... that I'm kind of like a bridge between that generation,
because I remember the '80s. -Mm-hmm.
And I remember singing freedom songs, and I remember running away from police.
Right. -I also wake up in the morning and groove to Phat Joe.
-You know?
-Yeah. Yeah.
Where do these songs come from?
Where do they originate from? Who wrote them?
Do we know the people?
Do you know who put them together?
[ Singing In
African Dialect ]
African people always made music. -Right.
Nobody ever said,
"I wrote this song in three minutes," or "I wrote it in three months. This is my song".
-Mm-hmm.
-Because you start a song, and someone backs you, and people just build up a song.
What I'm saying is that song didn't give birth to struggle.
-Yeah? Struggle gave birth to--
-No.
-Which one came first?
-Struggle gave birth to song.
No. No, no, no, no.
That's not true.
[ All Speaking At Once ]
[ People Arguing ]
We are a spiritual people, and one of the ways of expressing spirituality is through song.
One of the ways that an African... feels closer to his creator... or her creator is through song.
We were raised in families and homes... where our parents would break into song at the slightest provocation.
When your mother couldn't figure out what to feed you for that night... because she didn't have any money-- she came back from looking for a job-- she would break into a dirge that would be expressing how she felt.
[ Whistle Blowing ]
[ Man Narrating ] Every day of the year, except Sundays and holidays, trains come to a halt... at this siding in Johannesburg.
Every day they unload cheap cargoes of human labor.
Without these men, the economy of South Africa would collapse.
When all our land was taken, and we had to go to... the urban areas to look for work, the train is what we had to get on.
So, the train has always been a symbol of something... that took away your mother or your father... or your parents or your loved one.
[ Masekela ]
Because the train was... really South Africa's first tragedy.

[ Whistles ]
[ Man Narrating ]
It happened on Monday,
March 21, 1960. [ Shouting ]
Several hundred natives gathered peacably... to protest the pass laws.
Police, mounted on tanks, opened fire.
Sixty-nine natives were killed,
176 wounded.
Most of the victims were shot in the back.
[ Siren Wailing ]
...black South Africa went into shock.
[ Choir Singing
In African Dialect ]
[ Man Narrating ] Is the voice of protest heard in South Africa?
Most of the opposition has been stilled by banning or arrest... and no longer can their words be heard or read.
[ Ndlovu ] Nelson Mandela had been sent away forever, and that was how it was to our parents.
And the government had kind of introduced... this blanket fear among people.
[ Choir Continues Singing
"Thina Sizwe" ]
[ Ndlovu ] I was traveling with my father to a train station.
We were going somewhere, dressed nicely in our suits, and my father was holding me.
I was about nine years old.
I was just learning to read.
And there was a graffiti at the train station that said,
"Free Mandela or bombs".
And my father actually slapped me.
Because I was reading.
I was just learning to read.
And something there--
"Free Mandela or bombs".
My father couldn't read or write.
So, I mean, to him, he must have wondered... why I shout Mandela's name in public and stuff like that.
You know, there was that kind of thing. That's what happened to song.
[ Ndlovu ]
You couldn't just break out into song... and sing any type of song in the streets.
I've spoken about
"Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika".
You couldn't sing Miriam Makeba's songs. You would get arrested.
Whether we like it or not, um, the spirit of the people... was broken by the shootings, by the banning of the organizations, by the exodus of leadership into exile.
Exile was a spiritual desert.
That's what I have always called it.
It's an emptiness.
It's a spiritual--
You go into this-- the Kalahari of the spirit.
I took my little girl from here when she was nine, and she came to join me in America.
She never came back, 'cause she died before we came back.
And, uh, my mother died.
I couldn't come and bury her.
The hardest thing in exile... was dreaming.
Because you would dream that you were at home.
[ Chuckles ] Imagine sitting in New York and dreaming that you were at home, then waking up to the reality that you're not and you can't go.
You can't go back.
I remember my first year,
I was sitting in Central Park, and I was talking to myself.
I hadn't spoken Zulu for a long time, or Suthu.
I was beginning to dream in English, and it was starting to worry me, and I was sitting there.
And so as not to forget the language, I was talking to myself.
So I was--

[ Man Narrating ]
In the townships, peaceful protests... have escalated into bloody rioting, and civil disturbance was rife throughout the republic.
[ Man Narrating In Afrikaans ]
The '76 riots led directly from the fact... that the apartheid government tried to make Afrikaans... the medium of instruction in schools.
So that meant that you would have to learn... math, science, geography in Afrikaans, and black kids basically said no to that.
Children were killed because of a language.
[ Rathebe ]

We wrote songs to say to the children, you are strong, you are beautiful, you are--
-Black.

But I had also lost friends.
I mean, the children were being arrested all over.

I thought, in 1977,
I'd be going to medical school.
Saw myself as a little country doctor somewhere.
And all that was, you know, just blowing in my face.
So I was angry.
And I didn't believe
I wanted to go back to school.
I was too angry to be a student.
After 1976, you see the songs of youth, with energy.
Youth that is dynamic.
[ Protestors Cheering,

I think these songs expressed... not just the mood, you know, but the political momentum of the time.
The more, I would say, radical the situation was becoming, the more militant many of those songs became.

The Soweto Uprising was just starting.
At first we thought that it was very, very important... that we focus... on the mood of the people at that time.
And there was this little upright piano standing in the corner.
So we had a break, and I went over to the piano and touched it in "G".
[ Humming ]
But I think in the '70s, that is when some of us, particularly people of my generation, started seeing the crystallization of the struggle.
We started seeing where the struggle was going, and we started setting time frames, and we started seeing the possibility of the fall of the apartheid regime.
[ "Mannenberg" ]

M.K. stands for
Umkhonto we Sizwe, which translated means
"the spear of the nation".
It was the military wing of the A.N.C., which they formed in 1961... after they basically decided that... the government was not interested in negotiations-- in dialogue.
[ Singing In
African Dialect ]
[ Man Narrating ]
The South African security forces... believe there are at least 4,000 guerillas... under training in camps in Mozambique, Angola... and other frontline states.
The guerillas' song is about 1976, about June 16.
When Umkhonto we Sizwe was formed, you see again a change in song.
Now, the change of song... is of people in a war situation.
Those songs started, like, beginning to-- to take on those overtones-- just changing a word here, changing a word there.
When they say you are the Commissar, you are the mother of the soldiers.
You must make sure that soldiers are happy, soldiers are having enough morale, and by so doing, by [ African Dialect ], you bring lot of confidence to the soldiers.
[ Lindiwe Zulu ]
Even when we were dying, the feeling was that, when people have died, if you mourn them for too long, it demoralizes your spirit.
So, as a result, even when we used to go... to bury some of our comrades who had been ambushed on the way, we never used to cry.
We used to sing.
[ Muffled Explosion ]

And suddenly
I'm just remembering... when we had to bury
26 comrades in one day.
[ Automatic Weapon Firing ]

"We said, 'Yes,' and we departed for other lands, where our mothers and fathers don't know where we are".

And... we are chasing after freedom". -"We agreed". Yeah.
"We agreed". -"We agreed to be the bearers of freedom".
[ People Singing
In African Dialect ]
If you look at the wars... against the British and the Afrikaners, you know, 200,
300 years ago, there's a whole lot of battle songs.
And I think part of the reason why we lost the country, to a certain extent, is that before we attacked the enemy, we'd sing, and they'd know where we are.
You know? I don't know if you ever saw the--
the, uh, movie Zulu.
And there are these Zulus all over these mountains.
And, like, at dawn, they sang so beautifully.
There were a few British guys, but they said,
"Before we hit them, let's let them finish their song. It's a nice song".
[ Lindiwe Zulu ]
Ingoma is the Zulu word for "song".
And so,
Ingoma Umzabalazo.
It means
"the song for struggle".
Almost every phase... of our struggle... had its own kind of songs.
[ Zulu ]
So all the songs were composed... to fit in with a particular phase in the struggle.
So it would be really, really difficult... to know how many songs could have been composed.
It would be hundreds and hundreds of songs.
[ Singing In
African Dialect ]
[ Man ]
There's no initial arrangement... as to who starts what song.
As a song finishes, another one starts one, and in that process, there's a lot of compositions coming up-- new song altogether.
And, you know, the person might have... tried to sing what is presenting... with one or two other people during the day.
And as he leads, and the other two are backing him, you are then all drawn to follow... and-- and-- and-- and there's a song.
- You've got a new song.
- The songs select themselves.
You know? Because if people don't like a melody, or it doesn't, like, fancy them that much, they'll sing it, like, maybe for two verses, and then somebody will go:
"Sixteen!" or Bopha, which means,
"Stop this fucking song.
It's not happening".
[ Singing In
African Dialect ]
[ Ntuli ] My favorite freedom song: "Shonamalanga".
Shonamalanga ♪
[ Ntuli ] Shonamalanga, sho-- ♪
[ Ntuli ]
I love that song.
"Shonamalanga" really was a song... which came from domestic servants, you know?
"Till Sheila's day". The origins of
"Shonamalanga" is "Sheila's day".
'Cause the darkies couldn't say-- the Zulus especially-- can't say "Thursday".
Instead of Thursday, it's just
"Shlursday," which became "Sheila's day".
Sheila's day was Thursday, when the domestics, like my mom, on their free day from the plantation-- the one day of the week when they could just chill... all over Joburg, when Joburg used to be nice, man.
On a Thursday, that place used to look like a Christmas tree.
Because why?
The darkies are free at last.
But what happened was, in the days of exile, that song, like many others, was adapted... to the condition that we found ourselves in.
So, as opposed to saying--
[ Reciting Lyrics In Africa Dialect ]--
"We will meet on Thursday, on Sheila's Day," it became, "We will meet where we would rather not meet, in the bushes with our bazookas".
[ Singing "Shonamalanga" ]
[ Manzini ] These songs really reached the streets of Soweto.
They reached South Africa.
Because these songs were then played by Radio Freedom, and people here listen to Radio Freedom.

I was about 19.
I was about 19 when I was first sent into the country.
I had specialized on information gathering.
I was also very good with explosives.
We would gather information, send it back to Lusaka for approval.
If they said, "Go ahead with the operation," we'd hit whatever target we'd identified.
When I was 19, remember, that's when you start discovering life.
And, uh, at 19, that's when you think actually part of the reason we are on this world... is to discover yourself.
Yes, I--
I had an affair.
A member of my unit.
Somebody I had recruited into the unit.

There were also people who made love.

Things usually would go very bad.
Even when they went bad,
I thought I had survived, because I was moving around.
And finally
I got arrested.
And I was, uh, four or five months pregnant then.
I had been detained at John Vorster Square.
[ Modise ] I had been interrogated. I had been tortured.
They pull your breasts.
They stripped you naked.
They put in cameras in the cells, so they could monitor your movements from wherever they were.
Sat on the toilet, they looked at you.
They would beat me on the stomach.
And I broke my water during interrogation.
And they simply took me and dumped me in my cell, and they went off home.
Then I thought, "Well, they definitely will be finishing me off".
And that day, I told myself,
"This is it.
Might as well do it".
And I went towards this toilet in that cell... and thought,
"Well, if I try hard enough,
I could actually drown myself here".
And as I knelt down... to-- to start doing it, the baby started kicking.
After Tsolo kicked, it was... almost an act of defiance.
"So what? They are threatening to kill you?
"They could. They can any time they want to.
"But why would you willingly go to it?
"So they don't want you to sing?
"Do it anyway.
You can't fight against them.
There are too many. They are men".
And I sang--
I think
I sang anything-- everything.
And I think around 9:00 that night, my daughter was born.
When I was 18 years old,
I joined the underground.
And finally, in 1976, the security police captured me with some other comrades... and put me into detent-- interrogated me, tortured me, and then I was sentenced to seven years of prison, okay?
Because I'm a whitey,
I was sent to Pretoria Maximum Security.
[ Singing
In African Dialect ]
[ Singing Continues ]
People always talk about maximum and the discipline there, and you always want to go and work there, and then they transferred me to maximum.
I started there on a Monday, and that Wednesday,
I've been at my first, uh, execution.
We would get locked up at 3:30.
So night begins at 3:30 in the afternoon when you're locked up in your cell.
And then you get a chance to listen.
But slowly, slowly, as we listened, we began to realize a terrible thing.
That the prison that we were now in was the hanging prison, the prison in which they were executing people.
Start liking to work there.
There's times that you-- you-- you've got power over life.
You know, you're walking up with this guy.
He's alive. He's well.
He's fit.
And five minutes after 7:00, he's dead.
So there's a little bit of power feeling in it.
But it was your job.
[ Men Singing

Whenever somebody was told... that they didn't get the last-minute pardon, they had seven days to live.
They would start communicating.
You would hear.
I would hear.
When the desperation set in, either they would become, if they were political prisoners, very, very political... or very religious.
Either way, there would be songs.
Everybody is singing and clapping... and stamping their feet in their cells.
One, they were psyching themselves up, preparing themselves, those who were going to go to the gallows, but those, of course, who knew that in the following weeks or months... they too would be going the same route.

He went to the gallows singing.

There were beams up here.
We would hear them coming down like this. [ Feet Scraping ]
They were in leg irons. We would hear them coming down the passage.

And his hands were cuffed.
And then the hangman would come. He's got this mask on.
He would put a rope around his neck, close the mask.
And you walk up, and he will pull the lever.
And then at 7:00 we would hear a sound... which would be a bit like in a cinema when the seats go back.

You saw an army of South African youths... with grenades, with Makarovs, with AK-47s, and I think that's reflected a lot in the songs, because the songs had to articulate a new urgency and a new direction.

I was in Botswana, and I got--
It was my birthday.
And I got this birthday card from Mandela.
Here's a guy who's been in jail for 20 years, but he's writing to me, giving me encouragement.
You know, egging me on to say, "We're very proud of what you're doing," and, you know, "May the gods of Africa give you strength".
"And say hello to Deliwe," who was my niece who was staying with me,
"and to Jabu, your wife, and to George--" you know, all my friends.
It was like, you know, like I was in jail.
And this song just-- when I lay it down, when I finished reading it,
I just shook my head, and tears were streaming down.
And the song just came up to me.

The literal story in the Bible is that they came to the walls of Jericho... and they blew the trumpets, and then from blowing them, the walls fell, yeah?
They didn't crack. -But the whole point is that that was a poetic statement... about the fact that they actually attacked the walls of Jericho.

In a very general sort of sense, it talks to the fathers of the nation.
But it is about the ancestors.
And it is saying,
"Let their demise--"
"Let their destruction not be for naught.
Let their demise be for a reason".
But more importantly it is about saying,
"It will be so,
"if we come together as a people, as a nation...
"and remember who our ancestors are... and remember our heritage".
I don't know my father.
I was two years old at the time he was hanged.
So today it's as if I'm seeing him for the first time and I could sense him.

We're lucky to have been able to come out of it.
But what's amazing about this nation... is that it's the only people

And I think that, like, for the first time we're in a era, you know, where we're in the beginning of the good times.

But we're one country that's never been able to say-- to open our lips to say-- eh, "During the good old days".

{5214}{5293}My father never...
{5358}{5514}...to any of us, his children,|ever discussed that expedition.
{5525}{5615}Occasionally,|an odd statement came out...
{5621}{5701}...but he never let us read his diaries|when he was alive.
{5705}{5765}They were locked up.
{5806}{5925}My father never spoke.|He did say they had a tough time.
{5930}{5981}We were a bit too young|to listen to him.
{6021}{6134}But apart from that at all,|l never heard him speak much about it.
{6298}{6379}{Y:i}The 1 9 1 4 Imperial|Trans-Antarctic Expedition...
{6383}{6466}{Y:i}...under the leadership of polar explorer|Sir Ernest Shackleton...
{6470}{6617}{Y:i}...would have been the last great|journey in the heroic Age of Discovery.
{6698}{6745}{Y:i}It was a daring scheme.
{6749}{6857}{Y:i}A small party was to cross|the Antarctic continent for the first time.
{6862}{6895}{Y:i}According to legend...
{6899}{6997}{Y:i}...Shackleton announced the expedition|in a now-famous advertisement.
{7031}{7103}''Men wanted for hazardous journey.
{7108}{7202}Small wages, bitter cold...
{7207}{7257}...long months of complete darkness...
{7262}{7372}...constant danger,|safe return doubtful.
{7382}{7505}Honor and recognition|in case of success. Ernest Shackleton.''
{7522}{7614}My grandfather, Col. Orde-Lees,|was always looking for an opportunity...
{7666}{7705}...to do something exceptional.
{7714}{7809}And such an ad would have been catnip|to my grandfather.
{7813}{7876}He couldn't resist it.
{7905}{8017}Chippy McNish saw|an advertisement in the paper...
{8022}{8077}...looking for men to go to Antarctica...
{8130}{8202}...and it said that you might not return.
{8224}{8299}So he went and seen about it|and got there.
{8406}{8445}{Y:i}Five thousand men...
{8450}{8566}{Y:i}...from sailors to Cambridge-educated|scientists, responded.
{8578}{8718}{Y:i}Like Ernest Shackleton, they were|drawn by hopes of adventure and glory.
{8722}{8789}l had a dream when l was 22...
{8793}{8889}...that someday l would go to|the region of ice and snow...
{8893}{9042}...and go on and on till l came|to one of the poles of the Earth.
{9155}{9243}{Y:i}Exploration had earned Shackleton|fame and a knighthood...
{9247}{9330}{Y:i}...but he had still|not realized his dream.
{9334}{9410}{Y:i}Twice before, he had set out|to claim the South Pole...
{9414}{9475}{Y:i}...and twice|he had returned defeated...
{9479}{9597}{Y:i}...ultimately losing this prize|to Norwegian Roald Amundsen.
{9721}{9819}{Y:i}Shackleton's new venture|captured the British imagination.
{9823}{9887}{Y:i}Not all, however, were impressed.
{9892}{9963}{Y:i}First Lord of the Admiralty|Winston Churchill, for one...
{9967}{10042}{Y:i}...viewed the famous explorer|as a mere adventurer...
{10048}{10099}{Y:i}...and dismissed his latest project.
{10103}{10210}{Y:i}''Enough life and money has been spent|on this sterile quest, '' he wrote.
{10214}{10369}{Y:i}''The pole has already been discovered.|What is the use of another expedition?''
{10417}{10541}{Y:i}Nevertheless, in August 1 9 1 4, after|seven frantic months of preparation...
{10546}{10696}{Y:i}...Shackleton and his crew of 2 7 men|were poised for departure.
{10726}{10777}{Y:i}But even as his ship set sail...
{10782}{10906}{Y:i}...the world in which Shackleton's dream|had been conceived was coming apart.
{11097}{11165}{Y:i}World War I broke out in Europe.
{11189}{11289}{Y:i}Shackleton offered his ship and men|to Britain's war effort.
{11294}{11429}{Y:i}The Admiralty declined the offer|in a single word: ''Proceed. ''
{11514}{11609}{Y:i}Shackleton's ship, Endurance,|was named for his family motto:
{11614}{11657}{Y:i}''By endurance we conquer. ''
{11661}{11761}{Y:i}The phrase that summed up|Shackleton's own drive and resilience.
{11765}{11821}{Y:i}He was determined not to repeat|earlier mistakes...
{11825}{11922}{Y:i}...that had cost him the prize|of the South Pole.
{11968}{12017}{Y:i}Following the successful Norwegians...
{12022}{12121}{Y:i}...Shackleton brought along|69 Canadian sled dogs.
{12262}{12345}{Y:i}Food supplies would also be depoted|for the six-man sledging party...
{12350}{12467}{Y:i}...that would make the 1 500-mile journey|across the Antarctic continent.
{12518}{12583}{Y:i}Shackleton's own ship|would approach Antarctica...
{12587}{12694}{Y:i}...from the ice-strewn waters|of the little-known Weddell Sea.
{12739}{12807}{Y:i}The sea's gateway was the island|of South Georgia...
{12811}{12870}{Y:i}...the Endurance's last port of call.
{12874}{12942}{Y:i}An outpost of humanity|amidst the frozen wastes...
{12946}{13025}{Y:i}...the island was home|to small whaling communities...
{13029}{13096}{Y:i}...run by company men.
{13125}{13207}{Y:i}A local priest romantically|described these whalers...
{13211}{13294}{Y:i}...as a ''motley race of former noblemen|and other fallen creatures...
{13298}{13367}{Y:i}...who now strip blubber or render oil.
{13372}{13489}{Y:i}Many, if not most, are at odds with life. ''
{13511}{13641}{Y:i}Ernest Shackleton had something in|common with these loners and outsiders.
{13645}{13742}{Y:i}Born in Ireland, he had married the|daughter of a well-to-do English lawyer...
{13746}{13821}{Y:i}...but he was an indifferent|husband and father.
{13825}{13957}{Y:i}A restless soul, he had always been|happiest on his far-flung expeditions.
{13962}{14001}{Y:i}He once wrote to his wife:
{14006}{14115}{Y:i}''Sometimes I think I am no good|at anything but being away in the wilds. ''
{14119}{14275}Shackleton was not your 9-to-5 man,|your commuting type.
{14282}{14386}He wanted to be a great man. He was|searching for greatness, for reputation.
{14434}{14511}And in a sense, l think|he would have stuck at nothing...
{14515}{14605}...to achieve fame and fortune.
{14689}{14777}{Y:i}For all of November,|Shackleton and his crew waited...
{14781}{14877}{Y:i}...hoping that unusually icy conditions|in the Weddell Sea that austral spring...
{14882}{14935}{Y:i}...would improve.
{14956}{15042}{Y:i}Expedition photographer Frank Hurley|began his record...
{15046}{15162}{Y:i}...by capturing images of exotic wildlife|for an eager British audience.
{15166}{15211}{Y:i}The sale of film and photo rights...
{15215}{15302}{Y:i}...had been crucial|to financing the costly venture.
{15817}{15882}{Y:i}Perce Blackborow,|a young Welsh stowaway...
{15886}{15951}{Y:i}...sometimes served|as Hurley's assistant.
{15955}{16014}{Y:i}Blackborow had fallen in love|with the Endurance...
{16018}{16093}{Y:i}...when she had docked in Buenos Aires|on her way south.
{16097}{16171}{Y:i}Mrs. Chippy,|the carpenter's popular tomcat...
{16175}{16277}{Y:i}...also along for the ride, had fallen|overboard on the outward journey.
{16282}{16369}{Y:i}The ship had turned around|to pick him up.
{16386}{16489}{Y:i}The crew took advantage of their last|opportunity to send letters home.
{16494}{16567}{Y:i}Navigator Huberht Hudson|wrote his father:
{16571}{16661}''Dear old Dad,|just a line before we sail.
{16666}{16773}We've had a very good time so far,|and l think we shall do well.
{16777}{16906}l hope to be home again within 1 9 months|and go straight to the front.
{16910}{16997}What a glorious age we live in!''
{17049}{17121}{Y:i}By early December,|Shackleton could delay no longer...
{17125}{17196}{Y:i}...if he were to take advantage|of the Antarctic summer.
{17201}{17273}{Y:i}All his resources had been committed|to the expedition...
{17278}{17362}{Y:i}...and behind him, Europe was at war.
{17366}{17477}{Y:i}Twice before, he had seen|his dream snatched from him.
{17651}{17774}{Y:i}He was now 40 years old,|and this was his last chance.
{17793}{17949}{Y:i}On December 5, 1 9 1 4, the Endurance|left the island and headed south.
{19241}{19302}{Y:i}On the third day,|they encountered the enemy.
{19317}{19435}{Y:i}The huge, compacted chunks|of surface water known as ''pack ice. ''
{19502}{19550}{Y:i}The pack stretched to the horizon...
{19554}{19643}{Y:i}...broken only by gaps of open water|known as leads.
{19706}{19810}{Y:i}The challenge would be to navigate|the shifting, 1 000-mile tangle of leads...
{19814}{19881}{Y:i}...all the way to the continent.
{20326}{20430}{Y:i}Dr. Alexander Macklin, a Scottish|surgeon and one of the dog minders...
{20434}{20550}{Y:i}...recorded his observations of the ship's|high-spirited captain, Frank Worsley.
{20554}{20645}Worsley specialized in ramming,|and l have a sneaking suspicion...
{20649}{20734}...that he often went out of his way|to find a nice piece of floe...
{20738}{20834}...at which he could drive|at full speed and cut in two.
{20838}{20901}He loved to feel the shock,|the riding up...
{20906}{21007}...and the sensation as the ice gave|and we drove through it.
{21503}{21578}{Y:i}Some days,|the ship was held up by ice.
{21582}{21683}{Y:i}On others, she made long runs|in open water.
{21778}{21894}{Y:i}After six weeks of travel, the Endurance|was only 1 00 miles from the continent...
{21898}{22021}{Y:i}...when she entered a field of heavy|brash ice, slowing the ship to a crawl.
{22026}{22113}{Y:i}Capt. Worsley|recorded a fateful decision.
{22118}{22214}The character of the pack has again|changed. The floes are very thick.
{22218}{22314}We cannot push through except|with a very great expenditure of power.
{22318}{22370}We therefore prefer|to lie to for a while...
{22374}{22489}...to see if the pack opens at all|when this northeast wind clears.
{22582}{22669}{Y:i}When day broke, the men found the ice|had closed around the ship.
{22673}{22768}{Y:i}No water was visible in any direction.
{22773}{22883}{Y:i}As the days passed,|the ice showed no sign of relenting.
{22922}{23009}{Y:i}The event that sealed their fate|was recalled years later...
{23013}{23118}{Y:i}...in a radio interview by expedition|meteorologist Leonard Hussey.
{23122}{23217}On the 1 4 of February, 1 91 5,|the temperature suddenly dropped...
{23221}{23289}...from 20 degrees above zero|to 20 degrees below...
{23293}{23369}...and the whole sea froze over|and we froze in with it.
{23374}{23465}{Y:i}An unexpected lead opened up|400 yards ahead...
{23469}{23543}{Y:i}...offering a chance|to reach open water.
{23548}{23622}Of course we had no explosive|to blast our way out.
{23626}{23701}We just had picks and shovels.
{24165}{24277}{Y:i}For 48 hours,|the men attacked the ice.
{25797}{25880}{Y:i}Frank Hurley, who filmed the men's|exhausting bid for freedom...
{25885}{25918}{Y:i}...wrote in his diary:
{25922}{25970}All hands hard at it till midnight...
{25974}{26046}...when a survey is made|of the remaining two-thirds.
{26050}{26129}Itis reluctantly determined|to relinquish the task...
{26134}{26233}...as the remainder of the ice|is unworkable.
{26802}{26886}{Y:i}They were trapped until spring,|some seven months away.
{26890}{27016}{Y:i}Beyond even radio contact, no one|in the world knew where they were.
{27033}{27162}{Y:i}They had been thwarted only|one day's sail from their destination.
{27361}{27421}{Y:i}In his diary, Dr. Macklin wrote:
{27426}{27499}Itwas more than tantalizing.|Itwas maddening.
{27503}{27611}Shackleton, at this time, showed|one of his sparks of real greatness.
{27616}{27772}He did not rage at all, or show outwardly|the slightest sign of disappointment.
{27778}{27872}He told us simply and calmly|that we must winter in the pack.
{27877}{27993}Never lost his optimism|and prepared for the winter.
{28138}{28237}{Y:i}Optimism was at the very core|of Ernest Shackleton's personality.
{28242}{28321}{Y:i}Known to all as ''the Boss, ''|he was a born leader...
{28325}{28445}{Y:i}...who was, from his youth, driven|by a romantic quest for adventure.
{28449}{28518}{Y:i}At 1 6, he had shipped out|as a cabin boy.
{28522}{28633}{Y:i}By 2 4, he was certified as a master|in the merchant marine service.
{28638}{28701}{Y:i}Shortly after,|he was chosen as an officer...
{28706}{28807}{Y:i}...on Robert Falcon Scott's|historic first voyage.
{28822}{28926}{Y:i}There, he saw tensions flare among men|of different personalities and classes...
{28930}{28989}{Y:i}...thrown together in close quarters...
{28993}{29106}{Y:i}...and watched as morale eroded|under Scott's inadequate leadership.
{29110}{29200}{Y:i}Shackleton knew he could do better.
{29500}{29557}{Y:i}Now his own expedition|was in trouble...
{29562}{29661}{Y:i}...trapped in the pack ice,|drifting helplessly north.
{29752}{29825}{Y:i}The crew, restless.
{30155}{30253}{Y:i}Col. Thomas Orde-Lees,|the storekeeper and motor expert...
{30258}{30338}{Y:i}...irritated everyone|with his superior airs.
{30342}{30418}{Y:i}In a characteristic diary entry,|he observed:
{30422}{30515}l have made a point of sitting|at the same table as the 4th officer...
{30520}{30594}...and the carpenter,|who is a perfect pig in every way.
{30598}{30690}l've done this to try and accommodate|oneself to ideas and ways...
{30694}{30754}...less refined than one's own.
{30806}{30912}{Y:i}Others shared his distaste|for mingling with different classes.
{30917}{31041}{Y:i}McNish, the carpenter, had blunt words|of his own for the superior motor expert.
{31057}{31199}Orde-Lees is laid up with a sprained|back. He was shoveling snow yesterday.
{31204}{31285}The first work he has done|since we left London.
{31421}{31504}{Y:i}Shackleton insisted the men keep|to a strict daily routine...
{31509}{31595}{Y:i}...and carefully monitored their morale.
{31893}{31993}{Y:i}When dissension threatened, Shackleton|was prepared to act forcefully.
{31997}{32099}{Y:i}John Vincent, a heavyweight wrestling|champion caught bullying the sailors...
{32104}{32162}{Y:i}...was summoned to Shackleton's cabin.
{32166}{32234}{Y:i}He left demoted.
{32279}{32369}{Y:i}Everyone, including the Boss himself,|would work together.
{32373}{32429}{Y:i}Seaman Walter How remembered:
{32433}{32533}Everybody mucked in. Itdidn't matter|who they were or what they were.
{32538}{32620}Their qualifications|didn't count for anything.
{32625}{32735}{Y:i}Scientist James Wordie found himself|assigned to a cleaning brigade.
{32740}{32819}Everybody was prepared|to join in whatever was happening...
{32824}{32877}...whether it be scrubbing the floor....
{32881}{32969}And l think Shackleton himself,|with his lrish background...
{32973}{33091}...and ability to communicate and join in,|made everybody feel that they were one.
{33110}{33225}Itwas a team|and not a them-and-us situation.
{33635}{33683}He also communicated to his men...
{33688}{33778}...that he put them|above the object of the expedition.
{33782}{33853}The object was great,|but they were more important.
{33874}{33978}{Y:i}Second-in-command Frank Wild|had been with Shackleton in 1 909...
{33982}{34049}{Y:i}...when the Boss,|running out of supplies...
{34054}{34149}{Y:i}...gave up the pole in order|to save his party from certain death.
{34156}{34293}{Y:i}Wild had watched him turn back|just 97 miles short of the prize.
{34298}{34371}{Y:i}One night, with both men|close to starvation...
{34375}{34482}{Y:i}...Shackleton had forced upon Wild|a biscuit from his own meager rations.
{34486}{34517}{Y:i}Wild recorded:
{34521}{34598}l do not suppose that anyone else|can thoroughly realize...
{34602}{34674}...how much generosity|and sympathy was shown by this.
{34678}{34763}l do. By God,|l shall never forget it.
{34950}{35029}{Y:i}The floating landscape|convulsed into pressure ridges...
{35033}{35097}{Y:i}...became more difficult to negotiate.
{35101}{35208}{Y:i}Ice claimed their entire horizon.
{35342}{35450}{Y:i}As they drifted, Shackleton was mindful|of the fate of the ship Belgica.
{35454}{35526}{Y:i}She also had been frozen|for a winter on the pack...
{35530}{35660}{Y:i}...and her crew had succumbed|to infighting, and ultimately, insanity.
{36067}{36203}{Y:i}The men turned to the dogs, who quickly|became indispensable companions.
{36467}{36502}{Y:i}Hurley recorded:
{36506}{36557}A few words about my dogs.
{36562}{36645}Shakespeare, aliases Tatchco,|the Holy Hound, and Bug Whiskers...
{36650}{36737}...is a magnificent animal, somewhat|resembling an English sheepdog.
{36742}{36801}He is a noble creature,|dignified in gait...
{36805}{36916}...master of the team in battle|and a leader in canine sagacity.
{36938}{37025}A good leader will ferret out|the best track through broken country...
{37030}{37158}...will not allow fights in the team,|or indulge in capricious antics.
{37173}{37263}A team of nine dogs|can haul about 1 000 pounds.
{37267}{37336}My team is one of the best.
{38263}{38377}{Y:i}The birth of four puppies|captivated the entire company.
{38382}{38517}{Y:i}Tom Crean, tough sailor that he was,|became their adopted father.
{39297}{39390}{Y:i}The men passed the long months|with soccer matches.
{39443}{39493}{Y:i}With theatrical evenings....
{39634}{39690}{Y:i}With weekly gramophone concerts...
{39887}{39970}{Y:i}...and a memorable|haircutting tournament.
{39974}{40009}{Y:i}McNish recorded:
{40013}{40130}We do look a lot of convicts, and we are|not much short of that life at present...
{40134}{40226}...but still hoping to get|to civilization someday.
{40494}{40585}{Y:i}By May, they had been trapped|for over three months.
{40589}{40642}{Y:i}The sun disappeared|beneath the horizon...
{40646}{40763}{Y:i}...leaving days dark as night|until the end of winter.
{40830}{40882}{Y:i}The neat piles of sledging supplies...
{40886}{40997}{Y:i}...mocked Shackleton's ambition|and the dreams of his men.
{41105}{41181}{Y:i}Meanwhile, ominous forces were at work.
{41203}{41310}{Y:i}Ice, their old enemy,|menaced the helpless ship.
{41362}{41435}{Y:i}Under pressure|of the tightly congested pack...
{41440}{41570}{Y:i}...huge blocks of ice buckled|into ridges, threatening to crush her.
{41759}{41833}{Y:i}In July, a blizzard raked the Endurance.
{41837}{41947}{Y:i}As the ice groaned and heaved,|Shackleton paced his cabin.
{41951}{41998}{Y:i}Capt. Worsley recalled:
{42002}{42105}He said to me,|''The ship can't live in this, skipper.
{42110}{42254}lt's only a matter of time.|What the ice gets, the ice keeps.''
{42330}{42479}{Y:i}The Endurance survived, but as winter|turned to spring, assaults continued.
{42580}{42673}{Y:i}In an interview 40 years later,|sailor Walter How...
{42678}{42750}{Y:i}...still remembered the ship|staggering under the blows.
{42754}{42910}The ice got around to the starboard|quarter, and lifted her bodily as it were...
{42914}{42995}...and then she listed|very heavily to port...
{43000}{43066}...and the timbers began|to crack and groan.
{43070}{43133}Did you hear the timbers|going as the ice tided?
{43137}{43293}You couldn't avoid it. Itwas there like|heavy fireworks and blasting of guns.
{43566}{43669}{Y:i}Together, Shackleton and Wild|surveyed ice damage.
{43718}{43753}{Y:i}Orde-Lees recorded:
{43758}{43838}Sir Ernest must have gone through|terrible anxiety lately...
{43842}{43954}...though he is so inscrutable that no one|could have detected anything unusual.
{43958}{44045}l know for a fact that he did not once|lie down for three days...
{44050}{44143}...and l don't think he had undressed|for 1 0 days.
{44246}{44342}{Y:i}Tirelessly, the men worked|to cut the ice away from the ship.
{44346}{44445}{Y:i}Even the usually stoic McNish|was shaken. He wrote:
{44450}{44566}There were times when we thought it|was not possible the ship could stand it.
{44570}{44669}Everyone got our warm clothes put up|in as small a bundle as possible.
{44673}{44765}l have placed my loved one's photos|inside Bible.
{44791}{44865}{Y:i}In late October, the ice struck|with renewed force...
{44870}{44995}{Y:i}...opening planks of the starboard side.|Water flooded the hold.
{44999}{45141}{Y:i}All hands manned the pumps for three|days and nights to save the Endurance.
{45157}{45189}{Y:i}Hurley wrote:
{45193}{45237}The ship groans and quivers.
{45242}{45343}Windows splinter|while the deck timbers gape and twist.
{45347}{45415}Amid these profound|and overwhelming forces...
{45419}{45529}...we are the absolute embodiment|of helpless futility.
{45737}{45874}{Y:i}On October 2 7, 1 9 1 5, 1 0 months|after their entrapment in the ice...
{45878}{45973}{Y:i}...Shackleton gave the order|to abandon ship.
{45978}{46033}{Y:i}Seaman How recalled:
{46037}{46108}Shackleton sent Frank Wild|along forward...
{46113}{46243}...who explained to us|that it was a case of ''get out.''
{46529}{46641}Previously, Sir Ernest|had probably seen the red light...
{46645}{46773}...and sledges were packed|with as much stores as possible.
{47086}{47234}You've got to remember that a sailor|is a sailor and that's his ship, his home.
{47238}{47349}Once he's off that ship,|he's at a loss.
{47381}{47417}The adventurers of the expedition...
{47471}{47567}...the people that expected to stay,|and knew what they were up against...
{47572}{47685}...like Tom Crean, Worsley,|Shackleton himself, Wild...
{47702}{47775}...they adapted a little bit easier...
{47779}{47828}...but it was still tough.
{48033}{48126}{Y:i}They had been reduced to a fraction|of their original provisions...
{48130}{48225}{Y:i}...and to three of the ship's|four lifeboats.
{48485}{48569}{Y:i}It was minus 1 5 degrees Fahrenheit.
{48593}{48647}{Y:i}Tents and clothing had been salvaged...
{48652}{48737}{Y:i}...but there were not enough|fur sleeping bags to go around.
{48770}{48881}{Y:i}William Bakewell, an American sailor,|recalled the lottery Shackleton arranged.
{48902}{48957}There was crooked work|in the drawing...
{48961}{49043}...as Sir Ernest, Mr. Wild,|Capt. Worsley and other officers...
{49048}{49110}...all drew wool bags.
{49115}{49210}The fine warm fur bags|went to the men under them.
{49318}{49434}{Y:i}In the chill morning, Shackleton gathered|the company to explain his plan.
{49438}{49479}{Y:i}Dr. Macklin recorded:
{49483}{49573}As always with him,|what had happened had happened.
{49578}{49657}Without emotion, melodrama|or excitement he said:
{49661}{49778}''Ship and stores have gone,|so now we'll go home.''
{49942}{50081}{Y:i}This calm front belied the night|Shackleton passed, pacing the ice alone.
{50085}{50197}The thoughts that came to me|in the darkness were not cheerful.
{50202}{50289}The task now was to secure|the safety of the party...
{50293}{50361}...and to that l must apply|every bit of knowledge...
{50366}{50443}...that experience of the Antarctic|had given me.
{50454}{50525}There is nothing that can crush a man...
{50530}{50606}...as to see his dreams|crumble to the dust.
{50610}{50703}But on the other hand, he realized...
{50707}{50838}...if the one goal had disappeared,|we'll have another one.
{50842}{50972}And so, if l can't cross the continent,|l'm going to bring all my men back alive.
{50977}{51085}Because you mustn't forget|that polar exploration was littered...
{51103}{51161}...with dead bodies.
{51197}{51352}This almost fanatic-- Itwas a fanatic|desire to bring his men back alive.
{51357}{51502}This then became the driving force.|Itwas the only thing he cared about.
{51534}{51689}That change from aiming to attain|what you had set out...
{51703}{51817}...to extricating yourself from defeat...
{51822}{51957}...is a strain that has broken many a man.|Itdid not break Shackleton.
{52072}{52157}{Y:i}Shackleton's first impulse was|to march to the nearest land...
{52162}{52229}{Y:i}...some 350 miles to the west.
{52234}{52339}{Y:i}The men were allowed 2 pounds|of possessions, with few exceptions.
{52343}{52394}{Y:i}Hussey was allowed to keep his banjo...
{52398}{52475}{Y:i}...which Shackleton called|''vital mental medicine. ''
{52480}{52543}{Y:i}But there could be|no extra mouths to feed.
{52547}{52673}{Y:i}On Shackleton's orders, three puppies|and Mrs. Chippy...
{52678}{52725}{Y:i}...were shot.
{52762}{52849}l feel sure that it is the right thing|to attempt a march.
{52853}{52909}lf we can make 5|or 7 miles a day...
{52913}{53025}...our chance of reaching safety|will be greatly increased.
{53087}{53182}Itwill be better for the men|to feel they are on their way to land...
{53188}{53243}...than to sit down and wait.
{53346}{53485}{Y:i}But after three days of hard slogging,|they were still within sight of the ship.
{53490}{53569}{Y:i}The march to land had proved futile.
{53582}{53671}{Y:i}Now there was nothing to do|but watch and wait.
{54330}{54426}{Y:i}Food and supplies were salvaged|from the collapsing ship.
{54457}{54506}{Y:i}The men scoured her broken deck...
{54510}{54598}{Y:i}...retrieving what they could|and hauling it back to camp.
{54634}{54745}{Y:i}Frank Hurley conducted a salvage|operation to his submerged darkroom.
{54750}{54777}{Y:i}He wrote:
{54782}{54849}l hacked through|the thick walls of the refrigerator...
{54854}{54909}...to retrieve the negatives|stored therein.
{54914}{54989}They were located beneath 4 feet|of mushy ice...
{54993}{55117}...and by stripping to the waist|and diving under, l hauled them out.
{55492}{55573}{Y:i}Together he and Shackleton|selected 1 20 negatives...
{55578}{55643}{Y:i}...and sealed them in tin canisters.
{55648}{55723}{Y:i}The remaining 400,|Shackleton had Hurley destroy...
{55727}{55809}{Y:i}...so he would not be tempted|to recover them later.
{55826}{55957}{Y:i}Hurley retained a single vest-pocket|Kodak camera and three rolls of film.
{55993}{56113}{Y:i}On November 2 1, the broken ship|sank for good beneath the ice.
{56169}{56222}{Y:i}Shackleton recorded simply:
{56226}{56302}At 5 p.m. she went down.
{56317}{56382}l cannot write about it.
{56447}{56538}{Y:i}Now nothing remained|of the Endurance and her long battle...
{56542}{56611}{Y:i}...except Hurley's images.
{56855}{56981}Once the ship had gone,|my grandfather, l know...
{56986}{57107}...felt ill, not at ease on the ice.
{57112}{57201}Itwas a new thing.|l mean, he'd seen snow as a kid...
{57206}{57328}...but never set foot on an iceberg|like that. So it was a new...
{57335}{57397}...a new ballgame, so to speak.
{57421}{57519}ln their minds was,|like any human being, l think:
{57523}{57586}''Are we going to get out alive?''
{57726}{57839}{Y:i}The drift of the pack had carried the men|1 300 miles since they were trapped.
{57844}{57930}{Y:i}Now they hoped the same drift|would bring them to land.
{57934}{58033}{Y:i}If not, they were bound for open sea.
{58089}{58121}{Y:i}Hurley wrote:
{58125}{58234}Itis beyond conception even to us that|we are dwelling on a colossal ice-raft...
{58238}{58370}...with 5 feet of frozen water separating|us from 2000 fathoms of ocean.
{58374}{58526}And drifting along under the caprices of|wind and tides, to heaven knows where.
{58658}{58777}{Y:i}Timbers from the ship were used|to build a new home: Ocean Camp.
{58787}{58853}{Y:i}The wheelhouse became the new galley.
{58857}{58963}{Y:i}Hurley ingeniously converted part|of the ship's boiler into a stove...
{58967}{59061}{Y:i}...which was fuelled by penguin skin|and seal blubber.
{59121}{59169}{Y:i}A daily routine was established.
{59174}{59272}{Y:i}Hunting for penguins and seals|became the main activity.
{59669}{59749}{Y:i}Each man knew rescue was impossible.
{59761}{59877}{Y:i}They were managing to stay alive,|but to what end?
{59958}{60041}They had a pretty miserable time|on the ice.
{60061}{60156}But having said that, in the end...
{60163}{60221}...at every turn...
{60234}{60335}...Shackleton's enemy was not the ice...
{60340}{60462}...but it was his own people|in the sense it was their morale.
{60466}{60573}That was the foe. He had to prevent|their morale from crumbling.
{60578}{60654}The ice was nothing.|Anybody can deal with the ice...
{60658}{60754}...but to deal with the human spirit,|that is very difficult.
{61699}{61749}{Y:i}One month after abandoning ship...
{61754}{61853}{Y:i}...a bout of sciatica sent Shackleton|to his tent for two weeks.
{61858}{61910}{Y:i}Emerging after his forced confinement...
{61914}{62020}{Y:i}...he made the surprising decision|to attempt a second march to land.
{62035}{62101}{Y:i}In his memoir he related:
{62106}{62231}A buzz of pleasurable anticipation went|round the camp at this announcement.
{62236}{62303}{Y:i}Nothing was further from the truth.
{62632}{62728}{Y:i}The men dragged the loaded lifeboats|weighing more than a ton apiece...
{62733}{62843}{Y:i}...hacking their way through pressure|ridges that obstructed their passage.
{62913}{63013}{Y:i}At times they trudged|up to their knees in snow.
{63270}{63340}{Y:i}On the fourth day|McNish dug in his heels.
{63346}{63465}{Y:i}Earlier, he had proposed to build a sloop|from the wreckage of the Endurance.
{63470}{63532}{Y:i}Shackleton had rejected the plan.
{63537}{63649}{Y:i}Now McNish openly rebelled|and refused to continue.
{63653}{63777}{Y:i}His duty to obey orders, he asserted,|had ended with abandonment of the ship.
{63814}{63885}{Y:i}Chippy was a man who didn't like|to be told what to do.
{63890}{63973}You know what l mean?|lt's all on who you were.
{63978}{64057}lf Chippy didn't like it,|Chippy would tell you.
{64062}{64173}That's just the kind of man he was.|l mean, authority meant nothing to him.
{64223}{64306}{Y:i}Shackleton called the men together|and read ship's articles...
{64310}{64373}{Y:i}...dramatically asserting his command.
{64378}{64441}{Y:i}Despite the loss of the ship,|he announced...
{64445}{64529}{Y:i}...all men would be paid wages|until they reached port.
{64682}{64805}{Y:i}McNish backed down.|Mutiny was averted.
{64845}{64915}No leader on the edge|of survival can tolerate...
{64919}{65003}...the least threat to his authority.
{65008}{65150}And Shackleton, in fact, was prepared|to shoot the carpenter if necessary.
{65154}{65266}And he would have been justified|because there was a hidden danger here.
{65270}{65383}That the carpenter was only voicing...
{65387}{65467}...the opinions of two or three|other members of the crew...
{65471}{65511}...and more for all we know.
{65515}{65585}And had this not been|crushed immediately...
{65590}{65671}...the whole party|would have disintegrated.
{65711}{65769}{Y:i}Two days after the standoff|with McNish...
{65773}{65853}{Y:i}...Shackleton was forced|to realize his own error.
{65858}{65929}{Y:i}He called a halt to the march.
{65956}{66010}{Y:i}In his diary Shackleton wrote:
{66014}{66093}Turned in but could not sleep.|Am anxious.
{66097}{66165}Everyone working well|except the carpenter:
{66170}{66281}l shall never forget him|in this time of strain and stress.
{66451}{66505}{Y:i}Shackleton had put down the rebellion...
{66510}{66621}{Y:i}...but he could not quell all doubts|that threatened to erode his authority.
{66642}{66746}{Y:i}A week of backbreaking effort|had left his men worse off than before.
{66750}{66827}{Y:i}Precious equipment had been left behind.
{66832}{66949}{Y:i}Life at their new base, Patience Camp,|would be much harder.
{67033}{67103}{Y:i}More questions arose|about the Boss's judgment.
{67108}{67175}{Y:i}Food was running out,|but Shackleton had imposed...
{67181}{67286}{Y:i}...strict limitations on the amount|of penguin and seal meat stockpiled...
{67291}{67369}{Y:i}...insisting he would get them|off the ice before winter.
{67434}{67565}{Y:i}Lionel Greenstreet, the first officer,|openly questioned the Boss' philosophy:
{67569}{67695}His sublime optimism all the way through|is, to my mind, absolute foolishness.
{67699}{67805}Everything was going to turn out all right|and no notice was taken of things...
{67809}{67916}...possibly turning out otherwise.|And here we are.
{67930}{67965}{Y:i}Shackleton retorted:
{67969}{68032}You're a bloody pessimist.
{68050}{68129}{Y:i}For once, Orde-Lees voiced|the fears of many.
{68133}{68190}{Y:i}They had to have meat,|he put on record...
{68194}{68265}{Y:i}...in the event of another winter|on the floes.
{68285}{68394}Itwas important to have,|just like ammunition, to have supplies.
{68398}{68478}And the famous thing,|the statement of Wellington, wasn't it?
{68482}{68627}That ''the army marches on its stomach''?|That seemed to him to be elementary.
{68845}{68938}{Y:i}In the end, it was the Boss's vision|that prevailed.
{68946}{69093}Shackleton's great characteristic|was the ability to compel loyalty...
{69098}{69253}...even against his men's|better judgment.
{69282}{69373}Now this has got to do...
{69378}{69499}...with some force of character,|some flame that burns within a man.
{69586}{69700}{Y:i}Game grew scarcer.|There was no food for the dogs.
{69724}{69779}{Y:i}Shackleton gave Wild|the unhappy command...
{69784}{69844}{Y:i}...to shoot some of the dog teams.
{69871}{69951}{Y:i}Hurley paid a last tribute|to his old companion.
{69955}{70053}Hail to the thee, old leader Shakespeare.|l shall ever remember thee:
{70058}{70141}Fearless, faithful and diligent.
{70293}{70424}{Y:i}Within weeks, the remaining teams|were shot, and this time eaten.
{70429}{70467}{Y:i}McNish wrote:
{70471}{70542}Frank Wild shot the last|of our faithful dogs...
{70546}{70613}...of which we kept|the five young ones for food.
{70617}{70712}And their flesh tastes a treat|after living so long on seal meat...
{70718}{70817}...and this last 1 4 days|on almost nothing.
{71069}{71122}{Y:i}As the men drifted|to the edge of the pack...
{71126}{71195}{Y:i}...the ice began to disintegrate|around them.
{71200}{71272}{Y:i}One day Orde-Lees|awoke feeling seasick.
{71277}{71389}{Y:i}The ice had become so thin that the swell|of the ocean could be felt through it.
{71394}{71478}{Y:i}Soon, nothing would be left|beneath them.
{71814}{71942}Finally, Shackleton felt|that they had to get onto their boats...
{71946}{72064}...and make for an island|to escape from the ice.
{72077}{72153}The problem then was, where were|they going to go?
{72158}{72273}And there's an intriguing collection|of island silhouettes...
{72305}{72399}...which Worsley took with him so that|when they saw a little land...
{72403}{72453}...they knew where they were.
{72458}{72527}Otherwise how did they know|what they would see?
{72532}{72647}Their navigation, however brilliantly|it was done, was primitive.
{72655}{72763}And they embarked on this|boat journey from the ice...
{72813}{72884}...not knowing where|they were going to end up.
{72907}{72961}{Y:i}Several landfalls were possible.
{72966}{73098}{Y:i}The closest were Clarence and Elephant|Islands, some 1 00 miles to the north.
{73118}{73193}{Y:i}Deception Island,|over 1 50 miles to the west...
{73198}{73291}{Y:i}...was known to have supplies|for shipwrecked mariners.
{73314}{73389}{Y:i}Shackleton chose Deception Island.
{73477}{73545}{Y:i}Their three small lifeboats|would carry all 28 men...
{73549}{73641}{Y:i}...on a journey that would last|no one knew how long.
{73758}{73862}{Y:i}Sailor William Bakewell|recalled the landmark day of departure:
{73889}{73930}Our first day in the water...
{73936}{74025}...was one of the coldest|and most dangerous of the expedition.
{74035}{74072}The ice was running riot.
{74077}{74153}Itwas a hard race|to keep our boats in the open leads.
{74158}{74221}We had many narrow escapes|from being crushed...
{74225}{74306}...when the larger masses|of the pack would come together.
{74422}{74476}{Y:i}During the first few days|of their journey...
{74481}{74571}{Y:i}...they pulled their boats|from the water each evening to sleep.
{74575}{74650}{Y:i}Without the movie camera|and with little film to spare...
{74654}{74711}{Y:i}...it would be left to artist|George Marston...
{74716}{74814}{Y:i}...to record their tenuous camps|on the drifting ice.
{74915}{75034}{Y:i}Leonard Hussey and Walter How|recalled the night when disaster struck:
{75038}{75178}We were drifting over the sea on a piece|of ice and we were cold and frozen.
{75190}{75241}Pitch dark night once...
{75246}{75327}...and the ice split right across|under the men's tent.
{75331}{75393}There were eight of us turned in there.
{75398}{75471}One poor chap, name of Holness...
{75475}{75562}...him and his sleeping bag|dropped into the drink.
{75566}{75613}Shackleton looked into the crack...
{75618}{75698}...and he saw a man|floating in his sleeping bag.
{75721}{75833}{Y:i}Shackleton grabbed Holness and|lifted him in his bag up onto the ice...
{75837}{75937}{Y:i}...knowing he could survive|only minutes in the freezing water.
{75974}{76097}{Y:i}Seconds later the ice-edges|came together with tremendous force.
{76163}{76253}l remember Shackleton saying|to Holness, ''Are you all right?''
{76258}{76309}''Yes, sir,'' he said, ''l'm quite all right.
{76314}{76444}Only thing l regret, my bloody tobacco's|down there in the drink.''
{76690}{76730}{Y:i}Shackleton recorded:
{76734}{76863}Constant rain and snow squalls blotted|out the stars and soaked us through.
{76867}{77012}Occasionally the shadows of silver,|snow and fulmar petrels flashed close.
{77017}{77091}And all around we could hear|the killers blowing...
{77095}{77207}...their short, sharp hisses sounding|like sudden escapes of steam.
{77438}{77441}The sheer hardship of the rowing.
{77441}{77545}The sheer hardship of the rowing.
{77598}{77681}My father said that|at the end of a watch...
{77686}{77763}...your hands had to be|chipped off the oars.
{77767}{77852}And it's very hard to imagine|what it must be like...
{77862}{77982}...when you try to get some sleep.|Your hands must be totally frozen.
{77986}{78072}Your clothes are probably soaked|and you're hungry.
{78091}{78181}{Y:i}The days passed|in painful rowing and bailing.
{78209}{78258}{Y:i}Stable ice could not be found...
{78262}{78353}{Y:i}...and nights were now spent|sitting helpless in the black sea.
{78357}{78387}{Y:i}To complete their misery...
{78391}{78477}{Y:i}...many of the men|were now suffering from dysentery.
{78503}{78609}l think they only had one hot drink a day.
{78613}{78768}And he said that they|only ate a ship's biscuit...
{78789}{78841}...which in his own phrase:
{78846}{78969}''You look at it for breakfast, you suck it|for lunch and you eat it for dinner.''
{79046}{79139}What kept them from cracking...
{79144}{79223}...was Shackleton's sheer willpower,|his leadership.
{79228}{79288}This flame that burns within him.
{79293}{79375}And this was manifested|in different ways.
{79379}{79469}Either it was Shackleton playing...
{79474}{79549}...the consummate mariner|at the prow of the boat...
{79554}{79691}...leading his little squadron to safety,|or it was mothering his men.
{79696}{79799}Suddenly turning around and comforting|somebody or preparing food for him.
{79804}{79877}And acting, basically,|like a hen with one chicken.
{79882}{79987}And the next minute he was a martinet,|driving his men on.
{80126}{80176}lt's hard to imagine...
{80181}{80329}...and yet they probably were seeing|things of great beauty on that journey.
{80645}{80704}We were all laced together,|the three boats...
{80709}{80821}...on account of the bad weather,|and during the night several whale...
{80826}{80914}...l don't know what species,|were blowing around us.
{80918}{80995}And had they gone|over one of our tow ropes...
{80999}{81074}...the three boats would have|certainly disappeared.
{81078}{81145}And also us.
{81208}{81330}{Y:i}For days and nights with no sleep,|the helmsmen manned the tillers.
{81334}{81429}{Y:i}When Worsley was relieved of his shift,|he had to be lain in the boat...
{81434}{81545}{Y:i}...and opened slowly from his|crouching position like a jackknife.
{81677}{81793}{Y:i}Overwhelmed by misery and fear,|some of the men broke down and wept.
{81797}{81897}{Y:i}Now Shackleton knew|he must make for land at any cost.
{81902}{82010}{Y:i}Changing course,|they struck out for Elephant Island.
{82098}{82194}{Y:i}On the evening of the sixth day,|the skies to the northwest darkened...
{82198}{82253}{Y:i}...and a gale swept down.
{82309}{82420}{Y:i}Swamped with water, one of the|lifeboats was in danger of sinking.
{82474}{82553}{Y:i}Orde-Lees, who up until then|had disdained to row...
{82557}{82661}{Y:i}...rose to the crisis|and bailed for his companions' lives.
{82681}{82797}My grandfather was always a man|who wanted to do a feat.
{82801}{82899}Rowing, there's no|possibility of doing a feat.
{82903}{82977}l mean, everybody's|on the same oar rowing, like that.
{82982}{83085}Bailing out? Saving everybody's life?|Gosh, l mean, that's sort of...
{83089}{83173}...a part made in heaven|for my grandfather...
{83178}{83270}...because everybody would be aware|he'd been up all night bailing them out.
{83275}{83345}So gentlemen don't row...
{83349}{83444}...but by Jove, they'd do anything|necessary to save people's lives.
{83656}{83716}{Y:i}When dawn broke, Shackleton recorded:
{83721}{83773}The weather was very thick|in the morning.
{83777}{83845}lndeed, at 7 a.m.|we were under the cliffs...
{83849}{83933}...which plunged sheer to the sea|before we saw them.
{83975}{84034}{Y:i}Elephant Island.
{84050}{84114}{Y:i}The men had been|seven bleak days at sea...
{84118}{84194}{Y:i}...and over five months on drifting ice.
{84198}{84306}{Y:i}It was a year and four months|since they had touched land.
{84657}{84761}{Y:i}With frostbitten fingers,|Hurley recorded the landing.
{85216}{85266}{Y:i}In his diary, Hurley wrote:
{85270}{85393}Many of the party were emaciated|by exhaustion, fatigue and exposure.
{85397}{85538}Many suffered from temporary|aberration, or shivering as with palsy.
{85542}{85617}{Y:i}The men reeled|along the beach as if drunk...
{85622}{85706}{Y:i}...some burying their faces in the stones.
{85746}{85818}{Y:i}Wordie recalled more chilling behavior.
{85822}{85883}Some fellows were half-crazy.
{85888}{86023}One got an axe and did not stop|until he had killed about 1 0 seals.
{86332}{86389}{Y:i}Shackleton ordered food prepared.
{86407}{86492}{Y:i}It was the first hot meal in three days.
{86793}{86861}{Y:i}Hurley described the first night.
{86866}{86929}Tents were hastily erected,|all turned in...
{86933}{87022}...and almost instantly|were deep in slumber.
{87038}{87095}How delicious to wake in one's sleep...
{87100}{87209}...and listen to the croaks of penguins|mingling with the sea.
{87254}{87343}To fall asleep and awaken again,|and feel this is real.
{87347}{87410}We have reached land.
{87470}{87626}{Y:i}Land, such as it was, was a low sliver|of beach that offered no shelter.
{87657}{87716}{Y:i}Two days later, Shackleton led the men...
{87721}{87804}{Y:i}...to a second location|on the western side of the island.
{87818}{87923}{Y:i}The new campsite was called|Cape Wild, after Frank Wild.
{87928}{88027}{Y:i}To the sailors it was Cape Bloody Wild.
{88082}{88150}{Y:i}The boats landed in sleet and rain.
{88154}{88238}{Y:i}By night a gale blew up,|ripping one of the tents to shreds...
{88242}{88312}{Y:i}...and blowing equipment out to sea.
{88322}{88427}{Y:i}Men crawled under the boats for shelter,|and lay shivering in their tunics...
{88433}{88499}{Y:i}...as the wind heaped snow upon them.
{88504}{88589}{Y:i}The blizzard raged for five days.
{88749}{88851}l think l spent, this morning,|the most unhappy hour of my life.
{88855}{88903}All attempts seemed so hopeless...
{88907}{88994}...and fate seemed absolutely|determined to thwart us.
{88998}{89106}Men sat and cursed, not loudly,|but with an intensity that showed...
{89110}{89212}...their hatred of this island|on which we had sought shelter.
{89525}{89637}Shackleton had saved his men|in the sense he'd got them all alive...
{89641}{89778}...out of the ice and on to terra firma.|But now how to get back to civilization?
{89782}{89886}Elephant lsland was off...
{89890}{90038}...any conceivable shipping route.|Not only that, she was nowhere near...
{90042}{90145}...the routes of the whalers and sealers|that used to come down there.
{90149}{90277}So somehow Shackleton|had to get his men...
{90282}{90412}...to a port of call, even if it was only|a lonely island where the sealers came.
{90485}{90619}{Y:i}Staring down impossible odds,|Shackleton made a bold decision.
{90640}{90746}{Y:i}He would not wait,|he would sail for rescue.
{90782}{90845}{Y:i}Cape Horn, the closest land,|was beyond reach...
{90849}{90923}{Y:i}...as it would mean sailing against|the prevailing wind.
{90928}{91015}{Y:i}In the path of the westerlies|was the island they'd set out from:
{91021}{91063}{Y:i}South Georgia.
{91074}{91134}{Y:i}The plan was made.
{91138}{91221}{Y:i}Shackleton would take|a 22-and-a-half-foot-long boat...
{91225}{91331}{Y:i}...800 miles across|the world's most dangerous ocean.
{91418}{91478}{Y:i}Work began immediately|on the James Caird.
{91482}{91579}{Y:i}Earlier, McNish had raised her gunnels|with wood from packing cases.
{91583}{91673}{Y:i}Now he scavenged the other|two boats to reinforce her.
{91677}{91774}{Y:i}The seams were sealed with|Marston's oil paints and seal's blood.
{91778}{91845}{Y:i}Her deck was canvassed.
{91865}{91985}Itwasn't only that McNish was a good|shipwright, a good ship's carpenter...
{91989}{92098}...but he appeared to have|something extra.
{92102}{92258}He had a streak of ingenuity...
{92277}{92395}...of the real ability to improvise...
{92399}{92466}...to make something out of nothing.
{92470}{92624}And l think this is connected with|a strain of perversity, of cussedness.
{92629}{92784}And here's another paradox:|This was the mutineer who'd come good.
{92849}{92954}{Y:i}Shackleton chose the strongest and|most seasoned sailors for the journey.
{92958}{93077}{Y:i}With the greatest pride, McNish recorded|his own inclusion in the 6-man crew.
{93081}{93157}{Y:i}He would be joined|by Tom Crean and Tim McCarthy...
{93162}{93263}{Y:i}...both Irish sailors and stalwarts|of the voyage to Elephant Island.
{93268}{93349}{Y:i}The demoted boatswain John Vincent|was also redeemed.
{93353}{93417}{Y:i}Shackleton recognized|his strength and skill...
{93421}{93547}{Y:i}...the result of years on trawlers in the|brutal conditions of the North Atlantic.
{93609}{93694}{Y:i}Captain Frank Worsley had navigated|the boats to Elephant Island.
{93698}{93805}{Y:i}Now he would have to find a tiny speck|of land in a limitless ocean.
{93810}{93894}{Y:i}Pacing the shore, he checked|and rechecked the chronometer...
{93898}{93957}{Y:i}...that would be critical to his navigation.
{93988}{94108}{Y:i}Frank Wild, Shackleton's right-hand,|would be in charge of those left behind.
{94113}{94178}{Y:i}As the expedition was split|for the first time...
{94182}{94253}{Y:i}... Wild's unenviable commission|was the care of 2 1...
{94257}{94412}{Y:i}...demoralized, partially incapacitated|men on a deserted, wind-raked island.
{95070}{95216}{Y:i}On April 22, 1 9 1 6, McNish finished|his work and the weather cleared.
{95734}{95825}{Y:i}Moored offshore, the Caird was loaded|with 2 tons of stone ballast...
{95829}{95885}{Y:i}...for stability in the towering waves.
{96022}{96155}{Y:i}Water from ice laboriously melted|over a blubber flame was stored in kegs.
{96209}{96259}{Y:i}They took food for four weeks.
{96263}{96353}{Y:i}Beyond this they knew|they could not survive.
{96445}{96534}{Y:i}Standing on the beach, Hurley|captured the moment of departure...
{96538}{96640}{Y:i}...as the men left behind|bravely cheered the Caird on her way.
{96761}{96817}{Y:i}On board the Caird, Worsley reflected:
{96832}{96889}The men ashore formed|a pathetic group.
{96893}{96955}As long as they thought|we could see them...
{96961}{97061}...they kept up a wonderful appearance|of optimism and heartiness.
{97293}{97352}{Y:i}Elephant Island receded|into the distance...
{97357}{97451}{Y:i}...as the Caird departed on a day|of rare sunshine and calm seas.
{97765}{97834}{Y:i}Soon the Caird was in rougher waters.
{97881}{97945}{Y:i}By the second day, the weather|had grown severe...
{97949}{98014}{Y:i}...and water began pouring|into the little boat.
{98173}{98222}{Y:i}Frank Worsley recalled:
{98226}{98300}Bruised and soaked with never|a long enough interval...
{98305}{98369}...for our bodies to warm|our steaming clothes...
{98373}{98455}...our feet and legs had swelled and|began to be frostbitten...
{98461}{98550}...with the temperature|at times nearly down to zero.
{98590}{98658}{Y:i}McNish alone attempted|to keep a sea log...
{98662}{98736}{Y:i}...but on the ninth day,|he abruptly broke it off.
{98776}{98843}{Y:i}They worked round the clock|in four-hour shifts...
{98848}{98935}{Y:i}...three men vainly attempting to sleep|on the rocky ballast below...
{98939}{99015}{Y:i}...while three others held watch above,|bailing, pumping...
{99019}{99104}{Y:i}...trimming the sails,|fighting to keep the Caird afloat.
{99401}{99461}They were in a 22-foot-6|little rowing boat.
{99465}{99556}And it is absolutely staggering,|the height of the waves.
{99570}{99619}There were some incredible waves...
{99664}{99736}...which might nowadays|be called non-negotiable waves...
{99741}{99788}...where you'd head up to the top...
{99793}{99862}...and not get over the top|and you'd slide back down.
{99866}{99952}So it was an extraordinary|journey of survival.
{100142}{100223}{Y:i}In the end,|everything depended on Worsley.
{100228}{100313}{Y:i}He had learned to navigate|in the high surf of the South Pacific...
{100317}{100394}{Y:i}...but nothing could compare|to his present challenge.
{100398}{100441}{Y:i}To chart the Caird's position...
{100445}{100527}{Y:i}... Worsley needed to read|the sun's relation to the horizon.
{100531}{100602}{Y:i}But the sun rarely appeared|in the overcast sky...
{100606}{100704}{Y:i}...and the horizon became almost|impossible to find behind the waves.
{100709}{100813}{Y:i}Even to attempt a sextant reading, he had|to be braced by men on either side...
{100817}{100895}{Y:i}...as the boat heaved and pitched|her way through the water.
{100961}{101061}You mustn't forget,|every degree mistake you make...
{101065}{101141}...is 60 miles of latitude.
{101145}{101245}And they only had|about 1 0 miles leeway...
{101249}{101334}...in 800 miles in order to reach safety.
{101380}{101437}{Y:i}In 800 miles of stormy travel...
{101441}{101513}{Y:i}... Worsley was able to take|only four sightings.
{101551}{101634}{Y:i}The remainder of the journey|he navigated by dead reckoning...
{101638}{101727}{Y:i}...the experienced sailor's instinctive|gauging of speed and direction...
{101731}{101792}{Y:i}...or ''merry guesswork, ''|as he called it.
{101909}{102021}{Y:i}On the 1 0th day, Worsley believed|that they were a little over halfway.
{102073}{102109}{Y:i}He recalled:
{102124}{102193}Two of the party|were very close to death.
{102197}{102269}Shackleton kept a finger|on each man's pulse.
{102273}{102358}Whenever he noticed that a man|seemed extra cold and shivered...
{102362}{102472}...he would immediately order another hot|drink to be prepared and served to all.
{102477}{102571}He never let the man know|that it was on his account.
{102645}{102746}{Y:i}Vincent's upper lip was torn away|by a frozen metal cup.
{102793}{102854}Oh, God, it must have been desperate.
{102858}{102926}That's all--|Itmust have been desperate.
{102969}{103099}My father's ears,|his two ears, suffered frostbite.
{103103}{103173}They were like bones.
{103242}{103318}{Y:i}On the evening of May 7,|the 1 4th day at sea...
{103322}{103384}{Y:i}...a piece of kelp floated by.
{103405}{103453}{Y:i}Land was near.
{103463}{103511}{Y:i}Worsley recalled this moment:
{103516}{103602}We looked at each other|with cheerful, foolish grins.
{103606}{103689}The thoughts uppermost were,|''We've done it!''
{103845}{103950}{Y:i}With land in sight,|new ordeals arose to test their limits.
{103960}{104053}{Y:i}A wind drove them perilously close|to the island's cliffs.
{104057}{104123}{Y:i}Soon this wind increased|into hurricane force...
{104128}{104193}{Y:i}...descending upon them from|the darkening skies.
{104221}{104278}This is where Worsley|came into his own...
{104282}{104361}...because he understood the way|a sailing ship worked...
{104365}{104507}...and so he performed a miracle|with a round-bottomed whaler...
{104542}{104663}...whose profession was making leeway,|not built for sailing into the wind.
{104668}{104800}Somehow he clawed his way offshore|and into the wind.
{104833}{104906}{Y:i}The hurricane raged for nine hours.
{104953}{105047}{Y:i}Then the wind veered,|carrying them from destruction.
{105133}{105181}{Y:i}Shackleton recorded:
{105185}{105293}We stood offshore,|tired almost to the point of apathy.
{105378}{105457}{Y:i}On the evening of May 1 0,|the 1 7 th day at sea...
{105461}{105546}{Y:i}...the James Caird sailed into the|entrance of King Haakon Bay...
{105550}{105594}{Y:i}...on South Georgia.
{105669}{105788}{Y:i}In the gathering darkness, the boat ran|in on a swell and touched the beach.
{105793}{105907}{Y:i}A small stream flowed nearby and|the men fell to their knees and drank.
{105918}{106029}{Y:i}One of the greatest boat journeys|in modern maritime history had ended.
{106441}{106517}{Y:i}Above them, the hill was green|with tussock grass...
{106521}{106613}{Y:i}...the first vegetation they had seen|in 1 7 months.
{106689}{106731}{Y:i}McNish recalled:
{106735}{106825}l went on top of the hill|and had a lay on the grass...
{106829}{106893}...and it put me in mind|of old times at home...
{106897}{106985}...sitting on the hillside|looking down at the sea.
{107158}{107257}{Y:i}Suddenly home, rescue,|seemed possible.
{107266}{107307}{Y:i}There was only one catch.
{107311}{107411}{Y:i}The whaling stations lay|on the opposite side of the island.
{107479}{107564}{Y:i}Neither crew nor boat|were fit for another sea journey.
{107578}{107656}{Y:i}The island would have to be|crossed on foot.
{107750}{107838}Itwas a terrible setback.
{107877}{107995}l think that most men...
{107999}{108091}...under those circumstances,|without Shackleton's leadership...
{108095}{108242}...they might've collapsed morally there|and therefore not survived.
{108281}{108350}He took it all in a very matter-of-fact way.
{108362}{108458}He gave the impression that everything|would be all right in the end.
{108485}{108559}{Y:i}Their single map showed|only the island's coastline.
{108563}{108614}{Y:i}The interior was unknown.
{108619}{108719}{Y:i}Icy and forbidding, prey to sudden|blizzards and hurricane-force winds...
{108724}{108796}{Y:i}...the whalers considered it impenetrable.
{108873}{108973}{Y:i}This chaos of peaks and glaciers|had never been crossed.
{109113}{109172}{Y:i}They had just survived 1 7 days at sea...
{109177}{109248}{Y:i}...and their feet|were still numb from frostbite.
{109253}{109351}{Y:i}But if rescue were to be made,|they had to reach the other side.
{109469}{109547}{Y:i}Shackleton decided to take with him|Crean and Worsley...
{109552}{109639}{Y:i}...leaving behind the other men|who were not fit for the journey.
{109778}{109891}{Y:i}Using screws from the Caird,|McNish improvised climbing boots.
{109898}{109994}{Y:i}The frost of night would harden the snow,|making it easier to cross.
{109998}{110091}{Y:i}But there could be no stopping,|or they would succumb to the cold.
{110095}{110170}{Y:i}They were in a race|for their companions' lives.
{110417}{110483}{Y:i}Too weak to carry anything|but bare necessities...
{110488}{110545}{Y:i}...the three men took a length of rope...
{110549}{110623}{Y:i}...and a carpenter's adz|as their only equipment.
{110690}{110693}{Y:i}Taking advantage of the full moon|and calm weather...
{110693}{110758}{Y:i}Taking advantage of the full moon|and calm weather...
{110764}{110837}{Y:i}...they set out at 3 a.m.|for Stromness Whaling Station.
{110862}{110982}{Y:i}Beneath the deceptive blanketing of snow|lay ice fields pitted with crevasses.
{110998}{111057}{Y:i}One misstep could end in death.
{111115}{111147}{Y:i}As the day grew longer...
{111151}{111254}{Y:i}...they struggled through a bewildering|confusion of ridges and plateaus.
{111383}{111445}{Y:i}Time after time|they would ascend a summit...
{111449}{111521}{Y:i}...only to find a precipice|on the other side.
{111794}{111826}{Y:i}Shackleton recalled:
{111830}{111918}We were now feeling the strain|of the unaccustomed marching.
{111922}{112031}We had done little walking since January|and our muscles were out of tune.
{112170}{112254}{Y:i}By evening, they were again|high on a treacherous pass...
{112258}{112315}{Y:i}...too steep to climb down.
{112673}{112790}Itwas of the utmost importance for us to|get down into the next valley before dark.
{112794}{112870}The night temperature|at that elevation would be very low.
{112874}{112927}We had no sleeping bags.
{113034}{113075}{Y:i}Worsley recorded:
{113081}{113161}Shackleton said,|''We've got to take a risk.
{113165}{113249}Are you game? We'll slide.''
{113261}{113333}{Y:i}Coiling their rope into a pad,|they sat down...
{113337}{113462}{Y:i}...then pushed off, not knowing what|rocks or razor-sharp ice lay in their path.
{113503}{113550}We seemed to shoot into space.
{113567}{113659}Quite suddenly l felt a glow|and knew that l was grinning.
{113765}{113845}We finished up at the bottom|in a bank of snow.
{113885}{113990}We picked ourselves up|and solemnly shook hands all round.
{114273}{114348}{Y:i}All night into early morning,|they marched on.
{114374}{114400}{Y:i}Wrote Shackleton:
{114405}{114497}At 5 a.m., we were at the foot|of the rocky spurs of the range.
{114501}{114601}We were tired and wind that blew down|from the heights was chilling us.
{114605}{114695}l thought we might be able|to keep warm and have a rest.
{114721}{114801}Within minutes,|my two companions were asleep.
{115459}{115555}l realized it would be disastrous|if we all slumbered together...
{115559}{115669}...for sleep under such conditions|merges into death.
{115705}{115779}After five minutes l shook them|into consciousness again...
{115783}{115845}...told them that they'd slept|for half an hour...
{115849}{115902}...and gave the word for a fresh start.
{116239}{116300}{Y:i}By 6:30 a.m., they had climbed a ridge...
{116305}{116395}{Y:i}...that looked down upon a site familiar|from a year and a half earlier:
{116399}{116441}{Y:i}Fortuna Bay.
{116445}{116515}{Y:i}Stromness was around the corner.
{116593}{116654}{Y:i}At 3 in the afternoon on May 20...
{116658}{116779}{Y:i}...Shackleton, Worsley and Crean|stumbled into Stromness Station.
{116803}{116876}{Y:i}They had been marching for 36 hours.
{117208}{117277}{Y:i}At the home of Thoralf Sørlle,|the station manager...
{117281}{117331}{Y:i}...they knocked on the door.
{117415}{117502}{Y:i}''Who the hell are you?''|Sørlle reportedly asked.
{117534}{117605}{Y:i}''My name is Shackleton, ''|came the answer.
{117637}{117789}The whaling manager couldn't recognize|them because they were dirty, emaciated.
{117801}{117956}They were soot-grimed because of living|over blubber stoves for so long.
{117965}{118036}Their clothes were filthy.|Their hair was uncut.
{118069}{118165}They were like men|returning from the dead.
{118384}{118444}{Y:i}That night the weather turned.
{118449}{118502}{Y:i}Lying in bed in the manager's house...
{118506}{118594}{Y:i}...Shackleton listened|to snow drive against the window.
{118665}{118764}{Y:i}Had they been caught in a blizzard,|nothing could have saved them.
{118871}{118953}{Y:i}Years later, Shackleton|would give a mystical account...
{118957}{119013}{Y:i}...of the crossing of South Georgia.
{119022}{119114}l know that during that long|and racking march of 36 hours...
{119118}{119202}...over the unnamed mountains|and glaciers of South Georgia...
{119206}{119307}...it seemed to me often|that we were four, not three.
{119311}{119413}l said nothing to my companions,|but afterwards Worsley said to me:
{119417}{119543}''Boss, l had a curious feeling|that there was another person with us.''
{119651}{119709}The fourth man,|l suppose, was the man above.
{119713}{119819}They must have been deeply religious|at the back of everything.
{119824}{119860}They must.
{120005}{120062}{Y:i}Three days after arriving in Stromness...
{120066}{120181}{Y:i}...Shackleton, Worsley and Crean set out|for Elephant Island in a borrowed ship.
{120185}{120292}{Y:i}Their three companions back at King|Haakon Bay were given passages home.
{120341}{120387}{Y:i}60 miles short of the island...
{120391}{120470}{Y:i}...the rescue ship was brought|to a halt by their old enemy:
{120474}{120509}{Y:i}Ice.
{120544}{120605}{Y:i}There was nothing to do but return.
{120640}{120735}{Y:i}Over the next four months, Shackleton|made increasingly frantic attempts...
{120739}{120805}{Y:i}...to get through to his men|on Elephant Island.
{120820}{120865}{Y:i}At last, in late August...
{120869}{120955}{Y:i}...the Chilean government loaned him|a small tug called the Yelcho...
{120959}{121069}{Y:i}...and Shackleton, Worsley and Crean|set out on their fourth rescue attempt.
{121174}{121213}{Y:i}Elephant Island.
{121228}{121318}{Y:i}The rescue party was now|at least 1 0 weeks overdue.
{121357}{121410}{Y:i}In his diary, Orde-Lees wrote:
{121414}{121483}August 26, 1 91 6.
{121487}{121577}Another wretched day,|very dull and draining.
{121597}{121663}What little seal meat|we have left is tainted.
{121667}{121715}We've picked it over so often...
{121720}{121801}...that nothing but|the most decomposed remains.
{121852}{121912}{Y:i}The 22 men had passed|a sunless winter...
{121917}{121997}{Y:i}...living in a small hut|made from the overturned boats.
{122094}{122174}Twenty-two of us lived|in a tiny, dark little hut.
{122178}{122218}The weather was just appalling.
{122222}{122305}Blizzards and snowstorms|almost the whole time.
{122309}{122375}The great difficulty, of course,|was lack of water.
{122380}{122427}There was frozen water all round...
{122431}{122494}...but you can't suck ice|at those temperatures.
{122498}{122550}Itblisters your lips and your tongue...
{122554}{122610}...as though you'd sucked|a piece of hot iron.
{122614}{122661}So we'd take a few chips of ice...
{122665}{122743}...in our sleeping bags with us|at night in a tobacco tin.
{122747}{122834}And if you lay very still,|a few of the chips would melt...
{122838}{122927}...and you'd have a spoonful of water|for breakfast in the morning.
{123019}{123054}Food was very short.
{123058}{123150}We had little except a little seal|and penguin whenever they came up...
{123154}{123275}...and Marston had a little cookery book,|from which he'd read one recipe a night.
{123280}{123345}We all lay around very quietly|and very solemnly...
{123349}{123413}...suggesting, in turns, improvements|and alterations...
{123417}{123459}...and when the last man finished...
{123463}{123563}...we dreamt of the second helpings|we'd refuse when we were back home.
{123568}{123639}lt's difficult to realize|how hungry a man can be.
{123643}{123685}When we'd eaten our rations...
{123689}{123751}...and such seals and penguins|as we could catch...
{123755}{123814}...then and then...
{123818}{123917}...without any enmity,|we looked at one another.
{124151}{124245}{Y:i}Each day Wild roused the company|from their bags with the cry:
{124249}{124327}{Y:i}''Lash up and stow!|The Boss may come today!''
{124337}{124409}{Y:i}But by the end of August,|even Wild had given up hope...
{124413}{124468}{Y:i}...that Shackleton would return.
{124530}{124591}{Y:i}Orde-Lees summarized the situation:
{124603}{124697}The idea of a ship ever coming now|is getting more and more remote...
{124701}{124808}...as preparations are being pushed along|for sending one of our two boats.
{124816}{124897}{Y:i}Wild and four other members|are to go in the Dudley Docker...
{124901}{124993}...and will make their way from island|to island of the South Shetlands...
{124997}{125054}...until they reach Deception lsland...
{125058}{125126}...about 250 miles away.
{125161}{125221}Itis a big undertaking.
{125325}{125383}{Y:i}On August 30, 1 9 1 6...
{125387}{125487}{Y:i}...the men were gathered in their hut|for a lunch of boiled seal backbone.
{125491}{125603}{Y:i}Marston and Hurley remained outside|shelling limpets picked in the shallows.
{125647}{125713}{Y:i}Suddenly, Marston put his head|inside the hut.
{125717}{125753}{Y:i}Macklin recalled:
{125757}{125857}Marston burst in asking if it would|not be a good thing to send up smoke.
{125861}{125919}Wild called out to know|what was the matter.
{125923}{125978}Marston replied with the magic words:
{125982}{126023}''A ship!''
{126165}{126264}{Y:i}From the deck of the Yelcho, Shackleton|scanned Cape Wild through binoculars...
{126269}{126353}{Y:i}...counting the figures who poured out|of the hut onto the beach.
{126506}{126539}{Y:i}Frank Worsley recalled:
{126544}{126637}Two, five, seven,|and then an exultant shout:
{126641}{126729}''They're all there, skipper.|They're all safe!''
{126889}{126929}Crean joined us...
{126933}{127019}...and we were all unable to speak.
{127401}{127506}{Y:i}All hands were safe.|Not one life had been lost.
{127777}{127860}{Y:i}An ecstatic welcome|greeted Shackleton in Punta Arenas.
{127865}{127922}{Y:i}Although Germany|was at war with Britain...
{127926}{128010}{Y:i}...the German community|raised flags of celebration.
{128416}{128485}{Y:i}The crew of the Endurance returned|to a British nation...
{128489}{128572}{Y:i}...that little resembled the one|they had left two years before.
{128584}{128665}When Shackleton|and his men had left England...
{128669}{128723}...the Great War had just started...
{128728}{128830}...and their minds|were still in Edwardian England.
{128834}{128961}When they returned to civilization now,|they entered the modern world...
{128965}{129105}...and the war, as it turned out,|was beyond their comprehension.
{129125}{129261}And because of the dreadful carnage|on the battlefields in Europe...
{129265}{129324}...Shackleton rather disappeared.
{129329}{129451}And in any case, he was the wrong|kind of hero for England at the time.
{129455}{129509}The British wanted dead heroes...
{129513}{129598}...and they had lots and lots|of dead heroes.
{129946}{130001}l suspect in 1 91 8...
{130005}{130122}...the death of so many people|in the trenches in the war...
{130126}{130190}...made them feel that they had been...
{130199}{130257}...l could've said, nearly cowards.
{130261}{130358}That they avoided two years of the war|and they were lucky to be alive.
{130445}{130526}{Y:i}Most of the men|entered the war upon their return.
{130577}{130675}{Y:i}Frank Hurley went off to photograph|the fighting in the trenches.
{130682}{130793}{Y:i}Tim McCarthy would be killed|at sea six weeks after enlisting.
{130933}{130991}{Y:i}McNish emigrated to New Zealand...
{130996}{131092}{Y:i}...working on the docks|before suffering a crippling injury.
{131109}{131189}{Y:i}Most members of the expedition|were awarded the Polar Medal...
{131194}{131285}{Y:i}...but Shackleton withheld this honor|from McNish and three others.
{131299}{131396}{Y:i}The carpenter's brief rebellion|on the ice had cost him dearly.
{131649}{131690}{Y:i}As Shackleton had known...
{131694}{131785}{Y:i}...the Endurance expedition|had been his last chance at glory.
{131932}{132015}{Y:i}In 1 92 1, he headed south once more...
{132019}{132087}{Y:i}...joined by a handful|of the old Endurance crew:
{132091}{132213}{Y:i}Worsley, Macklin, Green,|Hussey and Frank Wild.
{132269}{132334}{Y:i}The goal of the expedition was unclear.
{132338}{132418}{Y:i}All that mattered was|that they were heading south again.
{132513}{132581}{Y:i}On the evening of his arrival|in South Georgia...
{132585}{132647}{Y:i}...Shackleton had a heart attack and died.
{132652}{132722}{Y:i}He was not quite 48 years old.
{132827}{132869}{Y:i}At the request of his wife...
{132873}{132958}{Y:i}...his men buried him in the island's|small whaling cemetery.
{133523}{133627}{Y:i}Bereft, Shackleton's men continued|their uncertain expedition.
{133646}{133747}{Y:i}Along the way, they took time to visit|a place they never thought to see again:
{133751}{133805}{Y:i}Elephant Island.
{133828}{133913}{Y:i}The expedition photographer|recorded their visit.
{134333}{134402}{Y:i}Confronting the site of their dark winter...
{134406}{134483}{Y:i}...they were overcome|with unexpected nostalgia.
{134493}{134525}{Y:i}Macklin:
{134529}{134583}We have stood gazing with binoculars...
{134587}{134670}...picking out and recognizing|old familiar spots.
{134710}{134793}What memories, what memories!
{134824}{134911}They rush to one like a great flood|and bring tears to one's eyes.
{134915}{135001}As l sit and try to write,|a great rush of feeling comes over me...
{135005}{135061}...and l find l cannot express myself.
{135065}{135155}Once more, l see the old faces|and hear the old voices.
{135160}{135232}Old friends scattered everywhere.
{135249}{135332}But to express it all,|l feel, is impossible.
{135582}{135653}{Y:i}Shackleton's feeling|about the Endurance expedition...
{135657}{135705}{Y:i}...was expressed in his memoir:
{135725}{135793}{Y:i}''We had seen God in his splendors...
{135801}{135881}{Y:i}...heard the text that nature renders.
{135887}{135986}{Y:i}We had reached the naked soul of man. ''
How can you say that?
Because it's true.
You're exactly like a Sebacean.
In what way am I like a Sebacean?
In that you think that you are superior.
And that you treat the rest of us like animals.
When have I ever treated you like that?
Only every time that we have to make a decision and you think that the best idea is your idea.
Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! They are going to write songs about the way you guys tore this place up.
- Right. Go away.
- I am away.
- I'm- on- vacation.
- Pip, beat it.
Has it occured to you why
Pilot banished you from Moya?
Because you're both acting like a couple of immature Dredgenaughts.
- I can' believe you pissed him off.
- I didn't piss him off. You pissed him off.
You did.
Grow up!
Or ignore each other, or kill each other, but just stop fighting all the time.
I'm out of currency.
Here.
Playland for the rich too classy for ya?
But you, you just keep on hunting for that long range cargo hauler of your dreams.
Cause she's bound to show up in you lap one day.
When she passes out, I'll,
I'll take her back to Moya.
In the meantime...
I'm gonna have some fun.
I suggest you guys do the same.
- See what you did?
- You did it.
- You did.
- You.
You... Yeah, right. You did it.
This alien is Raxil.
There's one like her on every planet.
And these girls?
No có¿...
We never did get their names.
Ahh... are you boys... a couple?
- No.
- No.
Can you handle some girls looking to party?
I am a full-blooded Luxan.
And ladies, I have so much cash in my pocket that I can assure you that the three of us...
... will be out of here on our hands and knees come sunrise tomorrow morning.
I've been arrested for saying exactly the same thing on four different planets.
Fe'Tor.
Bad guy. Dressed in black.
Another bad guy. The guy with Fe'Tor.
Crichton... Crichton, wake up!
Wake up!
Crichton!
- What happened?
- What didn't happen?
Oh, God, there were girls, right?
Feathered chicks...
The, the... Rainbow Coalition.
Girls. Breasts.
Blue breasts, green breasts, I don't know.
All I know is... they spiked our drinks and took our money.
- They rolled us?
- Yeah, they rolled us.
- You know, these...
- My pulse pistol.
...shots that we took?
They spiked em.
My pulse pistol!
They-they took my damn pulse pistol!
No one stole your pulse pistol.
We're on LoMo... no weapons allowed. Your pulse pistol's on the transport pod.
I don't remember that.
Where are my boots?
D'Argo...
...we're in a window.
There are people watching.
I think they've been there for about seven arns, so... why don't you just get dressed and give 'em a good show sweetheart.
I am dressed.
My name is John Crichton...
I'm lost... an astronaut... shot through a wormhole...
In some distant part of the universe...
I'm trying to stay alive...
Aboard this ship... this living ship... of escaped prisoners... my friends.
If you can hear me... beware... if I make it back... will they follow?
If I open the door... are you ready?
Earth is unprepared... helpless... for the nightmares...
I've seen.
Or should I stay... protect my home... not show them... you exist.
But then you'll never know... the wonders I've seen.
I said ten solar days away from Moya...
...and I meant ten!
Pilot, gimme a break. I'm tryin' to tell you what happened.
I understand, Crichton.
However, my inclination is not to accept any explanation.
Well, I can't go back down there.
I'm persona non grata on LoMo.
LoMo non grata.
Can't do it, not goin', uh-uh.
You return... beat-up, inebriated and broke, after only two!
Yeah.
But, that's what I'm tryin' to explain to you.
You said that if I could explain it, then I-I could stay onboard, right?
Proceed.
How the hell did we end up in that window?
I don't know.
- You don't think we, ah...
- I said, I don't know!
Hey, don't-don't yell. It hurts.
Have we heard from Jool or Pip yet?
- They haven't been answering their comms.
- Right. Go find 'em Lassie.
It was your idea to come down here in the first place.
You go frelling find them.
Aren't you worried about them?
Aw, hell, no.
They're probably sleepin' off the fun they had last night.
- Shut up.
- Hey, don't tell me to shut up!
You know, you're the one who told em to have fun.
Whadda you think fun is for Chiana?
- shut-up.
- What?!
John...isn't that the pile of dren we saw outside the window?
Yeah. Smile.
It was also in the bar last night, wasn't it?
I'm so glad you're not angry.
Ya know, I thought you were gonna...
Oh, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna scream!
- Don't scream!
- Did you steal our currency?
What are you talking about?
I didn't steal anything.
I came over here to talk to you, you know?
But you looked so angry before when you were in the window...
- Not talkin' about the window!
- All right.
Let me give ya something here.
I saw it all.
They're in trouble.
Yeah, they're gonna be in a lot more trouble when I find 'em.
The green and the blue chick...
Not the blue and green chick.
No, no, no.
I'm talking about your females.
I'm talking about the pretty gray one and the really annoying gold one.
- What about them?
- They're in trouble.
I can show ya. I can show ya what happened last night.
Let me go.
D'Argo, look.
Chiana knows how to look after herself.
We gotta find our money and I'm pretty sure... that this grommet is involved.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I've got something for ya.
I've got us a recording of all that happened last night.
I mean, ya don't believe it, you can see it for yourselves, ya know?
It's talking crap.
We got rolled, and I don't think we need a...
You're broke...
You can't get robbed again.
I mean, what do you think?
You think I want your shoes?
- I don't know what you want.
- You're not very smart, are you?
Now he...
...he's got brains
Now you, you're a bit of an idiot, huh?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- But, I'm bigger.
- Oh! Ow-ow. All right. Sorry-sorry-sorry.
Alright. Alright.
Ha-have you spoken to your females yet?
I'll bet you haven't spoken to them yet.
No, we haven't spoken to them, because they might be sleeping, they could be...
"Oh, yeah, princess."
How do I know you haven't spoken to them yet, huh?
You don't know that, do ya?
- No. Well, my point is...
- Will you just tell us!?
- That's Jool's comm.
- How do you know?
It's melted around the edges from when she screams.
Now. Do you want to see what happened last night or not?
'Cause I could just, you know, not.
All right, all right.
You don't have to push me.
The point is, you see, we can be friends, you can trust me, you see...
...everybody trusts me, 'cause I'm a female of my word.
- Oh, what is that?!
- It smells like...
Shh, shh, shh! Close... but no.
It-It's miramar root, you know?
Kabaah uses it in all his pleasure elixars.
Very low quality.
But we don't tell him that.
Mr. Kabaah?
- Wake up!
- Don't... yell.
Well, I have to, he's as deaf as a feather.
Wake up!
Go away.
I don't need your trouble.
Trouble? Me?
No, no, no. You must have me confused with someone else.
I'm not confused.
I've seen you snooping around, seeing you when you didn't want me to.
Is that...a Han-jee?
A Han-jee? I don't believe you.
What's a Han-jee?
Creature with removable eyes.
Optic nerves that continue to record and send back images,...
... even after they're seperated from the body.
Leave 'em in somebody's bed chamber...
You brought us to see a pornographer?!
I'm deaf, not dead.
Stop talking like I'm not here.
What do you want?
I know you've always got an eye hanging out at the LoMo bar.
So?
We're looking for a Nebari and an Interon.
You want... the show.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Who's paying?
You don't think you'll get the show for... free, do you?
We have no currency. You know that.
Come on, you gotta have something.
All right then, we are being scammed.
Ren and Stimpy here are teamin' up to rip us off.
Let's get outta here.
This phanix?
I would never team up with her.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just to prove to you... I'll pay.
There.
- Where did you get that currency?
- Why? What's the matter?
All of our brandar tiles were stolen last night.
So? Did you have your name on 'em?
No-No!
They aren't yours, they're mine, they're mine.
You two have really got to work on your attitude, you know that?
Kabaah, give 'em a tentacle.
Put one of these on your eye.
You gotta be kidding me.
These will link back to the optic memory of last night, and act as a three-dimensional image of everything that happened in the bar.
You want us... to put one of your tentacles... in our eye?
Don't be such a grimmit
Just do it!
This is, uh... this is.
D'Argo, you-you see'n this?
This is... uh...
Well, it's, uh... it's incredible.
Kabaah, show us the females.
Oh, hello.
I can be bad. You're jealous.
All right.
Yeah, this looks really dangerous.
Those girls are in fear for their lives.
Yeah, all right.
Have you got anything else?
Kabaah, get your eye outta the gutter.
Show them later... later!
- That it?
- Yeah.
You.
You want me?
Watch.
I just won a bet.
Raslak. Make it a large.
You smell so exotic.
I like watching you dance.
I like watching you and your friend... but especially... you!
Oh, big deal. She's being hit on by some guy.
Knowing Chi, he's probably in more trouble than she is.
Wait, there's more.
I have something for you.
You...
I like the look of you.
- Who is this bastard?
- That's Fe'Tor.
Ow! Whoa, whoa!
What the hell just happened?
You didn't pay me enough to cross Fe'Tor.
- Who is Fe'Tor?
- He was what I was tryin' to show ya.
Fe'Tor's the most famous kaznick around here.
He rounds up all the good-looking ones and they all just party night and day, night and day.
- What? Does he... do them?
- He hurts 'em. e gives 'em the whiff... well, you saw.
And then they do anything.
I'm not sure, but I think this is Fe'Tor's sister.
Her freslin is still...adequate.
I'm not interested in... "adequate."
We gotta get your females out of there.
- Do you know where we can find them?
- Yeah, got an idea.
Whoa! Hey, Whoa! D'Argo. D'Argo, wait.
What we saw is from last night.
Chiana could not even be with that guy anymore.
We can't have another auction yet.
It's too soon, too dangerous.
I think our female upstairs may be exceptional. For her, we can risk it.
D'Argo, why are you believing this Raxil thing here?
Chiana was having fun.
She could be walking back into the bar right now, we don't know.
Well why don't you go to the bar and wait for her?
- D'Argo, I...
- It's fine.
I'm just going to go along and say... hello.
Squeeze her dry.
Well, I've been comm'n the girls. No answer.
- Did you find 'em?
- Found 'em.
Deliveries around the back.
- Oh, oh, 'round the back?
- Yeah.
Uh... okay, thanks.
- They okay?
- They're fine.
Jool! Jool!
- Are you all right?
- Ah! Oh, D'Argo.
- Oh, come in with me. Come on.
- Where... is... Chiana?
Over there.
Um... ah... we thought that perhaps you might be in some trouble.
I'm not in any trouble.
At least none I don't want to be in.
Where's Raxil? She didn't wait around like she said she would.
That way.
Ow! Ow! Did you see them?
Are they in trouble?
They were taking... a bath.
...we saw him... give you something.
Some stuff.
- Oh... were you spying on me?
- No... no.
D'Argo, I came here to have a good time.
Does that make you jealous?
No. I'm not jealous. It's just that, ah...
'Cause you and me, we're-we're not together anymore, are we?
Ah, no, we're not together anymore...
Well then, let go of me.
All right. You and Jool are coming with me.
Let me go!
Chiana? Everything all right?
- She's fine.
- Why don't you let go of her then?
Why don't you mind your own business, you miserable little tralk?
They had...
...weapons!
You said... it would be a party!
But they had weapons that they put to my head!
They had weapons?!
Yes, but they weren't pointed at Chiana.
They were pointed at me.
Please, please, calm yourself.
I don't like to show force.
But you are in my residence and you are attacking my people.
Now... get out.
Chiana...
D'Argo, get out. Go!
Oh, we're fine, D'Argo, really.
We're just...
Uh... D'Argo? You're gonna kill her.
At the moment, I do not have a problem with that.
- What did you spray on him?
- Freslin.
Stop! Stop!
This makes no sense.
You make no sense.
What? Wh-What doesn't make sense?
She nailed him with love potion number 9.
It made him dance?
Well, it's a way to meet girls.
Pilot, just listen to this, all right?
This is important.
This is about the deal. It's about Freslin.
LoMo's dirty little secret.
I suspect the dirtly little secret is you spent...
... all your currency on pleasure and now...
Hey! You know what?!
It's a weird universe out there man.
You don't know that 'cause you're spending all your time indoors.
Just... let me finish my story.
See?
See why I made us get off the beach?
- He would've been chasing everything that moves.
- And it's all because of this stuff you gave him?
Freslin's an attractant.
You could be attractive to someone else, or they could be attracted to you.
It could be strong, weak... anything.
Depends on where it's manufactured.
Did you like the Freslin I gave you last night?
Is this more?
Mm, different batch... different quality.
Want a taste?
Bring it on.
- It's different.
- More better?
Yeah.
An animal's last batch always is.
This is... uh, this is from an animal?
A beautiful animal.
Is this the same stuff, that that guy sprayed on Chiana last night?
Yeah. Grade-A Freslin. Made in his own lab.
Fe'Tor's got the most sensitive nose in the business!
- What am I missing?!
- Nothing. Here.
Wonderful, isn't it?
Yeah.
Now. Will you do anything for me?
I'll do anything for you.
I think Fe'Tor wants your females for more than just...
... you know.
What... does he want them for?
No peeking.
Can you smell it?
Just breathe it in.
Well, the base element of Freslin is found in the senal gland...
... of sentient beings.
- Oh, you mean, like in... people?
- Yeah.
Fe'Tor's got a machine that milks this gland.
And... and when there's a lot of demand, well sometimes he'll milk them until... they die.
You'll love it.
Can I open my eyes yet?
Why did you not tell us this earlier?
John...
These people... will not dance with me.
- No one wants to dance
- No. Go away!
- Look at the booty on that girl!
- The booty?
Sweetie pie. Why'nt'cha come with...
I should have told you everything, but I was scared.
Fe'Tor's dangerous.
If Fe'Tor is so dangerous, why help us at all?
My mate, Sarl...
...he's with Fe'Tor.
He doesn't look very well.
I mean, he's tall, he's good-looking.
I mean, look at me, I'm a nothing.
I tried to warn him, but...
I'm telling you everything because, when you save your females, I want you to save Sarl.
Isn't that the guy... that was with Fe'Tor last night?
Yeah. That's Mitols... his right-hand shill.
Well he could probably get us in to see the girls, couldn't he?
'Course he can, but he's never gonna tell ya.
Keep D'Argo busy.
I've got some business.
How ya doin'?
Man, were you here last night?
Was that wild or what?
I drink alone.
Yeah, I'm not really ah, interested in drinking either, um...
I'm lookin' for some ah...
Freslin.
And I heard that you were the guy to see.
You like the Freslin?
Trust me.
It only hurts the first time.
Go away.
Okay, okay, okay, look.. let-let me give you somethin'.
I am loaded with currency.
And I'm lookin' for somethin' a little special and this is the only crap that I've been able to find.
And, uh... Kabaah told me that you were the guy to see...
... to get some really serious dren.
If they drained that much fluid from her,
Crichton, she would be dead.
Shut up and let me tell my story!
You really must relax.
Struggle only makes it more painful. Hm?
Mm. That's you you're ingesting.
Kabaah sent you?
Why didn't you say so?
I just did.
Apex of the moon tonight.
Fe'Tor's chamber. Know where it is?
I'll find it.
We're auctioning some incredible dren.
This'll get you in.
My frelling head is killing me, from that spray, you little tralk!
D'Argo, you can kill her later.
Right now, we gotta get the girls outta Fe'tor's.
So, what are we doing here?
'Cause I'm gonna help you, see?
I'm gonna make you a sorta disguise.
Hey, Hammerhead, how'ya doin'?
I'm back for some home video.
Get out, get out!
I don't think so.
I need to see into Fe'Tor's compound.
No, I won't help you against him.
Yes you will, or I'm gonna snap your head off.
Now I'm gonna see the compound layout.
You're gonna show it to me.
I don't care if it's empty, but you're gonna show it to me now.
Eh, this is the auction room.
Not bad, all it needs is a big screen TV.
Ka-D'A-go!
No!... It-It's okay, that's um... that's Harvey, it's not Scorpy. He's a puka.
He's... he's not real.
But thanks to our unique shared conciousness in this situation, we finally get to meet!
Ka-D'A-go!
- Give me five!
- Go away.
I've had some weird conversations in my head before, but this... is a little...
Yeah, I know. Hey, look.
Harvey just shows up every now and then to give me bad advice.
And my suggestion to you both... is to forget this folly.
But... since I know you won't.
Circuit breakers...
...to the entire subterranean level.
Darkness... ah, may be of assistance to you.
You know what? I think that's not a bad idea.
And the milking room you seek?
Down the hallway.
Kabaah, show us the milking room.
Raxil, what is that thing?
That's where they drain the bodies to make the Freslin.
Pleasure Planet, my mivonks.
We better count the steps in here.
One,two, three, four, five, six, seven...
- ...eight.
- ... eight, nine, ten.
Ten steps.
- Uh-uh, eight steps.
- Ten.
Eight! Small legs, human.
Jool?
Jool!
Jool?
- Something wrong?
- No! No, no.
I- I was ah, just tryin' to find Jool.
We should really be going.
You really are quite beautiful.
Yeah.
Where's Jool?
Don't be scared.
Everything's all right.
No, I will not go to Fe'Tor's auction.
- He knows what I look like...
- I'll get you in.
...so I won't get in.
And you're not spraying me with that stuff.
I'm not spending the rest of my life...
- ...on the dance floor doing some...
- This Freslin will be different.
- No! You are not!
- Shut-up! Just shut-up! I did not do everything... plan everything, so you could back out now!
- Did you say plan?
- No, no, no, I didn't mean plan.
I make a plan, like, like,
- like plan something, you know...
- Did you say that you planned this?!
No, no, no, no, I didn't mean that, no, no...
I got everything from the Transport Pod.
Two pulse pistols, a pair of night-vision goggles,
200,000 in tiles so we can buy any...
Freslin we want, uh...
- what did I miss?
- Two guns?
You brought just two guns?
This little rodent... has been lying to us.
- She said that she planned all this.
- Two guns?!
I mean, thought you were the great Crichton and D'Argo?
I mean, you blew up a Shadow Depository.
I mean, I thought you'd bring pulse rechargers...
... and a plasma bomb...
...and a really big gunship!
But, no! You bring nothing!
You bring two little weapons that wouldn't kill a Negnec!
You... have heard of us?
Yeah, I've heard stories.
But obviously they aren't worth a bucket of dren!
What the frell have you done to her?
- Get her out of that thing, you fekkik!
- Chiana.
She's not in any pain.
Don't worry. Eh? Here.
Enough with the dren!
You really shouldn't waste... the taste.
Now, I'll let your friend rest, but I need to replace her...
...with a new animal.
Now, I knew Fe'Tor wouldn't bother your females while you were in the bar.
So I paid...
...the blue and green girls to get you out of the way. wait!
You let... Fe'Tor... kidnap Chiana and Jool?
No, I didn't help him. I just created a situation where everyone...
Is there anything else you're not telling us?!
Nothing, nothing. I promise.
This little... tralk...
... has been lying to us all along.
So, what I suggest is...
Ah! Not again!
Please don't hit me. Please don't...
All right, you can hit me just once! Just once!
- Hello...?
- What?!
I've got a live connection. The Nebari...
Chiana...
They've begun milking her... think you're going to be too late.
Ah... I was right!
You're exceptional.
Would you like a taste?
- Drain as much as you can.
- Without damaging her value, of course.
D'Argo, you should check this out.
D'Argo?
Who the... hell?!
Oh, you know... the Freslin I sprayed him with, radiates his pheromones outwards...
...and creates an auro-morph.
So, we all see D'Argo like this.
I made him very attractive... don't ya think?
What... are you talking about?
D'Argo?
No more! Enough!
Even I am not so gullible as to believe...
... that D'Argo turned into another... creature.
I do not appreciate the lies you tell in order to circumvent...
Whoa, ho! Hold o
How long have we known each other?
Approximately two and half long cycles.
I ever lie to you? Hmm? Hmm?
D'Argo looked totally different.
Look at myself in the mirror?
I... ah...
And why does he not look that way now?
Metabolism?
Look, man, let me... can I please tell the story the way I wanna tell it?
Mitols is almost ready for the Nebari.
What should I do about the other one?
Wring curls... drain till failure.
She would only spoil the program.
I am your host.
But names are not important... only currency.
Well, son, I'm your buyer, and ah... money ain't important to me! Only quality.
Know what I mean?
You've come to the right auction then.
I recommend the Nebari.
- Finest I've ever tasted.
- Right.
Raxil...
...alive, still.
I thought you'd given the Freslin trade away...
... after your disaster on Elepuria.
Well, yeah, I did lemme tell ya, but uh, things change.
Enjoy, Bid high. Excuse me.
Do I know you?
Hi...
I, ah... I doubt it.
I've become a... a new man recently.
"I made him very attractive."
15,000 on my right.
Have I any further bids?
16,000, 16,000 on my left.
There, any further bids?
Going once, twice, three times, are you all done?
16,000, sold for 16,000 brandars.
You traded Freslin.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, years ago, never killed anybody, none of it.
- None of it, my ass!
- No, no, no.
My point is, you must calm down.
Increased oxygenation hastens the metabolism of the Freslin!
It's gonna wear off?
Not for a while, not if he stays calm!
Calm. Anger; bad.
D'Argo... be cool, man.
We buy the girls, Raxil's mate, if we can.
No guns, no killing...
...and we're outta here.
I'll watch you from up here.
Distinguished friends... we now come to the sale you've been waiting for.
I present... the olfactory genius...
Heska Fe'Tor!
Does this guy just scream Vegas, or what?
Heska Fe'Tor!
Friends... welcome.
Thank you for coming on such short notice.
What a fine auction this will be!
May I present to you... Chiana!
Metabolism, Luxan.
Bidding starts at 25,000.
What a wonderful bid, Heska Tinako.
Are there any others?
No?
If you don't mind, I'd like to take a closer look at the carcass...
Be my guest.
Hey, Pip. Can you hear me?
Go away.
What took you so long?
Do you mind cuttin' this heifer down, so I can take a closer look.
Where's Jool?
Milking room.
Wait, wait, wait, is she yours?
Used to be.
Look, you've got Freslin boiling in your brain.
Everything you feel's way out of whack.
What's going on down there, that's an act!
He's just pretending to be a buyer!
One quarter million brandars!
"Circuit breakers... to the entire subterranean level."
I can double that bid if you give me some more time.
No more time.
Currency... on hand.
Top the bid now, or step aside.
Sold! To Heska Tinaka for 250,000 brandars!
Did you have to caress her whole body!
- Oh for cryin' out loud!
- It's just the Freslin, it makes him, you know...
- Shut up!
- Shut up!
Listen up... Mister Horney Toad!
Jool's still in the milking room.
I'm gonna hit the lights, and get Chiana.
Good,good, good, good.
Ah... well get Jool, and her mate...
...and then we'll wait.
And remember, ten steps down the hall.
Eight steps, human.
Don't do anything till I hit the lights.
No, no.
Yeah, the lights.
Good.
This is all your fault!
If you hadn't bribed those women in the bar... none...
Easy, Luxan! Easy!
It's the Luxan!
Security, move!
Frell.
Raise you fity-dollahs.
Chiana!
- No, no, that's not right.
- It's eight.
- No, no. He said ten.
- Shut up I know what I'm talking about, it's eight. You're making me lose my place!
Eight, eight! Shut up!
You're wrong!
Okay. Ten.
Drop your weapons.
Jool, are you okay?
Who's that?
That's my mate. He's dead.
D'Argo, save me!
- Crichton.
- D'Argo!
Where's Raxil?
In there...
The mate is dead.
Right, meet you in the Pod.
Raxil!
This... is my honey!
The brains of the machine.
My design!
He stole it, sold it.
Fe'Tor didn't even know it was mine!
Worth and fortune and all!
How's your neck?
It's... fine.
I don't mind stickin' it out for you.
You don't want these broken.
You okay?
- Yeah.
- Good.
Weird.
You ruined everything.
You smell... exotic!
Smell this.
- Neck still okay?
- Yeah.
I knew it.
Sad thing is... he's gonna die happy.
...and that is what it was all about.
Raxil... she was gettin' her chip back, and she used us.
She used us, man.
So it is not our fault.
I don't... believe you.
Why not?
Too many... inconsistencies.
Too much... obfuscation.
Obfuscation? How the hell does that translate?
Fine, you know, look, you don't wanna believe me?
Go ask the girls!
Chiana and Jool are still sleeping off whatever it was they did, and I'm not inclined to wake them.
Pilot, I don't think you've understood me.
Lemme just start again...
Crichton!
No! have located another planet nearby
Industrial.
Comms traffic indicates they have... accomodations for visitors.
You and D'Argo are to be... visitors.
Pack what you need, we shall return for you in eight solar days.
Pilot...
- it was real.
- Perhaps... John.
However, Moya and I desire time away from your constant bickering.
And this adventure, however embellished, does not alleviate that need.
Get out of here.
Okay.
You know, you really should get out more... these things do happen.
- What, he didn't believe you?
- No.
- Well, what was that thing about a "slim duck"?
- Slam dunk.
Whatever. It doesn't matter,
- He's throwing us off Moya!
- Yeah, well, you want to give it a go?
No.
- See. I did my best.
- Your best was to blow it!
- I did my best!
- Well, you blew it!
D'Argo he's kicking us off
Moya 'cause we argue.
He's kicking us off Moya because you argue!
- No, we argue.
- You argue!
- We! You...
- You argue.
We argue... you would argue with a lampost!
- I do not... open the door.
- You open it.
You open the door!
What, you're a girl, I'm gonna open the door for you? Open the door!
I- I'm older than you, show some respect! You open the door.
- You can open it... I'm not openin' the door.
- I'm not openin' no door... you open it.
SUBTITLES By
Slay and Pcosmos
I still have dreams...
*** ok 69 loved ***
...and certain things come back.
I don't know what age I am, but life is quite normal.
Whatever we're doing is an everyday happening.
And this is when I wake up.
And as old as I am, I'm still sobbing.
In 1933, few of the Jewish families...
...who lived in Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia foresaw how much...
...their lives were about to change.
None of their children realized...
...how soon their childhood was about to end.
I was a very happy little girl growing up.
My father absolutely adored me.
There was never anything that I could have possibly done wrong.
My father used to go out with me shopping.
And I always used to admire this one suit which was for ladies.
I was only a kid, you know.
And I always said,
"Daddy, I would love to wear that suit."
So, one day, he said,
"Shall we go in there?"
And I said, "That's for big ladies, I can't....
"Let's go in there." And he went in there and they took my measurements...
...and that suit was made for me.
And I came home, and my mother was devastated.
"What are you buying this little girl all this stuff for?
"She doesn't need that."
And my father said,
"She is my pride and joy...
"...and she needs everything
I can get for her."
My parents were sort of middle-class people.
My father was a middle-level bank manager.
My mother was a lady of leisure.
And I was a very-much-desired first child.
They were both around 30 or so.
We had one of these very nice apartments in Vienna, with a high ceiling...
...lots of light, as I remember it, and big windows...
...and I guess I was spoiled.
In addition to them, there was the inevitable maid...
...nursemaid in the house in those days.
My grandmother looked in often and lived nearby.
It was, in many ways, a rather idyllic life.
And I was indeed the center of the universe.
There was my mother, father and my sister, who was four years younger than me.
We had a very happy, carefree childhood.
My father was always busy during the week...
...but when he was home, he often took me for walks.
By the river mostly.
And we talked about everything.
That brought us probably closer.
I always felt that my father and I were protecting my mother and sister.
I don't know what we were protecting them from.
I was about 8 years old...
...when Hitler came to power.
I had got some school friends...
...and my mother tried to make a birthday party for us.
The table was set.
I was very excited.
Nobody came.
Not a single child came to this birthday party.
That was the first terrible blow to me.
I know it sounds trivial...
...but it was the first sort of comprehension for a child...
...to understand that you're ostracized.
That there's something different about you.
For Jewish children...
...life under Hitler became increasingly isolated and threatening.
While the Nazis stripped their parents of their jobs and citizenship...
...the children were gradually barred from schools...
...parks, theaters, and swimming pools.
I was overprotected because of...
...the Hitler dangers outside the home.
But very much loved in the home.
My mother sitting on my father for a cuddle...
...was an everyday occurrence.
I had to join in, or else I would have been jealous.
He had to have both of us on his lap.
My father used to say:
Although he spoke perfect English...
...he felt he was just not young enough to start in a new country.
And the other sentence, which was because...
...his father and grandfather, and so on...
...were born in Germany was:
"This has got to change.
"This madman, Hitler, can't possibly last."
I feared every day.
I was most unhappy going to school.
I was walking down the street...
...six or seven boys came, called me "Jew bastard"...
...and then attacked me and threw me through a plate-glass window.
I was cut severely...
...and I had to go to the hospital for stitches.
I didn't want to go to the school there anymore.
I just felt that I was threatened constantly.
As Hitler strengthened his control...
...he began looking for opportunities to extend Germany's power...
...beyond its borders.
In March, 1938...
...German troops entered Austria...
...and without firing a single shot...
...annexed the country to the Reich.
The first thing that happens when a disaster strikes...
...is that nothing changes.
You think there's going to be some great drama...
...and you go to put your nightgown on...
...and you say the Shema to your mother and then you go to bed.
And you think, "Oh, this isn't so terrible."
But the next morning, my parents took me downstairs into the street.
The streets were full of new uniforms
I'd never seen.
And the young people wore the red bands around their arms with the swastika.
I didn't know what that meant.
And they were stretching out their arms in the Hitler salute.
And there were flags everywhere, these new red flags...
...with the white circle and the black swastika.
My main sense of something being wrong...
...was the haste with which my parents got me back into the house.
Suddenly I couldn't go to my normal school anymore.
I was sent off to a makeshift school...
...at the end of the tramline.
And I did it alone, even at age 7.
I went to the end of the line, and I would just walk on until I came to this house.
Word got back to my parents that while on the tram, I was a very talkative boy.
I told them all the bad things that Herr Hitler was doing.
I thought that "Herr" was his first name, of course.
And word got back to my parents that maybe...
...I shouldn't be traveling alone.
And my father then came with me.
He didn't say much, he hardly ever did...
...but he let it be known...
...that it wasn't wise to go around saying bad things about Hitler.
In the weeks following the annexation of Austria...
...Nazi authorities had enacted all the anti-Jewish laws...
...it had taken Hitler five years to put into place in Germany.
For anyone coming from Vienna, it was very dramatic.
The reality of it struck me when my parents talked about...
...giving up the apartment, that we had to leave.
That was something, you know, the bottom falls out.
Everything falls out of you.
This is all I knew...
...and we had to give it up, we had to leave.
That was probably the biggest blow I had.
Just the idea...
...it'll all end the way it is.
My mother was an activist.
She knew something had to be done.
The decision was to go...
...to England to be hired...
...as a domestic, because the English would take young women...
...who would not interfere with the labor market.
The plan was:
She would go ahead. She'd try...
...to get me and my father out.
This is the time when I remember...
...there was no conversation among the grown-ups...
...except how to get out of Vienna.
It's interesting because we're now asked,
"How come you didn't leave?"
And when I think of what it meant to leave...
...how impossible it was to leave.
First of all, you had to have a sponsor...
...in the country you were going to.
Someone who would promise you would not become a burden on the government.
You would have to get a visa from the state department...
...or the government to be allowed in.
Then you had to get an exit permit from the Nazis.
All these things had to come together.
And they had a time span in which they would expire.
You had to collect all these things together so that they would be ready.
And it usually didn't happen.
The hardest thing was to find a country to go to.
The countries under discussion were:
Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Venezuela...
...Shanghai, Cuba, the Dominican Republic.
I remember going with my father to the American consulate.
There was a queue around the block...
...up the stairs...
...and around the room.
We are now in the late summer of 1938.
I got to the United States on May 1, 1951.
It was a 13-year...
...quota for us.
German troops had barely entered Austria...
...when Hitler demanded the annexation of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia.
He insisted that the province...
...which was home to over three million ethnic Germans ...
...be allowed to secede and join the Reich.
On October 1, with international agreement...
...German troops marched into Sudetenland...
...adding one-fifth of Czechoslovakia to the Reich...
...and opening the way for further dismemberment of the country.
From then on, people were wondering...
...what would happen next.
Father was an optimist because...
...he did business with people in France who wrote and said:
"It's going to be bad, get out."
But for Father, no, things like that wouldn't happen.
He had a greater faith in mankind.
He used to say that he would rather trust people and be disappointed...
...than go through life not trusting anybody.
Less than half a year later...
...Hitler would destroy the Czech state.
But now, the Nazis continued their persecution of the Jews.
In November, they orchestrated a vicious pogrom...
...which they later called Kristallnacht:
"The Night of Broken Glass."
I had had a strange dream in the night...
...that my father was being arrested.
Our evening meal that evening...
...was the last meal
I ever remember having with my father.
I looked at him...
...and I thought, well, I hadn't really...
...seen his features properly.
You know how you look at somebody intensely?
And something told me...
...that I must imprint that image of him in my mind.
Before I went to bed...
...my father, in a rather stern voice, said to me:
"If you hear any strange noises during the night...
"...immediately get out of bed...
"...and go into that wardrobe in the hallway."
And I said, "I don't understand."
And quite differently than my father...
...would normally answer my questions, he said:
"Don't ask any questions, just do as you're told."
I was woken up at 2:00 a.m.
Terrible banging on the door.
There were two...
...Nazis at the door...
...shouting, "You're all under arrest!
Put some clothes on and come with us! "
I remember that it was a very cold...
...very dark night. We all went off...
...to an assembly point, which was like a big square.
And there were just...
...thousands of other Jews.
And I mean thousands.
And there were people I knew and people I didn't know.
And people getting beaten up.
And people crying.
I think everybody was petrified.
I also remember very vividly that they were beating up the rabbi.
And they had fetched the Torahs out of the synagogue.
And I think they were trampling on them.
I took my bicycle and went to school as always.
There was no Jewish business that I passed...
...that wasn't broken into.
The merchandise was either on the street...
...or looted completely.
As I got closer to school...
...I saw huge pillars of smoke...
...coming from the sections...
...where the two big synagogues in Frankfurt were.
And I saw that they were on fire.
Our school happened to be just opposite on the street where the synagogue was.
I was dragged out with the stream of children.
Everybody went to the playground...
...to watch these flames.
And suddenly somebody said:
"There's a Jew!
Let's throw her on the fire as well! "
I don't know how I got home.
I still don't know today how I got home.
And when I got home my mother was absolutely shocked.
My father had been arrested.
My father was quite an outspoken person.
When they came to Buchenwald...
...and they took away all the men's braces and shoelaces...
...he protested and said,
"You can't treat these old people like this."
So they made an example of him.
They beat him to death...
...in front of everybody...
...in order to instill terror and obedience.
They offered us my father's ashes in return for money...
...and eventually the urn came.
And we buried it in the Jewish cemetery.
Of course, whether it was his ashes, one never knows.
We heard loud banging on the door downstairs...
...and so my aunt, my mother and I...
...ran up into the attic.
We were hiding in an old wardrobe up there.
And I do remember feeling as though I had spent my entire life...
...in that wardrobe.
And I also remember whispering to my mother:
"I want to get out of here, and not just out of this wardrobe...
"...I want to get out of Germany."
World revulsion was swift.
Yet Britain was the only country willing to relax its immigration controls.
But only for children who would not threaten British jobs or public funds.
Days after the Nazi pogrom...
...Anglo-Jewish leaders met with Prime Minister Chamberlain ...
...and urged him to let into the country unaccompanied children...
...Christian as well as Jewish...
...up to the age of 17.
Six days later,
Quakers joined Jewish leaders...
...to present the government a concrete rescue plan...
...to be funded by refugee and religious organizations.
That night, the House of Commons debated the issue...
...and approved the plan.
My youth leader said:
"Call Otto Hirsch.
"There is a job for you to be done."
So I went and saw him, and he said:
"I have a request.
"We have been informed...
"...that the British government, the House of Commons...
"...had discussed the destiny of Jews in Germany after...
"...all this publicity...
"...and they are disgusted."
"They came to the conclusion...
"...to accept children for a certain time.
"We have an office for the operations.
"See what you can do."
As the transports got underway in Germany and Austria...
...thousands of Sudetenland refugees continued to flee to Prague.
English stockbroker Nicholas Winton...
...was summoned by a friend to view the situation for himself.
He toured refugee camps with Doreen Warriner...
...a representative of the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia.
We did have the feeling that the position was much more urgent...
...than anybody in London thought.
Doreen Warriner said, "I don't know what we will do about the children."
Almost spontaneously I said,
"Well, when I get back to England...
"...I find that the Home Office will allow them in...
"...we'll try and get some of them into England."
And when I went to the Home Office, they said:
"Under certain conditions, you can bring in as many children as you like."
We had to produce...
...somebody who'd guarantee 50 pounds against their re-immigration...
...which is about 1,000 pounds today.
It was quite a lot of money.
And then I had to find a family who'd take each individual child.
It certainly wasn't easy, but it wasn't that difficult.
It's easier to get somebody to take a child than to take a grown-up.
I tried to get America involved...
...and wrote to a lot of the senators...
...and got a lot of answers saying how concerned they were...
...and all the reasons why they couldn't do anything.
In the United States...
...a congressional bill to admit 20,000 child refugees...
...died in committee.
One of the arguments against the bill...
...was that accepting children without their parents...
...was contrary to the laws of God.
My father said:
"Mommy and I cannot leave, but you're going to leave."
I said, "What do you mean,
I'm going to leave?"
"You're going to England," he said.
"When?"
"Thursday," he said.
I knew...
...that she ought to go...
...that I ought to send her away...
...but I couldn't imagine giving permission for her to go.
My husband said, "She must go."
He didn't listen to me.
He just arranged everything for her.
And I had to give in, and I saw in the end...
...that he was right.
But the hurt is unbelievable.
That cannot be described.
My father died when I was 3 years old.
My mother had to go out to work...
...so I wound up in the orphanage.
When Polish Jews were arrested all over Germany...
...I'd found out that my mother was deported.
I was on my own.
I had nobody, no one, nothing.
I went to the Gemeinde.
There was this wonderful woman who knew me there.
She said,
"Pascha, what are you doing here?
"Where's your mother?"
I said, "My mother's been deported."
And she said to me,
"There's something happening now.
"I think you should get onto it."
It was the Kindertransport.
She said, "You'd better register immediately because you're by yourself.
"What will you do?"
So I said, "Okay. I'll go to England."
Just like matter of fact, as if it was nothing.
In hindsight...
...I think my sister and I...
...we owe it to my father's death...
...that we have survived...
...because they selected...
...children...
...who had problems...
...who'd lost parents...
...or whose parents could no longer look after them...
...to go on the Kindertransport.
Mother came home and said that she'd enrolled us.
About a fortnight later...
...my parents were told that I could go.
A week or two after that...
...my parents decided my sister could go.
Now both of us would go.
That must have been very hard.
That would have been hard to decide that we would both go.
We had about a fortnight before we left.
Into that fortnight, both Mother and Father...
...were trying to give their instructions and guidance...
...that they hoped to have their whole lives to give.
My bar mitzvah was a month after "Crystal Night."
It was held in an attic.
My father was not there, he was still in a concentration camp.
It was just my mother.
I felt terrible.
There was no celebration afterwards.
There was nothing.
You read your part from the Torah, and...
...you did your haftorah and you were finished.
And we were lucky that a minyan...
...showed up altogether.
I certainly felt...
...that the sooner we left Germany...
...the better off we would be.
My housemother wrote...
...to Baron James de Rothschild...
...asking if he would take...
...24 of her boys...
...her husband, herself...
...and her two daughters.
And he wrote back in January that...
...he would.
We thought of England...
...as a land of lords and ladies because...
...of the King and Queen, and the two little princesses...
...appealed to us very much.
We saw their pictures in the newspapers.
The coronation with their ermine clothes and crowns on their heads.
And we really thought that in England that's how people dressed.
Perhaps not every day, but sometimes on Sundays.
So that was our expectation of England.
I was told this was the best thing that could happen, and I was so lucky...
...because everybody around me was trying to find places...
...for their children.
And, suddenly, out of the blue...
...I had a chance to come to England.
How lucky can I be?
My parents said
I'd be able to go back to school...
...I will learn another language...
...I will live in London,
I will be able to travel on the subway....
And painted a beautiful picture.
And added, again and again:
"And we'll follow soon."
However, a few days or so...
...before I was to leave...
...I accused my parents of trying to get rid of me.
I said to my parents,
"I'm really a gypsy child...
"...and now you're trying to get rid of me.
You adopted me...
"...and now you no longer want me."
I must have really, deeply, deeply hurt my parents.
Since German policy in 1938 was to force Jewish emigration...
...the Nazis willingly let the children leave...
...as long as they did not take any valuables with them.
Each child was allowed one suitcase...
...one piece of hand luggage...
...and ten reichsmark.
We had four days...
...to pack and go.
My parents were so busy getting ready the things I was going to take...
...that I don't think they nor I had time...
...to think about what was happening.
My mother prepared all our clothes.
She lovingly embroidered our names...
...on every piece of clothing, even every handkerchief...
...every sock...
...everything.
I think I took my teddy bear.
My mother...
...always slept on a little pillow on top of her big pillow...
...and I asked her if I could take that with me.
She said, "Sure."
Mother had new clothes made for both of us.
We had a dressmaker at home who did all the sewing.
And some clothes she bought.
Otherwise, around my neck...
...because we were baptized, hoping that would be...
...of some help...
...I had a little cross...
...and I had a little elephant...
...and I had a sort of....
It wasn't a Jewish star, but it was a little angel.
I put them all together because I thought the Almighty could choose...
...which religion he would like me to belong to.
So sad the things I remember.
I remember that last evening, when all the cousins and all the aunts...
...came to say good-bye.
There was one aunt who had twins.
She was extremely angry with my parents...
...for getting me onto this transport, and for not having managed to get...
...her twins onto the transport.
There was grief and panic and fury in that room.
There was a moment...
...that my father took me between his knees...
...and he said:
"Now, when you get to England...
"...you must talk to all the English people you meet and you have to ask them...
"...to get your mother and me out, and your grandparents out."
And because this aunt was there and had been so unhappy...
...and so angry, he said,
"And Aunt so-and-so's twins."
Before long, I had a list...
...of people whom I, at 10 years old, had promised to save from Hitler.
The transports began in December...
...barely three weeks after the Nazi pogrom.
Although a few children traveled by plane...
...the majority departed by train.
Some trains left during the day...
...many others in the dead of night.
Each child was given a number.
My number...
...and I still have it, was 152.
This was a number that every child...
...put around its neck...
...and a similar number was attached to our suitcases.
There we stood, in our groups of fifty,
I think it was...
...and there was my mother and my father.
My mother kept up...
...a conversation with me as if this was an ordinary and interesting...
...thing that was happening.
But I remember that she wore...
...a pony fur with a fox collar...
...and her face was inside the fox collar.
I remember that although...
...her speech was as if everything was ordinary...
...her face, I remember, was hot.
It was red and hot.
Every parent promised their child:
"We will soon come and follow."
How otherwise did the parents...
...get the little children onto the trains.
"Give us a few weeks, when things...
"...will either blow over and you'll come back again...
"...or we'll come join you."
That was a promise every parent made to their child.
There came the time to say to the parents:
"You cannot go to the platform.
"The police will not allow it.
"You have to say good-bye here."
So I ascended a chair there...
...and addressed the people.
Where I got the courage to do that,
I don't know.
But I told the parents:
"This is your last good-bye."
They didn't want the German public to know what was going on...
...because they had experiences...
...of parents weeping and...
...fainting at the platform.
So we had to say good-bye...
...groups had to say good-bye, in an anteroom.
The scenes were pretty horrendous.
When my sister and brother left...
...all the other parents were crying bitterly.
I was so afraid.
I didn't want my mother to cry...
...because she was a very strong person.
I thought, "If she cries...
"...terrible things will happen."
I kept on looking at her, and I said,
"Don't cry. You won't cry." And she didn't.
I got to the station, which was crowded with people.
All the children had parents with them...
...and I was sitting there all by myself.
I had no parents. Nobody.
I was just there with a suitcase.
There was nobody's shoulder
I could cry on.
All I knew was I was going away.
I was going to England.
Whatever would happen would happen.
Every day my father said:
"Pupela, I don't want you to go.
"But I want you to go because it'll be good for you."
The day came and we went.
My mother and dad went with me inside the train...
...and put my suitcase up.
My seat was right at the window.
The German trains had great big windows...
...and my father pulled that all the way down...
...so I could be leaning out of the window.
He hugged and kissed me.
I could see my father's face getting...
...whiter and whiter.
I thought, "I only hope nothing is going to happen to him."
He looked so terribly, terribly pale.
My poor mother was getting worse and worse.
I couldn't wait for the train to go because...
...I didn't want to remember that.
The guy came...
...and he waved the signal.
When the train started to go...
...my father says, "Pupela!
Let me hold your hands! "
And I held my hands and said,
"I have to let go! I have to let go! "
"No! I don't want you to go!
I don't want you to go! "
And we were already....
My father couldn't walk very fast...
...because he walked with a cane.
We went a little bit more...
...and he took me by my hands...
...and he pulled me out of the window.
And I fell.
I could have fallen in-between...
...the platform and the train.
There was only a small amount of space.
I didn't, but I got hurt and I was bleeding...
...and I was devastated.
Absolutely devastated.
And my father was in seventh heaven...
...that he had his little Pupela, his little girl, back.
The parting was terrible.
That's the one thing I have never...
...forgotten in all my life.
And she had been so controlled.
She'd always been...
...a sort of solid...
...support to us.
And suddenly she showed her feelings...
...and it was terrifying, really terrifying.
We saw this face...
...which showed all the hurt...
...and agony she'd been through.
And I can still see my father that mealtime.
But I would have liked to have had a happier image of my mother.
That's the only image...
...of this contorted...
...face...
...full of agony.
It was very sad.
I remember standing by the window and waving good-bye...
...and just trying hard to believe...
...that we really would come back.
That it won't be for very long.
But when the train moved and they disappeared from sight...
...both Vera and I cried in each other's arms.
My parents ran along the train...
...on the platform.
And I still remember, sort of in my head...
...I heard that refrain,
"You're leaving! You're leaving! "
I watched their faces.
Tears were streaming down their faces...
...down their cheeks.
And I knew then...
...these people really love me.
This is why they're sending me away.
I immediately started to write to my parents.
And I apologized for what I had said to them...
...that they were trying to get rid of me.
In no time...
...the suitcase was gone.
The child was gone.
The other children were gone.
Just emptiness.
Then we turned around and went home.
I did not talk.
It was awful.
The children went with the hope that the parents would follow, or that...
...one day they could come back and see them again.
I did not realize...
...and I could never have realized...
...that only a year and a half later...
...from the same railway station...
...trains would go in the other direction...
...to Hitler's slaughterhouses.
I remember all that day we sang songs.
We ate the things that our mothers had given us.
When we got to the border...
...it got very frightening because...
...the train stopped at the last station...
...before Holland.
The big girls were very frightened and they scared us.
They said, "Don't move."
You know what happens when you sit and don't move? You begin to tremble...
...if you tense yourself enough.
I remember that...
...I was sitting there so tense that I was vibrating.
The Nazi border guard...
...very officiously came around...
...and made some of the children open their suitcases.
They shouted at us...
...and threw their weight about.
They were looking for new things people had.
Children had new clothes and things.
They didn't like that.
They gave the children a tough time.
Children kept crying and crying.
We were there quite a while.
They took their time and enjoyed doing what they did to us.
Then suddenly we were in Holland.
Everyone was cheering:
"Those damn Nazis!
They should drop dead! Now we are free! "
There was howling, yelling, shouting, and singing.
It was the best party I've ever been at...
...although I didn't really understand what was happening.
I was holding a big girl around the waist, and she was holding me.
They knew the songs they were singing.
They were probably Zionist songs...
...but I sang along because it was so much fun...
...to be part of this party.
Not only were the frontier guards on the Dutch side very nice...
...they had a contingent...
...of ladies who brought us cocoa...
...and Dutch zwieback.
It was like manna from heaven.
It was wonderful.
You suddenly felt as though you'd been clad...
...in a cloak of lead or iron...
...and it had been taken from you.
It was a wonderful feeling of freedom.
We started to smile.
I don't think any of them had smiled for a long time.
It was wonderful.
Then the train went on to Hoek van Holland.
We got onto the boat...
...which took us to Harwich.
It was an unpleasant trip because...
...the English Channel...
...is one of the worst places in wintertime to cross.
We had small children and people got seasick.
It was some how-do-you-do.
I have a very vivid memory of waking up...
...and seeing the sea for the first time, with the sunrise on it...
...and thinking how beautiful it was.
It was only the British Channel...
...but it seemed a long way from home in 1939.
And so, it was a mixture...
...of elation because we saw something so beautiful, and saw the sea, while this...
...fear within me, which never left me for those six years, of:
"What's going to happen...
"...at home?"
Refugees from terror.
The first boatload from Nazi Germany.
Vanguard of an army of helpless children.
Uprooted from their homeland in a modern exodus.
Each Kindertransport was lead by adult escorts...
...on the condition that after delivering the children...
...all escorts would return home...
...or else the transports would be ended.
A couple of times I traveled with them.
At one transport the customs official...
...checked and said, "We have a problem."
He said, "This young man here brought a violin...
"...which is very, very expensive.
"This is not an ordinary violin."
I said, "Well, don't forget...
"...these young people take music lessons...
"...and obviously he liked music very much...
"...so he took his violin along."
This didn't sit well...
...so I gambled.
I said to that boy:
"Can you play something?"
And he said, "Sure."
And he was playing God Save the King.
And that boy couldn't be stopped.
He played all three stanzas.
When he was finished...
...the guard looked very happy.
I asked the fellow, "Are you now convinced, sir, that he likes music?"
And he said, "Yes! "
So, the boy got his violin into England.
Then came the arrival...
...at Liverpool Street Station.
Everyone was being picked up...
...and I wasn't.
I remember sitting in an enormous arrival hall.
And I just sat.
Nobody came to me, nobody talked to me.
I think I must have sat for an hour.
Maybe longer, I don't know.
Then came two people...
...who were my guardians...
...and they introduced themselves.
They explained that they lived in Lincoln.
They didn't speak one word of German...
...and I didn't speak one word of English.
If they said, "Lincoln," that could have been...
...anywhere.
Never heard of the place.
My mother sent me off saying:
"Whoever is going to be good enough to take you in...
"...and give you a home...
"...you must treat as a temporary mother."
When we arrived back from Liverpool Street...
...and we all went to bed...
...in the evening...
...I went up to her, put my arms around her...
...and she pushed me away.
And her words were, "That's sissy."
She may have said something else like,
"We don't do this, that's sissy."
But the words "That's sissy" have never left me.
The children arrived in England at the rate of about 300 a week.
Those who were not already placed in foster homes...
...were taken to temporary centers...
...hastily set up in summer holiday camps...
...like Dovercourt.
They did try and keep us busy.
The memorable part of this camp experience was...
...that it was one of the coldest winters in history.
We all went for breakfast to this big hall.
The snow came in through the cracks.
We had this curious food. We had kippers.
What little Austrian-Jewish child has ever heard of kippers?
Here was this salty, shoe leather on our plates...
...and it had snow on it. It was interesting.
While we were sitting...
...around the stove, always with our coats on...
...and with our little gloves on...
...groups of people would come...
...to choose children to take away with them.
We called it the "Cattle Market"...
...because every Saturday and Sunday...
...we were told to put on our best clothes...
...and visitors used to come.
We felt a bit like...
...the monkeys in the zoo.
We were being stared at and evaluated.
People were chosen, taken away from the tables, and interviewed...
...if you were suitable to be taken to their families.
Most families...
...wanted little blue-eyed and blonde girls...
...of about three to seven.
Little boys were accepted as well.
And the older children found it a bit more difficult...
...to find foster parents.
Of course, by that time, they hastily established hostels...
...to take a big influx of the children...
...who weren't chosen quickly, because we had to be chosen fast.
In and out, the camp was filled.
Every week, another transport would arrive.
I was writing a letter to my parents...
...and one of these ladies in a fur coat...
...bent down to me and asked me...
...if I would like to come to Liverpool.
I said, "Yes, I would like to come to Liverpool."
She said to the other woman,
"Oh, she speaks English."
By speaking English, I mean,
I could understand:
"Would you like to come to Liverpool?"
And I could say "Yes."
Then they said to me, "Are you Orthodox?"
I said, "Yes."
They wrote that down.
It was understood that I was going to go to Liverpool the next day...
...and when the ladies had gone...
...I wrote in my letter to my parents,
"By the way, what is Orthodox?"
My brother had been chosen first...
...to be the playmate of a little boy in Coventry.
Then they asked me if I'd like to go to a family there.
Of course, I jumped at the chance.
I wanted to be near my little brother.
They chose me as a maid, but I didn't know
I was supposed to be a maid.
I hadn't ever thought of becoming a servant.
But I drew the line.
I point blank refused to wear a uniform.
I think they took me to show off in front of the neighbors...
...because they were working-class people.
The culture shock was very great...
...and also the fact that my clothes were better than hers.
She took great exception to that...
...and she took the clothes and all.
The children whom we brought over and placed...
...I think, in the main, were satisfactory.
One can never claim 100 percent.
There were certainly some who weren't.
There were certainly some who were misused...
...and used as servants if they were of the right age.
I wouldn't claim that it was a 100-percent success, but...
...I would claim that everybody who came was alive at the end of the war.
You felt you wanted to do something.
There was a meeting in Norwich...
...of a few Jewish congregates, and non-Jewish.
They said, "Any offers to take children?"
My husband and I said yes.
Then some photographs were handed around.
I remember there were some boy twins.
My heart ached, but we couldn't afford it in those days.
We didn't know what was going to happen.
So that's when...
...we took Kurt.
Percy and Mariam...
...picked me up at the boat...
...and took me back home.
At the entrance stood...
...the maid who, I would learn later, actually ran the household...
...and halfway up the stairs sat a little boy of five...
...looking at his "new" brother.
When we got home, my maid, Selena, was there...
...and she said to me,
"Can't we change it?"
He was filthy, you know, and smelt...
...of sick and everything.
Anyhow, we gave him a bath.
My grubby clothes, after three days of travel, were torn off me.
Burned, I learnt later.
I was scrubbed from head to toe...
...and then dressed in English clothes.
Then the family got together for a chicken dinner.
That I remember.
That's a language I could understand.
And I started to feel more at ease.
I learned English...
...by being sent to a German man, rather old...
...who lived a few houses down the same street.
Maybe I thought he was a Nazi...
...but I was terrified of him.
In fact, I was so terrified that I learned...
...English so quick so I wouldn't have to see him again.
Then six weeks later...
...I wrote to my parents in English:
"I no longer speak German."
I never have, and I've never been able to re-learn it.
He was very, very good.
He liked the sweet things and John liked the savory, but...
...they got on very well together.
But I noticed, well, we knew every night...
...when it was dark, he'd come down the stairs...
...and he'd see that the door was locked.
That was one thing I remember.
My mother was in London, so for me the separation...
...was not as traumatic because I was going to something.
I came to the London station...
...and she picked me up and took me where she was working.
Then I stayed in this very cold...
...fancy house in England...
...where they were exploiting the European maids.
And, of course, if you've ever been the child of a maid...
...you know maids aren't supposed to have children.
They're not welcome. You can't stay there.
I don't know how the decision was made, but I was to be sent to Belfast...
...to the Jewish refugee hostel in Belfast.
When you see your life has been saved and you're brought into a hostel...
...which is clean...
...and there is food there...
...and other children there, how could you not be happy in that place?
But, to me it smelled of orphanage, which, in due course, it became.
And orphanages...
...those things frighten every child out of its wits.
I mean, Charles Dickens...
...to be in a workhouse, to be an orphan.
My first impression of Waddesdon Manor was like a dream...
...like a castle I've seen in pictures...
...but never in person.
The Cedars was a servants' house.
Twenty-six of us lived in The Cedars.
The first thing we did was throw a soccer ball on the lawn...
...and kicked it around.
The local boys wanted to see what was, all of a sudden...
...being brought into their little village.
When it was time for dinner...
...they said:
"We'll see you tomorrow."
I was so excited.
I was absolutely so exuberant.
I ran to my housemother...
...and told her:
"Somebody who's not Jewish wants to see me tomorrow."
We did start going to school there.
It was marvelous.
I never realized what school was really like.
That you could participate.
And I did enjoy going to school.
And the wonderful part about it was that it had a library.
I waded through that library...
...and that's how I learned to speak English.
Through that
I got a love of English literature.
But altogether...
...it was a wonderful experience, and the children were so friendly to us.
I knew that I was going...
...to a school near Bournemouth in Dorset.
It was the headmistress of the school who guaranteed...
...to look after me.
When I arrived at the school, it was all these girls...
...who were very polite...
...and very nice, very kind.
I couldn't understand a word they said.
I was given my bed.
The curtains could be drawn, to give me some privacy.
The first thing I did was...
...put a picture of my parents on the bedside table...
...so I could say goodnight to them.
The first three months before war broke out...
...we could still write home.
So I could share my experiences with my parents...
...and I had letters very frequently.
So I didn't feel quite so isolated.
"As you can well imagine...
"...you have been constantly in our thoughts.
"We still see your face before us in that window...
"...of the railway carriage."
"My dearest little mouse:
"Hopefully this letter will reach you...
"...already in your new home, where you surely will enjoy your stay.
"Be a very good little girl.
"Be obedient."
"Dear Parents:
"How are you both?
"Today I had my first English lesson.
"Greetings and kisses."
"I was very happy with your dear little letter...
"...only there shouldn't be so many spelling errors! "
"If only I could see you just for a tiny moment...
"...but, as it is,
I can only write letters full of longing."
"Dear Daddy: Thank you very much...
"...for the game of cards...
"...and the brooches...
"...and the bracelet.
"I had a game with them."
"I keep running to the mailbox.
"Every line from you overwhelms me.
"Every day I thank God that you are in such good hands...
"...but please show your gratefulness."
"My dear, good, darling parents:
"I feel very safe here.
"If only I was not so very scared...
"...about your safety."
"For my birthday, you wrote me...
"...that I'll always have to be brave...
"...because you can't be happy if I'm not.
"And I can assure you...
"...that I always grit my teeth and smile."
"Your letter of yesterday was again so sweet...
"...and written with so much love...
"...that tears came running down your Mommy's face.
"Your writing is so natural...
"...it makes me imagine that you're standing before me."
"Your letters come to us like sunshine.
"It's our future that gives us big worries.
"We yearn to get away from here.
"That's our fondest wish.
"It'll be a difficult task for you to bring us over there...
"...but I have the feeling you'll manage it in time."
When I arrived in England...
...I made it my priority...
...to try and find homes for people...
...because I felt people didn't know...
...how desperate it was in Germany.
My biggest problem was to try and get my parents out.
That was difficult, because it was either finding them a job...
...and bearing in mind my father's age...
...or getting this 100 pounds guarantee...
...which was just nowhere to be seen.
I proceeded...
...to find large houses...
...and knock at the door to find out...
...whether I could get them a job.
My mother as a cook or bottle washer.
My father as a gardener.
Anything just to get them out.
Sometimes I knocked at the door and I burst into tears.
Sometimes I knocked at the door, and with my very poor English...
...tried to explain what it was all about...
...who I was, what I wanted, what I needed: help.
I did find someone...
...and it was just...
...like an unbelievable dream come true.
My father had a first cousin...
...in London.
Every weekend I took the train into London...
...and bombarded him.
I said, "Uncle Paul...
"...you've got to get my parents out of Germany."
He said, "I can't do it."
After me being so...
...insistent he finally said:
"I'll give him an affidavit if he has a working permit."
I went back to the Rothschild estate...
...knocked on the door...
...and the butler, who was about 10-foot-6...
...came out ...
...and said to me:
"What do you want?"
I said,
"I want to speak to Baron Rothschild."
He said, "Wait here."
I waited.
A couple of minutes later he says:
"Follow me."
I said to him, "Baron Rothschild...
"...my father's cousin will give him...
"...and my mother a visa...
"...provided he has a working permit."
Without hesitation...
...he said to me,
"Would he work on a chicken farm?"
I said, "He'll do anything."
He went to a notary...
...and made out a working permit for my parents.
The family that chose me were the only people...
...I could rely on to give...
...a visa for my little sister.
She was a beautiful little girl.
They had no children.
I showed them the photograph of Inge...
...and they seemed to like her very much.
But I realized one thing:
Uncle Billy...
...hated red hair.
Uncle Billy...
...was paying maintenance for a red-haired child, not his...
...by his first wife.
Well, say no more.
Inge was a bright redhead.
The question of hair color never arose because I had brown hair.
One day he said to me quite idly:
"What color hair does your sister have?"
I said, "Oh, like mine."
No more was said.
And they gave permission for her...
...to come and they would take her in.
I went very happily to England.
It was an adventure, you know, to go abroad, to go on the train.
My sister wrote fantastic letters.
Everything was wonderful.
She was having a marvelous time.
So was my brother.
My brother said he had a dog.
When I got there actually there was a dog and a cat.
The dog bit me.
I didn't think much of that.
Inge arrived, her hair aflame...
...titian-red....
Uncle Billy was furious.
He turned around and he called me a so-and-so liar.
I said to him:
"Because Inge has red hair...
"...I leave her at home in Germany?
"Now you send her away. Don't mind.
"Thank you for asking her here."
He calmed down in the end and he did accept her into the house.
I think, I had a sense...
...while I was playing, while I was laughing...
...that was the moment when I could and should've been doing something about...
...this demand on me...
...that I should bring my parents out.
From Dovercourt camp
I wrote a couple of letters...
...to the Refugee Committee in London.
I think they must have been moved by a letter...
...from a child asking to get her parents out of Vienna.
They did get my parents a domestic service visa.
My parents appeared miraculously...
...in Liverpool on my 11th birthday.
I remember feeling...
...that some terrific...
...weight that I had been carrying...
...and hadn't known I had been carrying...
...was taken off my back.
Everything was being done to get the papers...
...for my parents to come out...
...and war started.
And that was the end of that.
I just felt the world had come to an end.
Shattering, if I think about it.
Everything was built...
...around this reunion...
...and my temporary stay in England.
The fateful hour of 11:00 has struck...
...and the state of war once more exists between Great Britain and Germany.
Only 25 minutes after war was declared came the first air-raid warning.
Everything...
...we'd ever talked about or written about...
...or thought about, had all collapsed.
Everything had collapsed.
I think I cried for...
...not weeks, not months, I cried for years.
War ended all Kindertransports and legal immigration...
...from Central Europe to England.
It also ended regular mail between the children and their parents.
The only way they could now communicate...
...was by 25-word postcards sent through the International Red Cross.
The isolation came when the letters ceased.
It was accepted that you didn't talk about...
...what hurt you.
I couldn't speak Czech with anybody.
I didn't want to tell my sister how unhappy I was...
...because I felt she was too young.
I wrote at that time in my diary:
"I never dreamt that one could be so lonely...
"...and go on living...
"...with this constant fear for our loved ones.
"The tears I shed at night do not ease my pain...
"...yet I was told that one feels better after a good cry.
"All I have is a swollen face...
"...and my heart is as heavy as it was before."
My pillow often was very wet in the morning.
There was a gardener...
...who didn't understand perhaps what I was going through.
But he always said to me,
"Don't worry, it won't last long."
And whether I believed him or not it was good to hear him say that.
And he always gave me a flower.
Within a few months of their arrival in England...
...many of the refugees, along with other English children...
...were forced to evacuate to new families in the country...
...to escape the expected bombing of the cities.
-You consented to take two children?
-Yes, I'll take in two children.
Two little girls.
They'll be happy with you, I'm sure.
-Thank you very much.
-Two nice little girls, aren't they?
None of the foster parents with whom I stayed...
...and there were five of them...
...none of them could stand me for very long.
All of them had the grace to take in a Jewish child.
They were not particularly warm.
They did not love me.
I did not love them.
Nevertheless, they did, as I say, what most of us don't do...
...which is to burden the household...
...the kitchens, the bedroom and the living room with this foreigner.
Mariam was somewhat aloof.
It was her manner. She was loving, but...
...she didn't hug and kiss me.
My mother was the exact opposite.
She used to not just kiss me once...
...she sort of kissed me like "rat-tat-tat," like a machine gun.
But Mariam was distant and nice...
...and I think that's what I needed...
...because I had trouble...
...really...
...feeling that I belonged there.
To have sort of pushed me into it would have been difficult.
He didn't cry, not at all.
I couldn't understand it.
This is London calling.
Just once...
...they used to like to listen to some programs on the wireless.
He used to come sit on my knee.
And there was something...
...in the news, I just heard him once go....
A little sob and that was all.
I tried really to please the Cohens because I loved them...
...and I felt very dependent.
One of my main worries was that I would be...
...sent away.
I know this happened to another boy, somewhat older...
...who was taken in by some friends of the Cohens.
He was arrogant and impossible...
...and eventually they simply had to send him to some other home.
I'd heard of other places where this had happened.
So I felt very much...
...on edge.
Word came that my mother was no longer in London.
She went back to Vienna...
...to get my father to move, who was impassive.
So I really did make up my mind that I would be as tough as nails.
Nothing would hurt me.
I would have no emotions.
And it carried me through for about six or seven years.
I got a scholarship to a grammar school.
People were saying to me, partly in jealousy:
"You know, they are snobs in these schools and they're anti-Semites.
"You gotta watch yourself.
They're gonna take it out on you."
And I went to school.
I had a school tie, I guess...
...or a blazer.
I was just entering a new world.
The sun was shining.
I went to school, and a fellow came up to me and said, "Who are you?"
And I just knocked him down.
There was no doubt a cost...
...trying to be good all the time and keeping my anger in.
Only once did it slip.
One day John and I were having breakfast...
...and there was some silly argument over who got the marmalade first.
And Kurt threw a knife.
That was the only time he was naughty.
John had a little wound here, which was near his eye. It wasn't nice.
Dr. Rose, who was our friend, and lived a few doors down...
...he came in and he was furious.
"You shouldn't have taken this child in."
It terrified the entire family and me, too.
Since then I've been somewhat afraid of my possibility of letting go to anger.
The other signs that I had a lot inside me was that...
...I always had some intestinal problems...
...until I went into the army, and then I had the most terrible food and felt fine.
I have an analogy for this:
When all of us have had the experience of finding...
...a bird with a broken wing...
...and you pick up this bird and you hold it in your hand...
...and you think it's going to sit there, quietly, sweetly...
...with its warm feathers, and be darling.
It's not. It immediately tries...
...to use its muscles and it's a very uncomfortable thing to hold in your hand...
...because there's this fluttering.
What he wants is to get away.
It may need you to hold it and nurse it...
...but what he wants is to get the heck out of there.
I think that's what we were like.
Certainly, that's what I was like.
I was not nice to have around.
I got a new job in London...
...and I was working there until June 28, 1940.
It was lunchtime and I was having a sandwich...
...when suddenly two guys appeared.
Two men.
"CID."
"What have I done?"
"Nothing. You are Abrascha Gorbulski?
"You are now under arrest."
"Under arrest?
"For what?"
"You are an enemy alien, please come with us."
After Germany invaded Western Europe...
...the British began rounding up all refugees from Germany and Austria...
...who were over the age of 16.
Although the vast majority were refugees from Nazi persecution...
...anyone with a foreign accent was viewed as a potential saboteur.
Within a few months...
...the government interned approximately
30,000 men and women.
Plans were made to deport as many as possible.
The good thing about life is you remember all the good things...
...that happened to you.
Bad things, you forget about them.
In fact, you have to make an effort to really remember them.
The day came when we had to go to the ship.
Soldiers were standing there with bayonets...
...mounted on their rifles.
And they pushed us along and said:
"Leave your luggage, you'll get it later on."
They pushed us along the deck.
Before long, we went down the stairs, then more stairs. I was on the third deck.
Over 2,500 prisoners...
...twice the capacity of the ship...
...were crammed onto the HMT Dunera...
...supposedly bound for Canada.
Two days out of Liverpool...
...the Dunera was spotted by a German U-boat.
Suddenly, something hits the ship.
The lights went out.
This is the end of it.
Everybody gravitated towards...
...the stairway, which led to the deck above.
After about two minutes...
...you couldn't get up there because there were many...
...people going up the stairs, we were just choking.
Suddenly, the lights went on again.
Everybody stopped in their...
...steps and went back down.
The torpedo didn't explode...
...but I was under the impression that the torpedo hit us sideways.
It just bounced off.
Our luck, because if it had hit us...
...all of us would have been finished.
We were traveling, going west for several days...
...but suddenly our outlook said:
"Something's happening and we are not going west. We're going south."
We had no idea where we were going, except it must have been Australia.
We were starving daily.
They were treating us like pigs.
Being hungry every day, people were lining up in the kitchen...
...to get an empty pot where the jam was, just to scrape it out.
And having one slice of bread.
The existence from one day to another was worse than the day before.
And we were on the ship for almost completely two months!
What happened on the Dunera?
Years later, I'm thinking:
"This didn't happen to me.
It must have been somebody else...
"...because it was too horrible to describe."
From an overseas liner in Sydney harbor...
...a strange contingent of new arrivals is transshipped aboard a ferry.
Enemy aliens who are being interned in Australia for the duration of the war.
Before we knew it, we were off the ship.
The first thing I remember is that each one of us...
...got a box...
...of food. That was the best meal
I ever had in my life.
After starving for two months...
...I opened up the box.
There were two cheese sandwiches...
...thick like this, and a banana...
...and an apple, and an orange...
...and they were giving second helpings.
It was unbelievable.
As the war progressed...
...reports of mass arrests and deportation of Central-European Jews...
...began to reach Britain.
In the spring of '43, the city of Berlin...
...was cleansed of the last Jews.
They came and took...
...my family and myself along.
We were taken to a collection point.
After a couple of days, we were deported...
...to Auschwitz, though we did not know...
...when we got to the train, which consisted...
...of cattle cars, where we were going.
We landed in Auschwitz and the moment we landed there...
...we were commanded to leave the trains...
...women with children to the left and men to the right.
That was the last time that I saw my wife, my then wife, and child.
Lory Cahn and her family were deported to Theresienstadt...
...the Czech ghetto the Nazis used to deceive the world...
...about how humanely they treated their prisoners.
In time...
...the population of Theresienstadt exceeded its capacity.
One day...
...they came into our barrack, and my name was called...
...to report to the railroad station.
I went to the railroad station.
As they called your name, you had to go and see this SS guy...
...and he crossed you off the list and then you went into the car.
I got there and I repeated my name.
He said, "You're not going."
I had no idea.
I didn't dare ask why or what...
...but that was the end of it and they sent me back.
And this went on for maybe two weeks.
I'd been at the railroad station,
I think, four times.
And I was a complete wreck.
To say good-bye to your parents...
...one time...
...a second time, a third time...
...and a fourth time...
...and once before, when I was in the Kindertransport...
...it was...
...just absolutely devastating.
Every time I said good-bye...
...I think I tore a little piece out of my mother...
...and out of my father, and also a big piece out of myself.
The last time it happened...
...I said to the guy:
"Would you terribly mind, but I want to go."
"Are you sure of that?" I said, "Yes."
He crossed my name off, and I went.
Little did I know that we were going to Auschwitz.
It was a long period where I did not hear anything from my parents.
I said, "Well, it's wartime...."
I found all kinds of reasons and excuses.
Then, finally,
I received a letter from my father...
...in which he said, "Tomorrow...
"...I'm going to be deported to an unknown destination.
"And it may be a very long time before you hear from me again."
Then I received a letter from my mother.
She said, "Tomorrow...
"...I'm going to be deported from here."
She encourages me to be good, and honest...
...and courageous, and to hold my head high...
...and to never give up hope.
And this at a time when I think she knew...
...what might be happening to her.
Then there was one more communication from her.
A postcard dated September 4, 1942.
It's written in real shaky handwriting.
She's saying that she's traveling...
...to the East, and is saying a very final good-bye to me.
But for many, many years...
...I would see the postcard in front of me...
...and I would see she's saying:
"Traveling to the East."
Yet I would understand that she's saying...
...she's traveling in an easterly direction.
Then I would say to myself:
"Maybe she's going back to Kippenheim.
"And maybe that's good."
And the final good-bye, I didn't understand.
I always felt I should be grateful...
...that we'd been saved, and that these people had taken us in...
...and that I should be happier there.
But facts are facts, and it wasn't a good place to be.
Uncle Billy...
...who was not a very courageous man...
...every night, he would...
...go into the country, and he took us with him.
We went to escape the bombs...
...until one day, the people where we were staying...
...we all slept in a room there in a cottage...
...and the people said they didn't want the German children.
So we didn't go to the country anymore.
One day the sirens sounded...
...and what was known as the "Coventry Blitz" started.
And when the bombs started to fall...
...we stayed at Auntie Vera's mother's...
...who had a boarding house.
All night long...
...the bombs rained down...
...and Coventry was a very hot place to be.
We were in one house and that was bombed.
There was a big fire upstairs and everybody rushed out.
In the morning...
...when Auntie Vera and Uncle Billy came back...
...and they saw one of the boarding houses without any house...
...just a spiral of a bedstead...
...they were very shocked, and they thought we'd been killed.
They rushed over to the other house...
...and there we were all drinking tea, as alive as anything...
...and that was the only time
I saw Auntie Vera cry.
I think relief, because...
...I guess she had a heart after all.
Advance. End of line.
March!
-Jorgensky!
-Here!
-Tzufevich!
-Here!
-Leventhal!
-Here!
-Alba!
-Here!
-Rosenthal!
-Here!
-Tozic!
-Here!
-Tolina!
-Here!
Yes, they all have names like those.
This company, which I command...
...is almost entirely composed of German and Austrian anti-fascists.
It is one of the fifteen alien companies in the Pioneer Corps.
The Dunera scandal and the harsh treatment of refugees...
...began to shift public opinion in England against internment.
The government started releasing internees...
...and allowed them to join the British armed forces.
Those who wanted to go back to England...
...they would send back under one condition:
They would join the army.
I was anxious to get into this.
First of all, I hated the Germans.
I hated their guts...
...and I wanted to be part of it.
Besides, what was I going to do in Australia?
Sit in Australia throughout the whole war?
God forbid!
Girls, this is urgent.
If you're over 17-and-a-half and under 19...
...you can volunteer for the ATS.
The sooner you come, the wider the choice of jobs available.
Come on, girls, it's urgent!
When I was 18...
...I had...
...to do either work of importance or join the forces.
I decided to join the forces.
I also felt I was saying thank you to England...
...for saving my life.
I think, as a soldier, I felt...
...suddenly I was in an environment where...
...I was the same as everyone else.
For the first time in my life, I think.
Because I think in Lincoln, I more or less...
...think, I existed.
Because I was waiting for tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.
I had lots of friends and...
...I did things I hadn't done before.
I felt like everybody else.
The people on my left, the people on my right, we were all the same...
...and that, I think, was the first time in my life...
...I felt that I could do everything...
...the other people were doing.
I wanted to do something to help finish the war.
I said, "I want to go into nursing."
The first year, I nearly gave up.
I found it very difficult...
...but I was determined to do it.
The second year was better.
Then it grew on me.
We were so busy, I didn't have time to think of myself, anyhow.
After about two years of not hearing from our parents...
...life sort of stretched on endlessly, but suddenly we heard...
...that our parents...
...had reached Spain.
Every night since I left my parents,
I had prayed:
"Please, God, don't let it take longer than five years."
Five years almost to the day...
...we got the telegram.
The telegram said:
"Arriving Friday, 4:45."
That was all.
Unfortunately, 4:45 was the train...
...that my school friends were coming back on, as well.
I knew that since the whole village...
...also knew they were coming, they would all be at the station...
...and my school friends would see me...
...and my brother and sister, meeting our parents...
...for the first time in five years.
It was a tremendous ordeal.
We went down to the station to wait.
And I couldn't cope with it.
So I went back...
...home and I said:
"I'm going home.
I'm going to put the kettle on.
"They'll need a cup of tea."
How English can you get?
I waited and waited and waited.
They took ages.
Suddenly, there's my brother and sister...
...with this middle-aged, elderly couple...
...with suitcases and bags, coming up the path.
I remember rushing down to meet them.
I knew they were my parents...
...but they weren't the same parents I'd left.
They were much older and they were worn out.
And we obviously weren't the same children...
...that they'd sent off.
Suddenly I realized I couldn't say anything except their names.
"Mommy and Daddy" or "Mutti and Papa."
Then we just stood there...
...looking at each other.
It was such...
...a traumatic moment.
It was sad for Inge because she couldn't speak German anymore.
My brother spoke it with difficulty.
I was the only one who could communicate with them.
But the barriers completely went...
...and we became a family again.
The cease-fire began yesterday, to be sounded...
...along all the fronts.
The German war is therefore at an end.
I remember VE Day very clearly.
It was just wonderful.
We all danced in Piccadilly Circus...
...and for me, I just thought, well, this is it:
I'm going to see my parents next week.
I went straight back...
...and wrote to both of them.
I wrote separate letters because I had separate addresses...
...through the Red Cross messages in Theresienstadt.
The letters were returned to me...
...about three or four months later.
Took a long time.
All it said on the back was:
"Deported to Auschwitz...
"...October, '44."
And war was finished in May '45.
That's how I found out.
As soon as war finished...
...Hella and I went to the Red Cross Committee...
...and asked them to search.
Eventually we got a letter from them...
...saying that my mother had been killed in Minsk...
...in Russia, where she was deported.
It's very hard to come to terms with...
...when you've always had that hope.
And, of course, we've had...
...no grave, really...
...no parting, no end, no funeral.
It's that sort of vague feeling...
...in the air of hope, and that hope suddenly fading.
I remember nursing...
...in the children's ward and I was always joking with them and laughing.
And I was called to the telephone...
...and there was a telegram for me.
I asked her if she would read it.
So she read over the telephone:
"Your parents were gravely ill.
There was no hope.
"Wait for further news."
I probably didn't quite take it in...
...so I went back to the ward and started...
...carried on making beds, until one of the little boys said to me:
"Why aren't you laughing this time?"
That's when I burst into tears and ran out.
I remember going out into the garden and just lying on the lawn.
I didn't want to be with anybody.
It was such a shock.
And suddenly the future, which we always painted...
...wasn't there. There was no future.
There was just an emptiness.
At the time I was liberated, a month later...
...I would have been 20...
...and I weighed 58 pounds...
...and that's after eight concentration camps.
Many times I thought about it:
What would have happened if my father...
...wouldn't have pulled me out?
I would have never mentioned it to my father.
You know, "Why did you do that?"
I think I would have done him very wrong.
And I can fully understand, being a mother...
...what it would mean if this is...
...what I would have had to go through with my child, God forbid.
My main concern was always:
Let me be strong and let me try...
...to make it. I made it that far.
I want to make it to the end.
Regardless of what the end was.
Survival is an accident.
You cannot ask a soldier who comes out of battle:
"Why were your comrades, left and right, killed...
"...and you survived?" You have no explanation for that. It's an accident.
At the moment of liberation...
...we were very happy, but on the other hand...
...really very sad, because I realized...
...that I was one of the last who had survived.
All the others who had gone with me to Auschwitz or had been taken...
...to Auschwitz would never return.
In July, 1945...
...I went back to Germany to work for the American government.
One of the reasons was to look for my parents.
The most sensible place to go to, would be to go back to Kippenheim.
But I didn't go back...
...until August, 1947.
I think on some level...
...I knew my parents didn't survive...
...but as long as I didn't go back to Kippenheim...
...I could still say that maybe they were back in Kippenheim...
...which doesn't really make a lot of sense, but...
...I think it was just my survival mechanism.
I just wasn't ready yet to accept...
...the fact that I no longer had parents...
...that I hadn't had parents for a long time.
Although the vast majority of Kindertransport children...
...lost their mothers and fathers in the Holocaust...
...remarkably...
...a few parents survived to be reunited with their children.
My parents managed to get out of Austria...
...by going to Italy.
And from Italy they got into France.
They were hidden by some extremely wonderful people there.
After the war ended...
...I was told that my parents...
...were alive...
...and that some day I would probably have to go back and live with them.
I think I was horrified by that idea.
Uncle Percy persuaded my parents...
...to wait until I'd finished...
...the English School Certificate at age 16.
And also, they needed time to re-establish themselves.
Eventually, in 1947, they were ready for me.
I didn't want to go, but the Cohens took me to Paris...
...where I was to meet my parents.
I remember standing outside the hotel.
I saw, in the distance, my parents approach.
I couldn't look at them directly.
So I looked at them...
...their reflection in a shop window...
...as they walked towards me. I felt...
...a very, very strong emotion.
It was a sense...
...of elation...
...and of love. I suddenly felt it...
...and fought it.
But I felt, you know, I knew it was them.
We met.
Kurt's father, who was more demonstrative than the mother...
...put his hand through Kurt's curls...
...and Kurt went like that, and gave him a wallop.
And my husband says,
"Don't you ever do that again, Kurt.
"Your father is showing you his affection."
And that was that.
When it came to say good-bye to the Cohens...
...I realized for the first time,
I think, consciously...
...that...
...they had loved me, especially Percy...
...because he was in tears, and I'd never seen him cry...
...I'd never seen him cry before.
Then we had to leave him.
I remember him looking back.
It was very, very sad.
He didn't want to go.
He didn't know them.
My parents let go of a 7-year-old...
...and got back a 16-year-old.
And my mother especially wanted...
...to carry on where she'd left off.
And a 16-year-old doesn't like to be treated like a 7-year-old.
So, when we got back to France, things were very difficult.
Of course, I'm very lucky. I realize this.
Most of the Kinder never saw their parents again.
I not only had mine back, but another set of parents as well.
What more could one ask for?
I ceased to be a child when I boarded the train...
...in Prague.
It's strange that it's only six years out of a long life...
...and those six years will affect the rest of your life.
I never belonged when I was a child.
I wanted somewhere to find roots.
I feel...
...in the latter years of my life that I've been accepted.
And nobody's ever said to me:
"You weren't born in this country."
I was as entirely accepted as everyone else.
And I gradually felt...
...I had somewhere I belonged.
To be a refugee...
...is the most horrible feeling, because...
...you lose your family, you lose your home...
...you're also without an identity.
Suddenly, you're a nothing.
You are just reliant on other people's...
...good nature, and help, and understanding.
That's why, I think...
...living in Israel,
I feel for the new immigrants.
I feel for the Russians, and the Ethiopians...
...and anybody who's new, especially if they come without families.
If I can do anything, I do it.
I am dazzled, from the point of view of a writer.
Who else has...
...the unbelievably good fortune to live...
...with the Jewish manufacturer...
...the English working-class union man...
...railroad stoker, the milkman...
...and the Anglo-Indian Victorian ladies?
Whoever has the sheer...
...advantage of not studying this from the outside...
...but being a helpless member from the inside of these families?
Seems to me...
...it was a gift.
Didn't seem so at the time.
I now look at...
...my 14-year-old grandson...
...and I think, "This is the age when I lost...
"...parents, home, country."
A lot has been made up to me...
...from where I lost out.
I have a second cousin here.
He says "Anything you haven't had, you've got now."
Which is so true.
And I'm very grateful and very proud of the whole family.
The younger you were, the more unforgiving you are of your parents.
You may say they were so brave and saved you...
...but they really abandoned you.
We were four friends, very close friends.
We all agreed:
"If it ever happens again...
"...we will not send away our children.
We will stay...
"...and die together."
That's what we said.
Later on, as we grew older, we said...
...we mitigated it, we said:
"If it ever happens, we promise to take each other's children in.
"We will not send them to strangers."
I certainly do my share of remembering...
...but remembering also has to have...
...a present and future perspective.
You can't just stop at remembering.
I don't think I ever made a conscious decision to devote myself...
...to human rights and social justice issues.
Someone helped me.
I can't pay back...
...or thank some of the people who helped me...
...but I can do something for other people.
I've come to a conclusion about myself:
In 1938 I escaped...
...the deportation of Poland.
I got out of Germany in the Kindertransport.
I was sent to Australia on a ship.
The ship was torpedoed and nothing happened.
I got back to England and was in the army.
Why all these coincidences?
I've come to one conclusion:
I was meant to survive.
Not because of myself...
...but because the Jews were to survive.
And I would bring up another generation.
And they would live.
I look at my children...
...and my grandchildren, and I know...
...there was a purpose to my life.
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville!
Welcome to Jackass!
Hello, I'm Johnny Knoxville, and I'm about to rent a car.
- I have a reservation.
- I need a driver's licence and credit card.
I need a signature here that you'll use your coverage instead of ours.
- Is that white one us?
- Yes.
We're gonna walk around it and inspect it together.
Looks pretty good.
I'm just looking for dents and major scratches.
- Lùs not major, but I'll write it down.
- The little ding there?
We'll take care of her.
- Thank you.
- You have a good week.
We'll be doing a lot of work here today.
Trust us, we're gonna have fun.
I'm Johnny Knoxville. This is called the "Rent-a-car Crash-up Derby".
Oh, fuck!
Oh, fuck!
We didn't reinforce the windshield.
- That fucker missed me by that.
- Thaùs why you got the roll bars.
Whose car is this?
This is your guys' car.
I rented it from you earlier.
- Yeah, I hit a dog.
- A dog, you call it.
Come on in.
I had an accident, as you can see.
When I drink, I just black out.
- Were you drinking?
- I had a little, to be honest.
- Is there any licence plates on it?
- There was.
Hopefully, you guys will incur some of the cost,
'cause I rented it from you guys fair and square.
I don't wanna get stuck with the whole charge.
You will get stuck with it.
I don't think I should.
I think you should help.
No. You declined any additional coverage.
Right there. You declined it.
- Thaùs just paperwork.
- Lùs a legal contract.
I was... I had a few to drink when I signed that, too.
- We'll have to get this worked out.
- You'll have to pay for that car.
- You have to help me.
- No, we don't...
I returned it with a full tank of gas.
You returned it demolished.
- Lùs got a full tank.
- Thaùs the least of our worries.
This is an unmitigated outrage.
I've never seen anything like this.
- What does that mean?
- No one's ever done that.
- Well, I can't pay for it.
- You're gonna have to.
Well, I ain't.
I'll let you two work it out.
I'm gonna go outside, but that car is gonna have to be paid for.
F you!
Knoxville knocked my nuts in half!
This is "The Muscle Stimulator".
It hurts my teeth.
I can't even turn it off.
How's that supposed to help?
- OK, you ready?
- Yeah.
OK, I'm taking care of you.
Lùs all right.
Lùs cool. You cool?
Come on. Ease up. Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you. Come on.
- You're gonna have tits of steel.
- You're so buff right now.
This goes on the gooch!
This goes on the gooch.
Who's gonna do the gooch?
In case you didn't know, the gooch is the spot between your balls and butthole.
- Does it smell?
- Smell it. Just smell it!
Ehren, smell it.
- Zap my nuts.
- Leùs get it over with.
- Are we ready?
- You're so gone.
- He likes it.
- He liked it.
Afternoon. How you doing?
Son of a bitch!
What happened?
Man!
Thaùs the best thing I've ever seen!
Oh, fuck, dude!
- Are you OK? Get over here!
- Help him, help him!
- Medic!
- No! Don't move him!
That had bad news written all over it.
- Thaùs the worst that could happen.
- Dunn can't drive for shit.
I don't know what happened. We went in the air. The next thing I know
I'm just fucked.
Dude, you were hauling so much ass.
We're here in Tokyo, and I feel like partying.
Hi, I'm Party Boy.
Can I try this?
Here we go. Lùs my party music.
Like it?
That makes me want to party.
I feel like partying right now.
Thaùs what the big ones do.
Sometimes they take a while to...
Fuck!
Don't pull on it, man.
You can't pry his mouth open.
Lùs slowly getting weightless.
- Is he opening?
- No, you're twisting him!
Oh, fuck!
He's got my nipple, dude.
- I know. Hang on.
- Hang on. Don't move.
- You little bastard!
- Look at the teeth marks.
Man...
I am Bunny Lifeguard. Any alligators try to ruin our swimming,
I'll wrestle them down and have my way with them.
If he falls near an alligator and it grabs hold of him,
Steve-O will relax and hope the alligator will release him.
I'm Steve-O.
This is "Alligator Tightrope".
- Oh, shit.
- There's no such thing as failure.
He got it.
One thing I know is good tightrope-walking.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
- Put the chicken on him!
- Yeah!
- Oh, shit.
- There you go.
- Keep going, Steve-O.
- Oh, shit!
Keep your head up.
- Stick the bones up your ass.
- Let them pull it out.
Stay there, don't move!
Don't look!
Don't move!
I ran straight into a crocodile.
Oh, my God!
- Why can't you walk on a tightrope?
- I don't know.
I thought you'd do it.
Yeah, I don't know, man.
I'm sure I could learn, but today was my first try.
I'm Bam Margera, and my parents are asleep.
Lùs 12.42, and Phil has to be at work at five in the morning.
He's trying to get a good nighùs sleep, and I'm gonna go wake his ass up.
I'm dying. Holy shit!
- Oh, my God. I don't believe this.
- Look at Phil's tummy.
Phil, you got to be up at five in the morning.
Six o'clock I'll be at work.
Here he comes.
Christ, Bam!
I almost broke my leg getting out!
There's shit all over!
How am I going to work now?
That woman in the corner, cold playin' the role
Leave her ass in the corner till her feet get cold
Knowin' for a fact that girl is whacked
If you hold your hand out she'll turn her back
Better walk, don't talk
She's all pretend
Can't be her friend unless you spend
Wall to wall, after all, get ready to throw only money at the bitch
'Cause she thinks she's so-phisticated
So-phisticated
What are you doing?
I ought to arrest you with all that in your clothes. Whaùs wrong with you?
- What are you talking about?
- Get this out of your pocket!
Thaùs all me.
What is this bullshit?!
- Those are my bananas.
- Don't come here no more!
Get out, and take the other stuff out of your pockets. Get it all out.
- Thaùs how you treat an old man?
- Yeah, go.
An old man that steals.
I can't believe it.
What kind of games are you playing? Get out!
- Get out!
- Goddammit!
What is wrong with you?!
Get out!
Quit playing!
- I was Lon Chaney's lover!
- Go back and love him.
We're gonna go to this hardware store where they sell toilets.
I'm gonna take a shit.
I'm gonna shit my pants before we get to that place.
- Dave, fight it.
- No jokes. I just wanna hold it in.
- Got to poo?
- Pretty much. Really bad.
Do you wanna ruin everything?
I swear to God... lùs a problem.
Is this the worst you've had to go boom-boom?
No. I shit my pants at the fair.
Dude, he's shitting right now!
Get out, get out!
Get out of the fucking car!
- What did I do?!
- Did you shit?
Oh, shit!
I'm taking a cab back to the hotel.
He just shat everywhere.
- Whaùs wrong, man?
- I had to sit there while he shat.
I need to go home right now.
Lùs on my hand.
We have very...
What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.
I'm almost done.
I hope you aim to get that, son of a bitch.
You got to clean it out, pal.
That is disgusting, man!
What a fucking fruit loop!
Want me to play back?
What the fuck!
- Got him!
- Turn around. Leùs see it.
Thaùs a good one.
I'm Ehren Mcghehey.
This is "The Mousetrap".
All right!
Come on.
Thaùs enough! Time!
The "Bungee Wedgie".
- This isn't gonna work.
- It might.
Whaùs gonna happen here?
I don't know, but iùs not whaùs gonna be intended.
Raab's putting a bloody tampon on.
Thaùs a Courtney Love-sized
Maxi Pad.
This is worse than a hanging.
I'm Raab Himself, and I'm a complete fucking idiot.
- We need another one.
- Do it again.
Hey, I'm Raab Himself, and this is "Bungee Wedgie".
Is that your shitty ass?
Look at the bloody, shitty underpants.
I can't believe this!
We're in the Valley today to do our own riot control test.
This is George Hruska. What do you do and what are we doing here today?
I'm Vice President of Operations with ALS Technologies.
We make less lethal ammunition.
We're a top US manufacturer.
We're going to shoot you with one of our projectiles.
Lùs called the Pen-Prevent.
Lùs a 40-gram tail-stabilised bag.
Lùll be travelling about 250 feet per second.
Is that lethal?
Lùs considered less lethal.
This morning I thought I was taking the beanbag projectile in the chest, but George's company said no way.
If it hits me in the heart,
I'm pretty much done with.
We wanna take every precaution necessary to protect your vital organs.
- Are my intestines in that area?
- Think so.
Awesome.
Are you gonna take some practice shots?
This is nothing to mess around with.
This is nothing for anybody to throw in a 12-gauge shotgun and think they could take it.
I'm doing this because I can do this in a controlled state.
Safety's off.
Going hot.
- That really hurt.
- It looked like it hurt.
Oh, fuck!
Did you see the way I caught that beanbag with my stomach?
Thaùs instinct. You can't teach that.
It hurts so much going from a prone position to standing.
Ouch.
Hi, I'm Wee Man, and this is a big cone.
Oh, my God! My brakes!
Oh, shit!
My brakes! My brakes!
My brakes!
Stop me! Stop me!
Stop me!
- You all right?
- That was so fast.
- Did your brakes go out?
- Yes. That whole thing doesn't work.
Will you push me to the top?
I wanna do it again.
I could sure go for a Miller High Life.
Oh, you're in so much trouble.
Kick her ass!
I'm about to get ass-kicked by a girl.
Keep up the left!
And the winner...
...and still champion:
- Now pronounce her name!
His bloody mouthpiece.
My God, my jaw is two inches to the left.
I felt all right for a bit, until she punched me in the nose.
I knew she was fighting dirty.
- "Tropical Pole Vaulting."
- One, two, three, four!
- Go grab the dead kitty!
- I've been in there before. It sucks!
Oh, God!
We don't have to bleep cuss words, so I promise I will get my mom to say
"fuck" by the end of this movie.
I'm Johnny Knoxville.
We're about to test my rocket skates.
Go.
This is "Rocket Skates", take two.
- This one will be more powerful.
- These are different rockets?
No, there's more of them.
- Oh, fuck!
- Whaùs wrong?
I fell and busted my ass.
Thaùs whaùs fucking wrong.
Thaùs it.
No more rocket skates.
God! This party sucks!
- Hey, my man. Wasabi. Lots.
- Wasabi.
Yeah!
Today I'm gonna treat myself to some wasabi snooters.
Little circles.
God! Chopsticks are so stupid!
Pretty good line.
More.
Do another snooter.
I need a pick-me-up.
This is bullshit!
Phil. Phil!
Phil. Hey, Phil!
Oh, my God.
Is this thing real?!
This alligator?!
- What?
- Look! Over there in the corner.
What is that?
Where have you been?
Don't you even look?
Oh, my God!
Lùs moving. Oh, Phil!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Aren't you scared to death?!
Lùs so gross that iùs even on the floor.
I'm going out. Where's my keys?
That is the scariest fucking thing
I ever saw!
Don't leave. Where are you going?
Phil, help me get this thing out of here! I'm scared to death!
Oh, God!
Oh, man!
No, no! I don't want it open!
No, no!
You don't have it, do you?
- No, we don't.
- Lùs not there?
Seriously, is that real?
I'm serious. Is it real?
- Is it real?!
- Yeah.
I'm serious. I want it out!
Dude, wait, stop, chill!
Jason kicked your ass!
- I didn't even get you.
- You got beat up by Wee Man.
Let me see.
He didn't even get you.
- Where?
- He didn't even get you.
Let me see the back of your head.
- Oh!
- Lùll be all right.
I'm here with Eric Koston and Clyde Singleton.
Today I'm gonna 50-50 this rail, or try to.
- This thing is long.
- Thanks.
Thanks for reminding me.
I got it. I got this.
- Is he gonna go?
- He's gonna go somewhere.
He's going, yeah.
My impression of Johnny Knoxville.
Something like this.
"Oh, my face!"
I'm Johnny Knoxville, and I'm gonna grind this rail.
Ready, set, go.
He made it!
I can't believe he got that far.
You ran it to the fucking bottom!
This is the "Paper Cuts". I'm getting paper cuts between my fingers and toes.
There's no good way to do it.
Just deal with it. Take a breath.
You can feel when it goes in. This one works good. Give me the next.
Do it.
- Open up with a good one!
- Did you hear that?
That was my flesh!
If I do your hand, you'll forget the pain in your foot.
Good point.
Take a deep breath.
Hey, Lance, are you going to puke?
He's gonna puke!
From what, the pepperoni or the paper cuts? Both?
Pepperoni!
- Pig entrails?
- Lùs showtime!
Is he OK?
- Lance, are you all right?
- Don't knock over the beer.
- Are you OK?
- No.
There's green spit everywhere.
Steve-O, if you wanna do some more, do it. I'm done.
Is everybody ready?
That sucked!
Am I glad I came down to see what was going on in this room.
Wait a minute.
I know what my fortune is.
Lùs partying.
This is "Sweaty Fat Fucks".
Oh, honey. Lùs been a while.
- Lùs a little too much.
- No.
- You need to do it?
- You want a spot?
- No, I got it.
- You got it?
- You need a spot, give me a call.
- OK.
Whaùs the quickest you've knocked anyone out?
I hold the California State record of 18 seconds including the 10-count.
I think you'll break that today.
- I'm Johnny Knoxville.
- I'm Butterbean.
Today we're gonna do a little boxing.
Guys, touch gloves and come out fighting.
Get up!
One more time.
This is the last time you're kicking my ass.
More pain, thaùs it.
Hit me once, at least. There you go.
He's out.
Is Butterbean OK?
By knockout in the first round, new champion: Butterbean.
- Where are we going, Knoxville?
- The hospital.
- Why?
- Don't know.
Apparently, I have a gash in my head, and I'm a little concussed.
- Are you giving me a shot?
- Yeah. You OK?
We got one more to go, buddy.
Then you are a free man.
You're gonna be not feeling great for the next 24 hours.
Thank you, doctor. You'll probably see me in two or three days.
I, Sir Marcius, will never pay you with cash, only with drugs!
- Goddammit, what are you doing?
- Whaùs going on?
We're in Okinawa and about to swim with whale sharks, but first...
...we need to go rub one out.
I made the mistake of showing them what sea cucumbers do when they're threatened.
As soon as something touches them, white threads come out of the end.
Steve-O and Chris thought it was a great idea, so they're out there trying to masturbate.
Anyway, I apologise for this.
This is the "Whale Shark Gummer".
With a simple shave with a razor,
Steve-O easily disguises himself to fool the whale sharks into thinking he's a harmless young boy.
I am nervous about my wiener around that whale shark.
The best way is to think of whale sharks as big puppy dogs.
- Sometimes puppies bite.
- They have little teeth.
You're gonna get a gummer.
- Lùs like being with a gal with no teeth.
- Kind of.
Below these waters,
30-foot whale sharks are waiting to eat these frigging shrimp out of our crotches.
They're kind of...
They pinch. Are these alive?
They don't feel good all the way to your cock.
Look at this shrimp.
I don't have any last words.
I'll kill myself once I lose my wiener.
My penis is really small now.
I can't really look cool right now.
Hi, I'm Johnny Knoxville.
This is the "Tidal Wave".
- How did it look?
- Good.
- Look at this guy.
- Great.
I don't pick a tattoo unless I'm sure people will laugh when they see it.
Oh, my God, dude.
How do you perform the worlÔs dumbest tattoo?
Fuck, man.
At least I don't have to look at it.
My name is Henry Rollins, and this is "Off-road Tattoo"!
This is designed to fuck you up!
Christian motherfucker!
Lùs a total smiley face, dude.
- This fool got a haircut a week ago.
- You're about to get many more.
Look at Ehren.
Oh, shit!
We're finding it chilly in Japan, so we're gonna warm ourselves up with some fireworks.
- Leùs go, dude.
- Roll back just a bit.
Oh, no. This is a bad angle.
An ember fell in my cornhole.
Double-knot it, but gently.
You may think this next stunt is impossible.
You got to squat a little.
Every time...
Is Chris' dick shorter or...?
That almost hit Louis in the face!
Goddamn, this is the "BMX Tug-of-war".
What a dumb-ass idea!
I'm surrounded by cacti, for fuck's sake!
- Lùs cacti!
- Cactus!
Whatever it is, it hurts!
You wanna get help across?
This is the "Yellow Snowcone".
Pack it in nice and tight.
A little cold out here, it might take a second. There we go.
I'm not worried about the pee...
- You're missing the cone.
- I'm sorry.
You better eat that whole thing and that spot, too.
Enjoy the snow cone.
You just wasted a whole bunch.
Get that whole mouthful.
- Keep going, eat it!
- Lùs your pee!
- Come on!
- I'm trying. Lùs so cold.
- Swallow it.
- Oh, God!
- No puking.
- I'm doing it!
Lùs dripping out the bottom. Catch it!
Oh, my God!
That was bad!
Kick yourself in the head, Wee Man.
Are you starting to lose your mind?
You shit! Stop it!
Now you're getting crazy on this shit.
Hey! He's starting to lose it!
Jesus Christ!
I need toilet paper!
This is called the "Golf Course Airhorn".
When people tee off and are coming down with their swing, we'll blow these airhorns.
- Here she goes again.
- No? Is there another one?
She still hit it pretty good.
- What did I tell you?
- You lost your club. Sorry.
Didn't I tell you I'd come over and kick your ass?
- Sorry, I've got bursitis.
- So you got to play with a horn?
- It helps.
- I'll give you something to play with.
Sorry. It won't happen again.
- Oh, fuck!
- He's teeing up.
- Get back! Get down!
- Watch this. Wait.
Oh, Jesus, you're scary!
- I'm Bam Margera.
- Johnny Knoxville.
We're gonna be burglars today.
Oh, God!
- Fuck! Get the diamonds!
- I told you not to fall off the beam!
Turn around! Fuck!
Holy fuck!
Idiot!
Holy fuck!
- You all right? You OK?
- I'm good.
What did you think happened?
I wasn't halfway through the ceiling and you were already out the door.
You're an Olympic sprinter!
Dude, guys in masks, I'm out.
I don't quit!
Is there any actual real reason...
...one would shove this up their ass?
- No.
- I'm claiming predictions for this event.
- Where's Ryan?
1: lùs not getting in there.
2: If it does, iùs not staying.
Definitely no sitting down.
3: No way they'll believe this is true.
So you're saying iùs...
There's nothing I want more than for this to happen, but...
- You didn't want it that much.
- I really do.
This is our original talent for this piece, by the way.
The first thing you've ducked out of.
Man, I'm so glad
I turned this idea down.
I'll probably use all of this before the end of the segment.
What else have we got?
A condom. Thank you.
A little toy car. Blue.
Lùs my favourite colour.
Leùs see it dangling.
Look at the reservoir tip.
Now I'm lubing up the little toy car, because I'm going to put it in my butt.
Be comfortable.
EÔs here for rescuing, dude.
You're here for making it a problem.
- You watching is uncomfortable.
- I got to get another job.
- Lube up your cornhole.
- I am. I'm spackling.
- Heart rate's going up, for sure.
- Adrenaline's flowing, isn't it?
It hurts like hell.
Come on in, Manny.
You're just in time.
Manny, tell me I'm a man.
It feels so goddamn gross.
This is insane. Lùs totally insane.
- Lùs in.
- Lùs in?
Oh, fuck!
I feel like I have to shit my ass!
Is there anything to tap?
You said you didn't wanna do it because your dad would disown you.
- It wasn't that.
- You drank wine off a dude's ass crack!
But Dad never saw that.
I never told him that.
I was gonna do this and I was like,
"Dad, we're going hard these days.
There's ideas floating around."
I mentioned the car in the butt, and it was the only time in my life
I heard my dad say, "I'm not mad at you, I'm just disappointed."
That hurt so much more.
- Look at him walk.
- Dunn's gonna win, dude.
I'm not too excited about this skit, because there's a toy car in my butt, but this is the "Butt X-ray".
I think I need an X-ray.
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.
- I'm Ryan.
- What can I do for you?
I was partying last night with some frat guys. I passed out.
I must have broken something,
'cause I can't walk right.
We're gonna take X-ray now.
- This is comfy.
- Hold your breath.
I can't tell you, he's there.
- Whaùs that?
- No idea.
Thaùs not part of you.
Thaùs something extra.
- I woulÔve known if I ate that.
- You wouldn't be able to swallow that.
- That is a car toy.
- How did a car toy get there?
- Maybe you stuck it up your ass.
- I didn't do that.
You ever seen anything like that?
I've never seen that in there.
I'd say iùs a toy car.
Never in somebody's rectum.
- You can't get it out?
- No.
I'm a physician.
I practise this. X-ray only.
You think I can just poop it out?
You won't be able to poop it out.
It will hurt you.
I don't think iùs even good for you that you poop it out.
What will happen if he takes Ex-Lax?
Will that help?
No. He gets a lot of diarrhoea, but no car.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me.
He's alive! Johnny Knoxville!
He made it!
There is a God!
At last, I thought it would never...
This is the end!
Thank you, Jesus!
Subtitle arrangement:
Plavi-G@Avgust 2003
Whose dick do I got to suck to get some explosions?
Gator wrestling!
For fuck's sake, come here!
Hurry up!
Hurry!
We wanted to see if you would run.
I ain't running anywhere.
Scary enough to walk.
You're nice. You're a good man.
Wanna come over for dinner?
Lùs OK.
Do you know how to operate it now?
Yeah, I think so.
I need help.
The smiley face is a complete crucial...
- What did I say?
- "Fuck."
- I didn't say the F-word?
- You did.
- Don't worry. We'll bleep it.
- Can we cut that out?
I think it says "fuck" on my forehead.
- Did you know I had a tail?
- No.
They must have taken it from somewhere...
I can't believe you did that.
Show him the X-ray.
Trust me, dude. I'm not unimpressed.
Oh, fuck!
The next time we could do "Son of Jackass".
Yeah, dude!
Louis I. Kahn, whose strong forms of brick and concrete... influenced a generation of architects... and made him, in the opinion of most architectural scholars,
America's foremost living architect, died Sunday evening apparently of a heart attack in Pennsylvania Station.
He was 73 years old.
Besides his wife, Mr. Kahn leaves a daughter, Sue Ann.
When I first read that obituary,
I have to admit I was looking for my own name.
I was his child too, his only son.
I didn't know my father very well.
He never married my mother, and he never lived with us.
But I can still remember... every detail of the few times we spent a whole day together.
On this afternoon, we had a picnic.
He painted with watercolors, and my mother snapped these pictures.
He died when I was 11.
The circumstances of his death have always fascinated me.
He was bankrupt and alone on his way back home from India.
He collapsed in the downstairs men's room in Penn Station, New York.
The police couldn't identify him, because, for some unknown reason, he crossed out the address on his passport.
They took him to the city morgue, where he lay unclaimed for three days.
What was he thinking at the end?
Had he seen anyone?
Had he talked to anyone?
Had he really decided to leave his wife and come and live with us like my mother said?
For years, I struggled to be satisfied with the little piece of my father's life
I'd been allowed to see.
But it wasn't enough.
I needed to know him.
I needed to find out who he really was, so I set out on a journey to see his buildings and to find whatever was left of him out there.
It would take me to the other side of the world looking for the man who left me with so many questions.
My father had been dead 25 years, so there wasn't much time left if I wanted to meet any of his colleagues.
I figured I'd start at the top: the guy with the glasses.
- Mr. Johnson.
- Good to meet you.
- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- You're Lou's son?
Yes.
Generations go by quickly, don't they?
I've just decided Lou was the most beloved architect of our time.
- Really?
- Yeah... Well, think of anybody else.
Frank Lloyd Wright was too cantankerous to love.
Mies van der Rohe wasn't... you couldn't talk to him at all.
Corbusier was mean.
But Lou, now, there was a man.
All my buildings don't add up to what his three or four buildings, because he, when he did get a client... however he ever got any clients is a mystery, because artists don't get jobs.
Every time I've tried to do art,
I've ended up with a...
I've made much less.
Nothing to be ashamed of, naturally.
I do it the other way.
I do it by numbers and... and public fame and all that.
But Lou did it by being an artist.
He'd sit and work on art, see?
And I always wished... I think he did too... wished he knew me better, and I always wished I knew him better.
- Why?
- Well, you know, there's some things that don't go into words.
It's animal attraction... his mind, really, because his person... to look at him wasn't much a pleasure.
- It wasn't?
- It couldn't be.
See, he was so scarred.
Funny, he never talked to me as directly as he should have.
- Who?
- Lou.
He never came here, though.
- Didn't he ever come here?
- To the glass house?
That's strange, 'cause
I built it in '49.
Possible. Possible.
Do you think Lou would have liked this house?
- No.
- Why?
Oh, rigid boxes, you know. He...
He was his own artist.
He was free compared to me.
The first time I'd gotten a real sense of Lou's legacy was when I was a student up the road at Yale University.
My father was only 5'6" but he cast a long shadow in New Haven.
He built his first and last major buildings here: the Yale Art Gallery in 1953; and right across the street, the British Art Center, finished after his death.
I used to wander around in those buildings on weekends.
They were silent and mysterious, and I half expected Lou to just appear from around the next corner.
There were rows of books about his work in the library.
He hadn't built very many buildings, but apparently they had changed the course of architecture: the Salk Institute, the Kimbell Art Museum, the Exeter Library, the Capital of Bangladesh.
My art history professor, Vincent Scully, had been a friend of Lou's, but he always talked about him like some long-dead ancient hero.
It was unsettling.
From the very beginning he was after symmetry, order, geometric clarity, primitive power, enormous weight... as much as he could get, like this great monster that stands in the middle of this space.
You know as I said too,
I think, before: enduring monuments.
He wants his materials to kind of last, which is a permanent work in the world.
That's what he's after.
You know, it was such a wonderful thing to be close to somebody who really was changing everything.
You said at one point that he wanted to make everything right.
- He wanted to make it perfect.
- Perfect.
You know, in Jewish mysticism, which I know almost nothing about, but...
God can only be known through His works, right?
And since the messiah hasn't come yet, hmm, the works of any Jewish architect might be the works of God.
And you take those pictures of Louie when he's looking into the light and when he's enjoying silence like this, it's... it makes the hair stand up, because it really is like that, as if he's in some way communicating with this fundamental thing, that
God is in the work.
So it has to be perfect, you see.
It has to be perfect.
It can't be impatient.
It's timeless.
I wanted to ask you.
Do you think... did anybody know... that Lou had three families all at once?
No, I didn't.
As a matter of fact, for years
I didn't know Lou was married.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That was part of his mystery.
My mother and I lived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at the end of a secluded road.
Lou would visit every once in a while, mostly at night.
We never knew quite when it would be.
He'd call at the last minute and say he was on his way.
My mother would frantically whip up a five-course meal and have a Martini in a frozen glass waiting for him.
I got to stay up late, and Lou would tell me wonderful stories about India and elephants and tigers.
In the middle of the night, we'd all bundle into the car and drive him back downtown.
I'd lie in the backseat.
We were all silent.
When I asked my mother why we couldn't all live together, she explained that his wife wouldn't give him a divorce.
Why didn't he just run away?
We'd stop at the end of Clinton Street and let him out.
He'd walk down the block and disappear into the dark house, his wife's house.
Her name was Esther.
They had a daughter named Sue, who was 20 years older than me.
When I was in first grade,
I found out I had another half sister, Alex.
Her mother was a lady named Anne.
Then there was my mother and me.
Lou was 61 when I was born.
All three families lived within several miles of each other, but we never crossed paths until Lou's funeral.
- Do you remember this guy?
- Hell of a man.
- Sure, I remember him.
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
20, 40 times. Who knows?
He was a cab rider, strictly cab rider.
- Yeah, he didn't drive?
- Never. He used to sit in front.
- He sat in front?
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah. That was your dad, world-famous architect.
Yeah, that was your father.
- Do you remember him at all?
- A little bit, vaguely.
- Did he ever ride in your cab?
- Vaguely. He loved the women.
Not the young ones, but he loved the women.
Do you remember what he looked like or...
His face was pointed.
Yeah, and his hair was... his hair was, you know, very thin, like a blond.
- Like a what?
- Like it was blond. Yeah.
Oh, blond, uh-huh.
Do you remember that he had scars on his face?
Oh, sure.
It would look like he was burned.
Yeah.
This is where your father had his office, right there, where it says tickets, upstairs.
That's 1501. That's where he was, right here.
The office at 1501 Walnut Street was the last place I saw my father.
My mother would bring me here sometimes after hours and on weekends.
Lou would lean out the top floor window and toss down a key wrapped in yellow tracing paper, to let us in.
When I went to high school,
I had a teacher in the arts who was head of the department, Central High:
William Gray.
And he gave a course in architecture, the only course... in any high school, I'm sure... in Greek, Roman, Renaissance, Egyptian, and Gothic architecture.
And at that point, two of my colleagues and myself realized that only architecture would be my life.
How accidental our existences are, really, and how full of influence by circumstance.
Here at the University of Pennsylvania, one of the world's great architects,
Professor Louis Kahn, teaches and creates.
This is his Richards
Medical Research Building, called by the Museum of
Modern Art in New York City probably the single most consequential building constructed in the United
States since World War II.
It is principled, vigorous, fundamental, and exhilarating.
This building is Kahn's greatest achievement.
People come by all the time with their cameras taking pictures of this awesome architectural wonder, and we just sit upstairs in the window and laugh at them, because it's not a good place to work.
I don't feel comfortable in my room, in my lab.
The temperature is not constant.
- The temperature is not constant?
- Yeah.
I don't like that birds fly into the windows and get killed.
It's not a pretty building.
You know what I mean?
It doesn't have a good-looking architectural to it.
It needs face, something different, maybe paint the pillars a different color than the building or something.
I mean, something to give it a little pizzazz instead of, like I said, look like a bomb shelter.
This was Lou's only major building in Philadelphia, and I wanted to like it.
But I had to agree it was kind of disappointing.
Around this time, an article appeared in the Philadelphia
Inquirer about my search.
It quoted me as saying that I wanted to hug my father's buildings, which was very embarrassing, but it stirred things up.
I got several letters, including one from a relative of Lou's who was a rabbi.
He said that he'd officiated at Lou Kahn's funeral and Lou Kahn didn't have a son.
Hello?
- Is this Rabbi Kramer?
- Yes.
Yeah, hi. This is
Nathaniel Kahn calling.
God in heavens, the whole world opened up, my friend.
What are you talking about?
I mean, gosh, I've been raising hell with the Inquirer.
I said, "Find that man."
You're raising hell with the Inquirer?
- Why are you doing that?
- To find you, sir.
Oh, well, I'm glad you did find me.
Look, don't forget Lou
Kahn's my first cousin.
Lou Kahn is your first cousin?
And my parents was his godparents.
Wow, I didn't know that.
Well, I knew Lou very well.
With all due respect, I hear Lou fooled around.
Well, you know...
Anyway, I'm here, so that's a good thing.
What would you do with the film once you...
Oh, it'll be on... it'll be on TV, you know.
- Wow.
- Yeah, so...
I'd like to come and interview you.
- I'm photogenic.
- Oh, you're photogenic, okay.
Let's see if anybody's home.
Just calling for you.
Oh, that was kind of you.
No camera, please.
- No camera?
- No camera.
No, I understand. I know you were skeptical, so I wanted to show you my birth certificate, which, um, you know...
My bris certificate?
I don't have that.
What do they do?
That's okay, I understand.
Not that I'm proud of being... but I'm trying...
'74, right, and you... the two of you were there at his funeral, right?
But people in the family really didn't know that he was an internationally known architect, did they?
Does that mean no money to show for it, you mean, or what?
Why did they think that he traveled the world and he didn't amount to anything?
I grew up not knowing anything about Lou's family and the Jewish half of my background.
I'd hoped so much that
Kramer would fill in that part of the story for me, but I was disappointed.
In this society, how you made it is now like the dust has cleared.
Something else was happening, though.
Details about my father were coming back to me: his voice, the rough feel of his scars.
That was one of my favorite stories.
I made him tell it to me over and over.
He was three years old back in Estonia.
There were coals glowing in a stove.
He was captivated by the light.
He took the coals out and put them in his apron.
It caught fire, and the flames seared his face and the backs of his hands.
His father thought it would be better if he died, but his mother said he would grow up to be a great man because of it.
I first met your father... some AIA affairs.
And I sat right next to Lou.
And I praised him, on the Richards Laboratory.
I thought that was really a marvelous group of buildings.
And it was then that he told me, "You know,
"go to Scotland."
- Really?
- Know that?
No.
The Scottish castle gave him the inspiration.
- For Richards?
- Yes.
And I said, "That group of buildings are really one of your best."
And he said, "Well, the best is yet to come."
That was Salk.
So then he told me about his relationship with Salk.
He said, "I have the best client."
And he said, "Well, I view somehow that this will be an important piece of work."
And as it turned out to be.
I consider it to be a masterpiece of his.
The two of you have varying degrees of success with clients.
You seem to have succeeded very well.
I am... I am, but I'm a little bit more able to... a little more patient, perhaps, because of my being Chinese.
If my client... let's say a person did not agree with me,
I'll let it pass, and I'll come back another day.
I don't think Lou would do that.
Lou would probably... push it right through.
And then when he found a client that is sympathetic, it's a client for life, huh?
And I don't think I could claim that.
On the other hand, I probably... lost fewer clients than he did.
Oh, way fewer. I think you've built way more.
You've had way more success rate
- in terms of your buildings...
- Building doesn't mean success.
- No? -
Building... three or four masterpieces are more important than 50, 60 buildings.
Quality, not quantity.
Architecture has to have the element of time.
How can you judge a work today, let's say a work by anyone of these modern architects that you know about that's exciting and wonderful.
And then what'll happen to it 20, 50 years later?
That's the measure.
That's why that Salk
Center will always be as perfect as it was conceived.
The teakwood may fade away.
It probably did... or has.
But the spirituality of that project will remain.
Now, that building will stand the test of time.
No question about it.
There is something spiritual about this space.
For the first time since he died,
I felt I was getting closer to my father.
The scientists told me the building is not only beautiful, but it works.
Unlike the Richards medical towers, where the labs are small, these labs are totally open, spanning the full length of the building, and each scientist has a study with an unobstructed view of the Pacific Ocean.
Lou was 65 when Salk was finished.
He said it was the first building he was really happy with.
I looked up one of the men who worked with him on the project, a guy named Jack MacAllister.
Jack moved out here during construction and never left.
I was in charge of this project when I was 25.
You had an incredible responsibility.
Unbelievable.
That was one of the things that he had: enormous trust in young people.
Lou put me in charge and gave me his checkbook.
And he said, you know,
"You distribute the fees."
And I grew a beard because
I wanted to look older.
I'm serious.
How old were you when Lou died?
- I was 11.
- That's what I thought.
- I was 11, yeah.
- Did you know him well?
- I have a sense for him.
- Right.
And I saw him, you know, once a week, maybe.
- That's all, though?
- That's about all, yeah.
- Did you ever travel with him, or...
- No, no.
That's why I wanted to talk to you, because you spent a lot of time with him.
- Oh, yeah, me and my family did.
- Your family did too?
He used to spend
Christmas with us, yeah.
- He spent Christmas with you?
- He loved Christmas, yeah.
He absolutely loved it. I can remember him lying on our bed watching cartoons with the kids... and then falling asleep, you know? They'd just say,
"Lou's sound asleep, Daddy."
That's when we'll leave,
"You know, leave him be. He's tired."
Lou was very willful, you see?
He didn't want anything in his buildings... to look like he hadn't anticipated them.
So when something was going to happen, instead of trying to suppress it he made more of it.
And that's a way of thinking about things, you know,
- ... not just architecture, about anything. - Sure.
Any adversity, any difficulty.
Instead of trying to cover it up, you pull it out and express it, and then you own it.
And, I mean, you might say... it's probably a loose fit, but it had to do with his own physical imperfection
- that...
- His face, you mean?
Yeah, that the scars on a building that are produced by the way it's made should be revealed. I think he really believed that.
It all had to do with revealing the process of what it was about.
And he probably learned to think about himself that way.
I've never said the before, and it may be bullshit, but it's an interesting thing to think of.
You know, you can't be stupid all your life.
You got to be smart too.
We used to use the expression, you know, in the college... when I went to college.
When we couldn't solve a damn problem, you know, because it was so difficult and... or you didn't study for the examination you took that morning, you know, we always said, "I wish we were smart instead of good-looking."
That was the expression we used.
He was an incredible man who we all supported and forgave for a lot of things because of what he was doing.
What kinds of things did you have to forgive him for?
Oh, I once... on very short notice he came to me and asked me to build a model of a project while he was out of town.
And I went in, and I spent two or three days working on it.
I finally finished it. I went to bed at about midnight, and he came in from wherever he was.
He may have been in India,
I don't know.
And he came to the office about 3:00 in the morning, called me at home.
"Jack, this is Lou.
That model you built is a piece of shit." Bang.
What do you say? Maybe it was.
He could have been right, you know?
But... You know, he was capable of that kind of thing too.
- At 3:00 a.m.?
- Yeah, at 3:00 a.m.
He didn't know what time it was.
- Did you ever drink with Lou?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, you should ask my first wife.
Hello, Mr. Katz?
This is Nathaniel Kahn returning your call.
Yes, I would like very much to hear what you saw that night in Penn Station, New York.
What an incredible coincidence.
Please give me a call back and let me know where I can meet you, or I'll try you again later. Thanks. Bye-bye.
Are you David?
No, I'm not David, no, sorry.
I'm supposed to meet somebody right here.
... Me too a guy named Richard Katz.
What are you doing?
Actually, this guy
Richard Katz was... my dad died 26 years ago, and he was with my father in Penn Station, New York.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, and
I don't know the story of what happened.
So Richard Katz is coming to tell me.
- Is that great?
- I don't know if it's great.
- It's something, anyway.
- That's... yeah.
- Yeah, I hope he shows up.
- I hope he does. I hope my guy does.
Is that... is that the guy you're supposed to meet?
- No, maybe that's yours.
- No, I don't think so.
Are you Richard?
- How you doing?
- Hey, Richard. I'm Nathaniel.
- Yeah, I figured it'd be you.
- Nice to meet you. Right.
Right.
There was a policeman here and a policeman here,
- and the dead man was here.
- And where were you?
I'm pretty sure that I was over here.
So when you came in, were the policemen already there?
No, no.
I see this face of this guy, and he didn't look very well.
Did you know he was dying?
Was it clear to you that...
I've never seen anybody die.
So I don't think I would know that.
I've seen one or two dead men, and they don't look like that.
They look very peaceful.
- He didn't look peaceful?
- No.
You remember that, that he didn't look peaceful?
What was... what was the... I mean...
He just didn't.
- Scared?
- What did he die of?
- Heart attack.
- He did?
That's a real sad story that you didn't know your dad at all.
I have a kid who's 18 years old, and I didn't get to see him from the time he was 8.
So it's kind of a different story, isn't it?
Or is that the same story?
It's a different story, because... well, if I had died,
I guess it would have been the same story, huh?
Why hadn't you seen him for ten years?
Oh, it was a custody case.
- Did you want to keep him?
- Sure. My kid. My son.
I mean, I don't just feel sympathy for you.
I feel sympathy for Lou.
- Why?
- 'Cause you were his son.
A man has feelings for his son.
I know there must have been some kind of social convention that somehow kept you apart.
And I don't want to make excuses for that social convention.
Whatever it was, out with it... I mean down with it.
That's bad.
Whatever it was, it was bad.
It's just sad.
How accidental our existences are, really, and how full of influence by circumstance.
I wonder if I'll ever find out... exactly what happened that night in Penn Station.
For years, I thought maybe my father hadn't really died, that he was out there somewhere living a parallel life.
I suppose that was because he left no physical evidence that he'd ever been in our house, not even a bow tie hanging in the closet.
I remember my father's hands.
Sometimes that's all I could see when he would sit on my bed and tell me stories about his childhood late at night.
He said he was born on an island with a castle on it off the coast of
Estonia in 1901 or 1902.
He wasn't sure which.
He came on a steamboat to Philadelphia with his family in 1906.
They were very poor, but Lou was good at art and music.
His drawings won prizes, and he made money playing piano in the silent movie houses.
He told me Philadelphia was a city where a small boy could find what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.
I went back to the neighborhood in north Philadelphia to find the places he always talked about.
The whole family lived on the top floor of a tenement.
And when a wealthy lady gave Lou a piano, there was no room left for his bed.
So he slept on the piano.
They couldn't afford pencils for him to draw with, but that was okay, because you could make charcoal by burning sticks in the backyard.
The kids teased him and called him 'Scarface', so he waited until the last bell to go to school.
There was a girl he loved named Ada, but she loved someone else.
The next part of the story he didn't talk about much, so I have to rely on the architecture books.
He won a scholarship to the
University of Pennsylvania and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1924.
In 1930, he married Esther Israeli, and their daughter, Sue Ann, was born ten years later.
Esther worked in a medical lab and supported the family throughout the '30s and '40s as Lou struggled to get commissions and to find a style he could call his own.
It was the era of the new modern architecture: sleek steel skyscrapers and houses defined by walls of glass.
Lou tried to design that way, but it never felt right.
In 1947, with Esther's help, he started his own office with several men and one woman.
He was almost 50 years old and still hadn't found himself.
I wanted to show you some sketches I made when I was... when
I was in Rome.
Then in 1951, he was invited to be architect in residence at the American Academy in Rome and to travel throughout the ancient world.
What he saw changed his life.
These are the sketches I made a long time ago in Egypt, you see.
Timelessness, monumentality.
That's what mattered.
When Lou got back, he finally knew what he wanted to do: build modern buildings that had the feel and presence of ancient ruins.
He'd also become deeply involved with the woman working in the office, a young architect named Anne Tyng.
She's the mother of my half sister, Alex.
Lou was not a domestic person.
Let's face it. He never was. And...
He lived, really, in the office, you know?
He had his bench where he would take catnaps, and he even sent his laundry out from the office. I mean, he was really... and, of course, I know that he crossed his home address off on his... on his passport.
That's why they had a hard time locating his... in letting people know that they found him dead in 30th Street Station.
- Penn Station, New York.
- Penn Station.
My mother always said that Lou had crossed off the address because he planned to leave Esther and come marry her.
I don't think he was capable of doing that.
I mean, I'm sorry but
I really can't see him doing something like that.
I realized he was not about to do that.
He always said that work was the most important thing, that you cannot depend on human relations, that, really, work is the only thing you can count on.
Did you fall in love with him right away? Lou?
- Sure, yeah.
- Why?
Well, he had tremendous charm.
I mean, he was charismatic, and he was very accessible and very endearing to people.
And when you got pregnant, were you surprised?
Oh, yeah, it was a physical shock.
But that didn't seem to change his idea of what he was going to do. And he just would say,
"Well, you have to be philosophical about it."
So, I mean, I could spend the rest of my life being philosophical, but there was not much point in that. You know,
I had to do something.
And if he's not going to do something about marrying me, it's time I moved on.
But in spite of myself I...
I mean, when I left him, I didn't...
I didn't really want to.
So...
Next to arrive on track five is the scheduled Buffalo to Trenton.
Looking at Anne on that platform,
I kept thinking of my own mother.
Neither one of them ever got married.
They both live alone.
They were both single mothers when being a single mother was a major scandal, and they both believed in my father completely.
Anne left Philadelphia in 1953 and went to Rome for a year to have Alex in secret.
Lou wrote many letters to her while she was away.
"Dearest Annie,
"last night, I dreamt about you.
"I was in our office telephoning.
"You walked in and mentioned to me
"that you could wait no longer.
"Your eyes somehow were black and flashing,
"looking at me reprehensively.
"Annie, Annie, I think of you always.
"I miss so much our meetings together.
"I hope nothing changes about our way of life."
Well, of course, it would change.
When Anne returned, she collaborated with Lou on a small community center and bathhouse in Trenton, New Jersey.
It was Lou's first chance to fully apply his ideas about ancient architecture.
Anne is 80 now and hasn't been back to Trenton in 40 years.
Well, how do you go in?
- I think we go right in there,
I think. - Is this a door?
- Looks like it's boarded up.
- Was it not like that?
No, this was never closed like this.
Oh, there's a lock here.
- Hello?
- Hello?
Is it open?
Oh, hooray.
Thank you.
- Hi, I'm sorry about the holdup.
- Thank you.
- Let me get out of your way.
- Thank you very much.
Do you... do you know Anne Tyng?
- No. Hi, Rob Frey.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- An honor to meet you.
- Anne was the... the architect with Lou on the project.
- Unbelievable.
- Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay.
If it's okay if we just want to look around?
Oh, absolutely.
Gosh.
- It's painted now, huh?
- Terrible.
I mean, it's just such a shame.
"Dearest Annie,
"I must build one of the great buildings of the time.
"You must help me build this particular building.
"I doubt if I can do it without you.
"Just think how low architecture has gotten down.
"We, Anne, you and I, are going to show them the way.
"All my love, Lou."
Do you think this building was very important for Lou?
Well, he says so himself, you know, that the world discovered him when he built the Richards building, but he had discovered himself when he built that little concrete-block bathhouse in Trenton.
So that... that says it,
I think, right there how significant he felt it was.
Do you think about him a lot now?
Well, he's kind of there, you know?
Don't need to think about him.
- Part of you?
- Well, he's there.
He's there in you, he's in Alex, you know...
He's in his buildings. And...
And I think the ideas that you work on together connect you always somehow, you know?
Lou split up with Anne when Alex was about three and then got involved with my mother a few years later in 1959.
In spite of everything,
Anne has always felt that we're all connected and that we are, in some strange way, a family.
I wonder if Lou thought of it that way.
Or was each relationship an entirely new beginning?
The question is often asked, "Why isn't Lou Kahn
"working directly in the work which the government is doing in the actual rebuilding of
Philadelphia at this moment?"
I see it still as being the most useful plan, yes, and the most expressive.
It's the most expressive and the most useful.
Uh, yes.
Expressive.
I repeatedly made the effort to involve Lou directly in our work in Philadelphia, but it's turned out that the special quality of his genius could not be brought together with the reality of the problem.
I'd always heard that Ed Bacon was Lou's nemesis in Philadelphia.
Bacon was in charge of rebuilding the entire downtown area in the '50s and '60s, and he hired Lou to come up with plans for how the job should be done.
But something had gone very wrong.
We started work, and
I wanted to communicate to the stupid public in the most acerbic fashion I possibly could the essence of the idea.
And Lou would say,
"Wouldn't it be nice to put a curving stairway here?
Or how about kind of a little tower here?"
And suddenly,
I realized that the purity... of my communication was being encrusted by Lou's fantasies.
So Lou didn't get it?
Lou didn't understand what you wanted?
He didn't understand it.
He did not understand it.
And so he was angry as could be angry.
And he got nice ladies to give tease, where they would complain about me not using Lou Kahn for this purpose.
By the way, there's not a single shred of any way in which
Lou influenced downtown Philadelphia.
Nothing, I know.
Isn't that a tragedy?
Well, I tell you one thing.
It's... thank... would have been an incredible tragedy if they had built one single thing that Lou proposed for downtown Philadelphia.
They were all brutal, totally insensitive, totally impractical. The whole idea of doing circular garages up on Vine Street...
Yeah, but the idea of leaving the cars outside the city and then letting people walk into the city...
- it was a great idea, don't you think?
- No!
It absolutely wasn't.
It wouldn't have worked for a damn.
So ultimately, isn't it just two strong men... two strong egos that don't get together?
God damn it, no.
It's an absolutely pure ignorance on Lou's part, and it's the same damn ignorance as the American Institute of
Architects is based on now, that you have no responsibility to preparing the way for a system on the larger order, and you only do the little things that come along.
So you simply have not understood a word I've said.
Watch where you're going!
Some of Lou's ideas were utopian and impractical, but this was the '60s.
And like a lot of people then, he was questioning the way we live.
Do we really want the skyline of every American city to look more or less the same?
Why can't people leave their cars outside the city and walk instead?
To express is to drive.
And when you want to give something presence, you have to consult nature.
And there is where design comes in.
If you think of brick, for instance, you say to brick, "What do you want, brick?"
And brick says to you,
"I'd like an arch."
And if you say to brick,
"Look, arches are expensive,
"and I can use a concrete lintel over you.
"What do you think of that, brick?"
Brick says, "I'd like an arch."
And it's important, you see, that you honor the material which you use.
You don't bandy it around as though you said,
"Well, we have a lot of material around.
We can do it one way; we can do it another."
It's not true.
You can only do it if you honor the brick and glorify the brick instead of just shortchanging it.
I remember hearing him talk at Penn.
And I came home, and I said to my father and mother,
"I just met this man.
"He doesn't have much work, and he's
"sort of ugly... funny voice,
"and he's a teacher at school.
"I know you've never heard of him,
"but just mark this day
"that someday you will hear of him,
"because he's really an amazing man."
Tell me the story of Philadelphia.
What was it that stopped
Lou from building more there, from being more successful there?
Because he spoke his truth.
And he was not controllable, and he wouldn't have been controllable by the powers that be that really wanted control of the image of Philadelphia.
They wanted to have
Philadelphia bask in their image or be connected to it or get credit for it in some way.
But really fundamentally why?
It's all the obvious stuff.
Blood was important in Philadelphia.
And I think Lou's blood had a yellow armband.
- Jewish?
- Yes.
I really think so.
I think that was important, even though they might not even have known it was, maybe consciously, I felt it.
I felt it. I felt it.
Frustration and failure are really the things that make you.
Maybe he was made by being short and ugly and Jewish and having a bad voice and not wanting to be good with people, or whatever.
Maybe he was made by that, because it made him go internal.
So you can't just say,
"Oh, isn't it a shame he didn't build more buildings?"
"Isn't it a shame he wasn't this or that person?"
We're made by those things.
I think he had trouble, because he was a mystic, and he wouldn't be able to talk the lingo of the business world.
You know, architecture is so passionless... in the modern movement.
There was no sense of... I mean, it was all mechanical.
And that's why the postmodern thing happened, because people couldn't handle it.
It was just so cold and formless.
And Lou was kind of the breath of fresh air in that, I mean, in America.
And my first works came out of my reverence for him.
Good night.
When Lou's ideas about architecture finally caught on, he had ten years left to live.
Maybe he knew time was running out.
He never said "no" to a lecture invitation... or a possible job, no matter how tired he was or how far he had to go.
If they wanted him, he was there.
One night when Lou came to visit, he made a little book with me: The Book of Crazy Boats.
There was a boat made out of a spoon and one made out of a biscuit, and there was a sausage boat with toothpicks stuck in it to keep it upright in the water.
At the time, I had no idea that he was going to build a crazy boat.
It's a weird-looking thing.
Yeah, we saw that coming in yesterday.
"What the hell is that thing?"
Yeah, it looks like sort of a, you know, Jules Verne thing.
Lou built this boat out of steel.
It's a music barge that motors up to small towns all over the world and opens up into a concert stage.
It was commissioned by a man named Robert Boudreau, who is both the ship's captain and the orchestra conductor.
I didn't tell him that I was Lou's son.
- Hi.
- Hi, Robert. Hi.
- Nice to see you.
- Hi, there.
What are you up to?
Put that damn thing down.
- Yeah, how are you?
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Quite a boat you have here.
- Thanks.
This is that symphony boat to that cruiser in front of us.
I think it might be a good idea if you just moved out until we went in to dock and then came back in.
So, Robert, this boat is very futuristic.
Oh, yeah, people say this thing's from Mars, you know?
You know, I love this boat.
This is my boat, I created it, with Lou.
- So you loved him?
- Oh, yeah.
That's a Louie Kahn doorway for sure, isn't it?
You don't get 'em any better than that.
Isn't that amazing?
Well, take a look.
Take a look over there.
They're having all this light come right through that.
Do you have to go now?
Can you come back, or no?
- No, no, I'm going to go.
- Okay, well, did you know why
I came to see you today?
Well, I'm making a film about Lou.
- Well, I knew that.
- You knew that.
- I knew that.
- But... I'm Lou's son.
God.
I saw you when you were six years old.
I saw you at the wake.
I saw you with your mother.
You remember that day?
What a crazy world.
You are Lou.
Have a nice concert.
- Where's Nathaniel?
- Why'd you get so upset?
Gosh, you love a man... and I knew Lou had a son, and I was told never to tell that Lou had a son.
I don't know.
Lou was... didn't talk about his family much, except about his daughter.
He didn't talk about that.
Men don't talk about those things.
That was his, that was his very personal thing.
We all have those personal things.
Thanks.
"Dear Harriet, I keep thinking
"how your sweet words have helped me
"during these trying days of advice and criticism.
"What will happen is all I still don't know...
"I mean, the hatred of your brothers,
"Abbot and Willie.
"My only hope is that the beauty of new love
"will in some way make them understand.
"Now over me is a heaviness of quiet and incompleteness,
"and I'm still very discouraged by the feeling of ineptness.
"Lou."
Well, we were soul mates,
I would say, and inspired each other so that it was an equal exchange in many ways.
And I was a critic.
I do think that I brought the sense of nature and another sight to Lou's work.
Where did you work in the office?
I worked in a room, and sometimes it was locked.
Why?
Well, because of his wife, who would come in, drop by sometimes.
Sounds fairly... fairly nerve-wracking.
It was nerve-wracking.
It was humiliating in some ways.
When the buildings were created and finished and... for example, the Kimbell Museum.
Everyone went out to the opening, but I was not invited.
I was not allowed to come.
Is it partly because you were a woman or that you were involved with him?
Yes, I think all of those things, yeah.
Didn't you ever say to him,
"Well, why don't you respect me more?
"Why don't you include me in these things
"or make me a part of your"...
Well, you see,
I felt so... so happy and delighted to work on things.
I mean, to work on something like this was just... was just thrilling.
And when... when we were working on projects, we were just completely absorbed with the ideas.
And... and... and there was just great freedom and love of what we were doing.
And so that was the price that I paid.
It was worth it, you know?
My parents met by chance at a party in Philadelphia.
My mother was 32, and Lou was almost 60.
Her family was appalled by the relationship.
And when she got pregnant, she decided to disappear for a while.
She went to stay with her friends,
Charles and Susannah Jones.
They offered to adopt me if she had to give me up.
I was amazed to see this little man that she was so taken with.
And I didn't quite get his number, I have to say.
I mean, he turned on the charm.
And I was sort of a Yankee, and it didn't rub off.
I mean, I didn't get it.
And then it revolved that she was pregnant and that her family really resented that and...
- ... didn't accept...
- No, they didn't.
They didn't accept that.
And time went by, and I said to Charles,
"You know, what's she going to do?
She hasn't made arrangements and the family isn't coming through.
They're making it difficult.
I really think we should do something."
And there was one sister, Edwina, who did stand by her and said, "You know what I can do?
I can provide a man to stand up with you and get married... and give a name to that child, and then you just can get divorced two weeks later."
And Charles and I said,
"No way.
We don't want to have anything to do with that.
That's such a travesty of marriage.
Just go ahead with it and have this baby.
It's going to be all right.
Let him keep his name if you want, or have him take your name.
Don't worry about that."
And I also have to say... that you had to recognize it right at the beginning...
TO BE AND TO HAVE
For Lucie, who hasjust been born
Nice and easy!
That's it, here we go.
We may be lucky!
Typical, a car's coming.
Oh God, l don't believe it!
Hurry up, damn it!
Nice and easy!
Don't let those four through.
Morning.
See you later.
See you later.
- Morning, Jeannot.
- Morning, sonny.
All right?
Good morning, sir!
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand properly!
Start here, Jojo.
And then go down.
Like this? l can do that letter.
Come on.
Sir...
That's good, Létitia, carry on.
You forgot to come back up.
Come back up a bit.
No, Johann, no!
Turn the paper round.
Turn it round.
- Sir...
- Turn it round, please.
Now l do a circle?
Look at the circle.
You should come back up.
You forgot to come back up.
Sir, l...
Stop there.
Now come back down to make a circle.
Sir, l didn't look properly.
- Do it alone up to there.
- Almost done!
Look, sir.
There first.
That's good, Marie.
Look. Start from here.
Mine's better than Létitia's!
Carry on doing that one.
Come back up. Do another stick.
There. Stop.
Come up a bit.
Stop there. What comes next?
- A circle.
- Do it.
No, start a circle from the top.
Finished, sir.
Go on.
Sir, is it this morning or this afternoon now? ls it this morning or this afternoon?
Well? ls it the morning or the afternoon?
The afternoon?
Before the afternoon, what do we do? We...
- Eat!
- We eat.
Have you eaten yet?
- No. So it's...
- The morning.
The morning.
We've come to school.
- What?
- We've come to school.
Until this afternoon.
Have you all finished?
Yes, sir. l want you all to show your work.
- What do we do after?
- Let's look at Jojo's.
- What do you think?
- lt's good.
Good. You could go on... lt's a little bit good.
A little bit good.
What do you think, Jojo?
Look.
- What's it like.
- Good!
You say ''good'',
Marie says ''a little bit good''.
What about you, Létitia?
Good.
And you, Johann?
There may be something missing here.
The stick going down isn't here.
There!
Who's next? Marie?
So? What do you think?
- Good.
- Not good. lt's not good? lt's lots of good.
Lots of good?
- Except for the word ''mother''.
- Can you recognize it? lt's leaning.
Because it goes up and down a bit.
But it's not bad at all, is it?
What do you usually do to go to sleep?
''Close your eyes and...''
Where's our book?
- Here.
- So look here.
We got to ''Close your eyes...''
''Close your eyes''...
''Close your eyes
- ''and co...''
- Count.
''...count...
''the sl...''
- Hold on, where are you?
- ''...sheep...''
Good.
''...in your mind.''
''As long...''
''As long as l...
- ''...doesn't....''
- Don't.
''...don't have any nightmares.''
What's a nightmare?
A nasty nightmare.
A nasty one?
A nasty dream.
Do you ever have nightmares?
What do you see in your nightmares?
What do you see in them?
Ghosts.
Ghosts? l don't dream about ghosts.
Axel's telling me about his nightmares.
Shall we let him?
Can he tell us about them?
Good. So you saw ghosts in your dreams?
And what happened?
- How were they dressed?
- ln white!
Like real ghosts?
Where were you?
Where did it take place?
My bedroom. ln your bedroom?
- So tell me about it.
- At night.
Ghosts come out at night, right?
Do they really exist?
You think they do?
Have you ever seen a real one? l've never seen one!
She's scared...
''Riotous merriment reigned during playtime.
''Riotous merriment...
''reigned...
''during playtime.''
Ready, Nathalie?
Olivier too?
Full stop.
''Half the pupils
''played marbles in the shade of the trees.
''Half the pupils played marbles...
''in the shade of the trees.''
Full stop.
''Others played at horses...
''Others played at horses...''
Wasn't that an imperfect?
We saw it five minutes ago. ls that how you write the imperfect? ls that the imperfect ending?
''Others played at horses
''or at cars...''
Comma.
''Others played at horses or at cars...''
''...marching along...''
''...marching along in an imaginary climb.'' Full stop.
Ready? l didn't say it was over. l only said, ''Full stop.''
Alizé, are you my friend?
Jessie... are you my friend?
Jojo, are you my friend?
- Are you my friend?
- No.
All right, sit down.
Don't you want to work today? l do. l can't hear you.
- l didn't hear.
- l want to!
You want to?
So don't stop now, my boy.
Well?
Have you almost finished? ls there a lot left?
Maybe you can finish without stopping now.
What?
What?
Yes, sir.
That's good, Jojo.
Let's see what you've written.
A quarter.
A quarter. ls that right?
You're asked to write four fractions smaller than one.
What does that mean?
That means... smaller...
Than a unit.
Let's see what you've put.
Thirteen fifths. Correct that.
Finished, Jojo?
The fir tree's finished.
- The...
- Fir tree.
Did you colour the animals in?
The bear and the other two.
- How many are left, then?
- Two more.
Two more?
- Will you do them properly?
- After the bear.
Two more after the bear?
Well, concentrate then.
Good. Now fractions equal to one.
What did we say, Julien?
For a fraction to equal one, it must...
Sausage!
That's enough, Axel!
Have you finished?
Almost.
What's left now? l've done this one, l haven't done this one, l haven't done this one, or this one or this one.
There's still a lot left.
You told me you would finish it.
You told me you'd finish it. lt's playtime soon and you'll have to stay in, Jojo. lf you haven't finished.
Can you speed it up a bit? l won't say it again, all right?
- Just this one left to do.
- Very good.
You two can go out.
Jojo! Don't put your shoes on.
Come here.
You others can go out.
Come here.
Where have you got to with your fish? l'll finish after playtime.
No, that's not what we agreed.
- Tomorrow.
- No, not tomorrow.
- There's no school tomorrow.
- Exactly.
When are you going to do it?
On a school day.
Today's one!
So you have to do it now.
You said you would, you promised.
Have you kept that promise?
Have you finished? ls the fish finished?
So you have to finish it right now.
We've got snowballs too!
Not at me!
Why do you come to school? lt's my mum who... who always wants me to come.
And you wish you didn't have to?
What do you come to school for?
Just to play?
What else?
To do my work.
What's that? What work?
With the teach...
With Tatiana and you.
What do Tatiana and l do?
What do you learn here?
Just how to colour things?
Colouring's important but what else?
Work.
What is work?
What else is there?
Listening...
That's not work.
- What did you do this morning?
- A drawing.
No, on the blackboard.
Loops.
Yes. So, you're learning loops to learn to...
- To what? To write?
- To do sixes.
And what are we learning sixes for?
To do sums.
To know how to count. l can already count to six.
After five, there's six.
- And after six?
- After six, there's seven.
We haven't done that yet.
After seven, there's six...
No after seven, there's eight.
More, more. lt's all right if you spill a bit.
There, that's the flour...
Can you pour the vanilla sugar in?
- All of it?
- Yes.
There.
There. You turn it over and part both halves.
And you put the shell there. lt's Alizé's turn to break an egg now.
Come on, are you ready?
There! lt's broken!
Straight in.
That's good! Broken and in the bowl.
Perfect. Jessie now. lt's supposed to go in the bowl. lt doesn't matter. lt doesn't matter.
All right, here l go!
- Take the plunge!
- Go, Julien! l knew it! lt's cooking on the floor!
Good!
Not like that. Look...
Try doing it like this.
Almost there, Guillaume!
Good!
Well done, Guillaume!
Can l try another after? lt's slippery. Go faster!
Out of the way!
Olivier!
Olivier didn't get far.
Look out!
Yeah, Nathalie!
Do it like before, Nathalie.
Move your fingers and make it turn.
A bit more...
There. Good.
What do we draw now?
A radius.
Two of them!
That's called the dia...
The dia... You can't remember?
The diameter!
Come on, draw a diameter.
Finished, Nathalie?
What do you do next?
What do you call this section just here?
- The diameter or the radius?
- The radius.
So you take the radius and copy it how many times?
Four.
Put your age.
How old are you?
Four and a half.
The glass is broken!
The little one there...
And the big one there.
He took one of my erasers!
Him there!
No, it's mine.
An eraser... that was mine.
- Five plus one?
- Six!
And plus two?
- Eight!
- Write eight. l want us to talk about your argument and that fight at playtime to try to see what it means so it doesn't happen again.
There's no sense in it.
You're here in the same class. lt's a tiny class and still you fight. lf you have anything to say, say it now.
Say what you have to say and we'll try to sort things out.
Well?
Do you have anything to say, Julien?
Olivier?
How did it all start?
What happened?
Well, we were playing, at tag...
We caught him, he fell and hurt his back.
Then he caught the little ones and hurt them so we stepped in...
Then he got up and started attacking us all.
You were angry, then?
Was it right to blame the little ones? lt wasn't their fault.
Was that right or not?
All right.
And can you avoid that?
How about Julien? l mean, you fought a long time.
At first, you tested each other, round and round...
But then things degenerated, didn't they?
Well?
What do you think? l let go. l let go of him, see...
But after, he wouldn't let go.
Why wouldn't you let go?
You have to talk now to get it out of the way.
What was it that made you refuse to let go?
You wanted to show you were as strong as him?
That's probably true, isn't it?
Did you put up a fight or was it hard at times?
Sometimes...
Really? Sometimes it was?
That's how it is. Sometimes, you're stronger, sometimes he is.
You're the same age and size, you're both strong and you wanted to show one another how strong you are.
But does there have to be a winner? ls there any sense in it? ls it important for you?
Maybe it's less important for him since he let go first. l know this has been building up for a few days.
What started it?
You get on well at times and not at all at others.
Shall we talk about it? ls there a reason, Olivier?
What's your problem with Julien?
Come on, let's talk about it calmly.
What's the problem?
You can tell him now.
Tell him in front of me.
What don't you like about him?
- lt's when he insults me...
- He insults you.
You see, Julien, the words you say can hurt him more that when you attack him physically.
That's important for him.
He doesn't like it when you say things like that. lt's easy to insult someone. lt's totally gratuitous.
A word, a nice one or a nasty one, is easy to say.
But it can hurt someone a lot.
Perhaps Olivier feels hurt by the words that you or others may have said recently. ls that it, Olivier?
Can we stop all that?
One other thing. You're in a class with younger children.
The example you're giving them isn't a very good one.
You should be showing them that we can get along as friends and work together. l think that's better.
Don't you think so too?
What? What did you say?
Like before.
There's a song about good old times. lt was like that here too. l don't see why that should end.
From now until you leave, we need to find a more peaceful atmosphere.
What shall we do, Julien?
Work in that direction?
Do you feel that you can do it?
- Good. You too?
- Me too.
Seven times zero?
Seven times zero, zero.
Plus four, four.
Next.
Seven times zero, zero.
Don't look at me.
- Seven times one, seven.
- Good. Put it down.
Three times six... Twelve.
Eighteen!
- Watch where you put the eight.
- There.
Really? That's brilliant.
No, that one's a zero.
Carry on!
Three times six, eighteen.
Eight down, one to carry.
Three times zero, zero.
Plus one, one.
Three times zero, zero.
Three times one, one.
You want to copy it out a hundred times?
Three times one... Three.
Carry on!
- l've finished.
- What? lsn't that a five?
Five times six...
Twenty-five?
Recite the five times table.
Five times one, five, five times two, ten...
Five times three, fifteen, five times four, twenty.
Five times five, twenty-five.
Five times six, thirty....
- Five times seven?
- Five times seven, thirty-five.
Five times eight...
Forty!
Five times nine, forty-five, five times ten, fifty.
All right. l'm waiting.
Where does it go? Watch it...
There.
Where?
There.
You want a slap?
What's after the point?
Three figures.
- And before it?
- Another three.
Get your uncle to help you!
Two sixes...
Two times six slaps is how many?
Two times six...
- Six and six?
- Twelve.
Two times six, twelve.
He's peeking in his book!
Don't forget to carry over.
Two times six, twelve.
Plus four...
- l'm lost...
- l'm lost too.
There's a mistake there.
He hasn't shifted it.
You forgot this thingummy. lt should go here.
Here? ls that a four?
So the four goes here, the three here... and the eight here.
There's something wrong now.
- Where am l?
- l don't get it.
He has to shift it after.
Otherwise...
Where are you at?
Two times...
Nine, eighteen. He said that.
Two times nine, eighteen...
Two times...
Two times six, twelve.
Plus four...
What's up?
Two nines, eighteen.
One to carry. Put down eight and carry one over.
Two times six, twelve.
And one, thirteen.
Three down, one to carry.
Two times six, twelve.
And one, thirteen.
Three down...
There's a mistake somewhere.
Look...
Here. Two times two, four.
Two times zero, zero...
Two times four, eight.
No, it's right.
Two times two, four...
Two times nine, eighteen. lt's right.
Eighteen.
Eight down, one to carry.
Two sixes, twelve.
Plus one, thirteen. Move your finger.
That's right.
Three down, one to carry.
Twelve. Plus one, thirteen.
Three down, one to carry.
Two ones?
- Two ones?
- Two. Plus one, three.
Okay, that's it!
- No, it's not! lt's not right!
- Why?
- Because it's out by two figures.
- All the way along.
- So? That's normal!
- No way. ln you go.
Stand up straight before you sit.
Sit down.
The teacher will give us some and we'll stick them in.
Yes, because he gives the orders.
We don't give the orders, you give them, sir.
Yes, but when we grow up, we'll order our children around.
Exactly! Maybe you'll be a teacher one day too?
You'll order your pupils around.
Would you like that?
You too?
Me too, l want to do the same as you.
The same as me?
You want to be a teacher?
- l want to be a motorcycle cop.
- How about you?
What do you want to do, Létitia?
She wants to be a vet.
A vet? What's a vet?
A doctor for animals.
You want to look after animals?
So you want to be a veterinarian?
A farmer gives the vet his sick animals.
And what does Jessie want to be?
A teacher.
Teacher.
Teacher?
Mister Jojo!
And a motorcycle cop.
What would you do if you were a teacher?
What do teachers do?
They make the big ones, first years and kindergarten work.
Big ones, first year and kindergarten?
All at once?
No, not all at once.
One after another? l'll finish it later. lt's lopsided.
Like this. lt's leaning like that. lt's like this.
Look, l'll show you. lt leans like this. ls it leaning too far?
Can you show us how, Marie?
That's good.
Very good. Go on.
Go on, Alizé.
Want me to do the dots for you?
Go on.
Good.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
What comes after six?
What comes next?
What did you draw just now?
What was that red one?
What did we learn today?
She can't remember?
Let's try Alizé or Marie, then.
What was the new number we just learned?
Seven.
Who does seven come after?
After?
Six? lt comes... lt comes after nine.
All right...
We haven't learned nine yet.
After six!
Six.
One, two, three, four, five, six...
- And then comes?
- Seven.
What comes after six?
Marie just said it.
Wake up, will you?
Seven!
Count again now.
Six.
What did Marie say after six?
She said?
Seven.
We have to help her.
Move, Cocotte!
Move, Joyeuse!
Read this first...
Then you'll be able to do it.
Her spelling is perfect. ln a dictation, she always tells me where to put the accents.
The others are always impressed.
There again, for mathematics, it's the opposite... ln mathematics, she needs...
You have to help her along. l don't know how you explain it but l explain it to her the way l learned it.
That's a good way too. lt's not easy though. l can tell she's lost at times.
Then l think l got it wrong. l say to Pascal,
''Tell her your way, maybe she'll understand better.
''lt must be the words l use, so you explain.'' l told my brother, Alain,
''You're younger, maybe you know equations better.''
He said he didn't learn that way either. l tell her to do as usual and let Mr Lopez correct it. l hope we'll understand then because we're at a loss. lf you were totally available, l don't think it would change. l don't think so.
That's how it is.
She feels freer with people from the outside... than with her parents.
Well now, this may be hard to say...
- l don't think this is true of you - but you mustn't take offence at this as a mother because her development is what counts.
She could be happier. l mean, she isn't...
So, in a way, if she seems less close to you, l'd say it's just a transition.
A necessary one.
What seems most important to me is to see her develop and be happy, even if she's a bit more distant with you. lt must be hard for you.
True, it's not easy.
But we've got used to her being distant from us, often off by herself, alone.
What surprised me was when she spoke to me out of the blue.
Out of the blue? l thought l was hearing things, that it wasn't her.
Then we carried on talking for part of playtime like that. lt was wonderful. l can believe that if you hear her voice all of a sudden, it makes you wonder.
As a matter of fact, she's Gemini like me.
But we're not at all alike.
Usually, they say that Geminis have a hidden side.
The ascendants must be different. lt's true, she tends to live... ln another world. ln her own world.
Let's correct the dictation.
Everyone ready?
Another dictation... l was saying that to myself.
''Another dictation.'' l just realized that it's been thirty-five years since l started giving dictations.
You've been here for thirty-five years? l've been here for twenty years.
- That's not bad.
- You're right.
How many dictations have l given?
A thousand... Two...
- More?
- Three hundred!
More than that?
Five hundred! l've never counted them.
The amount doesn't matter. l still have another year and a half of dictations to do.
Why? ls the school closing? l'm going to stop giving dictations.
You're stopping it all.
No more mathematics, no more vocabulary, no more reading.
We'll go on strike, then.
No, you won't be here any longer.
Will you be able to keep on teaching pupils?
Help them understand their homework?
Of course, a lot of teachers do that.
They take the time, the free time that they have and devote it, in the evenings, to helping children with homework.
But... l don't know.
There's a lot l want to do.
Like go to Tahiti?
- Not particularly.
- lt's expensive. ls Tahiti better than this place?
No, this place is better.
But there's no sea here.
You've got sea in Brittany.
- Will you live upstairs?
- Where?
Upstairs. l don't know yet.
That would be nice.
Perhaps l'll have to move out too.
Why?
Perhaps the new teacher will need to live at the school.
Why not nearby? l'll have to give up my house. lf the new one lives nearby?
We'll have to wait and see.
But, in theory, l'll be leaving.
You'll be at middle school.
Are they clean?
They were even dirtier earlier.
Do you think they're clean now?
You scrubbed them to get them clean?
- So what do you need to do?
- Scrub them.
- How?
- With soap.
With soap, yes.
And the sponge. l want to see sparkling clean hands. l can't reach the sponge.
Look, there's one behind you.
Two, in fact.
There. And don't slam the door on your way out.
You can leave it open. l saw a wasp.
Go and wash your hands, please.
There!
There, you see. l'll dry them on the cloth now.
Just a second.
Sir, look. The thumb...
The tiny finger and thumb are washed.
Let me see.
There's a bit left on the thumb.
On the little finger!
The thumb's here.
What do you call this one?
The in... dex!
- The...
- Miggle finger.
- The ring..
- Finger.
The li...
- The lit...
- Litre!
The little finger!
He said little?
No, he said litre!
All done? l just need to rub them on the cloth.
There's a bit left on the thumb.
There!
There's some pen on my forehead too.
On your forehead?
How do you know? You can't see.
No, but Laura told me.
She did?
Those are clean hands. ls that okay too?
Nearly all gone.
Go and dry off.
We've got a ball like that in our car...
And the other side?
That's clean.
The forehead's clean too.
We've got a ball like this.
We're going to keep it here.
That's good.
Try to stay clean now.
All clean.
Do you feel better now?
Can l wash my hands now?
Wait a second...
Wait.
That wasp that was outside is in the corridor. lt was in the corridor? lt went to the door and back.
Maybe to see what you were up to? lt came and went... lt was wondering,
''ls Jojo washing his hands?
''Does he still have ink on them?''
Was it wondering that? lt was looking at me like this when l washed my forehead.
Really?
Maybe it wanted a closer look.
Maybe it wanted to sting me.
Cléo!
Quick, close the gate!
No, l'm doing it!
Hurry!
Jessie, pull it back! l'm doing it!
Both of us!
Out of the way, Johann!
Out of the way!
Cut it out, l'm doing it!
Cut it out!
Are you crazy?
Just cut it out! l won't be able to go skating now.
What's wrong, Jojo?
Why did you push me?
Come on, we'll tell the teacher.
- What happened?
- He just pushed me!
- Who?
- Johann!
- He pushed you?
- ln the grass.
Johann! Come here.
What did you do? l pushed Jojo.
Why did you... Come here.
Why did you push him?
Come here.
Why do you push him?
- l don't know.
- You don't know? ls that a nice thing to do?
So don't do it again! lf he pushes you, what will you say?
Will you be pleased?
So don't do it, then.
Apologize to him. l'm sorry, Jojo.
Louder. We didn't hear. l'm sorry, Jojo.
There. All right now, Jojo?
Play a bit more.
And don't argue again.
My father always said that the ground was a long way down.
He knew what he was saying!
He was a farmhand for a long time before moving on and getting his own plot of land.
Above all, he didn't want me to do the same job as him.
When l helped him, l could see how hard it was.
That decided me to do something else.
Where was he from originally?
My father was of Spanish origin.
He was what's known as an emigrant.
He had come to France young and worked a lot on building sites until... until he met my mother and settled in France for good.
When he decided to become French, in fact.
He hardly ever returned home, back to Andalucia.
What made you want to be a teacher? l wanted to from an early age, from when l first went to school. l liked being at school a lot. l liked it so much l'd spend the days off playing the teacher for all the children around me, even those my age. l had a group of cousins that l used to teach like that and l really enjoyed it.
That enjoyment stayed with me and l don't think l could have done any other job.
Even now, l realize, on the verge of retirement, that l love this work with the children. lt takes time and personal involvement and the wonderful thing is the children return it.
They return it over and over.
Your parents must have been proud of you.
For them, a son who wanted to teach was a step up.
And they fuelled that desire, even going so far as to make serious financial efforts. l felt somehow that l was obliged to succeed.
For their sake too.
Are they still alive? l lost my father the year l arrived here, in Auvergne. l got here just after.
My mother still lives down south.
''Do you hear...
''those strange sounds?
''ln the night...
- ''the floord...
- The floorb...
''The floorboards... squeak...
''A sh...''
Shutter.
''cr...''
Creaks.
''The cat meows,
''the rain...
''f...''
Falls.
''A b...''
Dog.
''A dog barks.''
Close it!
Close it!
Wait, it's the wrong way round. lt's no good.
Put it in the bin.
Come back here, Marie.
Another bad one.
Maybe like this?
Let me try to understand. l know what we can try.
No, stop doing it. l understand... l understand now. lt's because there's no more paper!
No, you're doing it upside down.
Yes, l'm doing it upside down.
- No, not like that.
- Stop shoving me!
Not like that! lt's upside down!
Cut it out, Marie!
Not like that. lt's upside down.
You won't understand either.
When the friend's a boy,
''ami'', we use this one.
You have the A, the M and the l.
When it's a girl, as in,
''Létitia is Jojo's friend,'' we use the one with the E at the end, okay?
When it's masculine, a boy, masculine, we use ''ami'' with the l and when it's feminine, when it's a girl, we use ''amie'', with an E at the end.
Shall l show you again?
- Who do l use this for?
- A boy.
- And this one?
- A girl.
- Have you done your sentences?
- l have.
All right, Marie, read yours now.
''Marie...
''and her friend...
''her friend Jessie.''
That's good. ls it right?
What have you written, Jojo?
''Daddy
''and his friend Jojo.''
Can you say that?
Can you say that?
''Létitia...
''and
''friend...''
Her...
''Jojo.''
No, that's no good.
You have to put
''her'' before ''friend''.
The ''friend'' goes next to ''Jojo''.
That's right.
''Her'' before ''friend''.
Move the ''her'' round.
Yes, that's it.
Over to you now, Johann.
''Johann...
''and...''
His...
''pal...''
Pal? l didn't give you the ''pal'' card.
Friend.
''Johann and...''
He doesn't recognize it.
''His''.
Friend.
Go on, now we've told you.
''...his pal...''
Where's he getting ''pal'' from? lt's not ''pal'', it's ''friend''.
''...friend daddy.''
All right. lf you say ''mummy'' instead, what do you change?
Pal, in the feminine.
No, friend!
We didn't get to pal yet.
Who's coming here next year?
Julien and...
And who else? Olivier.
Nathalie and Jonathan are going to a school in lssoire.
Recognize these cows?
- They're Limousines.
- No, Salers.
Call yourself an expert?
You got it wrong.
Don't you recognize the Salers' lyre-shaped horns?
Did you recognize them?
Here you have books on music.
There, all the books about art, the plastic arts, drawing, sculpture, photography...
Here, the books about animals and here all the geography and history books. ln the first year of middle school, you have one hour a week in the library, working with the librarian.
We have lots of books, lots of magazines here.
We have computers.
You need to learn your way around or you won't be able to find the book you need.
How far can we count up to?
A hundred.
A hundred then.
Are there other numbers after that?
Can we keep going?
How far?
To a thousand.
Can you go further than a thousand?
A thousand and one, a thousand and two...
- A thousand and three...
- We can go further.
How far can we go after?
Up until...
Can we go beyond a thousand and four?
And five!
Can we go even further?
Can we say a thousand and twenty-one?
Can we say that, Jojo?
We can.
How far can we go after that?
Can we keep on counting?
Without stopping?
Can we say two thousand?
- Three thousand?
- Three thousand, four thousand...
Five thousand.
Six thousand.
- Seven thousand.
- Seven thousand, eight, nine...
Ten thousand.
Twenty thousand.
Thirty thousand.
Forty thousand.
Fifty thousand.
Sixty thousand.
Seventy thousand.
- Eighty...
- Thousand.
Ninety...
Thousand.
- After ninety...
- One hundred thousand!
Can we go beyond that?
We have to stop there?
We can't go on counting?
One billion.
What's next? Two...
Two billion, three billion, four billion, five billion... eight billion...
Can you say twelve billion?
Fifteen billion... lt's like when you pay with notes.
With notes?
Do you have a lot of notes in your piggy bank?
- Only two.
- Two isn't bad.
Can you go beyond billions?
Sir, look at all the animals...
Yes, they're good.
Can you go beyond billions? lt stops there?
You told me we could count forever.
Can we go on counting?
You think not?
- Jessie's crying, sir.
- She's crying?
Has she hurt herself?
- What do you think is wrong?
- Her nose.
Axel's hurt Jessie and she's crying too.
Jessie's crying?
Hand me your plate, please.
Want some sauce?
Hold out your plate.
Want some fish?
There's no bones in it.
Want some sauce? l don't want any!
Let's give it to your friend then.
Have a biscuit. l have to move along?
Look out!
We won't know until the end of June if you're in or not, so you'll need to work hard.
Just because you're moving up to middle school, that doesn't mean you can stop now.
You'll have to remember whatever comes next so it can help you next year.
At least l think so.
Don't slacken off now.
Who's that?
How's your father doing?
He's okay. ls he home?
Everything's okay, then?
- What?
- Yes and no.
What do you mean, yes and no?
He's not totally cured.
Does he have to go back?
So he's resting at home for now?
You know why he's going back?
Does he have to go back?
Do you know why?
He'll be okay after, won't he?
He has to go back one more time, then it's over.
He'll rest a bit, then he'll be fine.
Has he been home for long?
Yes, since...
A week now?
- Three weeks.
- Three weeks already?
Since the first operation?
Do you know what they'll do next?
Remove his larynx.
Remove what?
- What are they removing?
- His larynx.
So that's where it was?
They'll keep on treating him after, won't they?
Sickness is part of life.
You try to stay healthy but then along it comes and you have to live with it.
Take a deep breath, Nathalie. l don't believe it...
Come on, Nathalie!
Well done! l felt a drop of rain!
Ouch! l felt a drop in my hair!
You can see them. lt's raining.
A drop just landed on my foot!
Come on! Axel and Alizé!
Are you ready?
Hold your satchel over your head!
Ready? Let's go!
Quick, Alizé, hurry!
Axel, wait!
Hurry up, Alizé!
Here l come!
''Soon...'' Comma.
''it will be time...''
Okay, Olivier?
''Soon, it will be time...
''for the performance...''
How does it manage to turn? lt follows the rails, remember. ltjust keeps going.
What does derail mean?
Haven't you ever seen a derailed train on TV?
When it falls on its side.
Alizé, want to try some?
Quick, it's runny. lt's runny! l'm full.
You ate too fast?
Hey, that's my hat!
Alizé!
Alizé!
Here she is!
Go on in, this is your school.
Here's Valentin back here.
Do you know everybody?
Sit down. l'll introduce your friends.
The big ones first.
This is Nathalie.
Julien...
Guillaume...
Jonathan and Olivier, the big ones.
But only Guillaume will be left next year.
This is Axel.
And this is Laura, like you.
We'll have two Lauras.
- That's Jojo!
- Yes, you know Jojo.
Come along, you little ones.
This is Johann...
Jojo...
Létitia...
Jessie, with the little thing in her hair.
Over there, Marie...
Do you know Marie?
Have you seen your sister Marie?
And this is Alizé.
Léa. l'm Thomas.
Océane.
What's your name?
What's your name?
Tell them your name.
My name is... What?
Valentin.
Here we have another Valentin.
That makes two Valentins and two Lauras as well.
- Where was your old school?
- Le Vernet.
The school in Le Vernet.
You'll be with Laura and Axel next year.
There'll just be the three of you.
Did you already know Laura?
You didn't... l knew her.
You know everyone, don't you?
Do you want to sit with your friends over there?
Do you want to play?
Marie and Létitia, can you show them the games?
Go and play Valentin.
Show him how to play.
What's the matter, Valentin? ls something wrong?
Mummy...
She'll be here soon.
What do you want to do?
Mummy...
Your mummy's coming for you later, okay?
Stay here with us a while and then she'll come for you.
Look, everyone else is here.
They're not crying.
Valentin!
Your sister's here.
Want to sit next to her?
Do you want do draw something?
Do you want to play?
- What do you want?
- l want my mummy!
She's gone for a walk outside but she'll be back for you soon. l'll put you down to play here.
Your mummy will be here soon but not just yet.
Do you want to sit by Océane?
Stay with Océane.
Can you look after your brother?
She's coming back.
You have to wait here.
Wait for her.
Océane's waiting nice and quietly.
She's playing, so is Valentin.
Do you want to play too?
Do you some?
Play with him, Alizé.
Play with Valentin.
You too, Marie.
He doesn't want to?
Leave him, then.
She's hasn't left, she's waiting. l want to see her!
You're going to see her.
But not just yet.
Don't shout like that.
She's coming for you later.
Want to play with a car?
She's coming later.
She isn't lost, she's here.
The time has come to talk about your results and to see if you move up next year.
All right, Julien...
Even though your results aren't totally satisfactory, we're sending you up to middle school.
You'll be going to that school we went to visit, the one in St Germain l'Herm, for next year.
But you'll have to knuckle down straightaway.
As l said, your results aren't totally satisfactory so maybe there's room for improvement. ln what subjects?
Mathematics.
- ls that all?
- And French.
You have your work cut out with maths and French. l think you need to improve your attitude.
You won't have a teacher who can look after you personally anymore.
And the punishment can be harsher, according to your attitude when you refuse, when you argue or when you don't agree.
When you couldn't care less.
You make it obvious.
When you sigh... l won't be there to help.
Maybe l can help from afar but l won't be there.
Now then, Olivier...
Off to St Germain too.
Are you pleased?
Like Julien, you'll need to improve your results. l've asked them to make someone available to help you with the class work to bring you up to scratch in the subjects where you're lagging behind. lt'll be just the two of you.
Since you'll be together, try to get along better.
What are you going to do?
Stick together.
All right but don't let yourselves get isolated.
Maybe you can defend each other.
Some of them will try to beat you up at first. lt happens.
You're as strong as an ox, Julien. lf Olivier's in trouble... if he's getting attacked, maybe you could get stuck in. ln any case, you're no wimp either.
You can stand up for yourself.
Now then, what's the problem?
You want to keep your own company?
Or is it just that you can't manage to talk to others?
Shall l tell you what l think? l think you can do it but don't really feel like it for now.
Am l wrong? ls that right or not quite?
Do you mind talking about it?
We have to talk about it.
You talk a lot more with me and the others now.
But it's still hard for you at times. l've noted that so your new teachers will know that it's hard for you. l had to tell them.
Don't you think so?
Was l wrong to say that? Tell me. l was right to let them know so they can keep an eye on you. ls that right? l think you'll be okay, Nathalie.
With a bit of effort, everything will be fine.
You'll be with older children, you'll make new friends... lt'll be much better.
We have to say goodbye one day. ls that what's bothering you? ls that it?
All l wanted... was to carry on... helping you by letting your teachers know.
You'll work hard, l know.
You like work.
Do you think you'll need someone to help you with this problem of not being able to communicate? ls it important?
Were we right to talk about it?
Do you feel better now?
You can still come and talk to me.
Next year.
Do you have school on Saturdays?
Come and see me then.
Would you like to come over then? l'll expect you every Saturday.
You'll come, won't you?
You can tell me all about middle school, things l don't know... l'm here and l don't know what they do there.
You can tell me all about it and show me your work.
You'll tell me how you're doing...
You can come here with Létitia.
That way, we'll still see one another. ls everyone ready?
Good. l stopped before you lowered your hands.
You shouldn't have. l stopped at the same time.
You're going to leave now. lt's the last time that you'll leave this year.
Goodbye, sir!
Can't you stop?
Goodbye, sir.
Enjoy the holidays!
Enjoy the holidays.
Goodbye, Johann.
Goodbye, Marie.
Létitia, goodbye. l'll hold onto these two.
Goodbye, Laura.
Goodbye, Axel. l have to get up for you.
Goodbye, Nathalie.
Work hard next year.
Bye. See you around.
Goodbye, sir.
Goodbye, Jonathan.
Enjoy the holidays.

[But for the person I tried to reach,] he'll pick it up, and I'll be able to talk to him.
I try to be responsible, but it's hard.
If you worry about what you're saying,
I get writer's block.
Kind of like, "I can't say that.
That's too harsh. Can't say this."
I have to block it out and trust my heart that I'm doing the right thing.
Pretty spit...
I was spitting.
- Chill out. Chill out.
- That's my style. That's my new style.
- That's my new style.
- 'Pac, chill out.
That's my new style.
Hey, have a good summer.
Have a good summer, bitch!
But I'm not saying
I didn't make mistakes.
Like some of the things I said when
I was fighting the Hughes brothers.
I beat up the directors to Menace II Society.
- All right, tell them why you did that.
- These chump, punk, slump...
- You'll be able to rebuttal to that.
- No, they better come now.
Check this out, they fired me in a roundabout, punk, snitch way.
So I caught them on the streets and beat they behinds.
I was a menace to the
Hughes brothers. It ain't over!
I still got more for you chumps!
I read what you said about me!
I'm gonna kick their ass!
My big mouth.
Mind y'all business, I'll mind mine.
I do what I gotta do, you do what you gotta do.
Long as I give you 12 tracks, you give me my $12, and we even.
I don't gotta be a role model.
I don't gotta hold your hand.
I don't gotta do shit.
My big mouth.
I got a big mouth, can't help it.
- I talk from my heart, I'm real.
- We talked about people in this business that you feel don't have a love for their own people.
We was talking about
Spike Lee, Arsenio Hall,
Eddie Murphy and the rest of them.
I thought I was charming, but I was immature. I did things without thinking.
Michael Jackson, Randy Jackson,
Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul, all of them.
She wants to not be black, but sell to blacks.
I don't appreciate her going out of her way to say she's not black.
My actions came before thought.
Things that I did, things I said.
So many things I wanna take back.
Eddie Murphy, with all that dough he's making, hasn't done nothing for us.
- He does a lot of charity.
- Charity doesn't get to the ghetto.
Everybody knows that.
I was young and dumb.
Being mad at Spike Lee and all those people, all of that.
The thing I said of Quincy Jones, he shouldn't mess with white women.
I said I was sorry personally for that.
I didn't think of how it would hurt people.
I'm gonna catch y'all in traffic and be the roughest nigga you ever seen.
That turned into more legal problems.
The People truly believe that
Mr. Shakur has shown no remorse whatsoever for his action in this case.
We view Mr. Shakur's appearance on Yo! MTV Raps as bragging.
He was proud of what he did and does not feel sorry.
I just want to say, judge, that I have a great deal of remorse.
As far as I want you to treat me different, I don't want that.
I just want the chance to make right from all the bad things that I got.
I got things against me and people that look up to me.
I don't want the last place they see me to be jail.
I guess it's now time for me to render the sentence.
I obviously find that the defendant is a talented individual.
However, this court believes that jail time is warranted with a battery with some injury involved.
The defendant will serve 15 days in the county jail.
I think the judge was fair.
I still don't feel like I got the decision that I wanted, but he was as fair as he could be.
Really, to my homeboys, I mean, a fight is a fight, battery is battery.
A two and a half minute problem just cost me 15 days in jail, and that was lenient.
But my most serious legal problems came from women.
How I was acting with women.
The Underground just don't stop
For ho's, I get around
I will no longer sit passively, allowing this degradation to be continued by our children.
I think we live in a very sexist society, and everybody's pointing the finger at me.
When somebody asks me,
"Do you exploit women?"
With her permission, I might smack a girl on the butt in the video.
I might be drinking champagne, but everything in moderation, and everything with class.
Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips
See me jocking, put a little twist
In her hips because I'm watching
I don't have to always do a song with the good woman.
I don't see women as all one thing.
I think all women are different.
You wonder why they call you bitch
You wonder why they call you bitch
We African-American women, particularly, are tired of being called ho's, bitches and sluts by our children.
Dear Ms. DeLores Tucker
You keep stressing me
Fucking with a motherfucking mind
I figured you wanted to know
Why we call them ho's bitches
If I do something that has a bad woman, people go, "He hates women."
If I do something that has a bad woman, people go, "He hates women."
I don't think like that. But there are definitely a type of female, label them a bitch, whose main thing is to get what they can, and they revel in breaking a nigga's heart and taking what he owns.
Shut the fuck up!
There's male bitches too.
Women know there are bitches.
I don't know why they're surprised.
They know. They say it louder.
They think we say they're all bitches.
That's not what we're saying.
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares
And don't nobody else care
That's "Keep Ya Head Up" and "Get Around".
I said, "I'm gonna write a song about women like my mom,
"who represent a strong black woman." I did that.
I'll rap about women I see daily.
That's "Get Around".
If I just did "Keep Ya Head Up", it makes me seem more than I am, but I'm just a normal man.
America, America
- God shed his grace on thee
- Stop.
I'm gonna close the door.
Come on, Mr. Cameraman.
This is some real private shit that's about to happen, Mr. Cameraman.
Bye.
Anyway, I'll let you hear the sounds.
Is there a double standard for men being promiscuous?
Yeah, but we didn't start that double standard.
- I'm not saying you did.
- And I'm not saying it's fair.
I'm saying this is how it is. How can we rap about a world that is not like that?
- This is how it is.
- Do you look down on males if they're as promiscuous as women?
I don't look down on anybody that's promiscuous.
I only look down on people who don't control the situation.
If a girl sleeps with a lot of guys, she's still my homegirl.
You're only a bitch, not if you sleep with a lot of guys, but if you're sleeping with them for money.
- So you put a price on yourself.
- Because they have a nice car.
Guys, when they sleep around, they do it for free.
At that time, a lot of girls, they'd seen my face on TV so many times, they wanna be associated with that person.
It's the fame that gets these people.
It's not me. It's the fame.
I've seen females look at me when they didn't know me, and I can see it, nothing.
Then someone whisper who I was, it's this glare in the eye.
- You make yourself want them.
- How do you feel about that?
I don't understand how people can stand next to you one year, and next year, they cannot.
They're going crazy, screaming.
They can't take it that you're there.
But last year I was in the same club, walking around, lonely like a motherfucker.
Couldn't get a date or a dance.
I was too skinny, too something, and now, "He's just adorable.
He's just, oh!"
But I still enjoyed sex without the emotional connection.
And it was always a fantasy for me to have sex with a lot of people in the room.
But I didn't play one situation correctly.
Rap singer Tupac Shakur was released on $50,000 bail today, accused of a sexual attack in a New York hotel.
The singer was arrested Thursday night after a woman claimed he and three other men overpowered her in a hotel suite.
- Are you disappointing your fans?
- Very, but they're gonna support me.
With bodyguards and attorneys, he went into Manhattan Criminal Court.
There, the rapper and two friends were charged with first-degree sodomy.
The allegations stem from an incident last Thursday in which a woman claims she was held down as he and two others allegedly sodomized her.
The allegations by this young lady are without merit.
Defense attorneys say the woman went there consensually, and answering machine tapes that indicate her interest in Shakur were erased by police.
OK, so you tell me when your lawyers have asked you to stop.
The girl who claims that...
What does she claim?
- I can't even say it, man.
- OK.
But technically, it's a rape case.
I wasn't convicted of no rape charge.
My charge was sexual abuse, forcibly touching the buttocks.
I have a female saying that...
I can't say it, but...
It just bothers me so much, you know?
To go through my life and everything I did, coming out of a family and household with just women, to get to this point to have a woman say that I took something from her.
It was hard.
It was an emotional day for a 20-year-old female fan, who admitted that she had consensual sex with Shakur on Sunday night, four days before her alleged rape in the hotel room.
During her cross-examination, defense attorney Michael Warren painted a picture of a starstruck, naive girl anxious to have sex with Shakur.
Word is, you had a relationship with this woman prior to all this friction.
If you can say that's a relationship.
I bumped in a club. I seen her.
Let's use a clinical term.
There was oral copulation?
Yeah, she performed oral sex on the dance floor.
A lot of guys could say what they wouldn't do and what they would do, but when it happens, you know...?
- Yeah.
- It just goes down. And it's... Really.
She did some things there at the club, and we got together later that night.
I saw her again another time with these guys that introduced me to her.
Everybody was having a good time, nothing sexual, just a good time.
Me and her went in, she gave me a massage, went to sleep, woke up, she's screaming,
"Rape, rape." I raped her.
And she's yelling at me, "This is not the last you're gonna see of me."
I'm cursing her out because I'm not thinking she's really gonna do that.
And the next thing I know,
I'm going to jail.
In your opinion there was no truth to the sexual abuse charges?
Not on my part at all.
The defense pounded away at her, asking her why she didn't scream for help at the time of the alleged attack.
The woman testified that Shakur's friends said:
"Tupac needs his fans.
Don't go to the White Man with this.
"Millions of girls would love to be in your shoes right now."
What about your cronies?
That was a big misconception.
The people with me weren't friends.
- Why were they in your room?
- I hang with lots of people.
And that's how I am.
It's similar to like you said, about Led Zeppelin. They don't know all of the people with them.
This guy got the weed?
OK, you can kick it.
Got the money?
You can kick it.
This guy has connections to the clubs?
OK, you can kick it. I don't know him.
But that was my fault, I had that kind of environment around me.
I didn't do nothing. I'm charged with being in concert with some guys.
Well, where are they at?
Why me? Because I'm Tupac...
I'm not mad at them.
I'm mad at the system.
I don't want nobody to go to jail, but I don't wanna go for something I didn't do.
I just don't wanna be the scapegoat.
I just couldn't believe this was going on in my life.
See the cameras. It wasn't like I had a chance for justice like a normal citizen.
Hi, Tupac. Can you tell me how you're doing today?
Well, I just had to listen to the prosecution's closing argument, and it was so far from the truth that it has me drained at the end of the day.
But I'm leaving it in the hands of the jury.
I'm learning a lot about people's innermost fears in this trial.
It's not even about my trial no more.
It's just about
Ioud rap music, tattoo-having thugs.
It's about some nightmare that these people are having.
I can't understand why it's so close.
There's no evidence I sodomized her, even though you put that in the paper.
Print the facts so everybody can sort it out.
My life is ruined because nobody has a chance to get the facts.
Fact is, there was no semen found.
No semen found, no forcible entry, no entry into the anal, no nothing.
I wanted to explain it.
If you could go back to the night when the abuse occurred,
- Is there anything you'd do differently?
- Yeah.
I would not have closed my eyes until she was out of the room, until everybody was out of the room.
So when you left the room and left her with those people...
I didn't leave her with those people or bring her to them.
- She came over?
- Right.
She came over, knew those people, knew everything.
I just didn't grab her out of there.
I'm guilty of not being a smart man, not being a goodhearted man,
I guess, or being more considerate.
At any point, were you aware she was involved in something she...
- Cut. That's a problem right there.
- Excuse me.
None of these legal matters can be asked.
I have a list of the stuff you'll have to cut out. Sorry.
- All right.
- The gentleman is out on bail.
I see.
I couldn't defend myself.
This would never have happened to anybody else.
They have no evidence on me, and it's about to come out.
Now my life is over.
This is a year later.
A year after the world's been thinking I'm a rapist.
The whole world owes me an apology.
I went through it and didn't kill myself like Kurt Cobain.
And I should, because this is some crazy madness.
Central, I got a black male shot at 48th and 7th.
Last night, just after midnight, at 723 7th Avenue, that's between 48th and 49th Street, rap star Tupac Shakur and three members of his group were robbed and shot.
They shot me, straight up.
I just kept thinking,
"They really did shoot me."
When I wasn't dead, immediately I was like, "Oh, man."
I was like, "No, this ain't it."
I know how it's gonna be when I die.
It's gonna be no noise.
You ain't gonna hear people screaming. I'm gonna fade out.
And I didn't... None of that was there.
I was like, "I got shot five times.
I'm not dead. They missed. I'm back."
When Shakur resisted, he was shot five times, twice in the head and twice in the groin area.
And his most serious wound, a gunshot through the hand, hitting an artery in his thigh.
He's listed in serious but stable condition.
Until it happened, I really did believe no black person would ever shoot me.
I believed that I didn't have to fear my own community.
You know, I was like,
"I represent them.
"I'm their ambassador to the world.
They would never do me wrong."
I believe that this was a robbery.
Anybody who was gonna walk into that building was gonna be robbed.
The police don't wanna find out who shot me. They're happy.
As far as that Vibe interview, just read everything over and read my reply, read their reply, read what people say.
Everybody that was there knows what happened.
My recollection was, I was shooting a video, the second half of "Warning", which is the B-side of "Big Poppa", and I was shooting around the block.
And I heard my man was up at the studio doing a Junior M.A.F.I.A. session.
So I got off at the reception area, and I saw Andre and Little Shawn.
I said, "What's up?" about to get on the elevator, and he comes out shot.
The Tupac article had me pissed off, you know what I'm saying?
Because first of all, he dissed my man, saying he turned his back on him, and I know for a fact it didn't happen.
And, like, the rumors that's spreading is on some tip like we set him up.
And that's crazy.
As soon as he comes out shot, me and my man try to sit him down.
He called his mom. He asked my man if he can roll him a blunt.
We asked if he was all right. He's like,
"Yeah, I don't know what's going on."
We were just trying to comfort him.
Andre Harrell called the ambulance.
And everybody there was very supportive of him.
It was just the total opposite. He came out and everyone ran to him.
It was nothing but love and concern.
They got different accounts of it, and I'm the one with the bullet wounds.
I also understand that if you was to get shot five times, your mind is just completely spinning.
You're real confused about your situation.
It'll make you say things you don't mean.
I was there for the whole thing. No one else was there for the whole thing.
I don't know the purpose of why the story was said in another context.
It's not important that others know what happened. I said it.
Now that I said it, it's dead.
Believe me or not, I did what I had to.
God knows the truth.
There's no religion about getting shot.
I don't want any converts.
After getting shot, I was like,
"Shit, I don't know who to trust."
In a bizarre twist of events,
Tupac Shakur checked himself out of
Bellevue Hospital Wednesday night.
After surgery, Tupac checked himself out of Bellevue against doctor's orders.
It was just time to leave.
I didn't feel safe there.
I kept getting these crazy phone calls.
At that point, I'm just paranoid, just bugging out.
I couldn't sleep or rest. I was like,
"I'm just tired, and I wanna just..."
And I felt like I'm like a victim, a target.
I couldn't even sleep at home.
People could kill me at home.
And are the police gonna come in and kill me?
You know, is there secret police?
I was so deep into the weed at that point.
And I was like,
"I'm petrified. I'm vulnerable."
I felt like just a prisoner to my own fame.
That's why I wanted to die at that point.
I felt like, "If everybody's so worried, why ain't nobody came to help?"
- Mr. Shakur?
- Open up, please. Open up.
- Excuse me.
- Step back, please.
- Just keep it tight, that's all.
- How are you this morning?
The jury deliberated, then, after days of twists worthy of a Hollywood drama,
Tupac Shakur has finally had one question answered.
Tonight, the jury found him guilty of three counts of sexual abuse, but innocent on six other charges, including sodomy.
Please, give me some space.
Please, man.
Why did you decide to leave the hospital?
Please, y'all are not letting me get through, man. Let me get through!
- Back it up.
- Why did you leave?
And sentencing for this trial has yet to be scheduled.
Where I was sent was a maximum-security penitentiary.
I know when I was young,
I couldn't wait to get to jail, straight up.
I mean, I was scared and everything, but I felt that's part of being a man.
Now that I'm here, this is not the spot.
I know everybody that comes out says,
"This ain't the spot." This isn't the spot.
Somebody tells you when to get up, when you can shower, do this, do that.
They can speak to you any way they want to, and you've gotta accept it.
You can die here, know what I mean?
Yesterday, a dude was murdered.
He wasn't in here on no murder beef.
He was in on a drug beef.
He's gone. He's dead in jail, you know what I mean?
By another prisoner who had life.
He had nothing to lose, you know what I mean?
I came to jail. I'm telling you, it's dirty.
It's filthy. It's like you're an animal.
At first, me and the guards had problems.
I got smacked and treated bad.
They did whatever they could to break me because I used to talk a lot of shit.
As soon as I got there, they went,
"There he goes, the rich nigger."
I was like, "Oh, shit, he said nigger!"
Everybody's looking at me like, "So?"
And I was like, "My God, this is where
I'm gonna be staying?"
He just said "nigger"!
You've got "niggas" in one of your records.
Niggas. He's talking about niggers.
Niggers was the ones on the rope, hanging off the thing.
Niggas is the ones with gold ropes, hanging out at clubs.
I learned things there. In jail, it's like how we should be in life, humble.
I was talking to skinheads because if you don't like black people, all right, that's fine.
That's your opinion.
I want people to respect my opinion when I'm rapping, so I'll respect yours.
You treat me with respect, I'll treat you with respect, and we'll get along.
This skinhead, "hate black people" all over, getting autographs for cousins.
I accomplished something.
I know, by him getting my autograph, that meant something to me.
He couldn't hate black people and get my autograph.
- The food was terrible, I guess.
- Oh, my goodness.
They've got this liver surprise thing.
The liver surprise. They're trying to pump that jail on the menu.
They're trying to get it to go prime-time, get it in the rotation.
I was like, "We had this yesterday.
I liked it already, goddamn."
- No Tater Tots?
- No. Are you crazy? Tater Tots?
I used to get baked potatoes with a huge finger imprint on it.
- All right.
- It was bad.
No, you don't wanna get me started.
Jell-O with hair all in the mold.
I'd be like, "Damn, man, how are you gonna mess up Jell-O?"
Jell-O is so wholesome and family-like.
It just ruins it for me.
To have a hair in there, yeah.
I mean, I'm like, "Come on,
Bill Cosby pumps this, man!"
Put the hair in my Jell-O.
And you can't go, "There's a hair in my Jell-O. I'd like to send this back.
"Can I see the cook, please?"
The cook is a big dude named Bubba Joe.
The first eight months I spent in solitude 23 hours a day, reading.
I wrote a script called Live 2 Tell.
I got How to Write a Screenplay, that big famous book by Syd Field.
I got that, and I remembered all of the scripts I ever read, and I wrote one.
I read a lot of good books.
I read a lot of Maya Angelou's books.
The Art of War by Sun Tzu.
But in terms of writing music and lyrics, I couldn't do it.
Everybody's like, "He's in jail now.
He's gonna have the bomb album."
But it's the opposite.
Prison kills your spirit, straight up.
It kills your spirit.
I couldn't write. My inspiration was gone because I was a caged animal.
But when I was in jail, a lot of people supported me.
Jasmine Guy, Jada Pinkett,
Mickey Rourke, he just wrote me funny stories.
The name that sticks out the most,
I'll keep saying this, is Tony Danza.
To me, he is the bomb forever.
I will be his number one fan forever, because when I got his letter,
I was like, "Whoa!"
I was screaming out to everybody,
"Guess who wrote me!"
They had a story on the local news that Madonna was coming to visit me.
Madonna has so much power that the guards gave me an extra shower because they thought she was coming to visit me.
I had guards walking me downstairs, everything, trying to peep a look.
- Did she come?
- No. No, I'm glad.
- But you got the extra shower?
- Hey, I got the shower.
The person that supported me the most was my mother.
When my mother got clean, we got real close again.
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand, for a woman
It ain't easy, trying to raise a man
I don't blame her for anything.
My mom's the bomb, you know.
The world's best mom.
- You are appreciated
- Lady
Don't you know we love you
Sweet lady
"Dear Mama" is the song
I wrote for my mother.
But it's also for all the mothers.
I'm proud of that.
It affected a lot of people.
It was from Me Against the World, which was completed before I went to jail.
It's just me against the world
Me against the world, baby
It was the number one record.
Me Against the World was one of those... My career highs.
It was a trip in jail.
They'd say stuff like, "You're in jail.
Won't be any rapping for a long time."
I'd be like, "My album is number one in the country.
"It just beat Bruce Springsteen."
And they'd be like,
"Go back to your cell."
I used to get Entertainment Weekly and see where my record was and just trip out and be like,
"Number one in the whole country."
To me, it will always be my favorite, and jail made me wanna dig deeper.
It took five bullets for me to see what was really going on.
In jail, you get perspective, and you start looking at things differently, like everything is not so important.
You know, you try not to take it personal.
Because you're talking to killers.
They say something you don't like, you can't say, "What?"
You gotta be like, "OK, look man, would you mind not calling me...?"
Anger management like a mother.
In jail, I tried not to have negative feelings towards nobody.
It's not like I wanted to get out and go shoot somebody up.
People said, "You softened up."
Ain't nothing soft. Nothing changed.
If anything, my mentality was like,
"Trust nobody.
"Trust nobody."
It's not like I'm untouchable.
I could be killed as soon as I get out.
I just thought,
"I already took five bullets,
"and if I can help it,
I don't plan on taking more."
Rapper, actor and convict, Tupac
Shakur, walked out of jail last week, bailed out to the tune of $1.4 million by
Suge Knight of Death Row Records, which signed Shakur to a deal.
My closest friends did me in.
My closest friends, my homeys.
I took care of their whole family, took care of everything,
Iooked out for them, put them in the game, turned on me.
So I just thought, "How could I make them sorry they ever did this to me?
"How can I come back, like,
50 times stronger and better?"
Fear is stronger than love. Remember that. Fear is stronger than love.
The love I gave meant nothing when it came to fear.
No question, sign with Death Row.
Suddenly, I was out on bail, pending appeal.
If I win my appeal, which, if God wills, I will,
I would've done 11 months for nothing.
You see that, judge? I didn't curse.
Probation people, I didn't curse.
Give me my props. Let me stay free.
I was relieved, happy to be home.
I wanted to drive up and down Sunset because I love L.A. with a passion.
I love Sunset, everything about L.A.
Can I get tatted up real quick?
I want a crown here.
You know, the energy, that's L.A.
- Hello?
- I'm saying, we on Venice Beach. It's what you do.
I've been in jail 11 months, Tabitha.
You're supposed to put "I love you".
You got to let me get a look at something.
It's a trip when last week you were in a cell, and then, next week, I'm up at Monty's with Cristal champagne and filet mignon and lobster and shrimps.
Everybody went, "Let me take you out.
You're home? Let me take you to this!"
We was all up in Roscoe's.
I even celebrated at El Pollo Loco because I was dreaming about
El Pollo Loco the whole time.
Then I went straight to the studio.
And I did 24 tracks in less than two weeks.
You can mix it later and have niggas that love being in the studio just add the drumbeat and shit. You can do that after the rappers leave.
That's when it's fresh.
Get that beat popping, throw them niggas on the track, put it down.
Everybody will listen, be like,
"This is the hook."
We'll go lay the hook.
That's the song.
Plus, I had so much to say,
I figured this was the best way to vent, instead of paying some psychotherapist $50 million.
I went in the studio. It was cheaper.
Here we go! California, get up!
Out on bail, fresh out of jail
California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene
I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of the West Side player
Where cowards die
And the strong ball
Only in Cali, where we riot, not rally
To live and die
In L.A., we wear Chucks, not Ballies
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits
And ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution
We collide with other crews
You gotta realize one thing:
Tupac is Death Row.
I feel I have more than just a business relationship with him.
He can be like a brother, a friend.
I like everyone on the record company.
I like Suge, Snoop and Dre.
I hang out with them anyway, now it's official.
This is Tupac and Dr. Dre, and this is the Week in Rock!
- Week in Rock, baby!
- Week in Rock, baby!
I came out, I was like,
"Dre, I want some beats right now."
He's like, "I'm working on
'California Love'."
I said, "You know you owe me this.
"I'm new on Death Row, fresh out of jail.
"You ain't gonna be finishing your album soon."
I love collaborating with creative people that's as talented as 'Pac.
He got right in and wrote his lyrics while he was behind the mike and dropped it, and it's funky.
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
Me coming to Death Row, for another reason was Snoop.
Please welcome
America's Most Wanted,
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac.
The man got so much style.
Ya'll know we down with this rock thing, nine-six flavor, Death Row.
But who knew it would last, this West Side staff?
Yep, yep, yep. This is me and Snoop,
"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted", the bomb track. It's the first single.
It's gonna be like the anthem of West Coast rap.
This is gonna shake the whole music scene, guaranteed.
Ain't nothing but a gangsta party
Oh, shit
You done fucked up now
You done put two of
America's Most Wanted
In the same motherfucking place
At the same motherfucking time
Y'all niggas about to feel this
Break out the champagne glasses
Picture perfect
I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision
My intention's to get richer
With the S-N-double-O-P Dogg
My fucking homey
You's a cold-ass nigga
On them hogs
I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom
Waiting on the outcome
Me and Snoop represent the nucleus of the entire ghetto.
Snoop represents the more calm, all legit, by the book, no waves, let's get our business handled.
You're doing your job every day
And then you work so hard
Till your hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life
And about the way it is
You see, we live by the gun
So we die by the gun's kids
Tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floating in a black Benz
And trying to do a show a day
I represent the hard-core, no-holds- barred, no-prisoners, relentless thug.
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency
And dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers
And so we made it
We both represent both sides of the game.
The calm one and the relentless one.
My nigga, Dogg, with me
Eternally the most wanted
Here's my commercial for Death Row.
If you come to Death Row, you will see your art brought to a bigger plateau, and you will be paid one of these days.
Death Row. Count with me.
Count with me.
This is for my homeboys in jail.
These are 100s.
And they ain't counterfeit.
If I said it was the money, the struggle continues.
I got money, but I have to pay everybody even more money.
I owe money to Death Row.
So it's not just, "Oh, he's paid.
He's living large." It's not like that.
People wanna sue you, and I have to settle for this and that when I know I didn't do anything, just because it's like:
"I don't wanna go to court another eight months." Makes you work harder.
Next year, Death Row is gonna print our own money.
We make so much, we need to start printing our own.
It's gonna be me and Suge on the $100 bill.
Me, Suge and Damu gonna be on the $100 bill.
I felt I'm getting pimped.
This is the $100 bill on Death Row money, here.
But you have to come up, start from the bottom and work up to the top.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome acclaimed rap artist and Grammy nominee, Tupac.
People fail to realize this is not just play. I work.
Run! Scatter, scatter!
Drag K off the stage.
Y'all come on, man.
Do it for real, man. One, two, three.
When it's time to get down and do my business, I'm going to.
I can't get no blood on the set?
Shit.
I believe I'm more responsible, more mature and more focused.
You don't say you need me
You don't sing me love songs
Y'all don't bring us flowers anymore
When I was in jail, I couldn't remember why I was rapping.
But I was away from it so long, I said,
"I really like going to the studio.
"I really like creating."
Living held down
My game plan, to be trained
And military mind of a thug lord
I like music, and I like acting.
I like doing it.
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super-freaky
I can be me. I can be whoever because I'm true to me.
The reason I sell six million records, the reason I can go to jail and come out without a scratch, the reason I am who I am is because I can look into my face and find my soul.
It's there. I didn't sell it.
So lash out and get a glass
Done finally got his own drink
Call it the best
Introducing a special brew
Made for a chosen few
I'm thugged out
While Snoop Dogg's sipping blue
I thought, "I'm a superpower.
Death Row is a superpower.
"Let's combine superpowers and ally."
Damu! My dog's going crazy, ready to kill a few people.
- Yeah. Yeah.
- He wanna kill.
I love my artists.
I don't consider my people artists.
I consider them family.
It's just a big difference, if they decided to turn in rapping or singing, they'd still be my homeboys.
We'd still travel together.
If they needed something, what's mine will still be theirs.
It's no situation where I'm dealing with them strictly for business, because they're good.
It's not like that.
You've gotta have more respect for your people.
Plus we've got a Death Row East going on.
- I'm sure you heard about that.
- Tell me about that.
Hold on. Damu! Damu, sit!
But Death Row has a reputation for having a thug-like mentality.
Won't that get you in trouble?
Death Row has a bigger reputation for success than anything else.
The reason for all of the fear involves the world of this man, the man getting out of the limousine.
Six-foot-three, 335-pound
Marion Knight, known by the nickname of "Suge", short for "Sugar".
It's an efficient camp over here, professional, business-oriented.
I like that.
At the age of only 30, and with a lengthy criminal record, including three felony convictions,
Suge Knight has managed to become the head of a $100 million record company and one of the most powerful and feared men in the music industry.
The controversy over Death Row Records and its owner being sort of a gangster.
Everybody's asking about Death Row.
- Suge ain't no gangsta. He's chilling.
- No?
No, man, Suge a rider.
I know what good morals are, but you're supposed to disregard good morals when you're living in a crazy, bad world.
If you're in hell, how can you live like an angel?
You're surrounded by devils, trying to be an angel?
That's like suicide.
I'd like to tell Tupac to keep his guards up. We're with him.
One other thing I'd like to say, any artist out there that want to be an artist and wants to stay a star and don't wanna have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row.
When I got out of jail, the West Coast-
East Coast shit was really starting.
Wait, the East Coast don't love
Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg?
The East Coast ain't got no love for Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Death Row?
West Coast was Death Row.
The East Coast was Bad Boy.
Check this out.
I'm the executive producer that a comment was made about earlier.
Everybody thought it was a war, a war for record sales and attention.
But to me it was personal.
I love the East Coast.
I'm from the East Coast.
But I felt like Puffy and Biggie wanted to dirty up everything I worked for.
So it made me come back more relentless.
I'm mad at Biggie. I'm rushing the nigga. What's the problem?
Yo, Piggie, man, we got it going on, baby.
It's on and cracking, man.
He's gone, baby. You the man.
So I directed videos.
'Pac, you alive? I mean, you safe?
Man, I'm so happy you're free.
Yeah? Happy to see you, lying piece of shit.
'Pac, please don't kill me.
It was Buff's idea.
- No, man.
- I'm just a rapper.
Please don't take me out of the game.
I ain't going to kill you.
We was homeboys once, Pig.
Once we homeboys, we always homeboys, even if you is a fat phony.
And I did a song with Faith, Biggie's wife.
Faith's my homegirl. I just want to send a shout-out to Faith. Hey, girl.
Then I did "Hit 'Em Up".
That's why I fucked your bitch,
You fat motherfucker
Which is a classic battle record.
First off, fuck your bitch
And the clique you claim
West Side, when we ride
Come equipped with game
You claim to be a player
But I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys
Niggas fucked for life
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug living out of prison
Pistols in the air
Biggie, remember when I used
To let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch
To let you sleep in the house
- Now it's all about Versace
- You copied my style
- Five shots couldn't drop me
- I took it and smiled
Now I'm about set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug
That you love to hate
Grab your Glocks
When you see Tupac
Call the cops when you see Tupac
Who shot me?
But you punks didn't finish that
You're about to feel
The wrath of a menace
Everything happened so fast at that point.
I was looking at things, the East Coast-West Coast thing, it just got out of control.
Dudes was getting killed, and I felt responsible.
But I couldn't stop it.
We ain't mad at the whole New York, just certain people.
I got this project coming out along with some brothers called One Nation.
It's like an East Coast-West Coast collaboration to kill this whole new vibe.
Everybody want it to be a war between the East Coast and West Coast.
It's really a problem with two rappers.
The East Coast-West Coast thing is something journalists are making up to get paid off, so it can drag out and everybody can have albums. They perpetuate this, so it can be drama.
When it go down, don't look at me and Biggie and be like, "Why is there a big
East Coast/West Coast war?"
When you're shooting this to 3,300 homes, 300 countries, telling them about a war that they would never know exists.
That's where information becomes a problem.
We both need to exercise greater restraint.
Damn, sometimes life gets messed up.
When I was on Death Row,
I was successful but not happy.
Tupac, your life has been marred by considerable pain.
Do you think you'll get to the point where you can live a normal life?
No. But, I...
I'm going for it. I'm trying for it, and until then
I have to make the life that I do live as happy as I can and try to do the best with what I have.
Live the best life I can live, be as happy as I can be.
Nothing is perfect for anybody,
I don't think.
I felt trapped.
They say, "You made your bed, lay in it"?
I tried to move.
I can't move to no other bed.
I felt I can't live a different lifestyle.
This the life they gave me, this the life I made.
I felt I can't change, not for the courts, not for the parole board, not for nobody. This is it.
I also felt like something was gonna happen to me because I'm paranoid.
And I put it in my videos.
That nigga ain't want none.
I been drinking. Where he at?
No, no, no, where he at?
Yo, watch out.
It was a prophecy.
I had a prophecy about my death.
That's why I go in the studio and do three songs a day, get things ready.
We don't have time or the luxury to spend all of this time doing one song. We don't have it.
If I die, it can happen.
If anything were to happen to me, that album's ready to go.
So it's all good.
I felt as if the only thing that can kill me is death, and even then my music will live forever.
At approximately 9:00 p.m., security cameras at the MGM Grand captured Tupac, Suge Knight and members of the Death Row entourage beating an alleged South Side Crip,
Orlando Anderson.
Tupac, Suge and others jumped
Anderson, punching and kicking him.
Terrified bystanders scattered as the group streamed into the casino then out into the street.
Whoa.
Just after the Mike Tyson fight,
Shakur, with record company executive, Suge Knight, headed for a club.
While stopping at this intersection a car with four people pulled up and fired on Shakur and Knight.
Shakur was shot several times in the chest.
The driver, his record producer, was grazed in the head.
He's returned to intensive care after another surgery, still in critical condition.
All week long fans of Tupac have gathered outside the hospital.
He's undergone two operations.
His right lung was removed.
He's intermittently conscious.
Jesse Jackson's been here.
Family is keeping vigil.
Despite reports that his wounds were not life-threatening, people at the hospital continue to tell us he is in very serious condition.
At 4:03 this afternoon,
Tupac Shakur was pronounced dead.
Who shot me?
Shit, I don't know.
Sorry.
My death, it's a tragedy like Shakespeare, I guess.
But I have no bad feelings.
I have love for everybody.
Please welcome the mothers of Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur,
Afeni Shakur and Voletta Wallace.
Coming to grips with my past, it was hard.
I don't feel what I did was evil.
I feel like the way I was living and my mentality was a part of my progression to be a man.
But we grow. We all grow.
We're made to grow.
You either evolve, or you disappear.
I don't want to be forgotten.
I'll always be a troublemaker to some people.
But I still get love from my community.
I owe them everything. That's why
I owe everything to the 'hood.
I've got love there.
I've got love from thugs and the street dudes.
And that focuses me back on what I should be doing, lay out the real mat on the world and how it is.
The message is, young black males could do anything if you just give us a shot, stop trying to beat us down.
And to my homeboys, we need to be in control of ourselves.
I'm not saying I'll change the world, but I guarantee I'll spark the brain that will change the world.
So keep your head up.
Do what you've gotta do.
And then inside of you,
I'll be reborn.
We climbed 'cause it's fun.
And mainly it was fun.
That's all we ever did.
And we were fairly anarchic and fairly irresponsible, and we didn't give a damn about anyone else or anything else, and we just wanted to climb the world. And it was fun.
It was just brilliant fun.
And every now and then it went wildly wrong. And then it wasn't.
Got into Peru when I was 25, Simon 21.
But we had done a lot of climbing in the Alps.
To climb mountains that have not been climbed before, or a new route at a mountain is what my climbing life had been moving towards.
A friend of us, who'd done an amazing amount of climbing in South-America had seen this face in the mid-70's.
I think he said it would be a challenging day out.
It was the last big mountain face in this range of mountains, that hadn't been climbed.
There's a great unknown there.
What's so compelling is stepping into that unknown.
It was an isolated spot, a 2
- days walk from a road.
The mountains all around seemed very big, compared to the mountains
I'd seen in the Alps.
We eventually reached a spot, on the approach to Siula Grande.
You couldn't really take the donkeys any further than this point.
I guess it would be 7-8 km from the bottom of the mountains.
We knew Siula Grande was at the back, but we didn't see it.
We'd met this lad called Richard Hawking in Lima. He'd been travelling on his own.
And I think we said, "Why don't you just join us on our trip?"
I think he said that he didn't know anything about mountaineering.
I didn't really know what pot of brew I was in. or quite, what I was letting myself in for.
We wanted Richard because when we were on the mountain, if he were at base camp he could look after our kit.
I got to know Simon quite well.
I don't know whether it was because of his personality, or whether it was because he was more forgiving towards me, being a non-climber in that environment.
But I found it very hard to get to know Joe.
I was much more ambitious about doing it than Simon was.
Siula Grande meant a lot.
We knew, a number of expeditions had failed on it.
If no one had tried, it wouldn't be quite the same.
It was the the fact that people had tried and failed, so we knew it was hard.
And my feeling was, "Well, we'll just do it. We're better than them."
Since the 1970s people have been trying to climb mountains in the great ranges in what's called "Alpine style".
And essentially, Alpine style means you pack a rucksack full of all your clothing, your food and your climbing equipment, and you start off from a base camp and you try and climb the mountain you're gonna climb in a single push.
You don't fix the line of ropes uphill beforehand, you don't have a set of camps that you stock and come down from.
That's the purest style and that's the style that Joe and I had climbed Siula Grande.
It's a very committing way of climbing, because you have no line of retreat.
If something goes wrong, it can be very very serious.
There's no rescue, there's no helicopter rescue and there's no other people.
There's no margin for error.
If you get badly hurt, you'I probably die.
I hadn't seen it from this angle, and it looked steep.
I sort of thought, you know, "Christ, that's big".
Looks harder than I thought and than I expected.
But I was excited.
Starting doing it was brilliant.
This is what we live for.
I love the actual movement of climbing.
When you're climbing well it just feels brilliant.
It's like a combination between ballet and gymnastics.
It's that mixture of power and grace.
For me, mountains are the most beautiful places in the world.
When I go into these places I feel an amazing sense of space, an amazing sense of freedom, when I get away from all of the clutter that we have in the world.
I think we surprised ourselves as we got up the icefield about 300m, and got up to a point where the ice is running through rock bands, and you've got vertical cascades.
We started intricately climbing through these.
The fact, that you are tied to your partner, means that you put an immense amount of trust in someone else's skill and ability.
But at some point, you may be thinking,
"For god's sake, Simon, don't fall here, for god's sake, don't fall here"
The rope can be something that rather than save your life, could kill you.
If your mate falls off then all this gear rips out, you're dead, you're gonna go with him.
If you're gonna do that sort of climbing at some point you're gonna have to rely wholly on your partner.
I think we were very pleased at the end of that first day.
We had done a lot of climbing, good climbing.
And we were very confident at that point that we should make it.
That altitude, you dehydrate enormously.
You have to drink a lot of fluid, 4-5 liters a day.
And the only way you can get it, is by melting snow.
Everything is so time-consuming.
To make a single brew at that altitude takes a very long time,
You're perhaps looking at an hour just to make a couple of cups.
For that reason, we perhaps didn't brew up as much as we should have done but we didn't have an awful lot of spare gas with us, either.
There's not a lot of risk in our lives normally now.
And to put an element of risk back into it takes us out of the humdrum.
In that sense, it makes you feel more alive.
I've never been that high before, and it's very very strenuous to climb ice like that.
Not only is it technically difficult and unstable and frightening, but your heart is going like crazy because of the altitude.
It would now go very cold indeed.
And we were up
5800-6000m, it was windy.
Then it started snowing, and it meant that the whole face was pooring with powdersnow avalanches.
The snow would actually stick on the outside of your clothing.
It would then freeze on top of you, like you're wearing a suit of armor.
The last section on the face was about 100m of the most nightmarish climbing.
Completely unstable powder snow.
No anchors at any point.
It was physically very, very tiring, full-body climbing really.
It took us the best part of 5 or
6 hours to climb about 65 meters.
Carried on way after it got dark.
I was getting extremely cold,
'cause I was sitting still while Simon was trying to climb.
I was getting near hypothermic.
You just knew that if you'd just carried on, regardless, it was gonna go tits up.
So we dug a snow cave.
In the morning, in good weather, we actually saw what we'd been trying to climb.
It was this undeering nightmare of flutings of the finest powder gouged out by snow falling down meringues, and mushrooms, and cornices all over the place.
We'd heard about these strange powder snow conditions you get in the Andes, and we've never seen it before.
I don't know the physics that explains why powder snow can stay on such steep slopes.
In the Alps it would just slide off if the slope was about 40 degrees.
It is some of the most precarious, unnerving and dangerous climbing I've ever done.
We were actually scared, that we would get to an impass, where we couldn't climb any further up.
Because we knew we wouldn't be able to get back down, not what we've already climbed.
We were climbing ourselves into a trap.
And not only that, we could see this
150 meter drop that was waiting for us.
And so it was with great relief that by 14:00, we got onto the north ridge and on the west face.
And we vowed that we didn't want to go near any of the flutings again.
We were pretty tired, by the time we got onto the ridge,
I was knackered. And
I remember thinking,
"Oh sod it, we've done the face,"
"now I can't really be bothered to go all the way up there"
And then we thought, "Hang on, we've come all this way,"
"we might as well stand on the top"
I don't particularly like summits, because 80% of accidents happen on descent.
We decided before we even climbed the face that we were going to come down the north ridge of the mountain, down to a cul between the mountain Siula Grande and another mountain called Yerupaja. and then we'd be able to abseil down the smaller section of the face.
Already the clouds were coming in from the east. Big clouds.
We expected this ridge to be quite straightforward, quite an easy way to descend.
We were hoping, we would be able to sort of walk.
And it turned out to be very difficult.
It was horrendous.
Vertical on the west side, with the cornices overhanging the west side, and on the east side steep fleetings running down 100m below us.
It was a shock. And it was quite dangerous.
It all got a bit out of control. That stage of things.
Half an hour to an hour after leaving the summit, we were lost.
We were in the wild now, we couldn't see anything.
Then we got like a little break in the clouds and I saw the ridge, so I started climbing back up to it.
I didn't know it was the side of the ridge I was on, but it was actually an enormous cornice, an overhang of snow and ice, and I was walking up over the top of it.
I was left hanging, looking down, as all this snow and ice then fell away from me, down the west side of the Siula Grande.
I got back up on the ridge and shouted then to Joe that I'd found the ridge, like that, I said,
"I found the ridge, Joe!"
We'd hoped to go down that day, but by the time it got dark, we were still very high.
Still at 6000m.
And that night, as we made a brew, the gas ran out.
It was pretty obvious the following morning that we descended the worst part of the ridge.
And I was pretty confident that we'd get back down to the base camp that day.
I thought at that stage it was pretty much in the bag I suppose, the whole climb.
I was ahead of Simon, and suddenly there was this vertical wall, bisecting the ridge.
I then get on my hands and knees, and hammer both my axes into the ice at the top and then lower myself off the ice cliff.
When you hammer the axe in, you listen to the sound it makes. And you look at it.
Now I was hanging with both axes, right. I took the hammer out, and what I wanted to do is now place it in the vertical wall.
And I swung, and the pick went in, and it just made a... just a strange sound.
And I thought, "Well, I'll take it out, make a good placement."
So I just wanted to put bona... dead solid axe placements in. All the way down.
And I was about to swing at the ice again
The pain is... came flooding down my thigh and my knee was very, very very painful
The impact drove my lower leg straight through my knee joint.
As the bone went into my tibia it split the tibial plateau straight off and carried on up.
Quite wild, the pain now. I couldn't cope with it at first.
I just breathed on and it started to go and I can remember looking across to the west and seeing that we were level with the summit of Rasac, so I had a height gauge, where we were. and I just thought, "fuck,
I can't have broken my leg",
"If I have broken my leg I'm dead."
And then the rope went slack.
I knew that meant that
Simon was coming towards me.
I couldn't feel any bone under anything.
I brought my hand down, there's no blood on it, and the pain had gone down a little bit.
And I thought, maybe I was being a bit whacked,
I'd just torn a ligament or something.
I tried to stand on it
I felt all the bone go, all grating and everything and I knew it was broken then.
The look that he gave to me sticks in my mind
A look of shock and desperation and a sort of terror.
Lots of things in a single look.
And he said, "Are you ok?"
I think it did occur to me to say,
"Yeah, I'm fine". That was stupid.
I think I said, "No,
I've broken my leg".
Immediately, just doom. I thought "god, we're stuffed".
We're gonna be doing well if either of us gets out of this now.
It did come into my mind, just thinking,
"If he slips off the side of the mountain now, then I can just clear off,"
"and leave him and get myself down and
I don't have to have all the hassle,"
"of trying to deal with him and with the situation we're in".
He gave me these painkillers which were effectively headache tablets.
And he didn't really talk about anything.
It was almost as if he...
He knew, what this meant.
He knew, and I knew, that he was going to have to leave me.
He could have said something like
"I'm just going to get some help" and I'd gone "right, yeah"
'Cause I knew there wasn't any help.
That'd been an easy way for him to say it.
I didn't think we really seriously thought that there was any choice
I couldn't put my finger on it, why
I thought something had happened.
And I started to think "Is one of them dead, or are both of them dead?"
Even "If one of them is dead", not
"which one do I want to be dead", but
"if one comes back, who do I want it to be?"
It's kind of, quite cold to say it, but I guess
I would rather have it would have been Simon.
I thought, "oh, he's not leaving"
I calmed down a bit and managed to focus myself again to think how I was going to get him down the mountain.
We discussed, between us, what we were going to have to do.
We thought, well, we got
2 ropes that are 50m long.
And if we tie them together we have a
100m rope with a knot in the middle of it.
So I tied to one end and
Simon tied to the other, in theory he could lower me down 100m.
To really get anchors to lower him from that do matter, what I did was cut a bucket in the snow, sit in there and brace myself.
And I sort of lay down between his legs.
And Simon started lowering then.
I'd lower him one rope length, 50m, and then the knot would come up between the two ropes.
Now the knot would not go through the belay plates.
So he would stop me.
I would stand on my left leg, my good leg, so that I could get the weight off the rope.
I gave him enough slack to be able to unclip the rope thread the rope back through the lowering device, with the knot on the other side clip it back to himself and lower me the remaining 50m.
He'd make himself reasonably secure, and I down climbed to join him.
And we'd repeat the process again.
Simon was trying to lower me fast, and it meant that my foot kept jabbing in and jabbing in and bending the knee.
Excruciatingly painful.
I can remember feeling angry with him because he was hurting me, and I was thinking "do it slow", and I also knew that he had to do it this fast. He hadn't got a choice.
And he was very grim faced,
I remember looking at him, wondering if he was pissed off with the whole thing.
I couldn't take too much notice unfortunately of these cries of pain, because we got to go down.
We would dig these holes from the sitting in the powder snow, and they would last about the length of the time it took to lower me.
And in fact they were crumbling around him.
And he was lowering me on a 9mm, well 8.8mm rope. That's that thick.
But hands sort of frozen.
What he did was quite extraordinary, and I've never heard of any single handed mountain rescue like that.
We were now lowering in a full storm. I don't know what the wind chill factor was, but it would be like -80 or something like that.
I lost a liter of blood in my leg,
I was in shock and severly dehydrated
It was a point where we should have dug a snow cave and taken shelter, got in our sleeping bags and made a hot brew, and rehydrate.
We couldn't, 'cause we'd run out of gas.
And we just lost control at this point because we couldn't dig a snow cave, and risk getting trapped by a storm that didn't break.
It was all starting to look up in many ways at that point, as we were virtually down.
And I started to slowly think,
"maybe after this one we will have one more, and we'll be on the glacier".
And suddenly all got hard on my elbows, and icy, and it got steeper, going down a slope and suddenly it's steeper, and I just was full of alarm.
I was screaming at Simon to stop as loud as I could, and he just couldn't hear me.
I did notice that more weight came onto the rope, but didn't really think a lot about this. And I just thought,
"Well, he's going over some steeper ground"
When I looked down, and I glimpsed
'cause there was a big drop underneath me,
I was horrified to discover what I'd gone over.
And I could clearly see that there was a large crevice directly under the cliff, about 25m below me.
I was trying to get my axes to see if I could reach this wall that was out there,
I think, almost as I start and try to do that, I started being lowered again.
And I was thinking, "Christ, don't do it, don't do it",
'cause I knew, that there wasn't enough rope to get me to the bottom.
And if I couldn't get my weight off the rope, he couldn't disconnect the rope, to get on the other side.
And I knew all this, and I was screaming again, not to lower me.
I carried on lowering him, until I reached the knot, then shook the rope.
My signal to him, to take the weight off the rope.
And nothing happened.
And nothing continued to happen.
I knew, that the only way out of this is if I could climb up the rope.
I had two prusik loops. Prusik loops are thin cords of rope.
And if you use a special twisting knot on the rope, you can slide it up the rope, and pull on it, and the knot grips the rope.
Clip a snapping to it and then a sling to it, and you can stand up.
And if you got another one, tied above it, you slide that one up,
Standing this loop is now higher.
I was trying to hold myself upright, to keep the rope in place.
And then trying to put this knot through itself, and through itself, and this fiddly bloody rope... it is just hard to describe how I couldn't do it.
Because my fingers, I just couldn't feel the fingers at all.
And I'd be looking and trying to push the thing in, and using my teeth, and getting it round, and getting it round.
My hands were cold, my feet were... I was very very cold.
It was a desperate position, made worse by the fact that that I had no idea what Joe was doing, or what position he was in.
I just couldn't figure out why it was taking him so long to get his weight off the rope, there was no sensible explanation for it.
I got one on, and I clipped it to my chest, because that would keep me upright.
And I tried to put the other one on, and I had real trouble with my hands.
And I dropped the bloody thing, and I watched it fall.
And I knew that I was stuffed then.
I just thought, "Well,
I can't climb the rope", this idea that you can climb a rope hand over hand, you can't, especially when your hands are frozen. You just can't do it.
Nothing I can do, and I felt completely helpless.
And really angry.
There was nothing I could do. I couldn't get the weight off the rope,
I was just there, and this went on for maybe an hour and a half, during which time my position became more and more desperate.
I was struggling to maintain the, sort of shivery seat that I sat in, and the snow was gradually sliding away from under me.
So my position was getting desperate.
I think psychologically I was beaten.
'Cause there was nothing I could do, so I just hung on the rope and waited to die.
And I think I would have died pretty soon, actually. The wind chill was very low.
I was literally going down the mountain in little, jerky stages.
'Cause this soft, sugary snow collapsed away underneath me.
I was expecting him to come off, and couldn't do anything about it.
He was gonna fall about 100m.
50m away from me, he was gonna fall double that, he was gonna die.
And he really didn't know, whether I was meters off the ground, or centimeters, he just didn't know. But he knew, I think, pretty sadly, that he was gonna die.
Then I remembered that I've got a pen knife in the top of my rucksack.
I took the decision pretty quickly.
To me, it just seemed like the right thing to do under the circumstances.
Because there was no way that
I could maintain where I was, sooner or later, I was going to be pulled from the mountain.
I took the rucksack off, and then unzipped the top pocket with one hand, and got the pen knife out.
Boof!
It was an awful night.
My mind was plagued with the thoughts of what had happened to Joe.
It took a long time to warm myself up. And I didn't properly, I guess.
Had a very, very cold night.
The overriding memory is just feeling desperately, desperately thirsty.
To the point where I felt I could smell the water in the snow around me.
I felt that very strongly.
It was quite a strange thing.
I didn't know what had happened.
What I landed on wasn't flat, it was sloped on each side.
And I was sliding, in the dark.
I think I must have fallen about 50m in total.
I was pretty surprised to be alive.
The head torch beam just went down, and down, and down, and the darkness just ate it, just gone.
I felt very unnerved, very very vulnerable.
If I had landed less than
1m further to the right,
I would have just gone down this huge hole.
I got this ice screw in, pretty quickly.
And then looked around, and thinking,
"Jezus, it's gonna be nearly impossible to get out of"
My rope was going all the way up,
25m, up to this small entry hall.
And I thought, Simon is on the end of that.
But I felt sure he was dead.
And it didn't mean anything.
I just thought, "If I pull on this rope, it will come tight on his body".
Because he would have flown off the cliff, on to the downside of the crevice, and then, Iying dead there, like a counterweight, the rope would have come back up and then dropped into the crevice.
So I thought, if I pull on this rope it will come tight on his body".
And it just kept coming, and coming, and coming,
As soon as I saw it,
I knew it had been cut.
I thought, "you're gonna die in here".
I had a pleased feeling, that it meant that Simon was alive.
Simon!
Looking where I was was an awful prospect.
You don't die of a broken leg.
I think I did turn my head torch off to save the batteries.
It was dark, and it began to get to me.
There is something about crevices, they have a dread feel, not the place for the living.
I could hear the ice cracking, and wind noises in the ice.
I turned the light on again,
'cause I didn't like it in the dark.
I felt very, very alone.
And I was very scared.
I was 25, I was fit,
I was super ambitious.
And this was the first trip I've been on. I wanted to climb the world, and it just didn't seem... this hadn't been part of our game plan.
It must have been quite late.
I think that I pretty much was thinking that I wasn't gonna get out.
Fuck. Stupid, stupid...
As a climber you should always be in control, you have to be in control.
So doing that, you could be seen as half a failure. You lost it.
This is childish. I just cried and cried.
I thought,
I'd be tougher than that.
It was getting light, as it was 5 or 6.
And I started screaming
Simon's name again.
I got myself up, got dressed inside the snow home and packed everything away,
Just a horrible feeling of dread.
By this stage, I strongly felt that
Joe had been killed the previous day.
And that now I was going to die, as some form of retribution.
But rather than just sit here, feeling sorry for myself or whatever,
"I'll get on with it and
I'll die on the way down".
Very quickly, the ground dropped away steeply.
So I skirted around this area of steeper ground.
As I abseiled down, I could see this overhanging ice cliff, which was what I had lowered him over, so I knew that he'd had actually been hanging in space, which is the reason he couldn't get his weight off the rope.
And as I went down lower,
I could see to my horror, that the base of this ice cliff was an absolutely enormous crevice, that's 12m wide and just bottomless from where I was looking at it.
SIMON!
He would have been up with first light, I thought.
'Cause I was desperately, desperately thirsty.
And he would have been. And he would have wanted to get down, and get water.
And he would have wanted to find me.
Now I did stop and pause, and I shouted across into the crevice, and I yelled and yelled, "Joe, Joe".
And I suppose again, with the benefit of hindsight, after I got off the rope, I should have gone and looked, into the crevice, to see where he was.
But to be quite honest, the thought didn't occur to me at that time.
I was just convinced he was dead.
Absolutely convinced, by 10, totally convinced, that I was on my own.
That no one was coming to get me.
I was brought up as a devout Catholic.
I had long since stopped believing in God.
I always wondered, if things really hit the fan, whether I would, under pressure, turn around and say a few Hail
Mary's, and say "get me out of here".
It never once occurred to me.
It meant that I really don't believe.
And I really do think that when you die, you die. That's it, there's no afterlife.
There's nothing.
And I was thinking, "Could
I climb out of here?"
25 meter of overhanging ice. No way,
I couldn't do it with a good leg.
I knew that they were both dead. But I couldn't just clear off and leave the camp.
For one thing, I didn't know anything about them, except for their first names, Joe and Simon.
I didn't know their family names,
I really knew nothing about them.
And I had this bizarre idea, that if they'd fallen off the mountain, they would have just landed at the bottom of it.
And I thought, perhaps from the bottom of the glacier, I'd be able to see them.
And set off with the aim of going as far as I could.
I started to go down the glacier on my own.
In this stage I was still certain that I was gonna die myself.
Crossing a glacier is very very dangerous on your own, because there are crevices in the ice, and the snow covers them.
Fortunately I managed to find a faint outline of our tracks, from when we walked in.
It was only when I got off the glacier,
I realized that I was going to get down,
I was going to get out of it,
I was gonna live.
I can't really describe how scary the night had been.
I thought, it would be like that, for days.
You gotta make decisions, you gotta keep making decisions, even if they're wrong decisions.
If you don't make decisions you're stuffed.
Short of dying on the ledge, my only chance was to lower myself deeper into the crevice.
I didn't what I would find down there.
I was just hoping there might be some way out of the labyrinth of ice and snow.
And I really struggled to make that decision, I was so scared of going deeper.
The other option was to just to sit there, blindly hoping that somehow it might get better, and I just knew it wasn't going to get better.
I didn't want to look down,
I was horrified at the thought that it was just empty down there.
I didn't put a knot near the end of the rope, and if there was nothing down there
I wouldn't be able to hold the rope, and then I would fall, and it would be quick.
And I thought "Jesus, this is big!"
By this stage I was completely physically done in, staggering back down these meringues, still desperately thirsty.
There werre all these sort of thoughts swirling around in my mind, guilt, worry, thinking about how on earth am I going to explain this to Joe's parents, my friends, to Richard.
The thought did cross my mind that maybe I could think up a decent story, that would make me look better.
And I did quite think about that, for quite a while.
Really the only image that sticks in my mind from all the time in Peru, is seeing this figure.
And it was fairly close before I could see who it was.
But he looked absolutely horrendous.
You wouldn't recognize him.
And I said, "Where is Joe?"
And he just said, "Joe is dead".
I told him the whole story, as we walked back to the camp,
I told him the whole story of what had happened.
He wasn't in the slightest bit judgemental about me or what I'd done, he took it very well.
I must have lowered myself about 25m from where the ice screw was at the bridge.
I was now in what seemed to be the base of the crevice, that was shaped like a big hourglass.
To the ceiling, was probably about 50m.
I think it's as big as the
St. Paul's dome in scale.
I remember looking down, and there was just solid snow.
And I thought, "this is the bottom of the crevice!"
About 15m away from me, there was a slope leading up.
Right at the top, there was the sun coming through this hole.
And it was shining, just this big beam of sunlight coming in.
This was the way out
I'd been looking for!
I remember thinking, "Whoo, I can climb that slope, I bloody well will climb that slope!"
I crawled across this flat floor, and
I started crawling across on my stomach.
Then I heard things breaking away underneath me.
I realized that this wasn't a solid floor, it seemed to be hollow underneath it.
I was absolutely horrified.
It was suddenly, as if
I was on an egg shell.
If I break through, I'll never be able to get across to this slope, and that was my way out.
Alright, I'm on it, this is solid now.
I started to get my axe in and hop up.
That is extremely painful, as your legs hopped up, they both came down together.
I was trying to get into a better position, so that my left foot ain't first.
But I inevitably went onto my broken leg.
I feel the displacement go, the bone move, so every hop I nearly faint.
It was just excruciatingly painful.
And it was a bright sunny day.
Wow, the whole world has come back.
I was Iying on the snow, just laughing.
That was the relief of getting out that place.
And I then looked at the glacier and I thought,
"Well, you haven't even started, mate".
It's kilometers and kilometers and on really bad ground.
But I think I was contemplating just sitting there, because I was coming at this, having done the most serious climb in my life.
You come down safe from a climb like that, you'd be exhausted for days.
You'd just eat and drink and sleep.
I'd just come out of that, I'd badly broken a leg, I was in great pain, highly dehydrated, I had no food, and
I was looking at trying to do that.
Just no way, just no way you're physically gonna do that.
And then it occurred to me that
I should set definite targets.
I started to look at things and think,
"right, if I can get to that crevice over there in 20 minutes",
"that's what I'm gonna do".
If I got there in 18 minutes I was hysterically happy about it, and if I'd gotten 22 or 24 minutes, I was upset almost to the point of tears, and it became obsessive.
I don't know why I did it, I think I knew the big picture of what had happened to me, and what I had to do was so big I couldn't deal with it.
I stayed on Simon's tracks, and they were weaving around over humps, and past obvious crevices and stuff.
I thought, "Well, unless I come to a hole with his body in the bottom of it,"
"these tracks will lead me through the minefield of crevices".
All these huge mountains around you, big mountain walls.
And they do make you feel small and vulnerable.
And you wonder whether there's some malign presence out to get you.
It was like somebody was just teasing an ant, and putting something in its way all the time, and eventually gonna stand on it.
I could see Simon's tracks were filling in.
They were my lifeline off the glacier.
And I started to get very desperate.
I carried on crawling in the dark, a stupid thing to do on the slope of the glacier.
But I was frightened and I was just trying to see Simon's tracks.
In the morning, it was a bright, sunny day, all the tracks had gone.
I started quite early, and every now and then I had to stand up on one leg to try see the way, and then sit down again, and shuffle on.
There was one very horrendous crevice bit right near the edge, and I got into a maze of them.
I suddenly came to a point where I could see ice running down, then I could see rocks.
It was probably me, who brought up the subject of leaving.
Partly 'cause I was worried about Simon.
I just felt it was best to get as far away as possible from where it had happened.
I didn't want to leave immediately,
I felt I needed a day or two just to collect my thoughts, and to regain some strength.
Spend a long time washing myself.
That felt good, to wash my hair and to wash my face, to have a shave, to... get the... get the remnants, the mountain out of my system.
I was desperately thirsty, because it doesn't matter how much snow you eat, you just can't get enough water into your system.
And I saw the rocks, I knew how big these boulders would be and how far it was, and that was the first time that I really thought about, whether I could get the distance.
I got rid of all my gear.
I knew that I couldn't crawl over these rocks, they were just too big and jumbled, and that the only way to do it was to try and hop.
I knew I was gonna fall a lot.
I'd fallen virtually every hop, and it's just like having your leg broken about every time, and I remember looking back where I'd come from, it was just over 20m, and it had taken me ages. And the pain, just of the 20+m...
I can be insanely stubborn.
And I do like to have things my way.
And things were seriously not going my way over these days.
I'd look at a rock and then I'd go,
"Right, I get there in 20 minutes".
Once I decided I was going to get that distance in 20 minutes,
I bloody well was gonna do it.
And it would help me, because I'd get halfway through the distance, and I'd be in such pain,
I just couldn't bear the thought of getting up and falling on again, but I'd look at the target and think "I've got to get there".
And I'd think, when I was
Iying a bit long, and I think,
"no, you gotta get there. You only got
10 minutes left, only 10 minutes left!"
It seemed like there was a very cold, pragmatic part of me that was saying,
"You have to do this, this and this, if you're gonna get there".
"Come on, keep moving, keep moving"
"Right, get up, and do it again"
It was quite insistent, and quite clear.
It was almost like a voice or a separate part of me, telling me to do something.
Very uncaring. No sympathy, no acknowledgement of the fact that I might be tired or hurt.
It was very, very odd.
That part of me kept saying, "Keep moving, stop resting, keep moving", and the other part of me, my mind, anyway, just was, "Alright.", looking around and absorbing things.
And as the hours went, and certainly as the days started to go, it became weirder and weirder.
So I was very, very, very thirsty. Very dehydrated.
And the agonizing thing is, all these boulders, these meringues, are on top of the glacier. And you could hear water running.
All the time.
I'd fall over a lot and I'd hear water and
I'd start digging around searching for it.
Couldn't find it, couldn't get it.
And it was driving me mad, to be able to hear water.
I was worried about Simon.
About his health, 'cause his fingertips were still quite bad from frostbite.
And I just felt it wasn't a place to be lingering in.
We just started getting ready to leave in the morning.
I did eventually collapse amidst the rocks, and I didn't sleep very well.
My leg was very painful. It was agony.
It was the first night, I think, it hadn't stormed.
It didn't snow on me, and it didn't rain. And I could see the stars.
I can remember Iying on my back for what seemed endless periods of time, staring at the stars.
At one point I had this weird sensation that I had been lain there, conscious, for centuries, for lifetimes.
Becoming part of the rocks, and part of where I was never gonna move from.
The sun came up, and it started to warm me.
And I thought it'd be just so nice to just lie there, don't move, and never hurt, and christ, I got so, so close to doing that.
I genuinely believed that I wouldn't make the distance, and I also believed that I was going to die, and I sort of acknowledged it in a very matter-of-fact way.
And it seemed very rational to keep on crawling, if you didn't think it was gonna be of any good.
I think that it was that loneliness, that sense of being abandoned.
It was there all the time.
I didn't crawl, because
I thought I would survive,
I think I wanted to be with somebody when I died.
Probably just a symbolic act to say goodbye to him, in my own mind, by doing that.
I drank liters and liters of it.
And it was just like putting fuel in,
I could feel myself immediately just getting stronger.
I kept wetting myself.
And I can remember actually quite liking the sensation, the warmth of it.
It was just a slow, steady reduction.
Not just physically.
Physically is very obvious, but you, everything, yourself.
I felt left with nothing.
And I didn't care anymore.
Didn't have any dignity, you didn't care whether you're brave or weak or anything.
You just became almost nothing. It was strange.
I was still doing these test 20 minutes things, get here, get there.
And then I saw these footprints.
Then I got convinced, that it was Simon and Richard.
They were up above me, and they were just following on, and I carried on crawling down, utterly convinced that they were wandering along behind me.
And I can remember thinking, "that is really stupid, they would come and help you", and I think I persuaded myself that they were just following on, because they didn't want to embarass me
'cause I peed myself and I was crying.
I don't know how long it lasted, maybe about an hour.
I totally believed it, and then suddenly it was like popping a bubble.
And then I realized that they weren't there, and I felt utterly shattered.
It was about 4 o'clock when I reached the lake.
And I that at the far end of it, there was a meringue dam.
And from the top of that meringue dam,
I would be able to look down into the valley where the base camp was.
In fact, I would be able to see the tents.
This was the first time I thought it,
I thought, "I'm gonna make the distance,
I can actually make the distance".
Almost as soon I thought it, the next thought that popped into my head was,
"Will there be anyone there?"
I thought, "Christ, this is the fourth day since I saw Simon", and as I worked it out, I thought,
"Why on earth would they be there?"
I knew it got dark at six, and thought
"I got to get there, I got to get there", and I was trying to do it as fast as possible.
The rest of that afternoon,
I was plagued by this dreadful feeling that they would have gone.
I hadn't paid attention to what was happening with the weather.
Between leaving at four and getting to the top of the meringues, about six, the weather had changed.
So when I looked down at the valley, it was just full of clouds.
I listened intently, hoping to hear a whistle or an answer, a cry back, something, and I didn't hear anything at all. and I spend a long time, sat there, crying, not sure what to do.
I thought about getting in my sleeping bag.
For some reason it just seemed a bit of a pathetic way to end things, just in a sleeping bag.
I thought, "Well, nice but just keep going, you'll end it down there, somewhere".
I don't know entirely what happened for the rest of that night.
I stopped looking at the watch, and everything just started to go apart.
And I think I just got lost.
And I didn't know what
I was doing anymore.
I don't remember thinking of anyone, anybody I loved or any of that.
I did have one time, when I got a song going through my head.
And it was by a band called Boney M.
And I don't really like Boney M's music.
Brown girl in the ring,
there's a brown girl in the ring,
brown girl in the ring,
she looks like a sugar in a plum,
plum, plum!
Show me your motion,
come on show me your motion,
show me your motion,
And it just went on and on and on, for hours.
I found it very upsetting, 'cause I wanted to try and get it out of my head.
And I wanted to think of other things.
I was thinking, "Bloody hell,
I'm gonna die to Boney M".
I remember sometimes not waking up,
I think I was awake all the time, but coming to, it was like waking up, and sort of find myself sitting there,
I didn't know where I was.
It was pitch black and snowing, and
I'd think I was back on the glacier, or I'd think I was in a public car park, and had been beaten up again, and then I'd just drift off again.
I remember smelling something.
It was a really strong smell.
And it acted like a smelling salt, to cut through all this delerium.
And I remember being really confused,
I couldn't understand what it meant.
It took me ages to to try and work out what it meant.
I thought it was me.
And very slowly, I worked it out, and I thought,
"I've crawled through the latrine area of our camp site".
And I realized then, that
I was close to the tents.
As I was shouting it, I thought, "This is it, this is as far as this game goes".
I'm not capable of going any further.
I made the mistake of having a little bit of hope, that they'd still be there.
And when I shouted, and they weren't there,
I sort of knew I was dead then.
That moment, when no one answered the call, it was... I lost something.
I lost me.
I woke up, not knowing why.
And was aware of this kind of strange atmosphere,
I could hear the wind howling outside the tent.
And started hearing something.
It did slowly dawn on me, that really the only thing it could be, would be Joe outside shouting.
But that was completely impossible, because he was dead, and he died 3 or 4 days ago.
And then head it again, much sharper, and it really sounded like somebody shouting. Simon.
I can have gotten into a panic, but first, it couldn't be Joe, because Joe's dead.
And then, if he is out there, it's gonna be this horrible thing, it can't be a human being, because, no human being can possibly go through that, and be outside the tent.
I was just kind of Iying there, really not knowing what to do.
And then Simon woke up.
"Simon!", it was quite clearly a shout of my name.
I knew it was Joe actually,
I knew immediately.
I was looking around, and then
I saw this thing, floating.
Of course Simon exploded into action.
Suddenly I heard voices.
Is that you?
I was holding back, because I didn't feel that was a human being out there.
And we went back up the stream, right from where these cries had come from, about maybe 60-80 m outside the camp, and there was Joe.
I couldn't completely believe it, until I actually saw him, but then it was still a little difficult to believe that, because of the eerie night and the state he was in.
Absolutely awful state.
It was almost like he was a sort of ghost-like figure.
It was like I had to sort of pinch myself almost to believe this was true, that this was really happening.
Help me!
- Oh fuck, Joe!
Simon, he was swearing a lot. Swearing a lot.
Richard, lift him!
Richard, hold him, you stupid bastard! Lift him!
I remember Simon grabbing my shoulders, and holding me.
I remember that.
That feeling of being held.
He thanked me for trying to get him down the mountain, for all that I'd done up to the point, where I cut the rope, and he said to me, "I'd have done the same".
Those were the first words he uttered to me.
And I remember, before we'd done anything to him, before we'd even close the door, he said, "Where are my trousers?"
We had to explain, that we burned his trousers, which made him quite angry.
And I think that kind of brought me back into life, to some extend. realizing it was the same old Joe, back again.

They were the days of American innocence, of "Father knows best".
Lady Day passed on and Fats
Domino enticed the nation to visit Blueberry Hill.
Elvis Presley burst out of
Mississippi like a tornado, gathering followers from every sphere of American life.
There was a cultural tidal wave in his hips and music.
Radio stations flooded the country with this new sound from the South.
{\an3}But the roots of that music, the originators remained unknown.
These pioneers of R&B, could be found in the far reaches of the radio dial, playing soulfully for their loyal fans.
But they were confined to frustration, as they watched their white counterparts triumph, with the style they'd created.
Struggling to find the key to mainstream America's heartbeat, scores of black artists and record companies searched for a new sound, that would free them from the race music label.
In Detroit, that sound arrived...

- You know about Motown;
- Oh yes.
- You know a lot about music?
- I... I like to think so.
- Yes, I'm from Detroit.
- Yeah!
- Motown, yeah sure, the sound of Detroit.
- I know a little.. too much about music.
- What's your favourite
Motown group?
- Well, I wouldn't say group,
I'd go with Marvin Gaye.
- I have to say it's Smokey
Robinson, probably.
- Well, of course Stevie Wonder.
- I love the Supremes.
- Four Tops.
- Would you happen to know who played the music on the Supremes albums?
You know, the instruments and stuff?
- I have no idea.
- Did you ever think about that?
- Mm.. I think about it with-.. No,
I haven't actually.
- You know who played the music for Smokey;
- Mmm.. no (...)
- It's the Miracles.

Who are they?

I would believe it.

People will ask "Well, what is the Μotown sound? They've asked producers,
{\an9}they've asked executives from Μotown, well, what was the Motown sound?
It was the musicians. OK?
{\an3}When these cats cut tracks, it really..
{\an3}- no offence to any of the great artists that sang on them, but anybody could've sung on them. You can add (...) singing on some of the stuff, it would've been a hit, because the tracks were just so incredible... they were musical entities on to themselves.
{\an3}They had a natural filthy music, you know, they were just that exceptional.
{\an3}Being really good jazz musicians, they could swing like crazy, and that's something that's not always present in pop music.
The bass drum had a note. It wasn't a dead pfff... It was the boom, so you had boom...
When there's a groove like that, the subliminal effect is everybody feels good.
{\an1}They were the groundwork. They were the things, that everything else was built on.
{\an3}It was like a river.
Constantly flowing.
{\an3}Talent, creations, you know, people coming, you know..
Who's available, who's on the list?
Well, call him in. Where are they?
Are they out of town?
This one's out of town.
Well, call the other one.
But it was always the Funk Brothers..
Always the Funk Brothers..
First!
Without them, there really wouldn't be a Μotown.
That was the sound, that was the foundation.
That was the essence of Μotown.
That essence was an overpowering line-up of veteran groove masters and trailblazing virtuosos.
Guitarists Eddie Willis,
Joe Messina and Robert White.
And keyboardists Johnny Griffith,
Joe Hunter and Earl Van Dyke, wove an irresistible tapestry of instrumental hooks and counter rhythms, over the electrifying core of the Motown groove.
A core comprised of James Jamerson, the tormented genius of the Motown bass.
And late era bassist,
Bob Babbitt.
Percussionists, Jack Ashford and Eddie "Bongo" Brown.
Drummers, Uriel Jones,
"Pistol" Allen, and the explosive Benny
"Papa Zita" Benjamin, the creator of the
Motown drumbeat.
The dance-floors of the world didn't stand a chance!

After World War II, the auto industry boom turned Detroit into an economic magnet for people in search of steady work.
Tens of thousands migrated to the city.
Among them, several future Funk Brothers.
Actually, Jamerson came from South Carolina,
{\an3}Eddie Willis came from Mississippi,
{\an3}Pistol came from Memphis, Tennessee and I'm from Jackson, Tennessee.
We came north, mostly our people came north, to get jobs in the car factories here in Detroit, Michigan.
And I worked at Chevrolet myself, I worked at Chevrolet for about a year and a half.. and the last thing we wanted to do was work in the factories, we really wanted to play music and that's what we ended up doing, the Funk Brothers ended up playing music.
{\an3}<font color="#ff8000">Baker's, located at the intersection of 8 Mile Road and Livernois,</font>
<font color="#ff8000">has been a Detroit jazz institution for over 50 years.</font>
Berry showed up down at
Little Sam's one time and he walked over by the bandstand, while we were playing and he said to me, "Would you have time to talk to me?"
I says, "I got more time than money!"
{\an3}and he explained to me what he was about.
{\an3}He wanted to set up a record company and.. he needed good musicians.
I thought it was a wonderful idea and wanted to know, did I know anybody to fill the thing.
He already knew Mr Benjamin,
Benny Benjamin "Papa Zita".
So, actually he called the first rehearsal over to
Claudette's house,
Smokey Robinson's wife at that time.
That was late '58.
And then Papa Ζita was already there and I was there.
We eventually found the great
James Jamerson on bass.
{\an9}I remember my dad saying as a child growing up, that he would take
{\an9}a stick and take a rubber band, and put one part of the rubber band
{\an3}at one end and the other part at the other, and stick it in an ant hole.
And make the ants dance!
When he was a kid on Edisto Island,
James and his friends would slip through a window into their little, two-room school house, they'd light a fire and play the piano, until class started.
After school, they'd continue making music in a neighbour's vacant summer home, where there just happened to be an old piano and an upright bass.
{\an1}But the most important pointer that my father taught me ah, when I'm playing, if I don't feel it, don't play it.
{\an6}And you know, a lot of guys would just play straight...♪ there were no feeling, but he would play it like...♪ you know, put something in it. He just felt life, you know, that life was music.
And he used to tell this story like.. this one song he did, he saw a fat woman walking down the street and her butt going boom da-boom...
And that was his interpretation of music, sort of..
He put music to, just about in anything that had life to it.
There's an indentment right here in the bass, where he kept his thumb, right here, as a rest.
That's how old this bass is.
So you can see all the dirt on here.
As he used to say, the dirt keeps the funk!
This has been the original bass ever since he started playing, before he switched over to Precision.
{\an3}He used this on Heat Wave,
My Guy, Shop Around,
{\an3}most of the Mary
Wells stuff,
{\an3}You Beat Me To The Punch, some other earlier stuff with Stevie.
And he played with one finger on all those hits, just like this,.. the finger was called "the hook" and it would hook like this and all the songs that you heard, basically was done with one finger.
I have trouble playing with two fingers, the line that he played, so!
You couldn't even touch his timing, because he could hear another time in his head and be playing cut-time against what you're playing. And it would fit!
{\an1}There was never a bass player, on no coast end
{\an1}there was West Coast, East Coast, whatever coast you wanna call it, that was comparable to a James Jamerson.
{\an3}It's the height of creativity, you know and freedom and experimentation
{\an3}and fearlessness. You have to be absolutely fearless to play those notes in that place and... and yet be responsible for your, for the bottom of the groove like that.
I thought bass playing was played like that all the time, but little did I know that it was my father changing the course of bass.
Soon about 1960, Berry bought a house on West Grand Boulevard.
This house had a garage, with a dirt floor.
Walk down the four, time-worn, wooden steps into the basement of 2648, West Grand Blvd. and you enter a fantasy land.
A tiny, dimly-lit room, with smoke stained walls, where dreams came true for Motown's young stars.
A place where timeless classics like I Can't Help Myself,
Shop Around and Where did our love go, were born.
This is Hitsville USA, the home of the Motown sound.
But to the musicians who worked there, it was just Studio A, affectionately referred to as: The Snakepit!
It was the site of countless, steamy, 4 A.M. sessions, where monster hits were cranked out, in an hour or less.
A place where deadly grooves threatened to set the walls on fire!
This was the home of Motown's studio band, the Funk Brothers.
{\an1}- Smokey was the main one that would pull this off.
{\an3}He'd dream of a song. He'd come in the studio with something
{\an3}written down, maybe 2 bars or
2 verses of it all on paper.
It's basically, "Hey man, I got a tune.
What do you think of this?"
And he'd play it, next thing you know, Joe would say, "Well, this is what you're trying to play."
And he'd give him the chords and full structure, next thing you know
"Hey, hey, come, come here James."
And he'd make James play this line, and in a minute you'd have a song.
That's how the studio was
every day. And they'd fight to get in Studio A.
{\an6}This is the first time we've been in here to play, since the '70s. Lot of these people come here for the first time. They have no idea what's in here.
Because, along with our creativity, was Berry's prayers in here, that we will be successful in what we were doing, to make those hits.
{\an1}And then we used to hear it in his voice.
We used to hear the way he used to
{\an1}talk to us, we used to hear the artists, how they would talk to us.
{\an1}Lot of prayers where in this building.
Wasn't it Joe?
- Yeah. True.
You have no idea the gravity of what went on, emotionally.
I swear to God, when I went in there tonight,
I get this feeling, I can almost touch it.
It never left that room.
- Yeah, it's a strange feeling.
- It never left that room.
It's in there.

{\an6}I was playing up in Boston,
Massachussets, when
I ran into Marvin Gaye.
I didn't know who he was and someone from his entourage said,
"I want you to meet a famous singer."
I said, OK. And he said,
"His name is Marvin Gaye."
{\an3}So, I didn't realize Marvin was standing with the guy,
I didn't know who he was, so, he said,
"Have you ever heard of Marvin Gaye?"
I said, "Nah.. never heard of him. If he don't play jazz, I don't know him."
I was kinda cocky, 'cos all jazz musicians were cocky.
Everybody wanted to be like Miles Davis,
...no matter what instruments you played.
{\an3}So I talked with Marvin and he was telling me about, he was starting a band,
{\an3}and would I like to come to
Detroit. So, no musician turns down a good gig.
So I said I'd come.
{\an7}- Was this like a.. garage area or?
- Garage. Yeah, it was a dirt floor. from the beginning. They had a piece of plywood in this area
{\an3}with the piano sitting, right there.
{\an3}And the walls had.. carpeting.. cinder block. - Yeah.
- And the entrance was right about there.
{\an3}You know, not being a bass player, not being a guitar player, not being a drummer,
{\an3}arrangers would come in and just have a general idea of.. or concept, and would leave it up to the masters.
{\an3}We were allowed 4 songs in a 3 hour session.
And we were to get no less than 2.
But that's because the same guys played together all the time.
So, I mean, the only thing that changed was the changes.
And, it was like a home then, we spent so much time there.
It was always usually Jamerson kicking something off.. and everybody falling in, either Benny.
Benny kicked something off,
Jamerson had something to throw in, that fitted. And, then everybody could come in.
Back then, you guys would have to do the tune, all in one take.
- Yes. - Yeah, oh yeah.
- From beginning to end. Yes.
- In the earlier days they only had 3 tracks to work with.
- I think it was a great school for mixing, because you had to learn how to mix, 'cos you had one shot at it.
- You only had one shot at it and you had to get it right the first time.
- That's right.
We felt as it was our job to really lay the groundwork for these kids, to have as a place to really develop their careers in singing, because we had the experience. They had the talent, we had the experience.
{\an1}- They were really young, right?
- Oh, they were very young,
{\an1}most of the producers were young.
In fact, all of the producers were young.
There was a bunch of fellas standing around, drinking a little wine, called "The Contours".
And we was up there doing a funny band track, something I'd never heard before, you know, and had the charts out.. we start playing, you know.. start playing the charts, when the director came up there.
And after we finished, I say
"That will never be a hit".
And the Contours walked up to each one of us, like... like little kid eating ice-cream..
"Oh, thank you. Thank you, that's a beautiful band crack -track."
And I said, "They're crazy..."
<font color="#ffff80">♪ Do You Love Me
The Contours (1962)</font>
In the early days of Motown, the Funk
Brothers played on some big hits like:
The Miracles - Shop Around,
The Marvelettes - Please Mr Postman and Mary Wells - You
Beat Me To The Punch.
{\an3}But still, there was not enough recording work
{\an3}down in the Snakepit to make a living.
{\an3}So in 1961, James Jamerson, Joe Hunter and a few of the other band members left to go on the road with Jackie Wilson.
But Wilson was recovering from a gunshot wound and didn't have the strength to perform more than once or twice a week.
Realizing their new situation was worse, they returned home to Motown, where Berry
Gordy welcomed them back with open arms.
But their touring days were not yet over...
{\an3}- Like in the early 60s, you went out with the Marvelettes, - Right.
- I went out with Marvin, you know, and Stevie Wonder - Yeah.
{\an1}and then we did gigs, maybe, you know,
200 miles outside Detroit, occasionally.
- That weren't nothing. - Yeah, Joe.
- The first really big tour was the 1962, - Yeah. - Motown Revue. - Right.
- Where we had 31 nighters and New England, and then the South, and then 10 days at the Apollo.
- Oh, man. That's a long streak.
- And that was the 3 of us.
In all that was the 3 of us.
We were on the road, you know and coming back from up North, on a gig..
- Yeah. - And.. everyone was packed in the car, half sleeping, everything.. and you know, as I think back on that,
Marvin Gaye was the drummer on that gig, wasn't it?
- Yeah.. that was ridiculous.
- I think he was a better singer, though.
- You know, that's right.
{\an3}- And they had us in this big old station-wagon. - Right.
{\an3}- It was about 2 o' clock in the morning.
- Right. - And it was freezing.
- And Jamerson in the car with us.
- Ain't that something. - Damn...
- And about 10 degrees outside, we were coming down the mountain side.
We were all dozing off, we told all the jokes we could think of.
And Jamerson says, "Can you pull the car over?
Robert, can you pull the car over?"
What you doing, man? Hurry up, man, it's cold outside.
So he pulls over to the side of the road, goes back there to get to the trunk, pulls his brown paper-bag out.
Jumps back in the car, he decides to put his pyjamas on, in the back of the car.
- In order for me to go to sleep, I got to put my pj's on.
He's bumping people on the sides and slamming people's heads...
And everybody's complaining now..
Everybody settles back down, 'cos we knew about being around Jamerson, you try to keep him as tranquil as possible, because he could really get out there.
Then all of a sudden, that bag rustles again.
- Oh, man...
- Oh my God, he got pigs feet..
Smelled like someone kicked the dog on a skunk on the behind.
Everybody really got ticked about that, 'cos it was.. rancid!
So man, we raised so much Cain in that end, you know, he says, OK, OK...
- All right, all right, I might put the top back on. I might! - Come on, man.
- That stuff stinks, man. - Just because, you know, just to keep the peace.
So he put the lid back on.
So he's sitting back.
Everybody's kinda dozing again.
And we see a light, light in the back. Somebody lit a match.
It's Jamerson!
He lights his funky, smokey cigar.
- Hey, Rob.
- That's it! Man, pull the car over.
They say, hey man, pull the car.
We're putting him out.
So sure enough, Robert pulls over to the side. Out goes James, with his funky pig's feet, his pyjamas and his cigar.
♪ The way you smell so sweet, you know, you could've been some perfume... ♪
- That's right. And as Jamerson faded, we thought about it. We had to run over his butt!
{\an3}Benny played with Dizzy,
Charlie Parker, Ray Charles,
{\an3}Lowell Fulson, Muddy Waters,
Jimmy Reed, Chuck Berry..
{\an3}Benny played with the best was out there.
He was the main, standard drummer and I was the pianist at that time.
And before Earl got there. Anyway, we liked to frequent the corn liquor places. He had a taste for corn liquor.
So this day we went and, we hadn't had too much sleep.
And Benny was up there, they was doing a tune called "Hitch-hike", by Marvin Gaye. They kicked off the tune and Benny was nodding and dropped his sticks.
So, the A&R men went up there and smelled his breath.
He said "Benny, I said you've been drinking.
Benny!" He picked up the sticks real quick and he said "Papa-zita, papa-zita, papa-zita"
So after that, everybody in the studio started calling him Papa Zita.
{\an3}He come in the studio one time late and he told Berry, said
{\an3}"Man, I was on my own, on the freeway, on my way here, say, the traffic got tied up, 'cos a circus had just come into town, and the truck had an accident and the elephants got out of the truck and got loose and was holding up the traffic.
And everybody knew he was lying, 'cos - guess what - Benny didn't even drive!
First of all, Benny was a master at locking the tempo.
He's like a, like a metronome.
He would lock it, see.
And then he had certain kinds of pick-ups, which were only unique to him.
For instance, a Benny Benjamin pick-up would go like this...
{\an3}like that... you know...
That's different. OK?
Uriel Jones would play, you know...
Then, if I would play it 4 bars or something like that, I'd play...
All three of those pick-ups came from Papa Zita,
Benny Benjamin, you know, he originated them.
- I'm really curious as to how you all got the name "The Funk Brothers"?
- Look here, one day when
Benny got ready to leave, he walked up them steps and Benny said,
"You all are the Funk Brothers".
And I'll remember that all of my days, all of my days. And we are the Funk Brothers.

{\an3}I was raised in Detroit. I studied classics, for about 10-12 years.
Then I found out I couldn't make any money doing that, so
I went on a rampage of singers,
I worked for so many hours at companies.
So I did some work with Sarah Vaughan,
I did some work with Lou
Rawls and Dinah Washington.
She was the Queen of the Blues, supposedly, at that time, you know, until Aretha, they crowned Aretha the new Queen of the Blues,
I was working with her at that time.
So I worked with both the Queens.
{\an3}I was working in a club and first Mickey Stevenson came by.
{\an3}And then he told me, how would I like to be a studio musician.
I said, "Well, what is that?", he said,
"Well, come by the studio and listen to what Joe is doing and work from that point." I said, "OK, fine".
So, I went by there and
Joe was doing this record, was Pride & Joy, or something like that.
So I sit and I say, "What the hell are you doing?"
You know, 'cos we never played to nobody singing, and the tracks.. you just cut the tracks and you just play.
I said, "Well, how do you know what to play?", 'cos I was used to accompanying.
So he said, "Well, just play what you wanna play",
They don't know what they're listening to, anyway.
Just play." He said, "If it's too much, they'll let you know."
He was my.. introduction to the, you know, R&B record scene.
{\an3}Joe was the man round town, as far as recording, he'd been recording for everybody.
{\an1}Actually, my mother, she could teach up to around about the 3d grade of music.
{\an1}So she had a lot of little students in the area.
Of course, I was out trying to shoot marbles and play football with the rest, they didn't think I had any talent.
But I'd be listening to everything that she was practically teaching, when
I was in the living room.
Actually, I thought it was a spiritual thing really, the way that it came about, I was trying to play Stormy Weather, it looked like the keys was just going by themselves and
I was trying to stick my hands into those holes and catch up with the keys.
When my grand-mother came in, she says,
"Donna", that's what she called my mother, she says, "This boy is in here playing Stormy Weather"
My favourite classical pianist was Rachmaninov.
I heard him, he had such a terrific left hand, and I said, "I wish my left hand could be like that", you know.
So I'd put my right hand in my pocket and just play with my left, trying to get as fast as Art
Tatum and Rachmaninov.
In the 1960s, jazz clubs were springing up all over Detroit, with names like, "The Flame
Show Bar, Phelp's Lounge, The Apex,
The 20 Grand and The Chit-Chat."
These venues were oases, where the Funk Brothers could escape the pressure cooker atmosphere of the studio, by returning to their roots and playing cool jazz, into the wee hours of the morning.
New ideas that hatched in these spirited jam sessions, often shimmied their way into the Snakepit, adding new textures and rhythms to the Motown sound.
{\an3}My stage name was,
"Lottie-the Body"
{\an3}and I had a beautiful body.
I was exotic dancer, one of the greatest exotic dancers in the world.
As a matter of fact, I consider being the greatest.
And I worked with small bands, big-big orchestras,
Teddy Harris' big orchestra,
I worked with Count Basie..
- You had to know how.. if she moved one cheek, there's a certain drum she wanted you to hit.
If she moved the left leg, it was a certain drum you had to hit.
And you had to catch all this stuff, plus keeping rhythm with the band.
You know, but after you worked with her a while, you feel her out and it was a little easier, but the first time I worked with her.. oh, I swore I would not do it again.
- I'm sorry, darling.
- You feel like it? - Yeah, let's do it baby.
- Don't kill me, baby!
Make me feel good.
Lot of rhythms that we did do in the studio, were rhythms that came from working with Lottie.
Because we weren't doing too much, what you call it, Afro-Cuban, you know.
So.. both Grapevines, Marvin Gaye's like... and Gladys'... All that's Latin stuff.
Well, we did all that stuff with Lottie.
This is the spot where a whole lot of stuff happened.
The third, 1-2-3, the third door over there.
That's where the Chit-Chat was.
When I was coming here, today, earlier, when I passed by here,
{\an7}I looked over here, I said, "Oh, there they are!" It couldn't be no clearer.
{\an3}The Chit-Chat was the place.
Though it was small,
{\an3}everybody in Detroit knew about the Chit-Chat and knew what was happening at the Chit-Chat.
With Motown being not that far down the street here, you had any Motown act would show up at the Chit-Chat.
From Marvin.. to Four Tops,
Contours, the Originals, the Temps..
- We were still at.. really enjoying our jazz thing there, you know.
- We'd do things here, that we would do in the session the next day.
- Right. - You know,
I mean we would do things, like for instance that was the uniqueness of the Funk Brothers, because, and we were doing a tune and and a change was similar to something, in one of the jazz tunes that we played.
Earl would say,
"Well, do so-and-so, like we did last night". And we would interject that into the change of the song.
And then the song would take on a different colour, something that they hadn't planned on but of course the producers.. "Oh, man, that's it!" And they had a hit.
The Funk Brothers ruled the night-life of Detroit's club scene, in the 60s.
But their realm was a rough and tumble world.
Where getting paid at the end of the evening, often proved as challenging
{\an3}as the music they were playing.
{\an3}Benny was working with us. And Benny used to go in there in the daytime, when we weren't working and drink.
And sometime I think, the waitresses would, sort of put a high tab on him, than anything else.
But when the owner got ready to pay us off, he reached up in his thing and put out a great, big, old, fat gun, looked like a German Lucas 45, and popped it on the table and he looked around at each one of us.
And said, "Well, you know your drummer, Benny has over-tabbed".
He says, "In fact, he's gone into y'alls money."
So, at that particular time, Jamerson pulled out a piece, his piece and laid it down
He says, "I got to feed my family" -he looked. And Robert White pulled out a piece nobody expected Robert to pull out a piece, and he laid his down.
And he looked around and I pull out my little 22 and laid it down.
He said, "What kind of band have I got here?"
He got so confused, until he even paid Benny.
He paid everybody.
{\an3}Motown was really, it was America's introduction.. to Soul music.
{\an3}It was America's introduction to Soul music.
And Soul music is powerful, soul music makes you believe.
Soul music gives you hope in the way that you feel.
In the way that you wanna feel, you know.
And that's what was coming out of the sounds I heard these men making, as a child. It gave me unconscious hope.
I didn't know why. You know, it gave my father hope.
So for years and years, players and producers have been trying to.. find that magic Motown sound and pack it.
As if it's some sort of a formula.
People would always say everything but  the musicians.
They would say it was the artist, the producers, the way the building was structured, or the wood in the floor, or maybe even food.
You know, but I'd like to see them take some BBQ ribs or hamburgers, anything and throw it down in the studio, shut the door and count out, 1-2-3-4, and get a hit out of that.
The formula was the musicians.
- I'll be Earl Van Dyke.
Let me give an example. We gonna take "Ain't too proud to beg", which I think everybody is familiar with.
All right Uriel, give it to me.
You and Pistol. ♪
I'm gonna put a little bass in there.
All right. Now bring a little bit guitars in here for you.... 1-2-3-4...  ♪
All right. Now we'll bring a little Johnny
Griffith, with the keyboard in there. ♪
You see how that feels?  ♪

<font color="#ff8000">Motown producer Johnny Bristol said
The Funk Brothers "breathed together".</font>
<font color="#ff8000">He once recalled a session where one of the guys</font>
<font color="#ff8000">went out to get a sandwich, came back five minutes later,</font>
<font color="#ff8000">and fell back into the groove as if he'd never left.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Motown engineering graduated to 8-track</font>
<font color="#ff8000">recording, using hand-built machines</font>
<font color="#ff8000">that opened the sonic spectrum and allowed room</font>
<font color="#ff8000">for the sophisticated arrangements cited next.</font>
By the time The Funk Brothers recorded Jimmy Ruffin's,
{\an3}What Becomes of the
Broken Hearted, in 1966, the Motown sound had travelled a great distance from the twist records and blues and do-wop influenced tracks of its early days.
{\an9}Advances in recording technology
{\an9}and an influx of skilled arrangers and composers, had brought about new levels of sonic clarity and musical sophistication.
{\an9}But the most noticeable difference was power. Raw power.
{\an9}The added muscle coincided with the emergence of keyboardist Earl Van Dyke, as one of the central figures down in Studio A.
He was a natural born leader, whose forceful playing style was jokingly called
"gorilla piano".
Van Dyke became the hub through which
Motown's producers and arrangers often communicated their ideas to the band.
{\an3}He was like the glue for everything. Earl
{\an3}was, you know, he's a solid keyboard, you know, he'd have the piano rocking, actually rocking. That's why we call him "Big Funk", OK?
They'd have to have a piano tuner come in and really redo things, after Earl got through playing, see, because he put so much muscle into it.
When Earl came in, that's when we developed the style of two pianos playing, not together, but accompanying each other.
{\an7}But there were so many good days among the musicians in the studio.
{\an7}- You guys had fun.
- We had fun, we had fun, you know,
And much like I said before, there were kids
{\an9}like Stevie, who we could never get rid of.
{\an9} Stevie liked to hang out with the guys.
You know, behind me and the musicians,
{\an9}so we could never really get rid of Stevie.
And Stevie's always been..
Stevie and the Four Tops,
Marvin Gaye, Bobby Taylor.. all the guys have always been my, our favourites.
He was part of the foundation of Motown.
He was one of the first ones to teach me piano.
{\an1}A lot of the people here today are really people that were the musical foundation of Motown.
Earl was a great man. And most of all a spiritual man.
Stevie came here with
Mr Paul, Clarence Paul.
They were standing on the steps, as you go into the studio, when we got through doing the little di-di, the first thing he walked over to was the piano, where I was. He says,
"Oh, I like the way you play the piano."
Bahm, I showed him a few chords, he said, "What's that?" I say,
"Well that's the E flat major and I'm throwing a colour tone in there, which is the flatted filth and so forth and so on..
"Yeah!", he shook his head, "yeah" you know. And so finally,
I found out about a year later, he didn't need me!
He had learned more than I'd learned!
And the same thing with Benny. Benny taught him how to hold his wrists
{\an7}and how to use those sticks. And
I don't think he needed Benny.
- With anybody he worked with.
- Yeah.
When I started playing music, I didn't start on the drums, I was playing trombone.
{\an1}At the same time I played trombone, I was training down at Brewster Centre.
{\an1}You know, boxing. And I was determined to do both of them.
But it was kind of hard, 'cos they was kicking my butt at Brewster and when I come to class to play trombone, my lip be all sore,
I might be trying to play at the side of my mouth, you know.
So my music teacher told me, "Man, you gotta make up your mind, you gonna either box or you gonna be a musician." you know. So I said, OK. so, that's when I started playing drums.
And so, I didn't have a full set of drums,
I had a snare drum, I had a high-hat,
I don't know what I was using for a cymbal, I don't remember.
But I know my bass drum was one of those old, heavy cardboard beer cases. And, to the day,
I have never found a sound, that sounds as good as that beer case did.
{\an1}We were sneaking around town, different studios...
{\an1}United Sound... - PAC-3
- PAC-3, you know and.. we was doing a little outside moonlighting, yeah.
- You weren't supposed to, but you had...
- No, see, 'cos these guys, some of these guys were under contract. You know, exclusive contracts, you know.
So, Motown they wanted to keep their sound. - Yeah.
- Which.. I guess they was paying for it, I guess. A few bucks..
So they started putting spies around, man, in different places, you know.. like in hidden cars and behind buildings and.. the Sherper's that was near the studio, they had spies like that around, you know.
{\an1}They offered me $100 a week to be a spy.
{\an1}- How much? - A hundred.
- $100 a week. - One hundred dollars.
{\an1}Extra hundred bucks a week. So, naturally, I took it, I say,
"Well, yeah", you know. 'Cos, threw it all in the pot. It's all the same to me.
So, I had no intentions of spying on anybody, anyway.
When they see us coming out, there'd be at least a couple of them on the stake, you know...
"We caught you! You fired, you fired, you're fired" and... this is real, and they say to Jack,
"You're fired twice!
Because we saw you coming out of there yesterday!"
Finally they call me in, say, "Look, we're paying you and you haven't told us anything.
Who's doing what?"
Well, I said, "Nothing happened." They say,
"No, we got pictures of people coming out of the studios and..", you know,
"as a result, you're fired."
So I say, "Wait a minute. How can you fire me?" I said, "Now, from what I've seen,
James Bond and all these guys", I said, "you're a spy, you get a
Maserati or you get a.."
I said, "You gonna give me $100 a week,
I can't even buy gas." you know.
So, they said, "Well, look.. we still fire you."
So I lost my job as a spy, but they let me continue to play piano.
Even during Motown's golden period, when Hitsville sessions were going on around the clock, the Funk Brothers were still dashing all over Detroit, recording for any studio or record label, that offered them another opportunity to create some magic.
Among the hits recorded outside of Motown were Jackie Wilson's Higher & Higher,
John Lee Hooker's Boom-Boom-Boom and the Capitols hit dance tune, Cool Jerk.
<font color="#ffff80">♪ The Capitols
Cool Jerk (1966)</font>
<font color="#ff8000">The "few bucks" Eddie mentioned rose from an initial $5 per track, in late '59,</font>
<font color="#ff8000">to the union scale of $52.50 per 3-hour session, in 1964.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Most of the Funks were salaried employees, earning a steady income</font>
<font color="#ff8000">they could augment with outside gigs.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Between 1962 and 1975, 75% of all
Motown releases made the Pop charts.</font>
In the mid 60s, Motown was a permanent fixture at the top of the Billboard charts.
As their artists chalked up one Nr1 hit after another,
{\an6}they began to emerge as some of the brightest stars
{\an3}in the galaxy of R&B and pop music.
{\an3}But the Funk Brothers remained earthbound and unknown.
{\an3}While they were beginning to share some of the financial success,
{\an3}they missed out on that elusive entity: glory.
Their last great tour, before they became totally studio bound opened their eyes to what fame could mean.
It was the acclaimed, 1965
Tamla-Motown revue, that took England by storm.
- What amazed me, they actually knew the musicians.
When we got off of the plane, in
London, these little British guys
{\an7}come running up to us with these signs.
And I say, "Who are these guys?"
They walked up and said, "We're the
James Jamerson appreciation fan club."
I said, James Jamerson... and he's not even with us.
Well, maybe I be James Jamerson.
I could use a fan club.
{\an3}While Motown invaded the UK, the
British were invading the US, armed with some American weapons, Motown tunes.
The Beatles landed in New York with cover versions of Please Mr Postman,
Money and You Really Got a Hold on Me, in their musical arsenal.
John Lennon remarked that the Motown drummer hit his snare with so much force, it sounded like he hit it with a bloody tree!
There was no doubt they were listening to
Motown's musicians, and listening hard.
In subsequent years, other
British bands covered
Motown hits, including the Rolling
Stones, with their renditions of
Ain't Too Proud to Beg, My Girl and Going to a Go-Go.
The Funk Brothers musical influence had spread to musicians all over the world.
Whether they knew it or not.
- You know in the mid 60s, when we were at Motown, we were pretty hot and we would have producers lined up back to back, waiting to get into the studio, to work with us.
{\an7}They didn't even consider the fact that it was a 12-hour or 14-hour day sometimes.
Rig means, when you play the song so much until it begins to get stiff,
{\an7}and everybody's tired, you say
"Rigor mortis" is here now.
'Cos you exhausted your creativity on it, you know.
Which happened sometimes, because especially when we had a producer, that we told him he was wasting his money, then he was gonna prove to us that he wasn't... "Take 64!"
He'd start flogging us...
..wasn't nothing really gonna happen then.
So we had to find some place to relax, because it was really a pressure cook in the Snakepit, at that time.
One time Earl came up and said, that he'd found a funeral parlour, that we could go and hide out. So we would just do this, you know, on many occasions,
'cos as I said, we were cutting 7 days a week.
The studio finally found out where we were hanging out. And then
Motown sent somebody over there from management to knock on the door, to find out where we were hiding.
- What's that smell?
- Just a little embalming fluid.
Earl had had the funeral director trained what to say, in the event that someone would come over there.
- But I really, really have to go.
- Well, wait! I wanna show you how to use
my saw and bone-crusher.
We would fall out laughing.
- You're not gonna believe this. I was forced to play a tambourine.
- In church? - No, no.
- Where? - With Charles Harris.
Came to the rehearsal one day with a big tambourine, it looked like a dish pan.
- Right.
- I'd never touched one.
So I got finished doing my solo, he said, "Pick the tambourine up, man",
I said, "Hell, no!" He said,
"Pick the tambourine", he got angry, 'cos I wouldn't pick the tambourine up.
So I pick the damn tambourine up...
I didn't know what happened.
And I said, "Damn, this feels good."
And I start playing and the tambourine just took on a life of its own.
{\an9}I came from Memphis, Tennessee.
And I started,
{\an9}first beginning with the drums and everything..
{\an3}I started in a commerce class, you know, on a raw typewriter, you know?
I wanted to be a CP Engineer, so we had to take typing class, you know.
So, I was sitting there at the desk and
I listen to drum beats, so I wind up playing drum beats on the typewriter.
So the teacher said, "Hey, what do you wanna do? Play the drums or be CPE?"
I said, "I think I'm gonna play the drums." So she kicked me out and that's how I really got into playing drums, and I moved to Detroit..
West End, with Kenny Burrell,
Pepper Adams, all the guys, and got into jazz thing. And then, while at the 20 Grand, with Levi Mann, Benny used to come in and play some of the shows,
I met Benny Benjamin and Benny said, "Hey man, you sound good.
Why don't you come down?" He said, "Look come, you can play this stuff, it's easy.
All you got to do is play... and keep your mouth closed." "Fine." I got in.
Grapevine, the beat on the tom-tom like that, you came like all hitting in the one, so you took it and put a backbeat to it, like... put a backbeat to it.
So Chank, Joe Messina.. the 3 guitars.. and so
Jamerson came in... so Chank, Joe and Robert came an octave ahead of, you know, Jamerson.. that's when the funk got to get in. But you got to have the head action in the tune. ♪
- Turn the tape on!
<font color="#ffff80">♪ I Heard it Through The Grapevine
Gladys Knight & the Pips / Marvin Gaye (1966/68)</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Producer Whitfield fought with Berry Gordy for the release of Marvin's version.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">It was stuck on an album more than a year later.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Radio found it and forced its release as a single, in Nov. '68,</font>
<font color="#ff8000">when it became Motown's most successful record, to that point.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Marvin's "Grapevine" was Nr 1
 in the U.S. and the UK,</font>
<font color="#ff8000">staying on top the U.S. R&B chart for nearly 2 months.</font>
We were all quite happy about the success of Grapevine.
At the same time it was a "mixed emotion" type thing going on.
Benny Benjamin he had a drug problem.
Bad drug problem and.. was just about at the bottom.
But at one point, Benny kind of disappeared for a couple of weeks. So Earl, you know, started trying to find out what happened to him.
And he.. he found Benny. And Earl came in, just when the session started, he just said, "Guys, I don't think there's gonna be no session, see..
Benny just died." And that was...
- It turned everybody around.
- Yeah, we didn't do no session that day.
- Yeah.
You know when they would pass the music out to the musicians, every group would get their little stuff together,
I'd get together with Earl, because
I play vibes, and they'd pass the music over to the guitar players, and they would
(...) over there, you know like.. a group of little mad pies working on it, they'd be trying their little parts out, laughing up their sleeve
- "He he, we got them"
- and so Earl would just look at them, he named them "Heckle, Jekyll and Son".
And they'd jump up and say,
"Yeah, we got it. We're ready, we're ready!" And so, you know.. and they'd really tear it up too, because they really did have it together.
{\an3}- All of it was important, as you know.
The parts. And we'd just
{\an3}work around each other and nothing ever ran into each other, you know.
{\an1}- I think the magic was we'd listen to each other. And we liked each other.
{\an1}- Yeah. - Which was important.
- Yeah, that's right, Joe.
- We had a friendship.
I think that helped.
- I was born in Mississippi. My little town was Grenada, Mississippi.
I built my own guitar.. a broom wire and attached it to the house and I made the house rock!
I moved to Detroit in '52.. 1952.
- My Dad had a guitar in the house.
He liked the instrument.
He used to play Italian weddings, when they played the Italian music.
- All that influenced me, you know. Just anybody, whoever was playing guitar.
Listening to radio and listen to
Chet Atkins, B.B. King, Albert King.
- I'd practice all day. At times
I would skip school to practice.
- The first gig was with this group, with
Marv Johnson. And eventually he did take me into Motown, and I did a couple of his recordings.
So what happened, everybody liked what they heard.
I was playing some pretty good funk, you know. And they kind of went for it, so
I ended up staying there.
- I ended up on the night show, at Soupy Sales.
I was there for 14 years. We had some very good musicians.
- Who used to come there?
- Oh, we had Charlie Parker,
 Miles, Coltrane..
I never listened to guitar players, mainly horn men. More in the jazz vein.
{\an3}I'd like Charlie Parker, so I'd get off his records.
I was working in a club called the 20 Grand, with Levi Mann, and Berry came in and he talked to me, asked me if I wanted to record for him.
I said, "Yes, I will"
- Did y'all mention Eddie Bongo?
'Cos he was a Funk Brother.
- All through.
- OK. Eddie was a good guy.
{\an9}Eddie kept a whole lot of mess going.
And he was Marvin's right hand man.
- The thing I remember about him most was his conga playing.
He could really play.
{\an9}- If there was one guy that kept things loose, it was Eddie "Bongo" Brown.
- All got the music sheets in there, but I don't know why the hell they put the music sheet up there.
He couldn't even read! Had the sheet sitting up there.
Got the producers tricked. Bongo just playing his ass off, he's playing...
And I look over there, and he's got a nudie magazine sitting up there, with legs gapped open with moon feet.
Oh my God! And they swore that he was reading.
- He invented a couple of licks that I hear a lot now,
I think he borrowed them from the Caribbean, where he'd lick his finger and slide over the drum and get a great sound.. he had all kinds of neat little sounds that way. And he'd put them in between his licks and people said, "What was that?" You know, the producers would go crazy.
"What's that? Do that again!"
- When I started out singing I used to sing in this little blues bar, in New York,
{\an1}called Dan Lynch and they had this amazing jukebox and I would go over there,
{\an1}pretty much every night after I played, and I would play that song,
 What Becomes of the Broken Hearted.
- I feel as though that "the broken hearted" is a song that could really live again.
- Well this will be the audition today and see if we can. - No, it won't be an audition, you've already passed the test.
- For me.
- I mean it's an opportunity to see if you really like it, after we give a display.. to see if we still have it.

<font color="#ff8000">unlike the 3 guitars, which were combined on one</font>

<font color="#ff8000">was a good friend to the Funks and did many gigs with them, after Motown.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">He died, shortly after the film was completed.</font>
{\an1}That's one of the, probably one of the more recognizable guitar licks
{\an1}of the early Motown days. And when I originally played it,
27 years ago, I didn't think much about it, only that it worked.
In the small confines of Studio A, myself and the rest of the musicians didn't realize what an impact we'd have on the rest of the world.
He was very quiet and he had a mystique about him, but you couldn't find a better, steadier guitarist. And the chords were jazz, but he made it fit in R&B.
- They called us the
"Oreo cookie guitar section", because Robert
White sat to my right, and Eddie Willis sat to my left.
And the white boy. - Joseph.
Shortly after Earl Van Dyke died in
1992, I went out to visit Robert, in L.A. and went out to eat. And as we're about to order and the waiter's coming over,
{\an3}all of a sudden you hear the guitar line from "My Girl"
{\an3}come over the speaker, in the restaurant.
And Robert got really excited, really animated and he said, as the waiter walked over, he said, "Hey man, you hear that? That's.. that.." and he stopped dead.
And he kind of looked embarrassed and he looked down at the menu and he says, "I think I'll have the BBQ chicken."
And then, you know I just ordered my thing and the guy walked away, and I said, "Robert, you were gonna tell him that was you, weren't you?"
He said, he kind of looked embarrassed, he said, "Yeah, yeah, but
I don't know.." He looked at me and he said, "Look at us tired old fools,
He'd never believe it."
And that flurred me.
Because, I mean, here's a guy who played a guitar line, that's the equivalent, it's like one of the top 5 of all time guitar hooks, it's right up there with "Satisfaction" by the Stones and "Paperback Writer" or "Come As You Are", from Nirvana.
At that point I realized, here's the guy that's lived for 30 years.. this close to his dream, and yet, instead of being inside the dream, looking out, he was on the outside of the dream, looking in. Never able to touch that dream.
I knew at that point,
Robert desperately needed some recognition in his lifetime. But he didn't make it across the finish line with the rest of the guys.
He just didn't make it.
The Summer of Love introduced the world to the soaring guitar and pulsating wha-wha of Jimmy Hendrix.
The following year, Sly Stone's relentless Oakland funk, swept over and enraptured public.
Mesmerized by these new trends,
Motown producer, Norman Whitfield enlisted the Funk Brothers, along with innovative newcomers Wha-Wha
Watson and Dennis Coffey, to help fuse these new elements into the Motown sound.
Psychedelic Soul had arrived down in the Snakepit.
{\an3}In San Fransisco, of course on the west coast, with Jimmy Hendrix they had
{\an3}a lot of the fuzz-tones and they had the wha-wha pedal, the things like that, the special effects on some of the guitars.
And what happened was, in one of those earlier sessions, where we were rehearsing and working with producers, Norman Whitfield came in and he brought in this song, Cloud Nine.
And I had a wha-wha pedal with me and I took it out and started playing it and then, within a few days, I got the call to do the session.

{\an9}I haven't heard anybody, anybody play
"What's Going On" like the record, ever.
No way. - The only person I ever heard do it was Babbitt, last week. I heard Babbitt.
- Oh, Babbitt did it last week?
- When I heard Babbitt
- I'm sorry - the other night,
{\an7}it just blew me away, man.
It was like dang!
{\an7}I felt like I was back, you know, 35-40 years
{\an7}ago, as a kid. I'm sorry, what'd you say, Nate?
- You remember, as a bass player in
Detroit, I know I came a little later but..
- You weren't late.
- '72. - OK.
- But if you could not play that solo, from that record, that Bob Babbitt did...
You remember? Scorpio?
- Oh, yeah. - You weren't a bass player.
You couldn't get a gig!
- That's right.
- You couldn't get a gig, man.
And he's telling the truth.
- You couldn't get a gig.
Scorpio... oh, man!!
If you couldn't play Babbitt's solo, you weren't doing nothing.
You see what was so beautiful about it, people loved Babbitt, it wasn't about no colour, they just loved the musicians.
All the cats in the hood,
"Man, that's Babbitt!"
When I went to 7th grade, I guess it was, I was in the choir and the same choir teacher was also the orchestra teacher, she said to me,
"Well, I know somebody
{\an3}that's gonna play bass in the orchestra next year."
And boom, it's me! She's looking at me, point at me.
So I started playing upright bass.
I'm supposed to be studying classical, which
I am, as long as my mother and dad are up, soon as they go to bed, they had some stations on the radio, in
Pittsburgh, where they had what they called "Race music". Where you could hear the black, black music. And
I used to take my bass, and go into the kitchen, turn the radio on and while everybody's sleeping,
I'd be playing with the radio.
'Round 1967,
I'd been working live with Stevie Wonder.
And Stevie brought me in to do my first session at Motown.
Now, you gotta remember James, he.. he set the bass down for the Motown sound.
Man, nobody can play this.
- What?
- Nobody can play this, lying on their back.
- You could, if you were
James Jamerson.
This is the story. This is hard to believe. But it's really true.
- You gotta tell me this one.
- Let me tell you what happened.
Marvin was working on putting all of us together, with the
"What's Going On" thing.
And it was experimenting with a lot of things.
But what happened, he decided he needed Jamerson.
So, Jamerson was working at a local club.
And Marvin found out where he was working and he went over there to get him.
Jamerson was blasted.
So he says, "Well, I gotta get him back, because I got this, I gotta get it off."
Brought him back over here, to the studio.
Jamerson really didn't wanna do this, but because, being Marvin, he said "OK, I'll try it."
So Jamerson couldn't sit up on the.. you know, he had a high stool he used to sit on.
- Yeah, right like a string bass player.
- He lay right out, where you were laying, and started playing this, no one believed it.
He did a job, that no one could do standing up.
He did it lying down.
That was James Jamerson.
- The master.
- Did you feel the pressure? (...)
- Sure, there was pressure, I mean...
You're sitting in Jamerson's seat. You know what I'm saying? And to do what he did..
I mean it was almost an impossible thing.
- I'm sure you just were yourself.
- Yeah, well, I tried to do the best I could.
{\an1}- Watching a documentary, was talking
'bout some of Atlantic recordings.
With Aretha Franklin, early recordings, and she had like basically a totally white band from Nashville.
- No, from Memphis, in Muscle Shoals.
- Right. OK. And then Martin
Luther King was assassinated.
James Brown started to change his vibe, with "I'm black & I'm proud"
The whole thing changed. And a lot of people felt "Well, we don't wanna use the white musicians. We keep it to ourself. Did you feel any sort of coming into this environment that.. you felt any racial difference?
- There was such a.. a closeness.
I mean, I can't.. and when Martin Luther King died, they never expressed to me any kind of hostility or anything. And
I was, I felt as sad as they did.
But.. I never felt that, from any of these guys.
I always felt like.. like.. I don't know..
I was like one of them.
I'm sorry..
On the evening of July 23d, 1967, the Detroit police busted up an after hours, "blind pig" speakeasy, at the corner of 12th and Clairmount. and all hell broke loose.
The Funk Brothers came out of a recording session, to a city in flames.
- Yeah, the sky was red.
- Everything was burning down.
- You protect your family.
That's just the way it was and I would've gone down for them.
Even if it was at the hands of a black brother.
'Cos he's invading my territory.
That's just the way I felt.
I didn't think about colour.
These are my brothers here.
So no one had to rally us, it was just:
We have to get from here to the car.
And that was the only thing we were interested about.
It was our mission to get our people home safe.
- But I also feel at the same time, that, had the role been reversed, and we had been in an area, where it was more predominantly a white area and something broke out, that I would've took a bullet for Jack, I mean..
- I believe it.
- Yeah, we would've done the same.
The end of the 1960s found
America watching in horror, as a daily stream of televised death came back from the war, in Vietnam.
Back on the home front, the cultural and social revolution being waged in the streets was further polarizing the masses.
Motown played a pre-eminent role in the cultural soundtrack that framed all these events. And nowhere more so, than in Vietnam, where terrified and disillusioned GIs found comfort in the grooves, played by the Funk Brothers, and in the words and melodies sung by Motown's stars.
But there was no comforting refrain, down in the Snakepit.
Still reeling from the death of Benny
Benjamin, and concerned that
James Jamerson's personal daemons were leading him down the same path, the Funk Brothers needed a rallying cry to pull themselves together.
In 1970, they found it, in "What's Going On".
Marvin Gaye's anguished plea for sanity, in a world gone mad.
Helping Marvin realize his vision, the Funk Brothers elevated the level of their artistry, from the dance floor to the world stage.
<font color="#ffff80">♪ What's Going On

<font color="#ff8000">Albums sessions for "What's Going On" were done in 10 frantic days.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Songs were cut in the sequence they were eventually released.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Jamerson recorded the first half of the album.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Babbitt handled the second half - "Mercy

<font color="#ff8000">The Funks had been recording "Ain't
Nothing Like The Real Thing",</font>
<font color="#ff8000">a few hours before the riots broke out.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Sessions were cancelled, for the next 10 days.</font>
<font color="#ff8000">Berry Gordy at first rejected "What's Going On". </font>
<font color="#ff8000">He not only didn't want a protest song,</font>
<font color="#ff8000"> he didn't like the "Dizzy

<font color="#ff8000">Chaka and her group Rufus, got their break, when Motown's Stevie Wonder</font>
<font color="#ff8000">wrote their first hit,
"Tell Me Something Good. "</font>
When Marvin Gaye first recorded "What's Going On", to us it was a very important record.
Musically, we felt that it was some of our best work.
It was the first record that
Motown ever given the musicians some credit, on an album.
And little did we know, we were biting our own time, but we kept recording, for about another year. And.. many more hits to come, you know.
So, one day, we went to the studio and we were supposed to record, and there was a big sign on the door, saying...
"There won't be no work here, today.
Motown are moving to L.A."
Wow, what a break!
I suppose, they were just looking for a new sound. I suppose...you know..
So we just kept doing, what we usually do, what we was doing before Motown and that was playing in the clubs around the city, playing our blues, playing our jazz.
That's just about the way it ended.
{\an3}When Motown left Detroit, there was no warning, no announcement
{\an3}and no way of preparing for it.
And that's the move that they had to make,
I mean a company doesn't have to explain to every individual, that they're moving.
But it kind of left all of us, kinda like... "What are we gonna do?"
{\an3}Funny thing was, we always had that idea about, it would never end.
You know, we felt like it would go on and on and on.
But, as you can see, it ended.
Hoping to hold on to their dreams, some of the Funk Brothers followed Motown out to L.A.
But the west coast music scene was too foreign to them. And without the emotional support the Funk Brothers family had always provided for each other, they were lost.
{\an3}He missed his friends, the Funk
Brothers.. just the atmosphere.
{\an3}It's totally different in
California, than in Detroit.
He wasn't getting the- receiving the phone calls like before, working in a studio, yeah, to work in a studio. And.. there was a battle there, you know, of emotions and probably feeling less than a man,
{\an3}or less than a dad, to provide for us, from what he used to do before.
{\an3}So I've seen a lot of hurt and pain, and the illness and the struggles with the alcohol.
Wasn't going right for him.
He wanted to do everything, he was used to doing everything, for everyone.
And then it was his time, where he needed help.
And a lot of times, no one was there... or he didn't wanna listen, 'cos he can be hard-headed too. So...
In 1983, James Jamerson scalped a ticket for the nationally televised show "Motown 25", and stepped into a balcony seat.
Two months later, he slipped away.
For ever.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to give it up.. give up the love for Detroit's unsung, musical heroes.
The drum section: Uriel Jones & Pistol Allen, and the late Benny Benjamin.
On the vibes and percussion, the fabulous, tambourine man
Jack Ashford and the late "Bongo" Eddie.
Guitar section: the one, none other, the brother Eddie Willis, Joe Messina and the late Robert White.
On the keyboards: Joe Hunter, Johnny Griffith and the late, great Earl Van Dyke.
And on bass: Bob Babbitt and the greatest bass player of all time..
James Jamerson. Here they are!
Ladies and gentlemen...
the greatest hit machine in music history:
The Funk Brothers.

I mean the people are great people, not just great musicians.
I think that's what I'll carry with me, just being able to converse and talk to people, who have done so much to influence what I do, and what I wanna be. The people bring the place alive and I think that's very important.

{33061}{33143}You know, they felt|a nationalistic resentment,...
{33144}{33270}..at the fact that America enjoyed|this unchallenged cultural hegemony.

{49179}{49259}I don't think Oasis|were too worried by it.
{49260}{49358}I think everybody at the NME|wanted Blur to win that war,...
{49359}{49449}..because, you know,|they were nice, middle-class boys,...

{50574}{50626}..there are other people involved...
{50669}{50785}..in the real reason why we fell out|so, er, kind of, publicly.
{50815}{50905}It's been described as the British|heavyweight pop music championship.

{51543}{51619}We are now in the golden era again|of British pop music.
{51620}{51673}These are two groups,|Oasis and Blur,...

{51853}{51937}..and who have now crossed right over|to the public at large,...
{51938}{52004}..and are duking it out,|to see who is the biggest.
{52005}{52109}The way I see it is Steve Sutherland|saying to Damon Albarn,...
{52110}{52161}"Release a single|on the same day as them."
{52162}{52238}"We'll sell a shitload of papers and|you'll sell a shitload of records."
{52268}{52308}That's the way I see it.
{52309}{52359}We were quite offended at the time.
{52360}{52429}We were sat in Rockfield|and Alan McGee come and said...
{52430}{52532}.."Well, they've moved|their single back."
{52533}{52604}They had it ready to go|two weeks before,...
{52605}{52700}..and they decided to move it back|so it was on the same day as ours.
{52708}{52741}And, um,...
{52757}{52806}..Alan McGee and that were saying...
{52807}{52872}.."Well, just, like,|move yours back again."
{52873}{52921}And we were saying "No, fuck that."

{53011}{53082}..to drag themselves up|on the coat-tails of my band, really.
{53095}{53233}And, you know, the NME losing readers|by the thousands every week...
{53265}{53292}Um...
{53307}{53342}I suppose...
{53343}{53432}..it was summat they didn't think|would get as out of hand as it did.
{53433}{53523}But, then again, you get Damon Albarn|on the ten o'clock news, you know.
{53585}{53654}I ask you, what the fuck|is all that about, you know?
{53655}{53725}When the record-shop doors|opened this morning,...
{53726}{53771}..battle commenced.
{53772}{53839}The chances are both singles|could have been number one...
{53840}{53902}..had they been released|on separate weeks.
{53921}{53985}I'm a little nervous|about the whole thing.
{53986}{54062}Obviously, because both bands|have really upped the stakes,...
{54063}{54162}..and someone's gonna come out on top|and someone's gonna come second.
{54163}{54223}And by the very nature|of being in a band...

{59233}{59287}..and you weren't interested|in the fucking first place.

{83987}{84028}..in connection with Cool Britannia.
{84029}{84128}Yet on the other hand, they kinda|did wanna be in Vanity Fair.
{84129}{84220}It was as though, if something hasn't|been noticed by the US media,...
{84221}{84271}..particularly New York|glossy magazines,...
{84272}{84327}..it's as though|it hasn't really happened.
{84328}{84456}So, even though Cool Britannia was|this, sort of, violent reaction,...
{84457}{84570}..um, to things|precisely like Vanity Fair,...
{84571}{84613}..and their enormous influence,...
{84614}{84700}..saying "We don't care what you|think. We don't care about America."

{84737}{84832}..they wanted to be photographed,|they wanted to be in the magazine.
{85015}{85141}One of the touch-and-go people,|for a very long time, was Tony Blair.
{85142}{85275}One of my jobs was trying to persuade|people in Tony Blair's office...
{85276}{85341}..that it would be a good thing,|politically,...
{85342}{85442}..for Tony Blair to pose in|the Vanity Fair Cool Britannia issue.
{85443}{85517}And, um, that was extremely tough,...
{85518}{85563}..because, on the one hand,...
{85564}{85668}..the whole cultural phenomenon|had occurred...
{85669}{85728}..under John Major's premiership.
{85729}{85814}So, in a sense, the Tories could|take credit for Cool Britannia,...
{85815}{85880}..so why should Tony Blair|in any way endorse it?
{85881}{85928}Um, but on the other hand,...
{85929}{85979}..Cool Britannia did seem to be...
{85980}{86070}..a harbinger of a new mood|in Britain, a new optimism.
{86071}{86155}And that was very much something|Tony Blair hoped to...

{93519}{93632}It's a measure of how conservative|the music business...

{93688}{93774}You absolutely couldn't say that|without getting slapped.
{93775}{93838}You could not criticise|New Labour,...

{94127}{94193}What really pissed me off was, um,...

{94370}{94470}..sending his kids to private|school, or "grant-funded", sorry.
{94478}{94526}That's a... euphemism.
{94531}{94600}Er, and I got a letter|from his office,...
{94601}{94652}..saying "Don't talk about that."
{94653}{94744}And that was really the end|of my, kind of, er,...

{95276}{95341}He'd stayed up to watch the election|all night,...
{95385}{95469}..and I asked him how he managed|to stay up all night.
{95489}{95533}And he leant into me and said...

{110253}{110318}It's about... There are two or three|really good songs on it,...

{111151}{111207}And it left a huge gulf.
{111208}{111274}There was, like, a vacuum there|that needed to be filled.
{111288}{111355}And with the music business,|it has a default setting,...
{111356}{111409}..and its default setting|is pop music.

[ Woman On TV] Good evening.
Later on tonight's late show... we look at the French philosopherJacques Derrida... founder of the post-structuralist mode of analysis... known as deconstruction... and internationally acknowledged by many as one of the most innovative... and inspiring of contemporary philosophers.
[ Siren Wailing ]
[ Chattering ]
My theory is that Americans exist to the degree that they're being filmed... or believe themselves to be filmed.
- Yeah.
- This is their natural condition.
[ Mumbles ] You see how Americanized I am now.
Careful.
[ Chuckles ]
She sees everything around me, but she's totally blind.
That's the image of the philosopher who falls in the well. You say?
- [ Woman ] Yes.
- While looking at the star.
- [ Car Alarm Blaring ]
- Watch it.
Watch--
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
[ Derrida ]
I have these people around all the time, day and night.
Wherever I am, for two weeks now they have been constantly...
- Mm.
- tracking me.
[ Woman ]
Are you getting used to it?
- Sometimes I forget. I just forget.
- Yeah?
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]
[ Derrida ] We should not neglect the fact that some biographies-- written by people who have authority in the academy-- finally invest this authority in a book... which, for centuries sometimes... after the death of an author, represent the truth.
Huh? The truth.
Someone... interested in biography writes...
Life and Works of Heidegger.
Well documented... apparently consistent... and it's the only one... published by-- under the authority of a good press.
Okay? And then,
Heidegger's image--
Heidegger's life image-- is fixed and stabilized for centuries.
That's why I would say that sometimes... the one who reads a text by a philosopher... for instance, a tiny paragraph...
- [ Camera Shutter Clicks ]
- and interprets it in a rigorous... inventive and... powerfully deciphering fashion... is more of a real biographer... than the one who knows the whole story.
[ Derrida ]
This is the blue jacket I have.
That's nice.
But this doesn't fit with the--
This is black, this is not blue. Okay?
- And I usually can't--
- I know.
Can I-- We won't get your bottom half.
Can I see what it looks like?
Is that okay?
I'm sorry to trouble you.
As you know, the traditional philosophy excludes biography... considers biography as something external to philosophy.
You remember, uh...
Heidegger's statement... about Aristotle.
Heidegger once was asked,
I think, uh...
''What is-- What was the life of Aristotle?''
What could we answer to the question:
What was Aristotle's life?
Well, the answer is very simple.
Aristotle was a philosopher.
The answer holds in one sentence:
''He was born, he thought and he died.''
And all the rest is pure anecdote.
[ Woman ]
His mother's grave is profaned.
His parents never read any ofhis books.
He cries out,
''Mommy, I'm scared, '" every night until she lets him sleep on a sofa near them.
One side ofhis face is paralyzed for three weeks... leaving his eye open continuously, unblinking.
His father composes his own death notice... shortly before he dies of cancer.
He's expelled from school because he is Jewish.
He learns he was given a secret name, Eli... after theJewish prophet Elijah, that isn't on his birth certificate.
He fails his first entrance exam to the university.
He writes his first novel at age 1 5... about the theft of a diary and blackmail for its return.
He pretends to learn Hebrew so as to read it without understanding it.
He is arrested and thrown in prison for 2 4 hours in Prague... for transporting drugs, which the authorities plant on him.
He receives a collect call from someone who identifies himself as...
''Martini'"Heidegger.
He declines an offer from Marguerite Duras... to play a part in one ofher films.
As an adolescent, he dreams of becoming a professional soccer player.
He doesn't circumcise his sons... greatly upsetting his mother and father.
He suffers from sleeplessness and nervous collapse... from the overuse of sleeping tablets and amphetamines.
His older brother lives only seven days... dying just a year before he is born.
Classical philosophers... usually avoid autobiography.
It is because they think it's indecent.
That is, a philosopher should not speak of himself as an empirical being.
And this impoliteness, or this politeness... is philosophy itself, in principle.
So, if we want to break... with this philosophical axiom, classical philosophical axiom... according to which a philosopher should not present himself... or...
[ Stammers ] give in to autobiography... then we have to be indecent to some extent.
[ Woman ] We no longer consider the biography of a philosopher... as a set of empirical accidents... that leaves one with a name... that within itselfbe offered up to philosophical reading... the only kind of reading held to be philosophically legitimate.
Neither readings of philosophical systems... nor external empirical readings... have ever in themselves questioned the dynamics... of that borderline between the work and the life... between the system and the subject of the system.
This borderline is neither active nor passive.
It's neither outside nor inside.
It is most especially not a thin line... an invisible or indivisible trait... that lies between the philosophy on the one hand... and the life of an author on the other.
[ Chattering ]
- Hi. My name's Jenny.
- Hi.
Listening to you speak just elucidated your texts just so much to me.
- Thank you. Thank you.
- [ Giggles ]
- But I just wanted to meet you.
- Thank you.
I-I read your novel, one of your novels over the summer.
I just wanted to hear you speak so I could understand it better.
I started reading about negative theology... [ Garbled ] and I was wondering if there was any connection... between, you said a specific Christian discourse... but I was wondering if there was any connection between that and say Hebrew cabala...
- uh, and something--
- Yeah, it never, it never finishes.
But it's not the same thing.
Cabala is full of... such gentle God beyond God--
[ Microphone Interference ]
[ Continues, Indistinct ]
- But it doesn't mean there aren't a number of--
- Thank you.
[ Woman ] You're very well known in the States for deconstruction.
Can you talk a little bit about the origin of that idea?
[ In French ]
[ Woman ] The very condition of a deconstruction... may be at work in the work, within the system to be deconstructed.
It may already be located there, already at work.
Not at the center but in an eccentric center... in a corner whose eccentricity assures the solid concentration of the system... participating in the construction of what it, at the same time... threatens to deconstruct.
One might then be inclined to reach this conclusion.
Deconstruction is not an operation that supervenes afterwards... from the outside, one fine day.
It is always already at work in the work.
Since the disruptive force of deconstruction... is always already contained within the very architecture of the work... all one would finally have to do to be able to deconstruct... given this always already, is to do memory work.
Yet since I want neither to accept or to reject... a conclusion formulated in precisely these terms... let us leave this question suspended for the moment.
[ Chattering ]
[ In French ]
[ Beeping ]
[ Beeping ]
[ Meows ]
[ Speaking French ]
[ Woman ]
[ Woman ] Who is it that is addressing you?
Since it is not an author, a narrator or a deus ex machina... it is an ''I'"that is both part of the spectacle... and part of the audience.
An ''I'"that, a bit like ''you, '" undergoes its own incessant violent reinscription... within the arithmetical machinery.
An ''I'"that functioning as a pure passageway... for operations of substitution... is not some singular and irreplaceable existence... some subject or life... but only rather moves between life and death... between reality and fiction.
An ''I'"that is a mere function or phantom.
[ Woman ]
[ Woman ]
[ Woman ] There is not narcissism and non-narcissim.
There are narcissisms that are more or less comprehensive... generous, open, extended.
What is called non-narcissism is in general... but the economy of a much more welcoming and hospitable narcissism.
One that is much more open to the experience of the Other as Other.
I believe that without a movement of narcissistic reappropriation... the relation to the Other would be absolutely destroyed.
It would be destroyed in advance.
The relation to the Other, even if it remains asymmetrical... open, without possible reappropriation... must trace a movement of reappropriation... in the image of one's self for love to be possible.
Love is narcissistic.
[ Footsteps Approaching ]
[ Woman ]
[ Woman ]
[ Woman ]
[ Woman ]
[ Derrida ]
- These are facts.
- [ Woman, In French ]
Raw facts.
[ Woman ] Now, well, okay.
[ In French ]
What I'd like to ask you about now is this question of the anecdote.
At the biography conference, you quoted Heidegger as saying... that one could sum up the life of Aristotle as:
Aristotle was born, he thought and he died.
And then when I asked you about your relationship with Marguerite... you said I can give you the facts, the dates and that's it.
Can you offer some commentary on that?
[ In French ]
[ Woman ]
[ Derrida ]
[ Marguerite ]
[ Derrida ]
[ Woman ] Was it strange to you to see something you had no memory of?.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
[ Woman ]
Just whatever you want to say.
[ Woman, In French ]
[ Woman, In French ]
[ Woman, In French ]
[ Woman ]
How do you call this?
-[ Woman ] Dispute?
- No problem.
You know, the usual family--
Always something.
Absolute peace.
[ Woman ]
That was the first and only last time.
[ Laughs ]
I saw that once and for all.
[ Mumbles ]
You remember this.
[ Chattering In French ]
[ Derrida, In French ]
[ Woman ]
[ Woman ]
And I am writing here at the moment... when my mother no longer recognizes me.
And at which, though still capable of speaking or articulating a little... she no longer calls me.
And for her, and therefore for the rest ofher life...
I no longer have a name.
That's what's happening.
And when she nonetheless seems to reply to me... she's presumably replying to someone... who happens to be me without her knowing it... ifknowing means anything here.
Like the other day in Nice... when I asked her if she was in pain.
''Yes. '"
Then where?
It was February 5, 1 989.
She had in a rhetoric that could never have been hers... the audacity of this stroke about which she will... alas, never know anything... no doubt knew nothing... and which piercing the night replies to my question.:
''I have a pain in my mother, '" as though she were speaking for me... both in my direction and in my place.
I stop for a moment over a pang of remorse... in any case, over the admission
I owe the reader... in truth that I owe my mother herself... for the reader will have understood that I am writing for my mother... perhaps even for a dead woman.
For if I were here writing for my mother... it would be for a living mother who does not recognize her son.
And I am paraphrasing here for whomever no longer recognizes me... unless it be so that one should no longer recognize me... another way of saying, another version... so that people think they finally recognize me.
[ Man On Radio ]
[ Timer Bell Dings ]
[ Derrida Speaking French ]
[ Man ] We are now approaching the actual maximum security prison.
[ Chattering ]
[ Man, Indistinct ]
- How much? Eighteen years.
- Eighteen years.
- That was his cell.
- That was his cell?
Yes.
[ Man ]
You will notice that in this cell... there is no water facility or toilets.
Toilets were the buckets.
Their own bucket with a lid.
[ Woman ]
As soon as there is the One... there is murder, wounding, traumatism.
The One guards against the Other.
It protects itself from the Other.
But in the movement of this jealous violence... it comprises in itself its self-otherness or self-difference.
The difference from within one's Self, which makes it One.
The One as the Other.
At one and the same time... but in the same time that is out ofjoint.
The One forgets to remember itself to its Self.
It keeps and erases the archive of this injustice that it is... of this violence that it does.
The One makes itself violence.
It violates and does violence to itself.
It becomes what it is, the very violence that it does to itself.
The determination of the Self as One is violence.
[ Derrida ]
More than once, we will be faced... with the effects of a preliminary question... which is the question.:
Who or what?
Does one forgive someone for a wrong committed... or does one forgive someone something?
Someone who, in whatever way, can never totally be confused... with the wrongdoing... and the moment of the past wrongdoing nor with the past injury.
So, the question:
Who or what?
Do we forgive someone, or do we forgive someone something?
[ Man ]
Okay, a final final question.
[ Man ]
There is a very anxious question.
Um, so you're a white Western male, speaking to a white audience.
We are part of the previous oppressive community in South Africa.
And you are speaking to us about unconditional forgiveness.
Um, you might have meant that pure forgiveness thing... um, with a lot of irony.
Um, and maybe that is something that is really impossible.
You know, pure forgiveness being really impossible.
But we sit here as potential objects of forgiveness... and we are, all of us, you included, in a sense guilty.
- Now, don't you think-- Okay.
- [ Man ] Ask your question.
Don't you think it fulfills an ideological function speaking to us... telling us, in a sense, we should not repent, not ask for forgiveness... because then we ruin pure, unconditional forgiveness.
At the same time, you are telling oppressed people... they should forgive without expecting repentance.
[ Derrida ] Uh, first of all,
I take irony seriously.
I take the problem of irony very seriously.
And we need some irony, that is something... which challenges the commonsensical concepts.
And you can't do this without some irony.
So there was no doubt some irony.
Now, of course, in this context...
I understand your concern and I share your concern.
I want to precisely draw a very rigorous border... between the pure concept of forgiveness... and the idea of reconciliation... and the idea of excuse and the process which is going on.
I think that as soon as you mix the concept of forgiveness... with all the connected concepts which are at work in this current process-- that is reconciliation, repentance, so on and so forth-- then first you obscurely
Christianize the process.
You introduce confusion and obscurity... in something which has to be as clear as possible.
[ Derrida In French ]
[ Man ]
Okay. Five seconds to go.
Five, four, three, two, one.
In your own time.
If I give you an example
I've often thought to myself... that Seinfeld, which is America's most popular ever sitcom.
Seinfeld. Do you know of the Seinfeld sitcom in America?
If you think of a classic American...
Jerry Seinfeld made this sitcom... about a group of people living together.
Everything is about irony and parody... and what you do with your kitchen cupboard... is imbued with as much feeling or thought... as whether someone believes in God, if you like.
Do you see anything in that?
Deconstruction, the way I understand it, doesn't produce any sitcom.
And if a sitcom is this and this... and the people who watch this think that deconstruction is this... the only advice I have to give them is just read... stop watching sitcoms and try and do your homework and read.

It's not easy to improvise.
It's the most difficult thing to do.
Even when one improvises in front of a camera or a microphone... one ventriloquizes or leaves another to speak in one's place... the schemas and languages that are already there.
There are already a great number of prescriptions... that are prescribed in our memory and in our culture.
All the names are already preprogrammed.
It's already the names that inhibit our ability to ever really improvise.
One can't say whatever one wants.
One is obliged, more or less, to reproduce the stereotypical discourse.
And so I believe in improvisation.
And I fight for improvisation.
But always with the belief that it's impossible.
And there, where there is improvisation...
I am not able to see myself.
I am blind to myself... and it's what I will see-- no, I won't see it-- it's for others to see.
The one who is improvised here... no, I won't ever see him.

Ah. There was a time--

- You recognize this, eh?
- Yes, I do.
-So, she has slept here, huh?
- That's nice.
[ Man ] If you had a choice, what philosopher... would you have liked to have been your mother?
That's his style?
That's his own style?
- [ Clears Throat ]
- [ Sea Gulls Crying ]
I have no ready answer for this, let me-- Give me some time.
My mother?
[ Chuckling ]
A good question.
It's a good question.
In fact.
It's an interesting question.
I'll try to tell you why.
It's impossible for me to have any philosopher as a mother.
That's the problem, hmm?
My mother--
My mother... couldn'tbe a philosopher.
[ In French ]
[ Woman ]
That philosophy died yesterday... since Hegel or Marx,
Nietzsche or Heidegger-- and that philosophy should still wander toward the meaning of its death-- or that it has always lived knowing itself to be dying,: that philosophy died one day, within history... or that it has always fed on its own agony... on the violent way it opens history... by opposing itself to non-philosophy... which is its past and its concern... its death and wellspring,: and that, beyond the death or dying nature of philosophy... perhaps even because of it... thought still has a future.
Or even as is said today... is still entirely to come because of what philosophy has held in store,: or, more strangely still... that the future itself has a future.
All these are unanswerable questions.
By right ofbirth, and for one time at least... these are problems put to philosophy... as problems philosophy cannot resolve.
Long ago, I had dinner... and his mother, when she was alive, was there.
And one of the great dictionaries in France had just come out... and included, uh--
I don't know if it was the Petit Robert, or something-- included ''difference'' with an ''A'' and that it happened that day.
And at dinner I said that we should have a party to celebrate... the induction of
''difference'' with an ''A''... into the dictionary.
This was a monumental, encyclopedic event... that ought to be marked, and a proper ceremony-- which I was very willing to arrange-- should take place.
And Jacques's mother, who is very ancient but noble... she said, ''Jackie, did you spell
''difference'' with an ''A''?
And she was mortified.
But it was so sweet.
It was so fabulous, and there was this moment where I also felt...
I had, um, blabbed... because, you know... now what's he supposed to do: explain to his mother, or--
He doesn't--
He's very modest.
He doesn't talk about himself to his family--
I mean, his relative's family.

[ Derrida ] You can imagine how strange it is... to have someone gather your so-called archive... but to attend the event of the inauguration of the archive--
I realized the other day, and this afternoon... by looking at the archive, in the library... with these... uh, gray--
- black and gray urns, uh...
- [ Laughing ] accumulated, like, of course in a graveyard... and, uh, already mourning--
We are already-- always already mourning.
Well, you know, among the concerns we have... about where are we going to be buried...
- [ Laughing ]
- the question is, ''With whom?''
This is the entire
Derrida archive... beginning there, and, um... almost to the end, and there's about a hundred boxes.
[ Yeghiayan ] But he mentioned that, you know, that his wife was... kind of reluctant to see these materials go.
That he was kind of foretelling of his imminent death... or something like that--
And, you know, we then had the boxes still in our reading room.
We were in a kind of different situation there.
And he, uh, he treated it like it was... you know, his little child.
And, I remember the manuscript, it was pushed out... and he looked at it, kind of touched the box.
You know, kind of sorry to see it go... or be in another domicile or whatever.
[ Woman ]
The question of the archive... is not a question of the past.
It is not the question of a concept dealing with the past... that might already be at our disposal.
An archivable concept of the archive.
It is a question of the future... the question of the future itself... the question of a response, of a promise... and of a responsibility for tomorrow.
The archive. If we want to know what that will have meant... we will only know in times to come.
Not tomorrow, but in times to come.
Later on, or perhaps never.

It will be your signature, and your autobiography in a certain way.
[ Woman ]
How can another see into me... into my most secret Self... without my being able to see in there myself?.
And without my being able to see him in me.
And if my secret Self... that which can be revealed only to the Other... to the Holy Other-- to God if you wish-- is a secret that
I will never reflect on... that I will never know, or experience or possess as my own... then what sense is there in saying that it is my secret?
Or in saying, more generally, that a secret belongs,: that it is proper to, or belongs to someone... or to some Other who remains someone.
It's perhaps there that we find the secret of secrecy.
Namely, that it is not a matter ofknowing... and that it is there for no one.
A secret doesn't ''belong. '"
It can never be said to be ''at home, '" or in its place.
The question of the Self,
''Who am I?''-- not in the sense of
''Who am I?'... but rather, ''Who is this 'I' that can say, 'Who'?
''What is the 'I'and what becomes of responsibility... once the identity of the 'I' trembles in secret?'"
[ Woman ] You asked me the other day if I regretted... having undertaken this project, and I was wondering... if that was a projection-- if you've regretted it?
No, so far. Perhaps, one day
I will regret it.
So far, no.
I don't know.
- Have you ever been in psychoanalysis yourself?.
- No.
- Would you ever consider it?
- No.
- I absolutely exclude it.

Yeah.

[ Church Bell Ringing ]
[ Woman ] We will wonder what he may have kept... ofhis unconditional right to secrecy... while at the same time, burning with the desire to know... to make known, and to archive... the very things he concealed forever.
What did he conceal, even beyond the intention to conceal?
Beyond the intention to lie or to perjure.
We will always wonder what-- sharing with compassion in this archive fever-- what may have burned ofhis secret passions... ofhis correspondences or ofhis life.
Burned without him, without remains... and without knowledge.
Without the least symptom... and without even an ash.
[January 1959, Habana, Cuba]
The Opression..
...has ended.
The joy is overwhelming...
But still...
..there is alot to do.
There's a discrepancy,
On a small island...
A big revolution...
No, I would have been dead.
Let me see..
If I go closer...
I have to look my best.
You ought to follow the orders given out by your superior officers.
Me too...
The Palace
Habana, Cuba
I know it's late, but you have to sign these.
What?
I can sign a few of them.
Let's do a couple.
I think that would be my speeches.
No, but when I write I try to establish a harmony between the words.
I try to combine the words, to ensure a cadence, a rhythm.
I could produce alot more-
-simply by talking in public.
Only the lord knows how many thousands of stories I've told.
A minimum amount of time for administrative duties.
As much time as possible with my fellow comrades, talking-
-about different issues.
Yes, in finding solutions to problems.
You have to gather information and familiarize with problems...
...in order to find solutions.
I don't waste my time shaving.
This one time I estimated that 
I was saving...
... months, if you calculate
15 minutes of shaving per day.
When I was a young man...
...I dedicated alot of time to sports.
I found a great pleasure trying out many different sports.
Today I do sports occasionally-
-for health reasons.
This office is my track and field.
I count all the steps i take.
Right away.
First, I check my watch... then my pulse....
And then I start walking.
What am I to do? 
I am a prisoner.
This is my cell.
I react calmly to good news-
-even though I rejoice inside.
And for the bad news:
-I'm used to bad news.
-Yes, some news are hard to deal with.
For example when I got the news that my mother had died.
I felt a very profound pain.
Or when I got the news of Che Guevara's death...
Ernesto "Che" Guevara (1928-1967)
Leader of the Cuban revolution.
Killed in Bolivia.
There are moments of very deep pain.
It's not only the news, but also some events that I've witnessed.
That's the first time we claimed someone to be deported.
Such illegal actions have been happening for a long time now.
We wanted to win a battle that didn't concern justice-
-but rather politics.
I felt a special emotion-
-when we received the father's request-
-to claim for his boy to be sent back.
I realized from a legal point of view we would never win the case in court.
But first, I needed to know who the father was.
To undertake such a battle,
I need to feel I am right.
They tried eight times.
The couple had eight miscarriages.
It was their 8:th try. He Cried.
I felt sorry for him.
I felt right away that it was fair-
-and that we had to do what was right. And I was not wrong.
Actually it has never crossed my mind.
-Never crossed your mind?
-Never. No!
Maybe it has something to do with my confidence.
I have never been asked that question.
Perhaps, it's due to the fact that already as a small child-
-I had to solve important problems.
I was sent to Santiago, Cuba, when I was 5 or 6 years old.
That was my first hard experience.
I got used to solving my own problems.
No, she was my ally.
..when I demanded to be sent to a boarding school she was my ally.
My father had plenty of land and my parents used it as farmland.
But I demanded to be sent back to school.
That was my third battle.
During the second year on law school-
-I got involved in an expedition-
-to overthrow the regime in
Trujillo, Santo Domingo.
Yes.
-No, but they tried to torture me.
He knew that I didn't have either money or resources.
They underestimated us.
-No, I don't believe in destiny.
I don't believe in that.
If I shared that feeling...
...it would seem I had reached the end as a leader.
We have never given up our fight.
Not for one second.
And the day I die, whatever the reason-
-I wouldn't think it was destiny that pushed me to that end.
Today I believe in a free Cuba-
-in the future of our ideals.
And maybe that will be the great test of time.
Yes. I admire Hemingway.
Maybe it was his philosophy?
-I would fight until I got killed.
And if the situation was such-
-that my gun stopped working or my ammunition ran out-
-My decision would be: Death!
Without a doubt.
I have never been a believer-
-simply because of the methods they used in school to persuade me-
-about god, they were dogmatic methods.
Yes, I'm totally confident it is.
José Marti 1853-1895
Cuban national hero.
Neither of the two.
I always try to be rational.
I have a vision what relative glory can be like.
José Marti expressed it in a phrase:
"All the glory of the world-
-can be confined in a grain of corn".
I have never thought about glory.
I have never been thinking about how I want to be remembered.
History is a relative thing.
The human species can be wiped out.
The sun could stop shining.
So what is then being a celebrity, or being famous worth?
One day, nothing will exist anymore.
If it's not attained relatively soon..
..then the human species will be obliterated.
We can't continue polluting the environment-
-continue to exploit our natural resources-
-and undermine the living conditions of man.
You don't even have to resort to mathematics.
Simple arethmics would indicate-
-the present problems must be solved, or mankind won't survive.
Sometime during this new century-
-common sense will win the war over greed and ignorance-
-and that man will survive.
But in a very short period of time-
-in 40 or 50 years, there will be almost 10 billion people.
It will not be worthwile to live on the planet-
-we have left.
I think that society is somewhat helpless against drugs.
We have been able to protect ourselves-
-from the widespread use of drugs.
We have reduced the drug abuse to a minimum.
Cuba is a country with one of the lowest percentage of drug users.
I think that natural drugs will be replaced by synthetic ones-
-which are cheaper to produce.
A change, rather than a revolution, is possible -
-since the current order in my view is unsustainable.
May 1959, Nationalization of American companies in Cuba
Number 24.. United Fruit Company.
I have been critical, but it would work better here than in India.
I have mentioned it as an example of-
-the tendency towards a homogeneous culture-
-and the destruction of a cultural identity.
A culture derived from the nation with power and media control.

1960 - USA introduces an embargo that still today is enforced.
This story is well known.
[1975 - FN Building]
[New York City, USA]
-that the colony could be freed-
-and the different groups could be organized.
The Cabinda province is filled with oil.
That's one of the reasons the imperialists want the power in Angola.
They organized the FNLA...
...with a little help from CIA.
Some imperialists ask themselves..
...why the Cubans are helping
Angola.
[1975 Fidel Castro sends] 
[30 000 men to Angola]
[As an answer to]
[The Apartheid regime's invasion of Angola]
They are used to countries co-operating just to get oil-
-copper, diamonds or other natural resources.
No, our interests are not of any materialistic nature.
It's simply logicial that the imperialists don't understand that.
Their norms are based on chauvinism, nationalism och egotism.
We carry out our international duty when helping the people of Angola.
[The South African army]
[Retreating from Angola 1988]
That one is nice.
We have about 120 paintings.
We did not go to the museum.
Look at this. The work he made.
Porto Carrero.
He painted the town.
This is the swamp..and the main land.
Hardly nothing. I haven't watched a film for 10 years.
I have been busy all the time.
I haven't had any holiday.
Ever since the collapse of the social structure-
-our patience has been tested numerous times-
-the double blockade for instance. 
I haven't had any time off.
-I think so, but on video.
Yes, I saw "Titanic".
On video as well.
That one you really have to watch on the big screen.
It was an interesting film.
Almost like a theatrical play.
-Almost all of them, but I can't remember anymore.
-I can't remember their names.
-Sophia... The Italian.
-Sophia Loren.
Yes, Sophia Loren. 
I remember. She was one them.
I'm also a big fan of 
Brigitte Bardot.
Charlie Chaplin.
I can watch his films over and over again.
The films of Cantinfla I can also see over and over again.
And I have seen some of 
Gérard Depardieu's films.
When he played the chef of Ludvig XIV, where he had to gain weight.
But he gained too much weight, and he remained fat.
He is extremely funny.
I have met him a couple of times.
You feel satisfied when you see the support you're getting.
But it seems to me, that in the last couple of years-
-after the kidnapping of Elian
Gonzalez we've had mass rallies-
-Far greater than those during the inital part of the revolution.
-Now people will think I'm a liar.
But I've told the truth.
The question about the feeble and the strong man hasn't been raised.
I don't read everything that's written about me in the states, 
Maybe I'm answering this question subjectively.
Normally I'm very self-critical.
Maybe not concerning things I've done, or all my mistakes...
...but when it comes to things
I've could have done better.
Sometimes we're even ashamed of the things we've done.
But we have managed to do ten times more than other countries in Latin America.
[Eva "Evita" Peron - Presidents Wife]
[Argentina, 1945-1952]
We found a country where 30 % of the population were illiterate-
-and where 60 % had hugh problems reading and writing.
And I don't think I'm exaggerating-
-if I say that 10% of the population were educated.
At the time of the victory of the revolution there were-
-between 30 000 and 40 000 persons with an university degree.
Today there's 700 000.
It's one of the biggest victories of this revolution-
-that even the prostitutes have university degrees. 
Do you know how many prostitues there were before the revolution?
Now, there is way less.
One becomes aware of-
-things we could have done better, when you discover the possibillites.
The camera man tells me it's better you're on this side.
-I don't know. I don't smoke any longer.
-Maybe it's candy?
I usually carry a gun with me, but I've removed it.
Luckily I don't carry any secret papers with me.
Maybe more in the past. Back then
I wasn't tied to the office as much.

There has always been doubts, when you use a scope-
-it's very hard to get back to the target on the 2:nd shot.
It recoils, and you have to find the target very quickly.
I have never believed the theory that it was one man.
If you aim well, all you could acheive is one good shot.
The possibilites that it was a conspiracy are very high.
And the strange thing that the assumed killer was killed...
It's all difficult to believe.
Yes, visit the school.
Walk around.
-Can I leave my bag here?
-Yes, it's safe.
-If you don't have secret papers.
-Where are you from?
-Nicaragua.
-Venezuela.
-Guatemala.
It's free of charge for them.
Dominican-American,
Thanks for letting me study here.
She is Dominican-American.
And during the years prior to the revolution-
-a great number of women died in illegal abortions.
And others suffer from the consequences.
Today it's a mother's choice.
It's not common, because women of today are better educated.
They want to work, study and be a part of society.
I think we have spoiled their class for today so we're going to leave now.
He was a man with good intentions-
-whose country needed improvements, not destruction. He destroyed it.
[Conference Center, Habana, Cuba]
[Fidel Castro Jr. - Nuclear Physicist]
[Fidel Castro III - Grandson, Student]
[Juan Almeida]
[Revolutionary leader]
-Did they say: 
"Castro doesn't know what he's doing"?
Nobody ever complained about Castro.
Some complained about the living conditions and wondered-
-what was supposed to follow.
We were inspired by independant
Cubans who were brave warriors.
Máximo Gómez, Marti, Maceo, who organized an invasion...
30 years of machetes and horses.
They inspired us throughout.
The tactics we used was a product of mere observation-
-and meditation-
-and inspiration.
I met him the first time in march of 1959.
He was vice president.
We spoke to each other.
I explained to him the Cuban problems and my idea for the future.
He immediately wrote a draft.
In which he said that 
I was a communist.
Just talking about a land reform back then-
-could get you listed as a communist.
I would say that from the very beginning-
-I got the impression that he was just a hypocrite-
-and just a petty politican.
Conceited.
He recommended an expedition-
-to crush the Cuban revolution.
When we were deprived of the sugar quota-
-the United States were left without market of sugar or oil.
It was a economo-political moment.
We had a sentiment of gratitude towards the Soviet Union-
-but it was not yet a political commitment, or a military one.
The fact of the matter is that the expedition was organized...
...in Guatemala, against Cuba prior to the invasion "Bay of pigs".
So, then we were buying weapons from the Soviet Union.
Kennedy inherited the invasion plans from the Eisenhower administration.
Plans that were already in process of being executed.
Just after two months the invasion plans were set to work.
Kennedy was an inexperienced president.
He trusted the institutions too much.
[Stevenson, US Ambassadeur]
[FN 1961]
[April 1:st 1961]
John F. Kennedy inherits a war. against Castro's communist regime.
It culminates in the "Bay of pigs", where CIA-trained exile Cubans-
-try to overthrow Castro.
The 3-day invasion is a hugh failure. 
1200 attackers are taken prisoners.
Exile Cubans blame Kennedy for refusing air support.
The reason for having missils here-
-is that the Soviet Union had information that -
-there was a plan to invade Cuba.
Even under the invasion he made very strong statements.
He talked about strategic missiles and insinuated that Cuba needed support.
And there was a moral issue to consider as well.
We did not like the idea of 
Soviet missiles here.
We had taken all necessary security actions-
-rather than to have a Soviet military base situated here.
From a military point of view, the Russians didn't do a good job-
-They allowed American planes to map the whole area and to locate the missiles.
They put our country in great danger.
We thought we were going to be obliterated.
That we were the first ones to be obliterated.
-Socialism or death.
-It might have been interpreted that way.
I didn't say: "Strike first"
I said: "If this country is attacked.."
"If this country with 40 000 
Soviet soldiers are attacked.."
I was sure that, after the bay of pigs...
...that an American attack would just be a matter of time.
We did not have a Russian interpretor.
We only had a Russian ambassadeur-
-who didn't speak very good Spanish.
I wrote the letter myself.
I doubt that he received a clear statement.
I can't imagine how the letter was translated at all.
Then, Chrusjtjov sent a letter where he defended himself towards the accusations.
He said that he had obtained guarantees from the United States that-
-Cuba would not be invaded.
An oral agreement of course.
And he said that we had suggested to strike first.
[Oktober 1962]
The Russian head of state Chrusjtjov places nuclear missiles-
-on Cuba and builds a Soviet military base on the western hemisphere.
President Kennedy defends himself with an embargo-
-and stops all transports of weapons from Soviet.
Kennedy was emotionally involved.
He believed what Chrusjtjov said.
It became a game of words.
Chrusjtjov used a naive and superficial statement-
[A. Gromyko]
[Soviet Foreign Minister of affairs]
-based on his intentions with certain weapons.
He said that they were not intended for offensive use.
Therefor they were not offensive weapons.
No, we were simply afraid that they wouldn't be destroyed...
..and that we would suffer from the radioactive leakage.
After 13 days, the Russians agreed to remove the missiles-
-if USA didn't invade Cuba.
That the Guantánamo base should be returned-
-the removal of the blockade-
-the end of terror attacks...
Five issues altogether.
Yes, that is what they did, and that's what I wrote about. 
They put our interests aside.
A great tension was created all around the world.
Nobody wanted a nuclear war-
-over an American military base in Cuba, or an economic blockade against Cuba.
Nobody would have started a nuclear war over that.
We were inexperienced.
We could not pretend to have more experience than we had.
We didn't know anything about the balance of power.
At the time of the invasion, the revolution was just 2 years old.
By the time of the missile crisis it was three and a half years old.
It seems to me, we did what we had to do.
And we did it pretty well.
But i don't think we would have known...
...just how erratic our allies could be.
They did not understand the 3:rd world or our operations there.
They just thought about tank brigades-
-artillery och motorized infantry.
Troups in general.
Irregular warfare cannot be fought with that kind of troups.
They're only good for parades. We have dedicated ourselves to irregular warfare-
-and triumphed over traditional warfare.
It would at least have been an expected behaviour from the USA.
It was not the only 
American intervention.
Santo Domingo and some other places in Central America were intervened.
CIA existed back then of course.
-Yes, everybody knew this.
Except the Americans.
Yes, all the Americans hear, is that it's a "communist regime"-
-that's a "danger to the national security" And that's a sacred phrase.
Whenever that phrase is used, the effect is merely a reflex.
"US national security..."
That's a sacred phrase.
No, there were Cubans that studied the experiences of the Vietnamese.
-I don't think more than 20.
I'm not totally sure about this, but it was a small group of people.
There has later been rumors that we had security advisors there-
-and that these advisors participated in torturing prisoners of war.
This is an absolute lie.
If this was true you could be sure that we would've taken those people to court.
Believe us or not.
I assure you that in 43 years of revolution
..we have never used torture.
That principal we adopted since the war.
It was Batista's methods, and we would never use them.
The Vietnamese didn't want any foreigners in their army.
They never asked the Chinese or the Russians for help.
-Yes.
Very nationalistic.
The Vietnamese were not criminals.
They didn't execute their prisoners.
-You should know better than I.
You know that there were an invasion.
1500 soldiers. 1200 were taken prisoners.
The battle lasted for 68 hours.
Hundreds were injured, and more than a hundred died.
We were attacked by planes disguised as Cuban planes.
That was a source of irritation-
-and a tremendous anger for the people.
I want you to tell me if any of 
1200 prisoners were tortured.
I came there myself.
Ask anyone, ask Almeida.
Go to the streets and ask people if they've ever heard of anybody being tortured.
It doesn't fit our way of life, and it doesn't go together with our morals.
[Huber Matos, Major]
[Sentenced to 25 years for treason]
The merits of war were minimal.
The trial took place here.
I went to court with all the papers, all the evidence-
-and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
He performed a treacherous act.
A dangerous act.
[Museum of modern art]
[Habana, Cuba]
If we tell them where we are going there will be alot of people.
We can tell mr Reagan...
..that we aren't scared of his threats.
What is a dictator?
Does anybody really know?
Is it bad to be a dictator?
'Cause I have seen American governments-
-Being friends with the biggest dictators that ever lived.
Karl Marx talks about the dictatorship within the proletarian movements-
-Not of personal dictatorship.
I have always tried to solve the basic problems-
-through persuation and moral authority.
You will not find a single picture from the last 43 years-
-where the police is oppressing the people.
What do they mean?
They deny me as a dictator?
I don't see the similarity, but I do think that Evita Perón-
-struggled for people's rights.
She fought for her ideals-
-and actually got a bigger support than her husband, Perón.
I'm not offended by the fact that you compare her to me.
I haven't borrowed ideas. I have always done what I thought what was right.
I confess to myself being a dictator.
My own personal dictator.
I'm a slave to my people, that's exactly what I am.
It was his imagination.
Look at him.
What we did today, we can do in any neighborhood.
In any street of Habana, we can do the same thing. Walk by ourselves.
In every state there's a bureaucracy.
I don't like....
We are talking about different things.
I don't give orders, 
I convince people.
I talk to much sometimes, but that's simply because I like convincing people.
I speak in a simple manor.
Almost like a conversation.
I have trouble sitting still.
The pope said recently that the theory of evolution-
-is not reconsilable-
-with the doctrine of creation.
The pope does not speak about hell-
-he talks about the fear of god.
I don't believe in everything that man has created.
It depends.
If religion is used to create values or to comfort people-
-then, that's not an opiate. But if it's used to support bad things..
...then it might be an opiate.
Religion comforts many people-
-I feel very pleased with my life..
...and the things I've accomplished.
It gives me pleasure when new ideas creates succesful solutions.
I'm constantly pleased with the revolutionary work.
I wouldn't consider to trade my life with someone else.
Yes, I think that the values that people have are important.
You should do something worthwile in life, no just by being a role model.
Yes, everything is based around giving our people possibillities-
-to develop their full potentials-
-Both in the field of health and education.
We try to cultivate certain values.
One of the most admirable things about Fidel is that-
-he's a historic man, a role model-
-who constantly refers to his own personal experiences.
But he doesn't live in the past.
He tells us what the future brings.
-People will live forever.
-We can live for 120 år.
Turtles can be 300 years old.
Could we modify the genes and live longer? It could be better.
Researchers should be working on that.
It could be the source of youth.
If a man could live for 500 years we would end up being bored.
-So he doesn't want to live forever?
-No.
My mind has adjusted to the thought that I can't live forever-
-There's a time limit.
-A deadline.
Also to think?
Viagra helps thinking?
The doctors say that it helps with the blood circulation.
-I could be a CIA agent.
-Correct. Headlines will be:
"Oliver Stone travels to habana to give Viagra to Castro!"
If they believe in America that you could kill the enemy with a heart attack.
You'll be decorated
The decoration you didn't get in Vietnam.
That's the courage you need now to do what you do.
It all depends if it will be within 20 years...
...within 10 years or 6 months.
Since I always has been in danger being killed in one of those attempts-
-since the initial revolution, I've always thought: "Who could have the-
-authority to continue the revolution"
It's not going to be easy.
I have more confidence in the ideas-
-and the political culture of our people-
-than in the men themselves.
-Who is he talking about?
-About me.
It has been a habit in my mind that I don't feel it's my right to talk about any public relation
I had with a lady.
That's the first rule in my life.
[Celia Sanchez died in cancer 1980]
1959: Fidel Castro stars in 
Edward R. Murrows "Person to Person"
As a politician and a revolutionaire
I refuse to mix family with politics.
The whole idea behind a "first lady" to me seems ridiculous.
As for my children, I haven't had much time for them.
If you're going to measure my parental quality judging by the time I spent-
-Perhaps I haven't a very good father.
-I haven't had much time. 
But I'm fully sensitive to my children-
-and their needs, and I'm very sorry 
I don't have more time to share with them.
When I'm with them, I try to make the most of that time.
That's a wrong question...
..since it's based on the assumption that we don't have an electorial system-
-and that we don't have elections in Cuba.
Possibly, our elections can often be more democratic than in other countries.
I think you ought to study the 
Cuban election system and our methods.
All the citizens are participating in shape of delegates from all regions.
The parties don't choose their candidates, the people do.
The citizens chooses and nominates their choice of candidates.
You can't assume we don't have elections here in Cuba.
At the beginning of the revolution there was in our country-
-a male-chauvinistic spirit... and prejudice against the gay community.
That is something that has faded away during the years-
-Today people practically are not prejudice anymore.
It was hard because we lived in a chauvinistic society...
The black population was the poorest.
They are the ones that benefited the most from the revolution.
Thanks to Fidel, 
"I now have what I deserve" as he said it.
It's all thanks to him.
Trust me.
The most revolutionary here are the blacks.
Yes, we have black political leaders, but we aren't pleased yet..
We haven't reached the maximum possibillities for equality between races.
They have entered a phase where the cease-fire has been lifted-
-and all the negotiations have been terminated.
It could lead to a very bloody war.
-So he sees another Vietnam?
-I see a civil war coming.
I can't compare it to Vietnam-
-because historic events never repeat themselves exactly the same way.
It's going to be a complicated war,because many different forces are involved.
[The South African apartheid regime]
[supposedly had nuclear weapons]
[When Nelson Mandela]
[became president 1994 they were missing]
No. I know a little bit about that.
My deepest conviction is-
-that he doesn't know where those nuclear weapons are.
I asked him about it. What had happened with the nuclear weapons-
-and what he had been told about the weapons.
He said he was told that they were destroyed-
-dismantled.
That is a question many of us bare in mind.
It's impossible to establish a world order based on force.
The solution to the world's problems is not a military solution.
I hope the American people will play a defensive role-
-when it comes to defending the idea of a better world with a more human system.
From a strategic point of view, 
I think he was correct.
But I never heard Che only referring to the United States.
USA is it's people.
To stop the corruption, and to put an end to the abuse-
-and the opression.
That was what Che prioritized.
It was about the struggle against colonialism. That's what Che meant.
If history is written like that-
-I wouldn't believe in history again.
Here is a letter from our comrade
Ernesto Guevara.
"Fidel"
I feel that I have lived up to the duty-
-that tied me to the Cuban revolution-
-Now I leave you, the comrades and your people, which also is my people.
The truth is that he asked one thing when he joined us in Mexico:
When the Cuban revolution had ended he wanted to continue the fight-
-and he didn't want, for reasons of state-
-that we should stop him-
-He had his mind set up.
-He wanted to continue fighting.
The Russians became critical.
That they used the capitalistic categories to build socialism.
-Never.
It would have been like getting rid of my own brother, Raul.
I sent him to Africa and 
I will tell you why.
Che was very impatient,
He wanted to go to South America.
I didn't think the situation was right at the time-
-and our mission in Africa wasn't completed.
He was very anxious to fight.
Guerilla warriors have to be young.
Bolivia was cojoint effort.
I realized that it would take time.
When a guerilla war starts, when you initiate it-
-the terrain and the people is unknown.
I wanted him to arrive safely.
But then there were different ideas about how things should be-
-and the head of Bolivia's communist party got jealous of Che.
Therefor there were antagonism.
"Other countries compete for my modest contributions"
I leave no possessions for my family, which I'm proud of.
I don't ask for anything, because I know they'll be taken care of by the state-
-everything they need to make a living, and get a good education.
You always philosophize.
I wish we could observe life as two different parts.
The first part is a rehearsal-
-and the other part is real life.
It has happened to you, me, to all everybody else.
It's enough being born once.
Of course, everybody make mistakes.
Life is a process where you learn values and ideas.
We are neither born with ideas, and not born with values.
We learn along the way.
We are taught along the way.
Or perhaps we learn from our own experiences.
If I was born again, I think 
I would be more or less the same person.
Under the same circumstances of course.
Our Nation - Or Death
We Shall Prevail
Let's not fool ourselves in believing that-
-the future will be easy.
Maybe it will be even harder.
I have to take him to the airport. it's the only guarantee, let's go.
Don't waste any time, Oliver.
We don't have any flowers or presents, but we'll post you some.
-Leave him, and we'll feed him.
-Good, I can do voluntary work.
Subtitling : iNSPiRE TM 2003
The National Rifle Association has produced a film which you are sure to find of great interest.
Let's look at it.
It was the morning of April 20th, 1999.
And it was pretty much like any other morning in America.
The farmer did his chores, the milkman made his deliveries, the president bombed another country whose name we couldn't pronounce.
Out in Fargo, North Dakota,
Carry McWilliams went on his morning walk.
Back in Michigan, Mrs. Hughes welcomed her students for another day of school.
And out in a little town in Colorado, two boys went bowling at six in the morning.
Yes, it was a typical day in the United States of America.
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah,
I'm here to open up an account.
Okay, what type of account would you like?
Um, I want the account where
I can, uh, get the free gun.
Okay.
I'd spotted an ad in the local Michigan paper that said if you opened an account at North Country Bank,
- the bank would give you a gun.
- You do a CD and we'll hand you a gun.
We have a whole brochure here that you can look at.
Once we do the background check and everything,
- it's yours to go.
- Okay. Well, all right, well, that's the account
I'd like to open.
We have a vault, which at all times we keep at least
- 500 firearms.
- Five-hundred of these,
- you have in your vault?
- In our vault.
Wow.
We have to do a background check.
- At the bank here?
- At the bank, which we are a licensed firearm dealer.
Oh, you are? You're a bank and a licensed firearm dealer.
What do I put for "race"?
White or Caucasian or...?
- Caucasian.
- Caucasian.
I knew you were gonna make me spell the... Cau-ca-sian.
- Is that right?
- Yes.
I don't think that's the part they're gonna be worried about.
"Have you ever been adjudicated mentally defective or have you ever been committed to a mental institution?"
I've never been committed to a mental institution.
What does that mean,
"Have I ever been adjudicated mentally defective"?
It would be something involved with a crime.
So if I'm just normally mentally defective but not criminal...
Yeah, exactly.
- There you go, Mike.
- Okay. Thank you very much. Wow.
- I had one personally--
- That's a nice tension.
It is and it's a straight-shooter,
It's a straight-shooter, let me tell ya.
Wow. Sweet.
Well, here's my first question:
You think it's a little dangerous, handing out guns in a bank?
Ten-ho!
Each gun makes lots of battle sounds.
Just press the trigger, and listen.
That sounds like a gun battle.
Over there.
- Is it real?
- Looks like real!
Hey, it sounds like real!
Right! The Sound-O-Power military and western rifles by Marx!
This was my first gun.
I couldn't wait to go outside and shoot up the neighbourhood.
Those were the days.
"I was born
"in Michigan
"and I wish and wish again that I was back
"in the town where I was born"
By the time I was a teenager,
I was such a good shot
I won the National
Rifle Association's
Marksman award.
You see,
I grew up in Michigan, a gun-lover's paradise.
And so did this man, the Oscar-winning actor and president of the National
Rifle Association,
Mr. Charlton Heston.
We come from a state where everyone loves to go hunting.
- Hah.
- Even the dogs.
There were actually two of the hunters at camp.
They thought they'd get a few pictures of the dog dressed up as a hunter to kind of just have some fun around camp.
And one of the guys had the idea that,
"Why don't we sling a rifle on the dog's back to make the pictures a little more interesting.
The victim was kneeling down in front of the dog when the weapon slipped.
The one round went through the victim's shin, the right part of his shin, and came out through the back of his calf.
Was the dog hauled off for any period of time by the police?
No, it wasn't. No.
Um, in Michigan, the law basically states that people can commit crimes that animals aren't some... form of, uh, you know, whatever that can commit a crime.
An animal cannot commit a crime or be charged with a crime in this state.
- Exactly.
- Is it possible that the dog
- knew what it was doing?
- That, I don't know.
I really wouldn't be able to tell you that.
The dog was cute dressed up as a hunter, there's no doubt about it.
I mean, it was a funny picture, um, you know, to look at.
It was... it was kind of neat.
Yup, this was the kind of place I was from.
A box
- of 270s.
- Coming up.
- There you go.
- Perfect.
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Sorry about that, sorry.
So I've been discharged.
You don't need no gun control.
You know what you need?
We need some bullet control.
We need to control the bullets, that's right.
I think all bullets should cost $5,000.
$5,000 for a bullet.
You know why?
'Cause if a bullet cost $5,000, there'd be no more innocent bystanders.
Every time somebody get shot, people are,
"Damn, he must've did something."
See, they put $50,000's worth of bullets in his ass!"
And people'd think before they killed somebody for a bullet that cost $5,000!
"Man, I would blow your fucking head off -- if I could afford it."
I'm gonna get me another job,
I'm gonna start saving some money, and you a dead man.
You better hope I can't get no bullets on layaway.
Not far from where
Charlton Heston and I grew up is a training ground for the Michigan Militia.
Why do you use the bowling pins?
From a self-defence or whatever tactical standpoint, it's a small target, which also represents the vitals on a... on a human being, if you ever had to shoot at one.
The Michigan Militia became known around the world when, on April 19th, 1995, two guys living in Michigan who had attended
Militia meetings,
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, blew up the federal building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people.
The Michigan Militia wanted everyone to know that they were nothing like McVeigh and Nichols.
This is an American tradition.
It's an American responsibility to be armed.
If you're not armed, you're not responsible.
Who's gonna defend your kids, the cops?
The federal government?
No, none of them.
It's your job to defend you and yours.
If you don't do it, you're in dereliction of duty, as an American. Period.
We're here to let them know we're here to help.
We're not the bogeymen we're made out to be.
We're here to help and defend the people of this country.
I'm sure you guys are the kind of people that people would like to have as their neighbour.
If somebody's in need, you're there to help them.
Pretty much. We're all normal people. We all have regular jobs and this is what we do on our time.
- What kind of a job do you have?
- I'm a draftsman.
- How about you?
- Unemployed right now.
Frank, what do you do for a living?
I work for a heat trading company.
- I drive a truck for 'em.
- Okay. How about you?
- I'm a real-estate negotiator
- Real- estate negotiator!
White collar all the way.
You don't bring that with you, though, do you, when you're negotiating the real estate?
No.
Where do you live, in suburban--
- Westland.
- So what do you have
- in your home?
- Smith & Wesson 9-millimetre.
- Nine-millimetre?
- Yeah.
- And how about you?
- With hollow points.
Twelve gage.
- Twelve gage at home?
- Yeah.
- How about you?
- M-16.
- At home?
- Yeah.
- At the ready.
- I don't agree with that,
'cause you gotta worry about where your arms are going.
I know where they're gonna go when I aim and shoot.
Whose idea was the calendar?
That'd probably be Christian.
A picture's worth 1,000 words.
A) it demonstrates a level of sophistication that you wouldn't expect out of Militia;
B) you know,
- we're people too.
- Right.
And we have a lot of fun with it.
- Right.
- There was a fundraiser.
It showed, um, that we're not so serious, you know.
We're not these conspiracy nuts who wouldn't want our pictures to get out. The idea... it was a fundraiser, you know...
I've had guns, um... pretty much since
I was old enough to... to have them. And I learned how to use them, um...
You're silly!
Uh, because being a female, number one,
I felt it was important to be able to protect myself with the best means possible.
And one of those means is having a gun.
When a criminal breaks into your house, who's the first person you're gonna call?
Most people will call the police because they have guns.
Cut out the middleman. Take care of your own family yourself.
If you're not going to protect your family, who is?
We're not racist, we're not extremist, we're not fundamentalist, we're not terrorists or militants
- or other such nonsense.
- We're citizens.
We're just concerned citizens.
We have a desire to fulfil our responsibilities and duties as Americans, and armed citizenry is part of that.
- What do you grow here?
- Right now, there's tofu beans, soy beans. Tofu-soy beans.
- You're a tofu farmer.
- Yeah. Yeah, food farmer.
- I'm a food farmer.
- Food.
I grow food for people to eat.
No herbicides, no pesticides on that stuff.
- Right. All natural.
- Right.
- Yeah. Better.
- Certified organic.
- Uh-huh. Healthier.
- Yeah.
Basically, yeah.
This is James Nichols, the brother of Terry Nichols.
James graduated from high school the same year I did, in the district next to mine.
On this farm in Decker, Michigan,
McVeigh and the Nichols brothers made practice bombs before Oklahoma City.
Terry and James were both arrested in connection
- to the bombing.
- U.S. attorneys formally linked the Nichols brothers of Michigan with Oklahoma bomb suspect
Timothy McVeigh.
Officials charged James, who was at the hearing, and Terry, who was not, with conspiring to make and possess small bombs.
Terry Nichols was convicted and received a life sentence.
Timothy McVeigh was executed.
But the feds didn't have the goods on James,
- so the charges were dropped.
- I'm just glad to be out and free, so I can get on with my life.
Did Timothy McVeigh ever stay here?
Yes. Yes. He stayed here several times.
For the longest period, about three months or so, I dunno.
But, uh, he was a nice guy.
- Decent guy?
- Oh, yeah.
They didn't find anything on this farm.
As to what,
- bomb-making material?
- Any kind of explosives.
Uh, yeah, I had blasting caps, dynamite blasting caps, dynamite fuse, black powder, you know?
For muzzle loaders and...
Sure.
Diesel fuel, fertilizer, but, uh, that is normal farm stuff that is no way connected any way whatsoever to, uh, the Oklahoma City bombing or bomb making.
Them people - law enforcement, if you wanna call 'em that - were here and they were shaking in their shoes.
They were physically shaking.
Scared to death.
Of?
Because they thought this was gonna be another Waco.
Because certain people... namely my ex-wife and other people, said I'm a radical,
I'm a wild man,
I got a gun under every arm, down every leg and every shoe, every corner of the house.
You say anything to me,
I'll shoot ya.
If the people find out how they've been ripped off and... and enslaved in this country by the government, by the powers-to-be... they will revolt, with anger, with merciless anger.
There'll be blood running in the streets.
When a government turns tyrannical, it is your duty to overthrow it.
Well, why not use Gandhi's way?
He didn't have any guns, and he beat the British empire.
I'm not familiar with that.
Oscoda has a bad habit of raising psychos.
Bad habit of it.
This is Brent.
And this is his buddy DJ.
They live in Oscoda, Michigan, across the bay from the Nichols farm.
Eric Harris, who would later go on to commit the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, spent part of his childhood here.
Eric lived on the air-force base in Oscoda, where his dad flew planes during the Gulf War.
Twenty percent of all the bombs dropped in that war were from planes that took off from Oscoda.
I asked Brent if he remembered anything about Eric.
I never knew him, but I knew of him.
He left here before I got here.
I've only lived here seven years
- off and on.
- He was about the same age as you, so you must have people in your class--
A friend of mine knows him, he was in class with him.
He's lived here all his life.
I went to school with him and it shocked me to hear it on the news.
That especially a kid from here would be doing that.
I didn't last too long in high school.
I got kicked out,
I got expelled.
- Why was that?
- I had a run-in with a kid one time and I pulled a weapon on him, I pulled a gun on him.
- What kind of gun?
- Nine-millimetre.
I could've made a mess out of that situation.
- Could've been worse.
- Could've been a lot worse.
- Could've been Eric Harris.
- It could've been.
- So they kicked you out?
- Yeah, they kicked me out for 380 days or 165 days, whatever a full school year is.
For the longest time, that's what my plan was, to move out
- to Colorado.
- Colorado?
'Cause I've got family out there.
Matter of fact, one of my uncles is a janitor for Columbine School.
- Really?
- Yeah.
After Columbine, what was it like here in Oscoda?
My name was second-highest on the bomb list, because of the reputation you get in this town.
Why? You mean they did a list of--
- Of suspects.
- Of students who potentially--
- Yeah.
- ...would call in a bomb threat
- after Columbine?
- Yes.
And you were number two on the list?
I was second or third on the list, yeah.
- Why is that?
- Because the whole fact is, like I said, this town really gets people down.
Yeah, but why did they single you out?
- Because I was a troubled kid.
- You were in trouble in school?
Oh, yeah.
Why did they put you number two on their list, after Columbine, of the students that could be a threat?
- Come on, there must be a reason.
- Well, okay. The thing is,
I have a thing, it's called the "Anarchist Cookbook."
It shows you how to make bombs and stuff like that.
If there's anything that went wrong, they're gonna come to me first.
- And I don't need that.
- Just 'cause you owned a copy
- of the book?
- Just because I own a copy--
- Never made a bomb yourself?
- No. Oh, I've made 'em.
It was nothing big; it wasn't even as big as a pipe bomb.
It was just... some make it like a little tennis- ball bomb or something like that.
Out of the "Anarchist Cookbook," the latest thing I built...
I think, would have to be...
I think I made it, like, about a good five-gallon drum of napalm.
You know, homemade napalm.
Kids knew that you were doing this?
- Yeah.
- So you were number two, then,
- on the list.
- Right.
- Who was number one?
- I don't know.
They never told me that name.
Which kind of made me mad.
'Cause I didn't make it to number one.
I know it's kind of silly, but I guess it'd been kind of an ego thing, knowing that I was number one at something in Oscoda, even if it was a bomb-threat list.
Do you believe it was right to blow up the building in Oklahoma City?
- I'm not saying you did it.
- No. No, no, no.
- I'm just saying: was it right?
- Why was it "blowed up"?
That's a good question. Why was that building "blowed up"?
- And who blew it up?
- But if someone did it,
- it would be wrong.
- Yeah.
It is wrong to take the lives of those people.
Yeah.
I use the pen. 'Cause the pen is mightier than the sword.
But you always must keep a sword handy, for when the pen fails.
I sleep with a .44 Magnum under my pillow.
Come on...
That's what everyone says.
- Is that true?
- It's true.
- If we were to go--
- The whole world knows that.
...look under your pillow right now, would we see a .44 Magnum?
- Yeah.
- Honestly?
Would you take us and show us?
Right now?
He took me into his bedroom, but told the cameraman to stay out. Sure enough, there was a .44 Magnum under his pillow.
There it is. Okay.
Is it loaded?
Aye-yay-yay.
Okay. I believe you.
Don't do that!
- You put the gun to your head.
- I know!
- Jeez!
- I'm not gonna get hurt!
- This is loaded.
- It's loaded, it's safe.
You've got to pull the trigger, pull the hammer and shoot it.
- Mm, put the hammer back.
- No one has a right to tell me that I can't have it.
That is protected
- in our constitution.
- Where's it say a handgun
- is protected?
- No, gun. We should...
- Every citizen--
- It doesn't say "gun"!
- It says "arms."
- Arms. What is arms?
- Could be a nuclear weapon.
- It's not these-- That's right,
- it could be a nuclear weapon!
- You think you should have the right to have weapons-grade plutonium here on the farm?
We should be able to have anything--
Should you have weapons-grade plutonium?
- I don't want it.
- But should you have the right
- to have it if you did want it?
- That should be restricted.
Ah! Ah, so you do believe in some restrictions.
Well, there's wackos out there.
"Happiness is a warm gun
- "Bang bang shoot shoot"
- The town of Virgin,
Utah, has passed a law requiring all residents to own guns.
Cary McWilliams proudly displays the target he used to pass his shooting test.
But the thing is, he can't see it.
He's blind.
Cary has had a love affair with guns since he first got his hands on an M-16 as a teenager.
I'm actually most comfortable with assault rifles.
Woo-hoo!
This is a great place to raise your children.
A really great place to raise your kids.
Very close-knit community we have here.
Everybody looks out for everybody.
- Good people.
- Good people.
This just happens to be a place where two young men made very bad, very wrong decisions.
And there's been international notoriety as a result of it.
Other than that,
I don't know that Littleton is a lot different than a whole lot of other suburban communities.
Economic Development P.R. Video
Good morning, Mr. Edwards, members of the board.
I'd like to report that
I've found the perfect location for our new corporate office,
South Metro Denver.
You can see,
I don't need these.
Because South Metro Denver has about the same amount of sunshine and precipitation as Southern California.
It's so incredible, you're just gonna have to see it for yourselves.
How's this look, Mr. Edwards?
Denny Fennel
Home Security Consultant
We're south of Denver, in a community called Littleton, and this house is pretty much your average middle-class suburban home.
The burglar or the rapist is still here in the neighbourhood somewhere.
And so citizens sometimes think that...
I have people tell me all the time--
Where exactly is the burglar or rapist right now?
If I was to try and stab you through this, right here, you're gonna have to be really close. Right?
And here's the bottom line on this.
What if I had a spear?
Now, downstairs is where the safe-room was constructed, and this is a solid-core door, a very heavy door.
And now, the criminal has to break through this door, so you've created another barrier.
- An axe would do it.
- An axe would do it.
I think that Columbine did a couple of things.
One is that it changed how we talk. That's the first thing.
- How's that?
- Well, for instance, if I say "Columbine," everybody knows what it means.
I don't have to explain to you that Columbine...
- Is... What's wrong?
- Nothing, I just...
- What's wrong?
- I-- I just... sometimes Columbine bothers me.
I'll be fine. Just a minute.
- That's okay, that's okay.
- Um...
There... there's something, um... something overwhelming about that kind of... viciousness, that kind of predatory action, that kind of indiscriminate, uh, killing.
World's Largest Weapons Maker
This facility, where we're located right now...
Evan McCollum
Lockheed Martin Public Relations and two other major facilities where our employees work are either in or very near Littleton.
So we have over 5,000 employees at these facilities, quite a number of whom live in Littleton, many of whom have children who attend Columbine High School.
I suppose in one way you could say that what happened at Columbine High School is a microcosm, uh... of what happens throughout the world.
You know the signs that we see around here, the ones that say:
"We Are Columbine," is that how you,
Lockheed Martin, feels, that you're the biggest employer here in Littleton, you're the biggest weapons- maker? "We Are Columbine."
I think we probably embody that spirit, that, yeah, we're all members of this community and that it behoves us to help one another and to reach out to assist one another, yeah.
He told us that no one in Littleton, including the executives at Lockheed, could figure out why the boys at Columbine had resorted to violence.
Why would kids do this?
Uh, some of the root of that probably has to do with their anger about various issues and we became aware of a program that provides anger-management training.
And so we made a $100,000 contribution to the Jefferson County schools to use this training in the schools. We hope to help both teachers and students learn alternative ways to deal with anger.
So you don't think our kids say to themselves:
"Well, gee, Dad goes off to the factory every day and, you know, he built missiles." These are weapons of mass destruction.
What's the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at Columbine High School?
I guess I don't see that connection, that specific connection, because the missiles that you're talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us.
Societies and countries and governments do things that annoy one another.
But we have to learn to deal with that annoyance or that anger or that frustration in appropriate ways.
We don't get irritated with somebody and just 'cause we're mad at them, uh, drop a bomb or shoot at them, or fire a missile at them.
Oh my goodness!
Oh my word!
Oh my word!
South of Denver in Littleton, on the grounds of the U.S. Air Force Academy, there sits an actual B-52 bomber.
The plaque underneath it proudly proclaims that this plane killed Vietnamese people on Christmas eve, 1972.
It was the largest bombing campaign of the Vietnam War.
Just outside Denver is Rocky Flats the largest plutonium- weapons-making factory in the world, and now a massive radioactive dump.
A few miles away, buried inside a mountain, is NORAD, which oversees our nuclear missiles, many of which dot the Colorado landscape.
And once a month, Lockheed transports one of its rockets, with its Pentagon payload, through the streets of Littleton, passing nearby
Columbine High School on its way to an air-force base on the other side of Denver.
The rockets are transported in the middle of the night, while the children of Columbine are asleep.
Largest one day bombing by U.S. in Kosovo war
Twenty-two NATO missiles fell on the village of Bogutovac near Kraljevo.
Deadly cargo was dropped upon the residential part of the village.
We're striking hard at Serbia's machinery of repression, while making a deliberate effort to minimize harm to innocent people.
On the hit list were a local hospital and primary school.
We all know there has been a terrible shooting at a high school in Littleton, Colorado.
I hope the American people will be praying for the students, the parents and the teachers.
And we'll wait for events to unfold and then there'll be more to say.
Jefferson County, 911.
There's some boy at Columbine
High School, someone killed...
Do you know if anybody's injured?
- Yes.
- They've got pipe bombs, pipe bombs...
- You're shitting me.
- I'm not.
Student hit in the spine at Columbine.
- Okay.
- We've got...
- He's shot in the head.
- He's shot in the head?
- Deputy cashier's office.
- We have automatic weapons,
- okay?
- Yes.
All right. Can you get us lots and lots of paramedics?
- So he's still under an attack?
- Yes, sir, the school is.
We got a couple of kids out in the hall that are shot, so they're trying to get to them. Do not let anybody else in
- until we tell them.
- Jefferson County 911.
Hi, it's Izzy Povich at NBC News.
We're calling about the school shooting.
We're on the air live right now on MSNBC.
Can you-- Is that something you could just, literally, patch through to my desk, or you could tell us on the air?
I could put you through
- right now--
- I understand that...
Now they said he's gone to the library; he stayed in the building.
He's gone into the library and he's in the building.
Hi, this is Stephanie Gold from Dateline. How you doing?
- Good, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.
- I love your show.
- Oh, I'm so glad. Thank you.
- I watch it every night.
- Thank you.
- Jefferson County 911.
- Yes, I'm a teacher at Columbine High School. There is a shooter here with a gun.
- He just shot out a window.
- Has anybody been injured?
Yes! And the school is in a panic and I'm in the library.
I've got students down.
Under the tables, kids!
Heads under the tables!
I saw a student outside!
Okay,
I was on hall duty, I saw a gun!
"What's going on out there?!"
He turned the gun straight at us and he shot, and my God, the window went out.
The kid standing there with me,
I think he got hit.
We've got help on the way, ma'am.
- Oh God!
- Stay on line with me.
Oh God!
I think he's shooting in the library right now.
He's firing shots from the library.
- Firing shots in the library.
- ...our way.
Do we need to leave?
Okay, hold on.
...inside the cafeteria
I'm gonna have to try and get outta here and call you back.
I called in before, trying to find out where I'm supposed to go and they put me on hold
- for freaking ever!
- Hi, it's Wendy at CNN still.
Hi. We're just taking names and numbers for the press.
Fox has somebody from your office on now--
We've talked to a bunch of people and we can only do so many, we got so many more calls coming in.
I gotta get to my daughter at Columbine.
I've been trying for an hour, I can't get anywhere near there...
Sir, okay, calm down, okay?
I think we're entitled to information as parents
- on where our children are!
- We have a lot of units
- out there right now.
- I can't get anywhere near it.
I wanna find out how to get in touch with my daughter.
How do I get information on my daughter?
I don't have that information right now--
Why in the hell not?
It's been over an hour!
My son is Eric Harris, and I'm afraid that he might be involved with the shooting at Columbine High School.
Involved how?
He's a member of what they're calling the "trench-coat mafia."
- Have you spoken to your son?
- No, I haven't.
- Have they picked up anybody yet?
- They're still looking for suspects. Your son is with who? What gang?
They call them the "trench-coat mafia". I just heard that term
- on TV.
- Stay low, because if you try to leave, I don't want you to get shot.
Stay very low and quiet.
Low and quiet...
Everybody just stay quiet.
When the shooting was over,
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had killed 12 students and one teacher.
Dozens of others were wounded by the over-900 rounds of ammo that were fired. It is believed that the guns that they used were all legally purchased at stores and gun shows.
And many of the bullets were bought at the Littleton K-Mart just down the street.
Harris's diary also detailed ideas about hijacking an airplane and crashing it into New York City.
Some may characterize that as fantasy...
In the end, they turned the guns on themselves.
And then he came into the library, shot everybody around me, then put a gun to my head and asked if we all wanted to die and...
We started hearing shots in the hall and then they came in and they all told us to get under the desk and we all got under the desk and then they started coming in the library and opening fire...
I just started screaming and crying and telling them not to shoot me.
And so he shot the girl, he shot her in the head in front of me.
Then he shot the black kid, because he was black.
I have only five words for you:
From my cold, dead hands.
Just 10 days after the Columbine killings, despite the pleas of a community in mourning,
Charlton Heston came to Denver and held a large pro-gun rally for the National
Rifle Association.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Thank you all for coming and thank you for supporting your organization.
I also want to applaud your courage in coming here today.
I have a message from the mayor,
Mr. Wellington Webb, the mayor of Denver.
No, no, no, no, no.
He sent me this, and it says: "Don't come here.
We don't want you here."
I said to the mayor,
"This is our country.
As Americans we're free to travel wherever we want in our broad land."
Don't come here?
We're already here.
I am here today... because my son Daniel would want me to be here today.
If my son Daniel was not one of the victims, he would be here with me today.
Something is wrong in this country... when a child... can grab a gun... grab a gun so easily... and shoot a bullet... into the middle of a child's face, as my son experienced.
Something is wrong.
But the time has come to come to understand that a Tech-9 semi-automatic
30-bullet weapon like that that killed my son, is not used to kill deer.
It has no useful purpose.
It is time to address this problem.
We have work to do, hearts to heal, evil to defeat and a country to unite.
We may have differences, yes, and we will again suffer tragedy almost beyond description.
But when the sun sets on Denver tonight, and forever more, let it always set on we the people, secure in our land of the free and home of the brave.
I, for one, plan to do my part.
Thank you.
Or like when they had their convention in Colorado, a week, whatever, the month after Columbine, that was just stupid.
Just don't do that.
Of course you have "the right to," but what are you doing?
Upsetting a whole city full of people, why would you do that?
This is Matt Stone.
He grew up in Littleton and has fond memories of Columbine.
Yeah, Columbine, it's just a crappy school in the middle of a bunch of crappy houses.
Matt and his friend
Trey Parker found a way to take out their anger of being different in Littleton and turn it not into carnage, but into a cartoon.
"Just another Sunday morning
In my quiet...
"Mountain town"
"You can see your breath
Hanging in the air
"You see homeless people
But you just don't care
"It's a sea of smiles
In which we'd be glad to drown
"It's Sunday morning
In our quiet little
"White-bread redneck mountain town"
Columbine is a normal high school--
- Yeah.
- ...in a normal suburb--
- Yeah.
- ...you know, basically.
Yeah. Painfully, painfully, painfully normal.
Just absolutely, painfully, horribly average.
Littleton in general is...
I remember being in sixth grade and I... had to take the math test to get into Honors Math in the seventh grade.
And they're, like,
"Don't screw this up.
Because if you screw this up, you won't get into Honors Math in seventh grade.
And if you don't get in in seventh grade, you won't in eighth grade, then not in ninth grade.
And 10th and 11th grade and you'll just die poor and lonely."
And that's it, you know?
You believe, in high school - and a lot of it is kids, but the teachers and counsellors and principals don't help things.
They scare you into conforming and doing good in school by saying: "If you're a loser now, you're gonna be a loser forever."
So that with Eric and Dylan, people called them "fag."
They're like, "You know what?
If I'm a fag, now I'm a fag forever."
And you wish someone just could've grabbed them and gone,
"Dude, high school's not the end of...
A year, a year and a half, was it? I don't even know.
- You just move out--
- No, no, they were two weeks
- away from graduation.
- Yeah, you're done.
It's amazing how fast you lose touch with all those people.
They just beat it in your head as early as sixth grade:
"Don't fuck up.
'Cause if you do, you're gonna die poor and lonely.
You don't want to do that."
You're, like, "Fuck, whatever I am now,
I'm that forever." Of course, it's completely opposite.
All the dorks in high school go on to do great things and all the really cool guys are all living back in
Littleton as insurance agents.
Almost person to person, it's completely that way.
If somebody could've told them that, maybe they would've have done it, but...
I guess we'll never know why they did it, but one thing adults should never forget:
It still sucks being a teenager.
And it really sucks going to school.
What's your view on high school?
Uh, I love it.
Uh, I learn, I get picked on by bastards who hate me, and the principal's a dick.
All right.
What causes school violence?
Uh... him.
- Him?
- Yeah.
Yes, and after Columbine, it really sucked being a student in America.
Since last spring's shooting, at Columbine High, schools nationwide have extended zero-tolerance policies, suspending and expelling students for all kinds of behaviour considered unruly, or warning signs of violence to come.
This second-grader in Illinois was suspended for 10 days for bringing a nail clipper to class
"That's a weapon," his school said.
An elementary school suspended a first-grader for pointing a chicken strip at a teacher in the cafeteria.
The eight-year-old was fooling around with a friend at lunch last week when he pointed a breaded-chicken finger at a teacher and then said:
"Pow pow.
He pointed a folded piece of paper shaped like a gun, and told his classmates he was going to kill them during a game of cops and robbers.
If this isn't a warning sign, then what is it?
This Virginia high-school student spent a month out of classes, originally sent home
- for dying his hair blue.
- A high-school honour student from Michigan could be expelled later today in a school-board hearing.
Seventeen-year-old Jeremy Hicks wore a Scottish bagpiper's outfit to his junior prom that included a plaid kilt, a feathered hat and a traditional knife known as a "skein dhu."
This T-shirt landed a high-school student in court.
She wanted to start an anarchy club.
The little time-bombs that are out there ticking, waiting to go off. And there are many of them in every community.
Students in at least seven different states have been suspended or arrested for talking about or planning plots of their own.
It's almost like guerrilla warfare.
You don't know from which direction the enemy will be coming.
Having a well-conceived and strictly enforced dress code can dramatically improve the safety of a school, and can ensure a positive learning environment for everyone.
As this student's appearance demonstrates, having a lax policy about dress makes it easy for a student to conceal a weapon and makes it difficult to identify intruders on campus.
A dress code can reduce weapons violations, relieve tensions between gangs, reduce disciplinary infractions and generally improve the atmosphere of the school.
Our policy requires that students tuck in their shirts, making the beltline visible at all times.
Our students may not wear baggy pants or colours or insignias that are commonly associated with gang activity.
This policy was a collaborative effort.
Yes, our children were indeed something to fear.
They had turned into little monsters.
But who was to blame?
All the experts had an answer.
Angry, heavy-metal subculture.
- Where were the parents?
- Violent movies.
- "South Park."
- Video games.
- Television.
- Entertainment.
- Satan.
- Cartoons.
- Films.
- Society.
- Toy guns.
- Drugs.
Shock-rocker Marilyn Manson.
Marilyn Manson.
Marilyn Manson has cancelled the last five dates of his U.S, tour out of respect for those lost in Littleton.
But the singer says artists like himself are not the ones to blame.
This is perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company.
"I'm not a slave
"to a god
"that doesn't exist"
After Columbine, it seemed that the entire focus on why the shootings occurred was because the killers listened to Marilyn Manson.
Two years after Columbine,
Manson finally returned to Denver.
The Oz Fest at Mile High Stadium brings shock-rocker Marilyn
Manson to Denver tomorrow.
There were protests from the religious right.
But I thought I'd go and talk with him myself.
When I was a kid growing up, music was the escape.
That's the only thing that had no judgements.
You can put on a record and it's not gonna yell at you for dressing the way you do.
It's gonna make you feel better about it.
Some will be so brash to ask if we believe that all who hear Manson tomorrow night will go out and commit violent acts.
The answer is "no."
But does everybody who watches a Lexus ad go and buy a Lexus?
No. But a few do.
I definitely can see why they would pick me, because I think it's easy to throw my face on a TV, because I'm, in the end, sort of a poster boy for fear.
Because I represent what everyone's afraid of, because I do and say what I want.
If Marilyn Manson can walk into our town and promote hate, violence, suicide, death, drug use and Columbine-like behaviour,
I can say, "Not without a fight, you can't."
The two by-products of that whole tragedy were, uh... violence in entertainment and gun control.
And how perfect that that was the two things that we were gonna talk about with the upcoming election.
And also, then we forgot about Monica Lewinsky and we forgot about...
The president was shooting bombs overseas, yet I'm a bad guy because I sing some rock'n'roll songs.
And who's a bigger influence, the president or Marilyn Manson?
I'd like to think me, but I'm gonna go with the president.
Do you know the day that Columbine happened, the United States dropped more bombs on Kosovo than any other time during that war?
I do know that and I think that's really ironic, that nobody said, "Well, maybe the president had an influence on this violent behaviour.
Because that's not the way the media wants to take it and spin it and turn it into fear.
'Cause then you're watching television, you're watching the news; you're being pumped full of fear.
And there's floods, there's AIDS, there's murder.
You cut to commercial, buy the Acura, buy the Colgate.
If you have bad breath, they're not gonna talk to you.
If you got pimples, the girl's not gonna fuck you.
It's a campaign of fear and consumption.
And that's what I think that's it's all based on, is the whole idea that: keep everyone afraid, and they'll consume.
And that's really as simple
- as it can be boiled down to.
- Right.
If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in that community, what would you say to them, if they here right now?
I wouldn't say a single word to them.
I would listen to what they have to say.
And that's what no one did.
- I'm Nicole Shleif.
- And I'm Amanda Lamontagne.
- And you went to Columbine?
- Yes.
And you were with
Eric and Dylan?
- In their class?
- Yeah,
- we were in their bowling class.
- In their bowling class?
- Yes.
- What's bowling class?
Just an elective you can take for a gym credit.
Where's the educational value of this, though?
Um... I guess there isn't really any.
No, there's not.
I learned how to bowl a lot better, that's for sure.
What were Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold like?
- Weird.
- Yeah?
I mean, not very social.
I didn't really know who they were.
Not very social, just kinda kept to themselves.
How good a bowlers were Eric and Dylan?
When we played them, all I remember is they were just, like, crazy.
- They would just chuck the ball.
- Chuck it down there.
Throw the ball down; didn't really care how they bowled.
Yeah, they didn't really care about their scores.
Deputy Sheriff Steve Davis - What were the suspects doing the morning of attack?
I told you that I'd heard that they were bowling; that's the only thing
I'm aware of.
So did Dylan and Eric show up that morning and bowl two games before moving on to shoot up the school?
And did they just chuck the balls down the lane?
Did this mean something?
Um, I guess they went to their favourite class.
Why wasn't anyone blaming bowling for warping the minds of Eric and Dylan to commit their evil deeds?
Wasn't that just as plausible as blaming Marilyn Manson?
After all, it was apparently the last thing they did before the massacre.
But wait a minute. There's lots of bowling going on in other countries.
And don't they listen to Marilyn Manson in Germany, the home of sinister
Goth music?
Some Gothic festival.
Don't they watch the same violent movies in France?
Most of the violent video games are from Japan.
Many people in America believe that it's the break-up of the family unit that's caused so many wayward youth to turn to violence.
I'll save you the trouble.
I'll run away and kill myself!
How would you like that?
You can't keep me here!
But statistics show that there are more broken homes and divorce in Great Britain than in the U.S.
It's official:
Fergie's marriage has ended.
Liberals contend that it's all the poverty we have in America that causes all this violence.
But the unemployment rate in Canada is twice what it is here.
Of course, most people say it's because we Americans have a violent history, a violent past.
Cowboys and Indians, the Wild West, a history of conquering and bloodshed.
Well, if that's all it takes to end up with such a violent society like we have in America, how do you explain this?
Yet in spite of all this, how many people are killed by guns each year?
In Germany:
In France:
In Canada:
In the United Kingdom:
In Australia:
In Japan:
In the United States:
But that, to me, brings up an important question:
Then what is so different about Americans?
Tom Mauser
Father of Columbine victim
Are we homicidal in nature?
Because in Europe and Australia, most other free-world countries, they don't have this.
They don't have people who snap and go on murderous rampages.
Well, no, they're just like us.
They have the occasional person that snaps and kills a lot of people.
How about a British soccer riot?
Those aren't Quakers there,
Every time that
I bring up comparisons with other free-world countries, what I hear is:
"Oh, our culture is so different. We're so different."
And as you said, they have violent video games, they have violent movies, they have alienated youth, they - like us - don't have prayer in schools.
What is so radically different?
What is it about us?
- What is it?
- What is it?
- What is it?
- What is it?
I don't know.
Now, it's time for...
Hi, boys and girls.
Ready to get started?
Once upon a time, there were these people in Europe called pilgrims and they were afraid of being persecuted.
So they all got in a boat and sailed to the New World where they wouldn't have to be scared ever again.
- Oh, I'm so relaxed.
- I feel so much safer.
But as soon as they arrived, they were greeted by savages.
- They got scared all over again.
- Injuns!
So they killed them all.
Now, you'd think wiping out a race of people would calm them down, but no.
Instead, they started getting frightened of each other.
- Witch!
- So they burned witches.
In 1775, they started killing the
British, so they could be free.
And it worked.
But they still didn't feel safe.
So they passed a 2nd amendment, which said every white man
- could keep his gun.
- I loves my gun, loves my gun.
This brings us to the genius idea of slavery.
You see, boys and girls, the white people back then were also afraid of doing any work. So they went to Africa, kidnapped thousands of black people, brought them to America, and forced them to work very hard for no money.
And I don't mean no money like:
"I work at Wal-Mart and make no money."
I mean zero dollars.
Nothing, nada, zip.
Doing it that way made the USA the richest country in the world.
So did having all that money and free help calm the white people down? No way. They got even more afraid.
That's because after
200 years of slavery, the black people now outnumbered the white people in many parts of the South. Well, you can pretty much what came next.
The slaves started rebelling.
There were uprisings and old masters' heads got chopped off and when white people heard of this, they were freaking out.
They going: I want to live!
Don't kill me, big black man.
Well, just in the nick of time came Samuel Colt, who, in 1836, invented the first weapon ever that could be fired over and over without having to reload.
And all the settlers were like:
Yee-hah!
But it was too late.
The North soon won the Civil War and the slaves were free to go chop the old masters' heads off.
Then everybody was like:
Oh, no, we're gonna die.
But the freed slaves took no revenge.
They just wanted to live in peace.
But you couldn't convince the white people of this.
So they formed the Ku Klux Klan and, in 1871, the same year the Klan became an illegal terrorist organization, another group was founded: the National Rifle Association.
Soon, politicians passed one of the first gun laws, making it illegal for any black person to own one.
It was a great year for America. he KKK and the NRA.
Of course, they had nothing to do with each other; it was a coincidence. One group legally promoted responsible gun ownership; the other shot and lynched black people.
That's the way it was till
1955, when a black woman broke the law by refusing to move to the back of the bus.
White people just couldn't believe it.
- Huh? Why won't she move?
- What's going on?
Man, all hell broke loose.
Black people everywhere demanded their rights. White people had a major, freaky-feel meltdown and they were all like:
Run away! Run away!
And they did. They all ran fleeing to the suburbs, where it was all white and safe and clean. And they went out and bought a quarter-of-a-billion guns.
And put locks on their doors, alarms in their houses, and gates around the neighbourhoods.
And finally, they were all safe and secure and snug as a bug.
And everyone lived happily ever after.
Because if you turn on the evening news,
America still seems like a pretty scary place.
Who is he? Is he dangerous?
What's he up to?
What are you trying to pull, man?
Remember all the Y2Kscares?
Weren't we told that our very society was about to collapse because somebody forgot to type in a couple of digits on the computer?
There's gonna be mass chaos and confusion.
Tonight, the countdown begins.
All day, store director
Rick Smith
- watched consumers get Y2K ready.
- Batteries sell extremely well.
The lamp oil, generators.
After sending the country into a panic, the clock struck midnight...
And nothing happened.
Or how about those killer bees that were going to attack America?
We're almost certain they'll arrive this year.
Schmidt expects the Africanized bees to reach Texas this year, cross into Arizona in about two to three years.
He's concerned because the killer bee is overly aggressive.
They will follow you for half a mile.
The bees never came.
Remember the first time you heard that someone had hidden a razor blade in an apple at Halloween?
Before long, kids were not permitted to go out in the dark on Halloween and go trick-or-treating at strangers' homes.
Many people say they won't give out candy treats on Halloween.
It's too dangerous and they're too scared.
Well, guess what?
There never was any razor blade in the apple.
In fact, only two kids in the past 40 years have been killed by Halloween candy.
And both of them were poisoned on purpose by relatives.
Bye.
It was like a scene from a horror movie.
This man was mowing his lawn when a fox darted out of the woods and attacked his riding-mower.
A warning about a popular weight-loss supplement.
What you don't know may kill you.
You ride them every day, but in an instant, an escalator can mangle you or a loved one.
We reveal why you may be riding on stairway to danger.
You might want to take some extra precautions: keep a low profile, don't go around dancing with a bunch of Americans in the streets.
Make sure that you don't draw a lot of attention to yourself and the fact that you're American.
Nation's top doctor says one in five Americans suffers some form of mental disorder.
The surgeon general David
Satcher pleads with people to seek help now.
The media, the corporations, the politicians, have all done such a good job of scaring the American public, it's come to the point where they don't need to give any reason at all.
Today, the Justice Department did issue a... a blanket alert.
It was in recognition of a general threat we received.
Uh, this is not the first time the Justice Department have acted like this.
I hope it's the last.
But given the attitude of the evildoers, it may not be.
I just love these boulevards down here, though.
You don't get this in most of L.A.
South Central
Los Angeles
How come whenever
I'm out here, though,
I turn on the 11-o'clock news and I hear, you know:
"Tonight in South Central, drive-by shooting."
Or: "Tonight in South
Central..."
Prof. Barry Glassner
Author, "The Culture of Fear"
...this, that or whatever. I mean, they're not making that up, are they?
No, they're not making it up, but they're choosing what they're covering. If you turn on the TV, on the news, what are you gonna hear about?
Dangerous black guys, right?
Unnamed black guy who, you know,
- accused of some crime or...
- Right.
You're gonna see pictures of black guys doing bad things, and hearing stories about black guys doing bad things.
And we've heard this our whole lives.
Now, the suspect is a black male in his twenties.
We are told he has a large afro, sideburns, he was wearing a silver chain at the time.
Police say the suspect is a black man.
Six foot one, 160 to 180 pounds, about 35 years in age.
Suspect is a black male, age 16 to 18.
The suspect is
African-American.
- Police believe--
- Police say--
- The black man--
- Suspect--
- The suspect is a black male
- A black man.
A black... black... black...
A black man.
Susan Smith drowns her two children.
- She tells people a black guy...
- Correct.
Stole the car and stole the kids.
And everyone, at first, bought it.
Some guy jumped into her car, with her two kids in it.
Then he took off.
That's a black guy, she says.
- Black male?
- Yes, Ma'am.
And I told them I loved them.
I hollered I loved them
And it's just a tragedy.
The anonymous urban - which means usually black - male, comes by and does this.
It's the excuse for all kinds of things.
Charles Stewart, a lawyer in Boston...
- Right, exactly.
- ...kills his pregnant wife, says a black guy did it; everybody buys it.
The suspect described as a black male about six feet tall.
Chuck and Carol Stewart were robbed at gunpoint as they left a Lamaze class.
It seemed the ultimate urban nightmare.
You know, the thing I love about this country of mine, is that whether you're a psychotic killer or running for president of the United States, the one thing you can always count on is white America's fear of the black man.
We've heard the stories on the news and in the papers and they have killed people.
Killer bees, also known as "Africanized" bees.
I'm scared. I'm really worried.
Rose Shipley never expected a nest of Africanized killer bees to shack up across the street from her.
But I'm terribly allergic to them and so are my grandkids.
They're originally from southern and eastern Africa.
Dr. Warrick Care brought some to Brazil in 1956 and tried to mate them with the European bee, the kind that we're used to.
But they got loose and moved to the southern United States.
The main difference between a traditional honey bee and an Africanized bee is the bee's aggressiveness.
If I was to do this to an Africanized bee's hive,
I could have several hundred stings in a matter of minutes.
Danny Self raises the kinder, gentler European bees, and he's done the research.
The only way that you can tell the two of them, is doing measurements on the body parts.
Quite frankly, the black community has become entertainment for the rest of the community.
Meaning what?
The entertainment being that the crime of the day - you know, "If it bleeds, it leads" - gets to be the front story and then that becomes the perception and the image of an entire people.
Which couldn't be further from the truth, in my opinion.
In fact, you'll find, I think, most African-Americans are quite adverse to gun possession.
In suburbia, I think, there's some notion that there's going to be an invading horde, come from either the city or from someplace unknown, to savage their suburban community.
To me, not only is it bizarre, but it's totally, uh... unfounded.
And these pistols, curiously enough, weren't being taken off kids in the city of Flint, but were being taken off of kids out in the out-county area, in the suburban communities.
And--
I didn't think that's what you were gonna say.
I thought you were gonna say that it's all these black kids in the inner-city schools that had these guns.
No, that's...
We've never really had many problems with guns in the city.
Not to say that we haven't; we've had some.
But that's never been the biggest problem.
The biggest problem has been the gun possession by these adolescents in suburbia.
How'd you get a gun?
I stole mine. I stole it from a friend of mine.
His dad owns a bunch of guns.
What we're you doing with the stolen guns?
We went down to Detroit and started selling them.
'Cause I can get, like, a buck fifty a pop for a 9-millimetre.
Oh, really. Who were you trying to sell them to?
Anybody that would really want
'em. Gangs and stuff like that.
- Gangs in the city of Detroit?
- Yeah.
- Black?
- Uh, predominantly. Yeah.
Yeah. So now you're out now, you're okay.
Yeah, I'm free now.
I'm completely clear.
- You can keep selling guns.
- I can't keep selling guns.
It's getting too risky.
Everybody knows me up here.
People want guns, drugs or alcohol, they come to my house and that's just too much.
- Yeah, too much hassle.
- Yeah.
My favourite statistic in all the research I did discovered that the murder rate had gone down by 20%. The coverage - that is, how many murders are on the evening news - it went up by 600%.
The American people are conditioned by network TV, by local news, to believe that their communities are much more dangerous than they actually are.
For example, here, in this community, crime has decreased every year for the past eight years.
Yet, gun ownership, particularly handgun ownership, is on the increase.
Crime rates have been dropping, dropping, dropping.
Fear of crime has been going up, up, up.
How can that be possible?
It doesn't make any sense.
But it makes perfect sense when you see what we're hearing from politicians and seeing in the news media.
So we're, uh, we're right here on the corner of Florence and Normandie.
It's kind of Ground Zero for the L.A. riots.
Right.
You know, if a couple of white guys would go down and walk around
South Central, they're gonna get killed.
Which I can tell you is a common perception.
The odds that something's going to happen to us are really, really slight.
- Minuscule.
- Right. Okay.
But you know, if you look up there, you get a different symbol of the Hollywood sign.
It means something very different than the corner of Florence and Normandie.
For most Americans and most of the world, it means glamour and Hollywood, except that we can't see it.
I can't see the Hollywood sign.
Where is it?
Right. You can't see it because of something that's probably... much more dangerous for us right now, which is the stuff we're breathing.
The pollution that's blocking the Hollywood sign, we're breathing this.
That's far more dangerous than all the other stuff the media's
- telling us to be afraid of.
- Right.
As we left the corner of Florence and Normandie,
I noticed that a number of helicopters had appeared in the sky.
Within seconds, the news media
- started to arrive.
- So what's the story here?
I'm waiting.
I thought you would know.
No, I don't know anything.
The Sergeant just told me there's a guy with a gun.
But they're not sure.
That's all they told me.
Since there's no action,
I'm not getting my camera down.
I just happened to see the chopper, going to another story.
- What story are you going to?
- It's a near- drowning.
- It's a drowning?
- A near-drowning.
How about a story about how you can't see the Hollywood Hills because of the pollution?
Could you maybe do a story on that tonight?
Pollution, that's rather good.
I find that good.
You can't see it. You can't see anything around here.
If you have to choose between a guy with a gun and a near-drowning of a baby - you could only be one place--
- I go with the gun.
- You go with the gun, always.
Is it all over, here?
It's all over? All over?
- Not yet, not yet.
- Looks like it.
Just wait for these sergeants down here to come down,
'cause they got all the details.
Okay. Hey, I was just wondering -
I just got here to L.A. today -
I can't see the Hollywood sign, down on the hills there, down Normandie.
You can't see the sign
'cause of the pollution.
- Right.
- Is there anybody you can arrest
- for polluting up the air?
- Absolutely not.
- Nobody?
- No.
Why is that?
Why is that, Sergeant?
He's fighting!
For over a decade, there has been one show on American television that has consistently brought black and white people together in an effort to reduce our fears and celebrate our diversity.
That show is Cops.
I went to see a former producer of "Cops" and executive producer of World's Wildest
Police Videos:
Mr. Dick Herland.
Look "liberal" up in the dictionary and I think my picture's in there somewhere,
So then, you know, why not be compelled to do, you know, a show that focuses on, you know, what's causing the crime, as opposed to just chasing the criminals down?
Because I think it's harder to do that show.
I don't know what that show would be.
Anger does well, hate does well, violence does well.
Tolerance and understanding and trying to learn to be a little different than you were last year does less well.
- Does less well in the ratings.
- Oh yeah.
Maybe because we, in the television business, because we tend to demonize black and Hispanic people, then those watching it at home are going:
"I don't want to help those people.
I'm not going to do anything to help them.
Because I hate them now, because they may hurt me."
- You know what I'm saying?
- I know what you're saying,
I'm not sure that's what we're doing.
I'm not sure we're demonizing black and Hispanic people, uh... particularly.
I don't think we show black and Hispanic people as being criminals.
I'd like to say not more often, but probably they are more often.
But I certainly don't think...
We're certainly not trying to demonize black and Hispanic people.
We show them on the news, we show them on TV, as pretty scary people.
Yeah.
And I agree. I'd like to see that reversed as much as possible. I...
- Start tonight.
- Well, the thing is,
I don't know how to start tonight.
I don't know how to tell that story.
If I was smart enough to do that...
- I'll pitch you one.
- Okay. All right.
Um... um...
Do a show called not Cops but Corporate Cops.
"Corporation man
Hey Corporate man
"We're coming out to get you better run while you can
"We're coming out to get you better run while you can"
Uh... I love the idea.
I don't think it would make very interesting reality TV.
Unless we can get those people to get in their SUVs and drive really fast down the road away from the police.
But I'm telling you, everyone in America who's got just your basic, everyday job is gonna love watching the boss being chased down the street with his shirt off, thrown to the ground and a knee to the neck. I tell you, that is gonna get ratings.
Yeah, I'm with you. And if
I can find a police outfit that would prosecute corporate criminals appropriately and would go after them appropriately... In other words, what you do to a man who's just stolen a lady's purse with $85 to it, than you need to do an appropriate response to a man who has just stolen $85 million from indigent people, then, boy, we're gonna be out there filming that.
But as a matter of fact, when police go after the guy who's just stolen $85 million, they treat him like he was a member of the city council - as he may or may not be - and it's not exciting television.
If you could get that guy to take his shirt off...
Right.
Yeah, and throw his cellular phone at the police as they come through the door, try to jump out that window, then we'd have a show.
You watch violence on TV in a place like Canada and you know it's not happening next door.
You watch it here, and you know it is happening next door.
- Right.
- I think that's...
I don't know what the difference is,
- but there's a big difference.
- Yeah, but why isn't...
Why isn't it happening in Canada?
Why aren't there, you know,
10,000 murders a year?
I don't know, but I want to go to Canada to retire, or something, 'cause it sounds like where we want to be.
I'd like to find out what that difference is. Wouldn't you?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to find out.
Where are you supposed to be right now?
- School.
- School.
School.
Aren't you worried about what you're not learning?
Nah, I'm mostly helping everybody else in the class.
- Then I barely get to do my work.
- How about you? You're not
- worried about your education?
- Well, I've got the textbook.
Why do you think we have so many, uh...
- gun murders in America?
- Uh...
I have no idea. People must hate each other or something.
Oh, you mean Canadians don't hate each other?
Well, we do but we don't go to the point of shooting somebody
- just to get revenge.
- What do you do?
I don't know.
Tease them, maybe.
- Make fun of them, ridicule them.
- Throw eggs at them.
How many gun murders in Sarnia this year?
- None.
- Last year?
I believe we had one, at the time.
The year before that?
I can't recall what we had in the way of--
Maybe one in the last three years?
- Probably, yes.
- Mm-hm.
Very low. Very low for this city.
Well, of course, there's no murders here because there's only
70,000 people and it's the kissing capital of the world.
So I went down the river to another Canadian city that was five times as large as Sarnia:
Windsor, Ontario, just across the river from Detroit.
I was sure there'd be more murders in Windsor.
Ever hear of anyone being shot by a gun in Windsor?
No. No.
You remember any murders here?
Uh, there was one a long time ago. Probably--
- How long ago?
- Oh...
- In your lifetime?
- In my lifetime, probably around 15, 20 years ago, there was one murder.
In fact, this Windsor policeman told me that the only gun murder he could recall in Windsor in the last three years was committed by a guy from Detroit, who had a stolen gun from Minnesota.
With nearly 400,000 people in the Windsor area, there were simply no Canadians shooting other Canadians.
I thought it might be time for some fun facts about Canada.
I hit the streets of New York to find out what the average American thought about our friendly neighbour to the north.
Canadians don't watch as much violent movies as Americans do.
That's wrong.
Hordes of young boys, all throughout Canada, eagerly await the next
Hollywood bloodbath.
Then one of the guy gets his leg taken off.
- Oh, wow!
- And there was a lot of girls,
- and naked at one point.
- I like that stuff.
- What movie did you see tonight?
- Sixth Day.
- With Arnold Schwarzenegger?
- Yeah.
Did it make you want to come out here and play this shoot-'em-up game?
Well... yeah.
There's no poverty in Canada like there is here... in the States.
Wrong again.
Mayor Mike Bradley
Sarnia, Ontario, Canada
Actually, we've also had a much higher unemployment rate.
When Michigan rate was running at 4%, we were still at 8-9%,
We seem to have an institutional unemployment rate.
I think there'd mostly be white people in Canada.
Hmm... that's strange,
'cause when I'm in Canada,
I see black people everywhere.
And yellow people, and brown people... and 13% of the country is non-white.
So the Canadians are pretty much just like us. And the reason that they have (Toronto, Canada) so few murders has to be because they've got so few guns.
- What kind of guns do you own?
- Uh, I hunt.
I own rifles and shotguns, and I own pistols.
- Mm-hm. So how many guns total?
- Uh... Probably about seven.
- Seven guns?
- Yeah.
- Do you have a gun?
- I have a few.
- How many guns do you have?
- Half a dozen.
You could name how many people that own guns, that you know?
- Two, three, a dozen?
- More than that.
There's a tremendous amount of gun ownership.
We're a large country geographically.
We grew up with hunting and fishing being a tradition.
In Canada, with a population of just around 30 million - there's about
10 million families - and the best estimate is somewhere in the region of seven-million guns.
Wow!
Canada was one gun-loving, gun-toting, gun-crazy country!
- Where can you get a gun?
- Uptown, any time I want.
I see you're a Glock owner.
Where can I get a Glock in Canada?
Most gun stores'll sell 'em to you if you have the proper permits and stuff.
In fact, despite all their tough gun laws, take a look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at the local Canadian Wal-Mart.
- Where's the ammunition at?
- Where's the ammunition?
- Yeah.
- Back here.
- What kind are you looking for?
- You know, like, bullets.
That's right.
I could buy as much live ammunition as I wanted to in Canada.
You take American?
Do you lock your doors?
- No.
- Are you afraid of anything?
Sarnia, Canada
- Nah, not really, no.
- Do you lock your doors at night?
- No.
- You don't lock your doors?
- No.
- Well, what do you...
- Are you afraid of anything?
- Not really.
- Have you ever been broken into?
- Yes, I have. Yeah.
- What happened?
- They broke into my home.
I wasn't there. They broke in, they stole some booze and cigarettes and they left.
So I figure it must've been some teenagers out to have a little bit of fun.
That's all they took, though.
Just some booze and some cigarettes.
Have you ever been a victim of crime?
- Yes.
- What kind of crime?
Uh, I've had people walk in while I've been sleeping and vandalize my home and steal from me.
And that didn't want to make you lock your doors at night?
No. No.
As an American with three locks on his doors,
I found this all a bit confusing.
Even here, in Toronto, a city of millions, people just didn't lock their doors.
So you don't lock your doors but we, Americans, do. Why is that?
You must be afraid of your neighbour.
Do you ever leave your doors unlocked at home?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you do?
- Where do you live?
- Right around here.
- Toronto?
- Around here.
- You leave your doors unlocked?
- Yeah.
You'd think, as Americans, that the lock is keeping people out of your place.
We, as Canadians, see it more as, uh... when we lock the door, we're imprisoning ourselves inside.
You don't want to do that.
Not really, no.
We don't want to... No.
I decided to go unannounced to a neighbourhood in Toronto to see if this unlocked-door thing was true.
Oh, hi. I'm sorry.
Just checking.
Oh, hello!
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
Nobody locks their doors.
Nobody locks their doors in this town.
- You want to lock?
- No, no, no.
- Do you like living here?
- I like it very much.
- Yeah? And the T-shirt?
- The T- shirt too.
This door was wide open.
And you're not afraid?
- Should I be afraid?
- I don't know. You live here.
- I don't think I'm afraid.
- You're not, are you?
- Thank you very much.
- All right. No problem.
- I'm sorry about the intrusion.
- No, no problem.
- Thank you for not shooting me.
- No problem at all.
- Bye-bye.
- Okay.
As an American,
I gotta say this all seemed kind of strange.
Until I looked up at the TV in the bar and noticed what they watched for their evening news.
They're friends of ours.
We'll certainly listen to them courteously and carefully, but you don't just make war just 'cause someone says so.
The Canadians weren't being pumped full of fear.
And their politicians seemed to talk kind of funny.
Mayor Mike Bradley
Sarnia, Canada
...making sure they have good daycare, assistance for their parents when they're elderly and need to be in an old-age home, that they have proper health care that insures that they won't lose their business or their house because they can't afford their medical bills.
That's how you build a good society.
No one wins unless everyone wins. And you don't win by beating up on people who can't defend themselves.
And that's been the approach, unfortunately, that's been spreading with some of the right-wing governments across North America.
They pick onto people that can't defend themselves and at the same time, they're turning around and giving financial support and tax breaks and tax benefits to people that don't need them.
Where are the indigents in the city? Where do they live?
Uh... indigent... uh...
You act like you've never heard the word before.
There's... We don't have that problem here, really. It's...
So I asked him,
"Could you at least take me to a Canadian slum," and well... this is what a ghetto looks like in Canada.
Is this the same mentality that says, with Canadians, if someone gets sick, they should actually be able to have health care?
- Yeah.
- Oh, definitely.
- Yeah.
- Yup.
Why?
Because!
Human rights. Everyone's got the right to live.
You just came out of the emergency room?
Yes, I did.
How much did you have to pay for your treatment?
The bill is covered by our hospital plan.
You're telling me you didn't have to pay anything?
No, I don't.
I have family that lives in the States.
They used to live in Canada and moved over there.
- And it's so different.
- They get afraid more easily.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, very much so.
'Cause everybody reacts over there just like that.
They don't stop and think.
First reaction is pull the gun out. "You're on my property."
You know, like...
I don't know. It's just different over here.
- Where do you live?
- Detroit.
Come over to Canada here for the night?
Right.
People are more open-minded here, a bit more welcoming.
Feel any difference when you cross over to this country?
Be honest, now, come on.
- It's a lot lighter.
The segregation over there is definitely much more--
- In the United States.
- ...more intensified
- in the States, yeah.
- Yeah.
So you can... You can feel it.
Almost like they just let you be.
That's Canada for you.
Every time I turn on the TV in the States, it's always about a murder here, a gunfight, hostile position...
I just think the States, their view of things is fighting.
That's how they resolve everything.
If there's... there's something going on in another country, they send people over to fight it and...
They are the most powerful country in the world, though.
Canada's more just, like,
"Let's negotiate, let's work something out."
Where the States is,
"We'll kill you and that'll be the end of that."
Um, if guns were...
If more guns made people safer, then America would be one of the safest countries in the world.
It isn't. It's the opposite.
I heard that 911 call, you know, on TV someplace.
It was horrible. It was just...
'Cause he kept asking,
"Where's the shooter?"
She said, "He's gone.
I need some help."
The little girl was in there too?
She was on the floor, yes.
And the police and the medics came, or...
By the time the medics were here...
The medics had just come in and I remember him stepping in and taking over the room.
He said, "You have to leave."
- All right.
- And then when the meds come in, when the police come in, you're no longer in control.
- They take over the building.
- Was she still alive then?
Her lips had become totally blue.
Back in my hometown of Flint, Michigan, a six-year-old first-grade boy, at Buell Elementary, had found a gun at his uncle's house, where he was staying because his mother was being evicted.
He brought the gun to school and shot another first- grader, six-year-old Kayla Rolland.
With one bullet that passed through her body, she fell to the floor and laid there dying while her teacher called 911 for help.
No one knew why the little boy wanted to shoot the little girl.
As if the city had not been through enough horror and tragedy in the past two decades, it was now home to a new record: the youngest school shooting ever in the United States.
On the morning of the shooting, it only took the helicopters and satellite trucks a half-hour to show up.
They check in the truck.
You know, we're doing one in 30 minutes again.
This evening, about seven o'clock, will be a public memorial service. Hundreds of people will mourn the loss of little
Kayla, a tiny little girl who loved pizza, teddy bears, and who was taken away from us much too soon. Gina?
Good morning, Christine.
The funeral home now passing out tens of thousands of these pink ribbons to support the young girl's family.
Today will be an emotional day and has been already, remembering little Kayla.
Jeff Ross, Fox-2 News.
Nice job.
Yeah, Michelle, we're having technical problems, okay?
Well, don't talk to me about it, call our sat truck.
I need a haircut, man.
I'm a pig. A rug.
Here we go.
Some too choked up even to speak about it.
There's a memorial service scheduled here for seven o'clock tonight.
We're live in Flint, Michigan, this afternoon.
Jeff Ross, Q-13 Reports.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Want some hairspray?
- I kind of need it, don't I?
- Yeah, you do,
I got some...
I have some. I just didn't put it in. I didn't have a chance.
I have hurricane-proof hairspray.
This man prayed for Kayla then let the balloon go.
I say we have the colour picture, not the black-and-white.
Plenty of media here that covered Columbine.
You know, there are some networks, especially, that go from, unfortunately, tragedy to tragedy.
And, uh, I feel bad for them.
Because that's all they see...
The tragedies.
We're just trying to crunch right now for the five and the six.
Today, we're feeding
CNN and Fox, so...
The national media had never visited Buell Elementary, or the Beecher school district in which it sat, or this part of Flint ever before.
And few, if any, of these reporters bothered to visit it even when they were here now.
If they had ventured just a block away from the school or the funeral home, they might have seen a different kind of tragedy that, perhaps, would contain some answers as to why this little girl was dead.
For over 20 years, this impoverished area, in the hometown of the world's largest corporation, had been ignored as completely as it had been destroyed.
With 87% of the students living below the official poverty line,
Buell and Beecher, and Flint, did not fit into the accepted and widely circulated story line put forth by the nation's media.
That being the one about America and its invincible economy.
The number-one cause of death among young people in this part of Flint was homicide. The football field, at Flint-Beecher, was sponsored by a funeral home.
The kids at Beecher have won
13 state track championships, but they've never had a home track meet.
Because around the football field, all they have is this dirt ring.
Years ago, someone here named the streets, in this part of town, after all the Ivy League schools, as if they had dreamed of better days and something greater for themselves.
The children are doing well.
The faculty and staff are doing well.
But we don't forget.
We don't forget.
Just don't want this happening to anybody else, you know?
It's...
I know.
I know. I don't want it to happen to anybody else either.
- Hmm...
- It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.
...from my cold, dead hands!
Just as he did after the Columbine shooting,
Charlton Heston showed up in Flint to have a big pro-gun rally.
Freedom has never seen greater peril nor needed you more urgently to come to her defence than now.
Before he came to Flint,
Heston was interviewed by the Georgetown Hoya about Kayla's death, and even his own NRA website talked about it.
We wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland.
How could they come here?
To me, it's like they're rubbing our nose in it. I was shocked and appalled that they would come here.
Heston was asked by a local reporter why he came to Flint after the tragedy at Buell, and what did the NRA have to say about six-year-olds using guns.
We spend $20 million every year and then we teach you... to five and six-year-olds, we say, "If you see a gun, don't touch it, leave the room, call an adult."
And then Moses himself showed up.
Right here in the city of Flint?
Right here in Flint.
Were there people that wanted you to try this child,
Arthur Busch
County Prosecutor, Flint, Michigan
- or even try him as an adult?
- Oh... Oh, yeah.
There were people from all over
America that wrote and called and sent mail and...
It was amazing to me, um... groups that were affiliated with the NRA - groups, you know, people that I call "gun nuts" - writing me and telling me what a horrible thing it was that I had admonished homeowners in our country to be careful about bringing weapons into their home.
They wanted this little boy hung from the highest tree.
I mean, there was such an undercurrent of racism and hate and anger.
It was ugly.
That's a picture that the little boy that was involved in the Buell-school shooting...
Once he was brought back here to our office, about 15 minutes after the shooting took place,
I gave him some crayons to kind of occupy him a little bit.
Michael Caldwell
Police Detective
He came over and drew that picture for me.
Because at the time, I had pictures right behind my desk that my children had drew for me and he wanted to draw me one.
This is what he drew for you.
What did he say this was?
That's him at his house.
That's him at his house, right here.
And why did you decide to hang on to it?
Because of the gravity of the situation and what had occurred and he asked me to hang that behind my desk, so I put it in a frame and that's where it'll stay.
Tamarla Owens was the mother of the six-year-old boy.
In order to get food stamps and health care for her children,
Tamarla was forced to work as part of the state of Michigan's
Welfare-to-Work Program.
This program was so successful in tossing poor people off welfare that it's founder,
Gerald Miller, was soon hired by the number-one firm in the country that states turned to to privatize their welfare systems.
That firm was Lockheed Martin.
With the cold war over and no enemy left to frighten the public,
Lockheed had found the perfect way to diversify and the perfect way to profit from people's fears, with an enemy much closer to home: poor black mothers like Tamarla Owens.
We've got a one-parent family and the mother's travelling 60 miles.
Sheriff Robert Pickell
Flint, Michigan
An hour, an hour and a half away to go to work an hour, an hour and a half to come home.
How does that help a community?
But that's part of the state... you know, making parents responsible, making them work--
- Welfare to work.
- Welfare to work.
That's a program that ought to be stopped because it really has no merit.
I think it adds more to the problem than it does to solve it.
- Really?
- I do.
You're the sheriff and you feel this way.
I do, I do. I wish I could put two parents in every home and make every parent equally responsible, but I can't do that.
But we're not doing anything by taking one parent and putting them on a bus and sending them out of town to make $5.50 an hour.
This is the bus that she was forced to ride every day in order to work off the welfare money the state had given her.
She, and many others from Flint who were poor, would make the 80-mile round-trip journey every day, from Flint to Auburn Hills, in Oakland County, one of the wealthiest areas in the country.
Tamarla would leave early in the morning and return late at night, rarely seeing her young children.
What's the point in doing that?
Where does the state benefit?
Where does Flint and Genesee
County benefit from that?
We have a child dead.
I think that may be, in part, part of the problem.
We drove the one parent out.
Now, you or anybody else that can tell me that that best serves the community,
I shake my head and wonder why.
How long you been riding the bus?
I've been working here
- just about three years now.
- About three years?
Yeah. My brother...
I got my brother working here, half of my neighbourhood works out here.
Just about everybody I know personally works in the mall.
In Flint, doing the same thing
I'm doing now, they only pay minimum wage in Flint. I come 40 miles to make three or four dollars more an hour.
- How much do you make an hour?
- I make 8.50 now.
Is that enough to pay the bills?
No.
So did you know Tamarla Owens, the woman whose son shot the little girl?
- I think she rode this bus.
- I knew her a little bit.
- Not real good.
- Nice lady?
Yeah, she was okay. She came to work every day, did her job.
- She worked two jobs, so...
- She worked two jobs?
She was trying to make ends meet.
"We're going hopping
We're going hopping today
"Where things are popping...
This is Dick Clark's
American Bandstand Grill, where Tamarla worked one of her two jobs.
"On the Bandstand
Bandstand"
I think she worked in this room here, as a bartender, fountain-person making drinks, making shakes, desserts.
- Was she a good employee?
- Yeah, she was.
She also worked at the Fudgery, in the mall here.
Dick Clark is an American icon, the man who brought rock'n'roll into our homes every week on American Bandstand.
Every part of your life, you can link up to a part of music, usually.
So, as Dick says,
"It's the soundtrack of our lives."
Music's the soundtrack of our lives.
His restaurant and the
Fudgery, here in Auburn Hills, applied for special tax breaks because they were using welfare people as employees.
Even though Tamarla worked up to 70 hours a week at these two jobs in the mall, she did not earn enough to pay her rent.
And one week before the shooting, was told by her landlord that he was evicting her.
With nowhere to go and not wanting to take her two children out of school,
Tamarla asked her brother if they could stay with him for a few weeks.
It was there that Tamarla's son found a small 32-calibre gun and took it to school.
Tamarla did not see him take the gun to school, because she was on a state bus to go serve drinks and make fudge for rich people.
"Bandstand"
I decided to fly out to California to ask Dick Clark what he thought about a system that forces poor, single mothers to work two low-wage jobs to survive.
I'm doing a documentary on these school shootings and, you know, guns and all that.
And in my hometown of Flint
Michigan, which you know, this little six-year-old shot a six-year-old--
Get in the car, Dave!
Watch your arm, watch your arm.
- Oop, sorry, sorry.
- I'm sorry, we're really late.
Anyways, but the mother of the kid who did the shooting works at Dick Clark's
All-American Grill...
- Forget it.
- ...in Oakland County...
- Close the door.
- A Welfare-to-work program--
- Close the door.
- These people are forced...
- Dick, no...
- Bye-bye. Come on, move over!
I want you to help me convince the governor of Michigan...
It's a Welfare-to-work pro...
These women are forced to work!
They've got kids at home. Dick!
Ah, jeez!
In George Bush's America, the poor were not a priority.
And after September 11th, 2001, correcting America's social problems took a back seat to fear, panic and a new set of priorities.
One way to express our unity is for Congress to set the military budget, the defence of the United States, as the number-one priority and fully fund my request!
We've been selling a lot of chemical suits, with the gloves and the hoods.
And we've been selling a lot of gas masks.
I'm trying to get one for myself and my puppy.
Denis Marks and his wife have been stocking up supplies.
Weapons, ammunition...
Wal-Mart says after September 11th, gun sales surged 70%, ammunition up 140%.
In Dallas, they're already taking potshots at Osama bin Laden.
In the months following the 9/11 attacks, we, Americans, were gripped in a state of fear.
None of us knew if we too would die at the hands of the evildoers, or who might be sitting next to some crazy guy trying to light his shoes on fire.
The threat seemed very real.
Sounds a little paranoid but
I'm not gonna take the chance.
Just trying to protect myself and my family.
Our growing fears were turned into a handsome profit for many.
Mike Blake has seen a 30% increase in sales at ADT over the last month.
Most of the people he talks to are still a little uneasy over the September 11th terrorist attacks.
How are we afraid of all these things, it's because a lot of people are making a lot of money off of it and a lot of careers off of it.
And so, there's vested interests, a lot of activity to keep us afraid.
And what better way to fight box-cutter-wielding terrorists than to order a record number of fighter jets from Lockheed?
Yes, everyone felt safer, especially with the army doing garbage detail on Park Avenue.
And the greatest benefit of all of a terrorized public is that the corporate and political leaders can get away with just about anything.
I've never seen a better example of cash-and-carry government than this Bush administration and Enron.
There were a lot of things that I didn't know after the World Trade Center attack, but one thing was clear: whether it was before or after
September 11th, a public that's this out of control with fear should not have a lot of guns or ammo laying around.
Well, I was shot with a Tech-9.
Nine millimetre?
Yeah. Yeah, I was, uh...
I guess it was supposed to be semi-automatic, but it kind of seemed like fully automatic to me,
- from what I remember.
- This is Richard Costaldo.
And this is Mark Taylor.
Both of these boys were shot the day of the Columbine massacre.
Richard is paralyzed for life and in a wheelchair.
And Mark is barely standing after numerous operations.
The kids at Columbine had to pay a penalty.
We paid a penalty that day... for this nation.
The way we look at it.
Mark and Richard were disabled and suffering from the 17-cent K-Mart bullets still embedded in their bodies.
As they showed me the various entry points for the bullets,
I thought of one way we could reduce the number of guns and bullets laying around. I asked the boys if they'd like to go to K-Mart to return the merchandise.
- Ready?
- You... you go.
K-Mart Headquarters
Troy, Michigan
Hi.
Excuse me, will you turn the camera off, please?
- We're here to see Mr. Conaway.
- You have to turn the camera off
- while you're in the building.
- Oh, okay, all right.
Okay, turn it off now.
- Hey, Michael.
- Hi, how are you?
I'm Mary Lorenz. I'm director of Media Relations for K-Mart.
- Oh, good. All right, good.
- How can I help you today?
Well, I'm here today...
This is Richard Costaldo.
- Richard, nice to meet you.
- And this is Mark Taylor.
- Mark.
- And they're students from Columbine High School.
They were shot at Columbine, in the massacre, with bullets from K-Mart.
You came a long way.
All the way from Colorado.
Yeah, I just...
I was thinking that... since you stopped selling the handguns and all, it'd kind of make sense to stop selling the bullets too.
Our request is that you get rid of nine-millimetre bullets and that you don't sell them in the store completely.
We do carry... You probably are aware of K- Mart - hopefully, you're shoppers at our stores - that we do only carry, you know, sporting firearms and the accessories that go with the hunting sport.
And we'll certainly take your message to our chairman and CEO,
Chuck Conaway.
He's not here today.
- He's not here today?
- No. He's not here, actually,
- this whole week.
- Not at all during the week?
Do you have a limit on the number of bullets, ammunition,
- that people can purchase?
- You know, I can't answer these questions for you.
I'm not the merchandiser who places those products in our stores.
Can we speak to that person?
But I can get answers to those questions for you.
If you leave your card, I could get those answers for you.
We don't want to leave a card.
The reason why we can't take a card and come back is because Mark here, he's got a K-Mart bullet just an inch away... right?
- Yeah.
- From your aorta.
- In between my aorta and spine.
- Between your aorta and spine.
I'm glad to see that you're still able to stand.
And I told him that somebody here would listen, somebody here would... would... would take the request seriously. Not just a PR person, but somebody who has some authority and can answer some of the questions that they want answered.
K-Mart does care about this, but I can't go any further right now.
So until I make a call, um,
I'm gonna go back to the office and see if there's anyone in merchandising...
Mary went back upstairs.
And two hours later, she brought down this guy whose job it is to buy the bullets for K-Mart.
- Good. Stay out of trouble.
- Yes.
We're not the ones in trouble, guys.
Mark thought he'd show him his bullet wounds.
- Those are his bullet holes.
- Hm.
From your bullets.
That's where the K-Mart bullets went in.
Well, take care.
Is anybody else gonna come down?
Is anybody else gonna come down?
Is that it?
- I'll check.
- Okay, thank you.
We waited around a couple more hours but no one else came down.
As we left the building,
Mark came up with an idea.
He suggested that we go to the nearest K-Mart and buy out all their bullets.
Just take as many of those as you can.
Yeah, you can come around here and look.
What else do we have over here?
You got 357. Sure, I'll take 'em all, take everything you got.
- So you're 17? You're what?
- Sixteen.
Wait.
Oh, shit!
Oh, my God...
Mark pretty much cleaned them out of their ammunition.
And the next day, we decided to go back to K-Mart headquarters with all the bullets.
This time, we brought the press.
Our local first coverage of south-eastern Michigan continues now with all-new stories.
Coming up here on our six-o'clock report, a warning to everyone this summer to watch out for snakes.
You'll hear from a mom who was bitten by a rattlesnake.
And also, students who survived the Columbine massacre are in town.
They are very angry with K-Mart.
We're here to see Chuck
Conaway, the chairman of K- Mart.
How you doing, sir?
It's always a pleasure.
Okay, uh...
They would like to speak to Mr. Conaway.
Here's the nine-millimetres.
These are the bullets that are in both Richard and in Mark's body right now.
Move your group outside.
I'll have somebody here in five minutes.
Do me a favour, don't block the door.
Just off to the side, if you would.
Will go outside and somebody will come out.
My name's Laurie McTavish.
I'm the Vice-president of
Communications for K-Mart.
I'm happy to deliver a statement on behalf of the company.
What happened in Columbine,
Colorado, was truly tragic and touched every American.
We're sorry for the... disadvantage to this young man.
K-Mart is phasing out the sale of handgun ammunition.
The business plan calls for this to be complete in the continental U.S. within the next 90 days.
Wow! Wow!
K-Mart representatives met with Mr. Moore and the students from Columbine,
Colorado, yesterday, and listened to their concerns about the product carried in K-Mart stores.
The company committed, at the end of that meeting, that K-Mart would have an answer for them within a week's time.
Well, the first thing we want to do is thank you for committing to no longer selling handgun ammunition in your stores.
And within 90 days--
The process will be phased out within 90 days.
And after 90 days, there will be no more selling of ammunition that can go into handguns or assault weapons.
Firearm ammunition, will be...
We will not sell it, after 90 days, in our stores.
- We greatly appreciate that.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
That's very brave.
Thank you. Wow!
That blows my mind. That's more than what we asked for.
- It's remarkable.
- Yeah. Well, like I told you--
- I didn't think--
- Did you think?
- No!
- We're like, uh...
We're just getting ready to...
We're going to the airport.
The kids from Columbine had scored an overwhelming victory against K-Mart and it inspired me to do something that
I knew I had to do.
All I needed... was a star map.
- Hello?
- Mr. Heston?
- Yeah.
- This is Michael Moore.
- Yes.
- The film- maker?
- Yes, of course.
- Yes. How you doing?
Fine, thank you.
Listen, I was wondering if maybe I could talk to you.
We're making a documentary about the whole gun issue.
And I'm a member of the NRA.
I thought maybe we could talk a little bit about--
Tell you what, let me look at my calendar.
I may be able to give you some time tomorrow.
- I have some people here now.
- Okay, well, how can I--
- Pardon me?
- Hold the phone.
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.
I can give you a little time tomorrow morning.
- I think that's Thursday.
- Yes.
- Let's say 8:30.
- Eight-thirty in the morning?
- Yeah. Okay?
- Okay. And just come here?
- Yes.
- Okay, good.
Hello?
Hi. It's Michael Moore here to see Charlton Heston.
Okay.
Hi. Good morning.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Thank you very much for agreeing to see me.
He took me out to his pool-and-tennis house so we could have a chat.
I told him that I was a lifetime member of the NRA and showed him my membership card.
Good for you. Well done.
I assume you have guns in the house here?
Indeed I do.
Bad guys take notice!
So you have them for protection?
- Yeah. Sure.
- Have you ever been
- a victim of crime?
- No. No.
- Never been assaulted or...?
- No.
No violence toward you, but you have guns in the house.
- Loaded.
- They're loaded?
Well, if you really needed a weapon for self-defence,
- you need it loaded.
- Okay, but why... why do you need it for self- defence? Because--
- I don't.
- Yeah, you've never been a victim of crime, you haven't been assaulted.
- No, that's true.
- You haven't been, you know...
Why would you... So why not...
Why don't you unload the gun?
Because the second amendment gives me the right
- to have it loaded.
- I agree.
I totally agree with that.
I'm just saying... I mean, the second amendment gives me--
Let's say it's a comfort factor.
It gives you comfort to know that there's a loaded gun.
Yeah.
Comfort meaning that it allows you to relax and feel safe?
- Not worry about it.
- Not worry, not be afraid.
And I'm not really, but, uh...
I'm exercising one of the rights passed on down to me from those wise, old, dead white guys that invented this country.
If it was good enough for them, it's good enough for me.
But you could still exercise the right, just by having a gun unloaded and locked away somewhere.
I choose to have it.
What sort of strikes me as interesting is that, in other countries, where they don't have the murder rate, the gun-murder rate that we have, that, uh... many people say,
"Well, that's because they don't have guns around.
It's hard to get a gun in
Britain or Germany or whatever."
But we went to Canada and there's seven million guns
- in 10-million homes.
- There won't be very long.
- But hear me out, though.
- Okay.
Canada is a nation of hunters, millions of guns, and yet, they had just a few murders last year.
That's it. A country of 30-million people.
Now, why - here's my question - why is it that... that they've got all these guns laying around, yet they don't kill each other at the level that we kill each other?
I think American history is... uh... has a lot of blood
- on its hands.
- And Germany history doesn't?
- No.
- And British history?
- I don't think as much.
- Oh, are you...
Germans don't have as much, blood on their hands?
- Uh, they do, yes.
- The Brits, they ruled the world for 300 years at the barrel of a gun.
They're all violent people. They have bad guys, they have crime, they have lots of guns--
Well, it's an interesting point, which can be explored and you're good to explore it at great lengths, but I think that's about all
I have to say on it.
You don't have any opinion, though, as to why that is, that we are the unique country, the only country, that does this, that kills each other on this level, with guns?
Well, we have, probably, more mixed ethnicity than other countries, some other countries.
You think it's an ethnic thing?
No, I don't. It's...
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
We had enough problems with civil rights in the beginning.
It's... But, uh, I have no answer for that.
What do you mean, you think it's a mixed ethnicity?
I don't understand.
- You said, "How is it that..."
- That we're unique.
"So many Americans kill each other?"
I don't know that that's true, but, uh...
Well, no, you know that.
We know we have the highest murder rate with guns.
It's way higher than any other country.
The only answer I can give you is the one I already gave you.
- Which is?
- Which is that we have, uh...
- Historically--
- ...a history of violence.
Perhaps more than most countries. Not more than Russia,
- not more than Japan or China--
- Not more than Germany.
Not more than Germany, but certainly more than Canada.
I come from Flint, Michigan, and last year, a little six-year-old boy took a gun into a classroom and shot and killed a six-year-old girl. And, uh... it was really a tragic thing--
- This was a kid, though.
- A six-year-old, yeah.
Did you hear about this?
A six-year-old shooting a six-year-old?
- Yeah.
- Well, here's my question.
After that happened, you came to Flint and held a big rally.
Mm-hm.
And, you know, I just--
So did the vice-president.
Yeah, but did you feel it was being at all insensitive to the fact that this community had just gone through--
Actually, I wasn't aware of that at the time we came.
We came and did an early-morning, uh... rally, then went on to wherever we were going.
You didn't know at the time, that this killing had happened?
- No.
- Had you known, would you have--
Would I have cancelled the... uh...
- Yeah.
- I don't...
Hard to say.
It wasn't like it was already planned.
I mean, the choice to come there was made after this horrible killing took place.
Yeah. Mm-hm.
You know, had you know that, would you have come?
I don't know. I have no idea.
- Maybe not. Maybe not.
- Okay. Thank you.
You think you'd like to just maybe apologize to the people in Flint for coming and doing that at that time, or...?
You want me to apologize... me, apologize to the people in Flint?
Or the people in Columbine for coming after their horrible tragedy.
Why do you go to the places after they have these horrible tragedies? I'm a member of your group here--
Well, I'm afraid we don't agree on... on that.
You think it's okay to just come and show up
- at these events.
- No.
You don't think it's okay?
Mr. Heston, just one more thing.
This is who she is - or was. This is her.
Mr. Heston, please don't leave.
Mr. Heston, please, take a look at her.
This is the girl.
I left the Heston estate atop Beverly Hills and walked back into the real world, an America living and breathing in fear...
In your mind, you imagine somebody who might break into your house, to harm you or your family.
What does that person look like?
You. Her. Him.
The camera guy, anybody.
Could be a gun in the camera,
I don't know.
Where gun sales were now at an all-time high...
Can shoot as fast as
Wesson semi-automatic.
And where, in the end, it all comes back to bowling for Columbine.
Three bowling-alley employees shot to death Sunday night at the AMF Broadway Lanes.
There's nothing I really know.
I really don't know anything.
- Just that three people died.
- Right.
In Littleton, in a bowling alley.
I'm sorry.
Yes, it was a glorious time to be an American.
Oh, hi, Roz.
Oh, there you are.
I brought something for Daphne.
I was just going to leave it with the doorman.
(sobbing):
Oh... Oh, Lord.
Did I say something?
Well, actually, our doorman Morrie passed away this week.
We just got back from the funeral.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry.
Is she going to be all right?
Well, uh, you know, she's been a little high-strung all week even before he died.
I guess it's just wedding stuff, you know.
Yeah.
Ooh... sorry about that.
So, you brought me something,
Roz?
Well, yeah, I figured you can't get married without wearing something borrowed.
Oh, what a beautiful garter.
Look at all the lovely detail.
I especially like the little odometer.
Thank you so much, Roz.
Does anybody besides me feel like a cup of coffee?
Oh, I'll brew a pot.
Oh, don't be silly.
I've been here enough times to know how to get the coffee made.
Daphne, make us some coffee.
Kidding.
"The Wayside Inn."
Is this where you're having the wedding?
Oh, gosh, it's just beautiful.
I hope it is.
The planning's been a nightmare.
I spent an hour today on the seating chart.
Everyone has some demand.
"Don't sit me near the band."
"You mind if I bring a friend?"
Oh, my God, you can't seat me next to him.
Exactly. Every selfish, whiny, little de... no, you cannot seat me next to Tim Walsh.
I dated him all last summer and he dumped me.
He's going with my bridesmaid, Annie.
I have to seat the bridesmaids together.
This always happens to me.
Is there no place I can go without running into some guy I've dated?
I was reading about a Trappist monastery in the Amazon that they somehow built into the treetops.
Shut up, you big doily.
This is going to be awful.
Here I am at a wedding sitting next to a guy who dumped me.
FRASIER:
Oh, come on, Roz.
You won't be alone.
You'll be on the arm of a well-known
Seattle boulevardier and radio star.
Frasier,
I can't go with you.
I mean... going to a wedding with your boss is like going to the prom with your brother.
Niles and I did not go to the prom together!
Our dates were sick and we went stag!
In retrospect, yes, we should've canceled the horse-drawn carriage, but hindsight is 20/20.
Hey... hey, Roz.
ROZ:
Hi, Martin.
I'm sorry to hear about your friend, Morrie.
Aw, thanks.
Yeah, his wife just did the nicest thing.
I guess she knew that Eddie and I would stop by and shoot the breeze with him so, she gave us something to remember him by.
Oh.
"For Martin and Eddie."
Gee, isn't that nice? Yeah.
I think it's some kind of wine.
Well, yes,
I'd say so.
My God, Dad, this is a 1945 Chateau Petrus.
Oh, yeah?
He got it from his uncle who was in France after the war.
Well, it's one of the rarest bottles in the world.
Well, if you're good maybe Eddie will give you a glass out of his half.
I've never even seen a '45 Petrus.
Oh, poor Morrie.
He probably waited his whole life for an occasion special enough to open that bottle.
Perhaps this should be a lesson for us all.
Morrie may be standing guard at the door to heaven right now but he is buzzing us with one last message--
"Live life now."
I'm reminded of a parable...
Come in. Come in.
Come in.
Simon!
Hi, Sis.
I thought you were in California.
Yeah, well, those friends I went to surprise were out of town.
So, I decided to house-sit for them, which was lovely, till they came home last night.
I don't know what all the screaming was about.
I was the one in the tub.
Where should I put this bag?
Uh, by the door, so you don't forget it when you leave.
SIMON:
Right.
Well, I think I know everybody here... or do I?
What would your name be, then, Miss?
Simon... you lowlife idiot.
You made a date with me last week and you stood me up.
Sorry, love, I need a bit more to go on.
Maybe this'll refresh your memory.
Roz-- of course!
MARTIN (laughing):
Well... look who's back.
Well, who's this, then?
I'd say it was Marty Crane but he's a bit too young and trim, eh?
Oh, go on.
Can I offer you a beer?
Oh, I hate to drink alone.
Can I have a sandwich with that?
MARTIN:
Yeah.
If that beer-swilling boomerang thinks he's staying here he's got another think coming.
Better get a move on.
He already has your address on his duffel bag.
We better get going if we're going to reach the cabin by dark.
"Cabin"?
Yes, Mel and I are celebrating our six-month anniversary by, uh, taking a little midweek getaway to her friend's country place.
Yes, no phones, no stress-- just two days of rest and relaxation.
I do have to pick up a little anniversary gift, though.
So, give me nine minutes and meet me at the northwest corner of Pike and
Elm at 4:42.
Coming up on 4:33...
Mm-hmm, synchronizing...
Now. Good.
I'm relaxing already.
Mmm...
Mmm...
SIMON:
Thank you, Marty.
That's most hospitable of you.
Well, you have to have a place to stay.
Stop right there!
He cannot stay here.
The man is loud, ill-mannered... and the last time he stayed here, he killed a ficus tree on the downstairs neighbor's balcony by means which are best left to the imagination.
Frasier, I invited
Simon to stay in my Winnebago.
Come on, Simon.
I'll show you your new digs.
Oh, Lord, Simon, you know, I'm sorry...
Oh, no, no, no, forget about it.
It's no worse than what I was just saying about you in the kitchen.
(chuckling):
Good one.
He thinks I'm joking.
Join me in a sherry, Frasier?
Oh, I think I will, Niles.
You know, I have to admit
I'm a little bit nervous about this trip.
I have a feeling
Mel may make another push for us to live together.
Oh, my.
Well, she's been bringing it up quite a lot lately.
She says it's a good way to test our relationship.
You afraid you'll discover things about each other that you won't like?
Oh, no, no-no-no, we're past that stage.
She knows my likes and dislikes.
I've... become attuned to her various quirks...
Mm-hmm.
Eccentricities... bugaboos...
Ah.
Bêtes noires...
Night terrors...
That's the fun of being in love.
I don't know what's bothering me.
Is it possible that your foot-dragging might have anything to do with some lingering feelings for Daphne?
Frasier, uh, you must realize
I put that behind me months ago.
Just asking.
I'm very happy with Mel.
Well, then, what's your problem?
Uh, well... let's see, uh...
I just got through a rough divorce.
Uh, I do have a tendency to be overly cautious.
This could be a chance to change all that.
So, you're in favor of it?
Well... I've never really been the president of the Mel fan club, but she does seem to make you happy, and as we were reminded this morning, life is not to be taken in baby steps.
Ask not for whom the doorman buzzes...
Thank you.
All right. That was much-needed therapy, Frasier.
Well, Niles, it's my pleasure.
You are my brother.
You get the family rate.
Hey, Niles.
Got all the way down to the Winnebago and realized I had the wrong keys.
I'll see you guys in a couple of days. Bye.
You don't say, Mum?
Your phlebitis again?
Daphne!
Oh, got to go now, Mum.
Dr. Crane's on the warpath again. Bye.
Thank you.
Okay.
Daph, you know,
I'm glad you're here because I was thinking about that wine of Morrie's.
You know, that's something, really, for a special occasion.
So, I'd like you to have it for the wedding.
Enjoy it on your honeymoon.
(sobbing):
Oh...
Mr. Crane...
Oh, oh, Daphne, come on. That's so sweet.
Come on, now.
It's only a bottle of wine.
I don't even know much about it.
Frasier, help me out here, will you?
Well, Dad, Chateau Petrus is a premier cru Bordeaux...
No, no...
Oh. I-I mean with Daphne.
There you go.
All right, Daph, oh...
Oh...
I'm sorry to get so emotional like this.
It's all right.
I guess the funeral must've really upset you.
It's not that.
Dr. Crane, I've wanted to talk to you about this all week but I haven't known what to say.
Can you promise you'll keep this just between us?
Of course.
It's about your brother.
You see, I know.
Know what?
I know about his feelings for me.
My God!
How did you find out?
It's not important.
Somebody blabbed, didn't they?!
Why can't people mind their own business?
Who was the nattering gossip?!
Roz?! Dad?!
You.
What?!
You were taking those pills for your back and you blurted it out while I was giving you a massage.
Oh, well, they were very strong pills, you see...
Needless to say, it completely took my breath away.
At first, I tried to forget about it... put it out of my mind. Yes, well, the bottle said to take just one, but...
Oh, will you shut up about those pills.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Daphne.
Anyway, after a while,
I couldn't put it out of my mind anymore.
I find myself thinking about him all the time.
Daphne... are you saying that you have feelings for Niles?
I think I do.
Oh, I don't know.
Even if I did, he may not feel that way about me anymore.
He's with Mel now.
I don't know what to tell you, Daph.
Uh... I-I think th-the best thing is to-to try to find a way to talk with Niles.
That's not an easy conversation to have.
It's easier now than after you're married.
You're right.
I have to talk to him, and right away.
I'm already making myself sick over this.
If I leave it any longer,
I'll be a complete basket case.
Uh, did he mention if he was going home?
Well, uh...
Actually, uh, he's-he's going somewhere... else first.
Um...
Where?
Get you some towels and you'll be all set down there. Right.
MARTIN:
Oh, geez,
Daphne, it's just a bottle of wine.
DAPHNE:
I'll get it.
Oh... Dr. Crane, I didn't even know you'd gone out.
I thought you might be your brother.
I went down to get the mail and got all these wedding gifts for you, but don't worry--
Niles called and said he'd be coming by this afternoon.
I don't even know how I'm going to begin this conversation.
I'm sure those chocolate chip-blackened teeth will be a nice icebreaker.
I've been so nervous lately.
I've done nothing but stuff meself with junk food.
It's him.
All right, all right, all right, fine.
You're going to be just fine, okay?
Remember to speak from the heart.
Mr. Crane!
Thanks.
Eddie started doing his
"I-don't-know- how-much-longer-
I-can-hold-this" dance, and I just ran out without my keys.
Ever see him do that dance?
Just the droll impression of it you do at parties, Dad.
You know, Mr. Crane,
Eddie seems awful fidgety.
I don't think he got enough exercise on that walk.
Anybody needs any exercise, it's you, the way you're eating now.
You know, when they put
"party size" on that cookie bag they don't mean
"party of one."
Simon, what do you want?
Well, I've just come to borrow a pen so I could fill out this job application.
What? Oh, you're applying for work?
Well, here, uh, allow me.
There we are.
Gosh, we'll miss you around here, but onward and upward.
So, what's the job?
Doorman.
Dear God.
Why, it's ideal for me, really.
Nice, cozy chair, plenty of time to think the long, long thoughts of youth... not to mention what the uniforms do for the ladies, eh, ha-ha!
If memory serves, a certain bellhop back in Manchester found that out with a young lady who will remain nameless.
Simon!
I'm this close to just poppin' him one.
Now, now, Daphne, Daphne, you just have to calm down.
Here. Have a cookie.
What is up with your appetite lately?
What, you knocked up or something?
Of course not, you...
Now, now, you wouldn't be the first person in our family to be walking down the aisle carrying more than just a bouquet.
Uh, Simon, why don't you finish filling that out in the kitchen, and help yourself to a beer?
Well, great.
Roz!
Hi, guys.
Hey, Frasier, I felt kind of bad about the other day dumping you as my wedding date...
You want me back, don't you?
...and I'm sick about it, but I can't find anybody else.
Sorry, Roz, I already invited somebody else.
She's driving up on Saturday to join me.
Get rid of her!
I need a date.
I'm desperate!
Well, well, somebody here is singin' my favorite song.
Simon, there's a guy who lives in the park across the street from me.
He wears a cat suit and meows at people.
If he's busy, maybe I'll call you.
I'm prettying myself up, just in case.
Speaking of which, Daphne--
I borrowed your blow-dryer for my job interview.
I spent an hour looking for that!
I thought I was losing my mind!
Well, that does happen to women in your condition-- you know, in a family way...
You're pregnant?!
I am not pregnant!
What, just another scare, then, like that time back in school with that Pakistani chap?
That's it, you pig!
Ooh. Put me down.
Daphne and I are going out for a breath of fresh air, perhaps to retrieve her blow-dryer.
Oh, if Niles should happen to stop by, keep him here.
There's something important
I need to discuss with him.
Oh, for God's sake, put me down.
Not until you promise not to kill your brother.
Oh, all right.
It's not as if he doesn't deserve it.
Telling everyone
I'm carrying Donny's baby-- like I don't have enough to worry about today waiting for Dr. Crane.
Daphne, Daphne, you have to calm down.
It's not easy.
I don't even know how to begin with him.
"Would you like steak or salmon at my wedding?
And by the way, I think
I might be in love with you."
Daphne, you'll find the words when the time comes, all right?
Don't pretend you're not listening, Mrs. Richman.
Your laundry is not that interesting.
Oh, come on,
George.
I'm desperate here.
I promise you a good time.
I mean a really good time, if you get my drift.
You might have mentioned
I was on speaker phone.
Listen to what you're doing, Roz.
It's not very dignified, is it?
Come on, Roz, give
Simon a chance.
What, so he can stand me up again?
And miss my sister's wedding?
Never.
Well, if you're worried about my appearance,
I know where I can get my hands on some very nice Armani suits.
Or you can just grab one out of Frasier's closet.
What do you think he was talking about?
All right... but, Simon, just remember-- my ex-boyfriend will be there.
If anybody asks, you're an Internet millionaire.
Right. I'll be your perfect well-bred, upmarket gentleman.
Now, I'll walk you to the garage.
Oh, you don't have to.
Oh, it's no bother--
I live there.
Roz!
Niles!
Simon!
Well, by the look of that smile on your face,
I'd say somebody got himself a bit last night.
I find that remark rude, boorish... and impossible to deny!
Brilliant!
Niles, how was your trip?
Oh, fantastic, Dad.
Where's Frasier?
I have some news.
Oh, he'll be back in a bit. What's up?
Oh, uh, well, I should wait for Frasier.
It was really his idea.
Do you mind?
I can wait.
Okay.
I can't.
What is it?
I'm married.
Married?
Yes. Mel and I eloped yesterday.
Well?
Well... congratulations, son!
That's great.
So, uh, you're happy, right?
Oh, happy? I'm delirious.
Yeah, you'd have to be, wouldn't you?
So, uh, you say this was Frasier's idea?
Well, indirectly, yeah.
Oh, before I forget, it occurred to me--
I think we should keep this from Daphne and Donny.
I would hate for them to think that we're stealing their thunder.
Oh, Niles.
Frasier.
Three guesses what
I did yesterday. What?
Daphne.
Dr. Crane.
Send Daphne away.
Get rid of your father.
Daphne, could you go to the drugstore?
I'm all out of liniment and my back's getting kind of achy.
Dad, that's because you've been sitting in that chair all day.
I tell you what, you know what you could use?
A good walk to the drugstore.
It'll do you a world of good.
I'll go with you.
Oh-oh, okay. All right.
Niles, why don't you come, too?
Yeah, we'll all go.
No! No, there's something very important
I need to discuss with Dad, Niles.
I'm sure you understand.
Fras!
Oh, excuse me.
Hello? Mel, darling.
No, just hanging out with Daphne.
Honestly, Dad, when will you learn to take a hint?
I can't take a hint?!
Couldn't you see that Niles wanted to talk to you?
Whatever it is, he can wait.
Oh, yeah, no big deal.
He just got married, that's all. What?!
He eloped with Mel yesterday.
Poor Daphne.
Would you please keep out of this, Mrs. Richmond!
We have got to get back up there!
We're going to the basement!
I can't wait that long!
See you later... darling.
Sorry about that.
Oh, it's all right.
So, 48 hours till the big day-- you must be pretty excited.
It's funny you should mention that.
You see, Dr. Crane...
Yes, Daphne?
(yelling):
Niles!
Dr. Crane! You're back awfully soon.
And you-you're all out of breath.
Is something wrong?
Uh, no, no. It's just that there's something
I need to discuss with Niles.
What, now? We were just having a chat.
Well, I'm sure it can wait, Daphne.
Daphne, Daphne, I need to talk to Frasier, too-- if you don't mind.
Oh, of course not.
It's not like I had anything important to talk about!
Daphne all right?
Well, it's just, uh, wedding stuff, I guess.
Uh, speaking of which,
I-I understand you have some... some news?
You're... married?
Yes. I guess Dad couldn't contain himself any more than I could.
I thought you were just going to move in together.
Well, so did I, but the strangest thing happened.
As we talked about it, we got more and more excited about the idea of being together, and then I remembered your advice to stop taking baby steps through life.
Before we knew it, we were asking the waitress for a phone book so we could find a justice of the peace!
What can I say but... congratulations?
Martin... or should
I say Dad?
Yeah. I heard.
Hello.
Darling, darling, it occurred to me
I think perhaps we should try to keep this quiet from Daphne.
Keep what quiet?
Oh, we can't keep something like this a secret.
We got married.
Did you?
NILES: Yes. While we were out of town.
But the last thing we want is to upstage you and Donny so we are not mentioning this outside this room.
Well, I am just so happy for you both.
We're having champagne.
Would you like to join us?
I'd love to, but I have to get a check down to the caterer's.
They're closing early today.
Let me drive you over, Daph.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Congratulations again.
Oh, save a glass for me.
This is the lounge.
Through there is the dining area where the rehearsal dinner will be.
This is lovely.
Say, have you seen the bride-to-be yet?
I'd like to have a word with her.
No, I haven't.
So, I thought we'd have the toast right before dessert.
Dr. Crane!
Gosh, Daphne, I was wondering where you'd gotten to yesterday.
After the caterers
I went straight to Donny's so we could leave bright and early together.
It's lovely up here, isn't it? Oh, yes.
Anybody else want something from the bar?
Um, Scotch rocks.
Donny, it's barely noon.
Isn't that when your mom said she'd be here?
Give him a double.
Um, Daphne, I was actually hoping...
I'll have whatever he's having.
Roz.
I don't even know why
I came to this wedding.
Hi, Daphne.
I was all set to drive up here myself when I think "wait a minute.
"I can't walk into that lobby alone.
What if my ex-boyfriend is here?"
So, I agreed to drive up with Simon.
There I am standing on the curb with my garment bag and what does he pull up in?
Your father's Winnebago.
Thank you.
Don't go anywhere.
Next thing I know, we're heading down the highway in the wrong direction towards the airport.
Hey...
I wasn't kidding.
Turns out he's promised to ferry your entire family up here.
All 14 of them?
Fifteen. Your Aunt Ida got the weekend off from the bakery.
Judging by the size of her, it'll be the first Saturday they turn a profit.
You know, Donny, maybe you could take Roz out for a walk in that rejuvenating country air while I have a word with your fiancée?
Come on, Roz, let's go.
You don't mind if I just take this with me, do you?
Well, uh...
I didn't think so.
Daphne, I wanted you to know that I'm just completely devastated by what happened.
It's all right, Dr. Crane.
It's just when I advised you to have a chat with Niles
I had no idea he'd run off and get married.
I know your concern for me, but I'm fine.
I thought about it all last night, and I realized what I was feeling was just wedding jitters.
I do love your brother, but I'm in love with Donny.
You're not just putting on a brave face?
No.
I'm a bit embarrassed now, making you worry for no reason.
Oh, it's all right, Daphne.
It's what I do.
You've always been such a wonderful friend.
In fact, I brought this for the honeymoon, but I'd like you to have it.
Oh, Daphne, I couldn't.
Donny and I aren't wine drinkers.
I wouldn't dream of it. Really.
All right, I'll keep it.
Now I've hurt your feelings.
Here.
Gosh, Daphne...
I tell you what.
I promise that when I do drink this,
I'll be thinking of you.
Oh, come here.
Oh, Daph.
There's my baby.
Hi, Mummy.
Mum, this is...
Oh, I know who he is, love.
I want to thank you, Donny, for rescuing my daughter from that horrible Dr. Crane.
Well, actually...
Every time
I call her, I'm not on the phone five minutes before that tyrant is ordering her to hang up.
Cup of tea, please.
I thought my daughter might get me one, but she didn't.
God, this seat's worse than the Winnebago.
Though not half as uncomfortable as that sardine tin of a room you arranged for me.
Oh, God, can't bear the smell of that.
Take it away.
Oh...
Reminds me of the salmon they served on the airplane.
Oh, if it doesn't have me hurling me guts out, it'll be by God's own intervention.
Now give your new mum a kiss,
Donny.
Oh, actually, Mum, this isn't Donny.
DONNY:
Oh, is this Mum?
This is Donny.
Hi.
Well, come here.
Let's have a look at you.
We've be starting to think our Daphne would never find herself a young man.
And I see she hasn't.
Well, beggars can't be choosers.
Well, I'm going to go and see if your father's stomach is feeling any better.
He keeps saying it's tension.
What he's got to be tense about,
I'll never know.
I was worried she'd be in one of her dark moods.
Daphne's brothers know how to let loose, don't they?
MARTIN: Boy, I'll say.
Now, listen, about their names.
The one who'll eat anything on a bet, that's Nigel.
No, no, that's Peter.
Nigel's the one whose Band-Aid he ate.
See ya.
Hey, Fras.
Had enough, huh?
Oh, yeah.
I think I hit my limit when in the middle of my toast
I looked down and there was a man chewing on my boutonniere.
Oh, God, it's been a hell of a week.
I still can't get over Niles and Mel.
Didn't see that coming.
Well, at least he says she makes him happy.
So there's nothing you can do about it.
Actually...
Fras, don't even think about trying to talk him out of it.
He's married.
End of story.
It's really not that simple, Dad.
You see...
I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
Is this about Daphne?
Why do you say that?
Oh, come on, I got eyes.
I know something's going on.
I seen the way she's been looking at him.
She found out how Niles has felt about her all these years.
You're kidding?
How'd she find out?
That's not important right now, Dad.
The problem is that she told me that she might have the same feelings for him.
Oh, geez.
Of course, then Niles shows up married.
Now she says it's just jitters.
Well, you can't tell Niles all this.
He says he's happy with Mel.
She says she's happy with Donny.
And I'm not sure I believe either one of them.
Just remember, Fras, there are two marriages on the line here.
So, before you get involved, you better make damn sure you know what you're doing.
Who blabbed? Roz?
Yes, but she feels terrible.
Hello, boys.
Hey...
A pack of smokes, please, barkeep.
Oh, lovely spot, isn't it?
I just took a nice little stroll outside around the wishing well.
Oh.
That'll be four dollars, please.
Oh, yeah, right.
This ought to cover it.
Tim, what a surprise.
I had no idea you'd be here.
Simon... come here.
Show time.
Simon, this is my old friend Tim.
He's a computer programmer.
Oh, what a coincidence.
With me owning my own software company.
Really? What sort of applications are you focused on?
Voice recognition, data encryption, something I'm working on for NASA.
Can't discuss that one.
Oh, very impressive.
And Roz, are you still producing?
I'll say she is.
Excuse me.
Mind if we join you guys?
Oh, please.
Sure.
There's plenty of room.
Give me a beer, please.
Sorry we didn't get a toast out of you,
Mr. Crane.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I really wanted to, Daphne.
But I just felt kind of awkward.
Oh, it's all right.
Anyway, I should be toasting you.
I'm going to miss you, you rotten old sod.
BARTENDER:
Ballentine okay?
Oh, yeah, that's my beer.
Yes.
You know, I just found out they're going to quit making this stuff.
Really?
Yeah.
There's an end of a era.
That's right.
It's going to be one sad day when I get down to my last one.
You know, it's funny... you get used to having something in your life.
It's part of your day.
Just take it for granted.
Then suddenly it's gone, and you realize how much it meant to you.
Hey, guys, great party.
Oh, uh, Mel, why don't you take my seat?
I'm going to sit here and enjoy the music.
I'll join you, Fras.
Take my beer over there.
I just want to go to the restroom.
You know, seeing that this is my last night as a carefree bachelor, would you care to dance, Miss?
I'd love to.
Uh-oh.
Well, certainly picked the perfect spot for your wedding.
It is, isn't it?
We're doing the ceremony in the garden.
Oh. It'll be beautiful.
I love this song.
Well, where are my manners?
Would you like to dance?
All right.
Give us a chance to keep an eye on those two.
Oh... it's been a while since we've danced together.
Yes, it has.
Thanks for dinner.
It's been a wonderful evening.
It's one of those times you just don't want to end.
Excuse me, sir.
You mind if I cut in?
Not at all.
Thank you.
Darling.
What in the world was so urgent that you brought me all the way up here?
Niles, just sit down.
Something I need to discuss with you.
Uh...
I was watching you on the dance floor just now and the look in your eyes was unmistakable.
Well, can you blame me?
Mel's quite the little dancer.
Of course, her vertigo does rule out any serious twirling, but...
Niles, I'm talking about Daphne.
The way you were looking at her... well, it just breaks my heart.
Frasier, it was one thing when you were beating this drum the other day, but I'm married now.
What's it going to take to convince you that I am over her?
She knows.
What?
Daphne knows that you have feelings for her.
She's known for some time.
How?
Well, it's a long story.
I think Roz said something.
Anyway, she knows.
I knew you thought my marriage to Mel was hasty but to poison it like this?
I'm not going to listen to this.
Niles, Daphne feels the same way about you.
At least I think she does.
She told me as much the other day and then she denied it once you got married.
But I saw the way she was looking at you downstairs just now.
Oh, my God.
Niles, I'm not in the habit of breaking up people's marriages.
But how could I not tell you?
You're my brother.
I love you.
MEL:
Niles, darling?
Yes, honey?
You left with our only room key.
Oh, oh. Here.
I'll let you through this way.
I am so sorry.
It's all right.
You have a whole lifetime to make it up to me.
This is awful.
I love Mel.
It's just...
Oh, I know.
I know.
I have to talk to Daphne.
Come with me.
Maybe while I'm speaking to her, you can find some way to occupy...
Donny!
Hello, Daphne.
Hey, Doc.
Things were getting a little too wild for us down there.
Oh, just as well.
We all have a very big day tomorrow.
About that, Daphne, can I have a word with you?
All right.
Go ahead.
I'm going to get out of these shoes, and I'll see you in a few minutes. Good night.
You know, I'll just brave the horde, see if I can get myself a nightcap.
Uh... good night.
Come in.
So, Daphne?
Yes?
May I offer you something to drink?
Um, no, thank you.
Oh, all right.
Anyway, Daphne...
Perhaps an Orangina.
Oh, all right.
Maybe I'll join you.
Funny thing about Orangina--
I never buy
Orangina at home, but whenever I'm in a hotel and there's a mini-bar, it's the first thing I go for.
Orangina.
Anyway... I was just talk... talking to Frasier about a conversation you two had.
Oh, dear.
No, no.
Don't get upset.
I specifically asked him not to say anything.
What was he thinking?
No, I'm glad he told me.
Oh, yes. So we can have a big talk about it.
That's what you psychiatrists always do-- drag everything out in the open so we can work through it no matter how awkward it might be.
Well,
I just don't see the point.
Daphne, I'm glad he told me because I love you.
(laughing):
Excuse me.
Dad?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you were in here with Frasier.
The boys are playing a game called William Tell with the seltzer hose, and...
Uh, oh, well, uh... anyway.
Why don't you two just go on doing whatever you were doing, and I'll just, uh...
I'll be down in the lobby by the fireplace.
Dr. Crane, you shouldn't say such things.
It's the truth.
Lord knows,
I have tried to deny it, tried to pretend that I'm over you, but not a day has gone by when I haven't thought of you-- your smile, your beautiful eyes, what it would be like to hold your hands and ask you the question
I never dared ask...
What's the difference between a blister and a boil?
Donny!
I took my shoe off, and it was like I'm growing another anklebone down here.
Doc, you went to med school.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Lance it or something?
You know, as I recall the best thing for that would be to soak it in tepid water for at least half an hour.
All right.
What luck, huh?
Can you imagine a worse thing could have happened to me the night before my wedding?
I don't understand.
How come you never said anything before?
Daphne, I wanted to.
I just... the timing never seemed right.
Oh, and the timing's right now?
I'm 12 hours from the altar and you're on your honeymoon.
I would never have gotten married if I thought there was the slightest chance that you shared my feelings.
Trust me, Daphne, say the word, and I will leave Mel in a heartbeat.
MEL:
Niles?
Darling.
I was just looking over these brochures for our honeymoon.
Hi, Daphne.
Hi.
The Danieli has a step-down tub, but the Gritti has the most romantic view of the Grand Canal.
What do you think?
I think a woman with your exquisite taste can handle this decision.
He says that now.
Wait till the honeymoon's over.
Don't the doors in this bloody place lock?
I'll get this one.
You get that one!
Daphne, it is not too late for us.
I meant what I said when I said I would leave her.
That's crazy.
No, no, it's not crazy if you feel the same way I do.
But I need you to tell me, and I can accept it if the answer is no... how do you feel about me?
Pardon.
Simon?
How could you get in here?
Frasier loaned me his key, in a manner of speaking.
I have to get some things out of the mini-bar.
I don't want to get caught empty-handed when last call comes.
You're not having a last call of your own in here, are you?
Of course not.
Right.
This isn't the chap whose baby you're having, is it?
Excuse me?
I'm not pregnant!
Simon!
Bit of bad news.
Nigel!
Peter's got sick into the piano so we've been asked to vacate the bar.
Bloody hell, Daphne.
Nice hotel you picked.
Well, Nigel, I'm sure
Daphne won't mind we help ourselves to the contents of her mini-bar.
Away you go.
Right. Give us a hand, lads!
Nigel!
Stephen! Peter! David!
Michael! Billy!
What are you all doing in here?
So here you all are.
What is the point of bringing the party down to the Winnebago when there's a perfectly nice room right here?
You're not moving the party in here.
Oh, Daphne, don't get your blood pressure up.
You've got your baby to think of.
Here, have a drink and relax... oh, God.
I'm sorry about all that.
I must be in love.
It doesn't even bother me that you come with them.
Lovely night, isn't it?
Hmm.
Stars are out.
There's a nice breeze.
Hmm?
Night-blooming jasmine.
And of course, there's the beautiful girl.
Dr. Crane, I still haven't answered your question.
Yes, I know.
That's why I keep talking.
In case I don't get the answer I want,
I can at least make this moment last a little longer.
I'm not sure if it's jasmine or orange blossoms.
You know, a lot of times...
Oh, for God's sake, Dr. Crane.
I think you can call me Niles now.
No.
I don't think I can.
I do love you, but
I can't do this.
W-w-well, I know it'll be difficult, b-but...
I will get a divorce, and you can call off the wedding.
I can't.
Donny is a dear and wonderful man, and I made a promise to him.
And, Mel-- you made more than a promise to her.
We were supposed to forget that?
For what? We have no idea how we'd be together.
For heaven's sakes, we've never even been on a date.
Daphne, take it from someone who knows.
You don't want to spend half your life thinking about a chance you didn't take.
I'm sorry.
My mind's made up.
I think we should say good night now.
Good night, Daphne.
Good night, Dr. Crane.
Hey, Niles.
Don't tell me the ceremony's over already.
Oh, no, it hasn't even started yet.
Actually, we saw you heading over this way.
We thought maybe you could use some company.
I just felt like some privacy.
This is one wedding
I couldn't see myself handling very well.
Oh, lots of people cry at weddings.
Yeah, but not so many end up wailing and rending their garments.
I appreciate your coming over, but I'd hate for you to miss it on my account.
Actually, it's been delayed a bit.
You see, the justice of the peace started out asking the witnesses to step forward, and three of Daphne's brothers just ran off into the woods.
Ah.
Hello.
Here's your wine, sir.
Yes. Thank you very much, young man.
Uh, and, uh, this is for you.
What is this?
Well, Niles,
I got to thinking about our old friend Morrie and how he kept this bottle of wine his entire life waiting for a special occasion.
And then, I thought what occasion am I saving it for?
And then I thought about what a courageous thing you did last night-- taking that chance.
And that's worth a toast.
No, no, Frasier...
Niles, it's too late.
The foil is pierced.
I know this thing between you and Mel seems kind of bad right now, but...
Oh, now, Dad, why do you say that?
Just because I spent the third night of my marriage proposing to another woman?
Well, I'm just saying that marriages survive all kinds of stuff.
You know, you might still be happy.
Ten years from now, this could all be ancient history.
I hope you're right.
FRASIER:
All right, gentlemen.
Here we are.
Dad, Niles-- allow me.
To better days.
Dad, where did Morrie keep this?
In his wine rack.
Which is?
In the boiler room.
Oh, Lord.
I'll just save this little treat for later.
Yes, well, thanks for the thought.
You two should be running along.
I'll be fine.
All right, well, take care, Niles.
FRASIER:
I saw a waiter passing champagne just outside.
I'll have him bring you a glass, so you can...
Get the taste out.
Yes, thank you, Frasier.
Come in.
Hello.
Daphne.
I was wondering... if you might be free for a date.
Oh, my God, yes.
There's plenty of time for that later.
Let's get this bloody boat moving.
What... you mean now?
There's about a hundred people back there
I'm not so keen on seeing.
All right.
Let's go then.
Fasten your seat belt, Daphne.
Fasten yours, Niles.

I hear the blues a'callin' ♪

Hey, guys, life-centered comedy.
Come on in .
She weighed 1 ,200 pounds, and the guy stayed married to her.
Can you imagine that?
''Honey, do you think l look fat in this?'' l have noticed that there is a certain compulsion among stand-up comedians to go onstage and perform .
Yeah , unless you wanna go. lt's a real need .
[ Applause ]
What am l doing here?
[ Laughter ] l made it! l had my own show!
[ Laughter ]
What did l do? l'm back here now! l screwed up.
[ Up-tempo jazz plays ]
Why are you here?
Why am l here?
That's a good question . l could ask you the same thing .
Well , l did an HBO special last year. l retired everything l've ever written and wanted to start fresh .
And you have just these couple little things to hang on to. lt's very strange. lt's very hard to get used to. l was in L.A. last week.
Everyone's going , ''l'm not just blowing smoke up your ass.''
You know that expression?
Hey, l really thought it was, you know, it was good .
And l'm not just blowing smoke up your ass.
What is it about having smoke blown up your ass. . .
Yeah , l've got, like, two bits, and the rest is. . . shit.
[ Cheers and applause ] l tell ya, l could not fuck around with these people, or l was going down , l knew it.
But they were with you .
That was -- like, you looked like you were having fun .
That's my job.
[ Up-tempo jazz plays ] l just have no idea what the curve is of when it's gonna be, you know. . . something . . . that's like -- it feels like -- like -- like it used to feel .
When you're killing , and while you're up there killing , you're miserable, then it's back where it used to be.
When you're like,
''Ah , big deal . l made these idiots laugh .''
[ Laughs ] l saw this lady today with a little, uh -- what was it? l don't even know the names of these little dogs.
The really little one.
- Chihuahua.
- Shih tzu .
- Yorkies.
No. l don't know. l don't know. l wouldn't even know if you said it.
- Rat in a dog suit.
- lt doesn't matter.
[ Laughter ]
You really can just relax, sir. l'll take it from here.
[ lndistinct conversations ]
This place absolutely has that unmistakable smell of every comedy club l went to starting out in New York -- that -- this kind of wood with , like, with alcohol , the cigarettes. l don't know what it is. lt's so distinctive.
Colin Quinn , everyone!
[ Cheers and applause ] l just love it. l love walking downstairs.
Jerry Seinfeld !
Go in there. lt's all crowded .
Everyone's perched .
You just go on and grab the mike and bust it out.
You know what l mean?
The bare essentials. lt's like Tyson fighting with no socks -- just his shorts and his shoes, and that's it. lt is the smelly gym .
Yeah . l love the conspiracy people.
You always have the friends that think they have the inside dope on everything . l go to the movies with my friend , l go to reach for a straw -- the straw thing , you know -- he goes, ''Whoa-ho-ho-ho!
Never take the first straw.
''Don't take the top front straws.
''Always take the straws in the back.
''My nephew used to work here.
They rub their balls on the straws.''
[ Laughter ]
They rub their balls on the straws?
''That's how they fuck around .''
Really? That's a very nice way to pass the time.
He yells at the popcorn kid ,
''Don't give us from the top.
''Underneath the top.
We don't want the top level .
They jerk off in the popcorn .
My cousin used to work here.''
He's like,
''Don't give us ginger ale.
They piss in the ginger ale.
My brother used to work'' --
Sounds like the problem might be your relatives. lt's a real pleasure to bring this next guy to the stage. lt's been a pleasure to watch him grow in the last few months.
How about a big hand for
Jerry Seinfeld , everybody?
[ Cheers and applause ]
People always say to me,
''lt must be so easy.'' lt's not easy.
What's easy?
For me, now, because people know who l am .
No, you get a little bit of a break up front.
You're goddamn right!
[ Cheers and applause ]
Yeah .
And then , uh , you still gotta be funny.
That's the beauty of stand-up, though .
That's the -- that's why it's closest to justice.
Not that it's just, ultimately, but it's close to justice.
Even Jack Nicholson , who everybody loves, if he's in the middle of a comedy show, everybody'd give him five minutes of grace.
And then they'd be like,
''Okay, Jack, you know, if you're not making us laugh , get going .''
You know what l mean?
He's the most beloved person there is.
Right.
So, in the end , whatever it is -- whether it's three days or seven days -- you're still irritated , still annoyed , still frustrated , still hating the whole experience all the way through .
And , now, my point here. . .
[ Laughter ]
What is my point?
God damn it.
[ Laughter ]
[ Groans ]
[ Laughter ] l got off on that whole thing about the number.
Oh , damn it. l don't know. l don't know.
What was it about?
And it's -- l didn't even want to say what l just said .
That's the ugly part. l don't remember.
Anyway, there's something good there about --
WOMAN : ls this your first gig?
[ Laughter ]
Yeah .
Yes, it is, actually.
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ]
No, l , uh --
Well , you know, uh , doing all -- all this stuff l have never said before to anyone.
These are thoughts.
This is how comedians develop material .
And , uh , as you can see, it's quite painful .
[ Laughter ]
The equivalent for a normal person would be to go into work in your underwear and try and do your job that you normally do.
All of a sudden , you can't do anything .
That's how a comedian feels when he's doing a new bit. l'll tell you what's funny -- that think-tank bit.
- Oh , come on !
- What?
That's so stupid . l would always -- l always thought this -- l hear about these places called a think tank. l mean , it's just really -- just a bunch of smart guys, and they bring in problems and try and solve them , right?
Nick Depaulo has a friend who's in a think tank in Boston .
Really?
Nick, where's your friend -- where is he in a think tank? l can't believe that many people have heard of a think tank.
- [ Laughing ]
- l'm thinking here.
What do you think people say when they go,
''l can't even think''?
They say,
''Wanna go for lunch?
Just give me two more minutes.''
[ Laughing ]
''All right.
''Let's get going . l just want to finish this one thing .''
He just sits there looking at you . lt's in there. lt's in there. lt would be kind of cool if there was a submarine, too.
Descend into the tank, and we'll let you up.
Well , that's the tank aspect of it.
Yeah .
And they won't let you up till you have, like, five thoughts.
''What do you got?''
''Uh , what about, uh , a pair of shoes with'' --
''No.'' Shut the door on you .
So when you go for the interview --
He doesn't think. lf you know how to think --
You know, sometimes, you just don't think.
You just don't think.
That's why they fire you .
They fire --
''What do you mean you're letting me go? Why?''
''Because sometimes you just don't think.''
That is very funny.
''lf you think that's thinking , you better think again .''
''l swear, l'm racking my brains.''
''That's what you think.''
''Hey, Johnson , l see you sitting in there.''
''l don't know what you're thinking .''
[ Laughter ]
''To me, it's like you don't even think sometimes!''
''l swear, boss, l'm racking my brains.''
''Maybe that's what you think!''
Mark my word , that think-tank bit is gonna be big .
- Yeah .
- [ Laughs ]
[ vehicle horn honks ]
Now, l've tried biking .
And don't bike in the city.
Oh , no, don't do it. l just got a ticket for running a red light on my bicycle. l got pulled over by a cop on a bicycle.
This guy's chasing me for three blocks.
He's like, ''Ring-ring !
Ring-ring !''
[ Laughter ]
''Move away from the bicycle.
Move away from the bicycle!''
See, l'm not 1 00%%% confident about this stuff, and that's what kills me. lf you're not behind it 1 00%%% , you can't sell it. l tape all my shows because, uh , that way l can go home and see what works and what doesn't work.
[ lndistinct speaking on television ]
Back to you , Phil .
[ Laughter ]
Did l say ''Potatoes are good for you'' twice?
And my mind does not stop writing , and that's why l'm up all night worried , because l'm thinking about all the jokes.
You know, if l'm doing a show on being Jewish , l can pull out the ''Jewish'' stuff. lf l want to do dating , here's ''Dating .''
''Old jokes to rotate in .''
These are all screenplays l've written .
Look at that.
These are all my journals.
All my journals. lt's all here. lt's all here.
This is it.
These are all jokes.
These are jokes, jokes, jokes. l can't believe how much work l've done. l have dreams at night that -- that all the material l've created is just gonna fall on me and kill me and suffocate me.
[ Groans ]
[ lndistinct speaking on television ]
Ohh !
''Ohh !'' l love that little dance.
That's painful , watching yourself on tape.
Even if you're doing well , you're like,
''Damn , look at my -- look at the way my hand moved or. . .''
- Hey, Jerry.
- How you doing?
Got it figured out?
Now you've added more pressure to my night. l was going to do at least 7 0%%% new stuff, and at least a 1 00%%% a new order, and open with something l've never opened with before.
- Really?
- Yes.
Wow.
[ Both laugh ]
Not impressed , are you?
No, l am . l wouldn't do that.
- Really?
- No.
- Why is that?
- You're crazy.
You're taking your life in your hands. ls he bringing me up? ls he?
Poor guy.
He's a goner. l realized today when l walk by a cute girl ,
9 times out of 1 0, l'll turn around and look at her ass.
And 1 0 times out of 1 0, she doesn't look around to look at mine.
And that's depressing .
All right, l gotta go.
Thank you very much , everybody.
Good night.
Listen , everybody thinks you're funny until you're funny, and then they don't say you're funny anymore.
So when a comic comes up and goes, ''You're really funny,'' that means you're not funny.
That's like you're an open-miker.
And then the minute you get really funny, then -- then they turn on you , and the jealousy in this business is ridiculous.
And the amount of that that l've had to battle -- l mean , everyone's like, ''Orny's so cocky, Orny's so this.'' l'm just sure of myself, and l've never been condescending to anybody else.
Normally what l do is l open with , like, three or four minutes, l do a couple of new stuff, and then l go in , you know.
That's the right way to do it.
You always need to establish yourself, establish the audience,
'cause you're never really comfortable.
Even though you may think you are, you never really are.
Right. l know.
But l thought l could -- l did it the other night.
Yeah , l've done it, too, and it's still a mistake.
Yeah .
Good luck following that.
[ Loud cheers ]
Fuck him .
You know, when Jerry gets up there, they're standing , they're on their feet.
You know, l brought him up the other night.
Everyone stands up. l didn't know if they were standing up because l was leaving or he was coming , but they stand up. very nice.
Thank you very much .
[ Cheers and applause ]
Good job, Jerry.
Whoo.
Come on out.
You can give --
Oh , here comes more advice. l think more important to me is the celebrity. l would like to right now have everybody in this restaurant looking at me going ,
''That is Orny Adams.
''That is him .
That guy's funny. l really respect what he does.''
You get to a point, you're like, ''How much longer can l take it?'' ls time running out?
Are you out of time? l'm getting older.
Please. l'm getting older. lt's odd .
Listen , l'm 29. l feel like l've sacrificed so much of my life.
The last three years have been a blur.
Do you have something else you would rather have been doing?
You got other appointments or other places you gotta be?
- Not necessarily, but --
- No, not necessarily. l see all my friends are making a lot of money -- a lot of money on Wall Street.
You what? l just see the -- like, my friends are -- they're moving up, and l'm worried --
- They're moving up?
- They're moving up.
Are you outta your mind?
No, l'm not outta my mind . l just, uh --
This has nothing to do with your friends.
- l've upset you .
- No, no.
This is a special thing .
This has nothing to do with making it or --
Did you ever stop and compare your life and go, ''Okay, l'm 29.
''My friends are all married , they're all having kids,
''they all have houses, they have some sort of sense of normality.''
Let me tell you a story.
What do you tell your parents?
How do you deal with that?
''What do you tell your parents?''
Yes. You know, like how do you --
This is your --
Your parents?
Let me tell you a story about --
This is my favorite story about show business.
Glenn Miller's orchestra, they were doing some gigs somewhere.
They can't land where they're supposed to land because it's winter, snowy night.
So they have to land , like, in this field and walk to the gig .
And they're dressed in their suits.
They're ready to play.
They're carrying their instruments.
So they're walking through the snow, and it's wet and it's slushy.
And in the distance they see this little house.
And there's lights on on the inside and this billow of smoke coming out of the chimney.
They go up to the house, and they look in the window, and in the window, they see this -- this family.
There's a guy and his wife, and she's beautiful .
And there's two kids.
And they're all sitting around the table.
And they're smiling , they're laughing , and they're eating .
And there's a fire in the fireplace.
And these guys are standing there in their suits, and they're wet and they're shivering , they're holding their instruments.
And they're watching this incredible
Norman Rockwell scene.
This one guy turns to the other guy and goes, ''How do people live like that?''
- That's what it's about.
- Right. lt was beautiful .
And the advice that he gave me, just, it reassured me of all the feelings that l have.
That's the way l feel .
Yes, Jerry, l am doing something different.
People are scared of me, but you're right. l should stand strong .
And every time l hear that from the industry, l'm just gonna think, ''Seinfeld told me to stand strong .''
[ Mid-tempo jazz plays ]
Were you a class clown-type like George was?
No.
Well , when did you start making people laugh?
Well , l made friends laugh , but l never liked to --
- Friends.
- Yeah .
You were the funny guy in the group.
Well , everybody was funny.
Don't you think?
When you were growing up, everybody was funny.
And then , at some point, everybody went off and got jobs.
Lenny Bruce and Robert Klein , really, was, like -- and George Carlin .
That's really the genesis of every comedian you see working today.
Everyone from my generation wanted to be like this guy.
Robert Klein -- how about another round of applause?
[ Cheers and applause ]
My parents, uh , retired to South Florida.
Uh , they're gone now, but l'll tell you the truth , l have a beef with South Florida. l don't know what it is. l mean , l tell you , l'm sick about it! Bitter! l sent two healthy,
65-year-old retired parents to South Florida.
30 years later, dead !
[ Laughter and applause ] l mean , what is it -- the water, the air? lt's a death camp!
They live in a very cozy place called Section 2 1 .
[ Laughter ]
You're on the way down .
[ Laughter ]
Where can you go from the biggest show of all time?
That's the way it is.
You want to be a comedian -- ls anybody here kind of thinking about it at all , maybe in the back of your mind?
Yeah , just kind of thinking about it?
You , sir?
[ Light laughter ]
Well , this is what it is. l mean , you can't get bigger than me.
[ Loud laughter ]
And look, l'm still shit. . . always shit.
That is lesson number one. ln comedy. . . it's always shit. l fuckin' hate it.
- You do?
- No, l don't. l just didn't have a good set today. l made that rookie mistake of opening with the new material
'cause you're excited about it and you want to try it, but you're not ready to do it.
You want to make sure you don't forget it, and you feel like -- almost like that new stuff is gonna open up all this other new stuff where you know you'll do
30 new minutes.
Right.
The oldest delusion in the book, right?
Yup.
You gotta go in there and get them to go,
''Oh , yeah , this guy is the man .''
Then you can do whatever you want.
And then , suddenly, you're not the man .
And you know they think you're not the man , or that's what you're thinking they're thinking .
Exactly.
They might not necessarily think that, but in your mind , that's it.
[ Slow-tempo jazz plays ]
What l was saying to Colin the other night, l said , ''l'm not gonna go out
Saturday night anymore.
They're too juiced up and all the date night.''
He just set me straight.
He said , ''No, it does not matter what the audience is.
Get up every night anywhere you can . . .''
Work, work, work, work, work.
''. . .early, late, good -- it doesn't matter.''
And , of course, l went,
''Of course it doesn't matter.''
When you're crafting an act, you need to see how that material works in front of each different type of situation .

You gotta work it, work it, work it, work it.
Well , the mad cow disease is back.
What l love about it is that we find a way to blame it on the cow. lt's not our fault.
Those cows are nuts.
[ Laughter ] l had a good , solid 20 minutes.
20 minutes in three months is a ton .
Think about the concept -- a beauty contest.
''You're very attractive. l challenge you .''
They have complete confidence in that plastic.
What do we know about the Glad sandwich bag?
Well , it keeps the sandwich fresh . l'll pick up shit with it.
20 minutes is not comedy.
An hour, an hour and 1 5 minutes, that's comedy, you know?
You learn how to open , how to sustain , how to pace.
What are you doing?
This weekend?
Working here.
[ Yawns ]
But certain trends l'm looking forward to come to an end .
Ladies, the outline around the lip. . . is over. l wish l could just say to all the women on behalf of the men of planet Earth , we see your lips!
That's why l'm doing this. l'm scared .
That l'm not gonna be able to do it anymore if l don't keep doing it, that it might leave me.
" Looks so natural , no one can tell "
" Looks so natural "
You ever heard of this product
''Just For Men''?
- Yes.
- lt takes away the gray.
" No one can . . . " l love the commercial for Hair Color For Men .
Did you ever see it?
With the song .
" Looks so natural , no one can tell "
Everyone can tell . l meant to time that set, but l'm definitely feeling like l've got a very solid
30 minutes.
Are you gonna go on first, or are you gonna wait? l'll wait. l thought there was so much more here.
Hold on . l'm getting to it.
Don't you push me around here, folks.
Do they still get drunk
Friday night, second show? lt's better than it used to be, but tonight was kind of getting there. l wouldn't want to go on now, l'll tell you that.
No, just go.
They kicked me out of your club tonight twice.
Well , it's not my club, it's theirs, and it looks like it's gonna happen again .
[ Laughter ]
" Looks so natural , no one can tell "
" You are drunk "
You guys clap when he's mean .
No one can tell .
When l'm mean , you guys are like, ''Oh , what a dick!''
" One, two -- one, two, three "
Where are you from?
Nice to meet you .
Oh , okay.
Hi , how are you doing?
Okay.
How's it going , Jerry?
Good , how are you doing?
Yeah , we just shook.
Nice to meet you .
We just shook.
Why do we have to do it again?
Folks comin' in late, yeah .
Y'all just missed
Jerry Seinfeld .
How fucked up do you feel now?
How bad do you feel?!
How much new stuff you got? l got about, uh , 40 minutes.
- Really?
- Yeah .
And you're happy with all of it? l think -- l mean , l started with nothing . l know.
And so, it was like --
When you started with nothing , when you -- when you just erased it all , the first time you went on , you had , like, what, five minutes?
Five minutes, yeah . lt was awful .
And you just -- you didn't say,
''Let me do one old joke to get a laugh and then l'll'' --
No.
- Really?
- No. lt's only, actually -- l've been doing it about four months. lt's only been , l would say, the past month that l'm actually starting to feel comfortable going onstage. . . not having that not-good feeling going up
''This might not work,'' which , you know, l haven't had for years.
That feeling of ''l don't know if this is gonna work.''
Yeah . l'm trying to get it together now. l'd like -- l'd like to, you know, two months from now, l think, l should be able to go to work somewhere and do 45 minutes.
So, does it feel like the old act, George?
Oh , well , it's not quite the old act, but it's, uh , you're certainly on your way. l mean , the progress that you made in four months is amazing .
Yeah .
The old act, you know, that was -- you started when you were 2 1 ,
22 years old .
Yeah , right, right. lt's very close to a marriage-type relationship.
- Good . Nice to see you .
- Nice to see you .
My oldest client's Carl Reiner, and he's 7 8.
That's right.
[ Laughter ]
- George Burns, he was 1 00.
- That's right.
But Jerry's gonna work -- do a date when he's 1 00.
Did you book it already? l didn't -- What?
Did you book that yet? lt's gonna be the Palladium .
We're talking .
[ Laughter ]
We're gonna lock it up while l'm still -- while l'm still here.
Can you believe you're in charge of deciding whether our brilliant ideas are good or not?
All these talented people, all these -- money, Tv credits, and they come up here, and you get to decide what's good and what's not good , and we believe you .
And what the hell do you know about it?
Nothing .
You know nothing .
You've never written a joke.
Most of you aren't funny. . . probably all of you .
You wouldn't be here if you were funny.
You wouldn't need to come to this.
But just think of how you would feel , you know, if l came into your office and said , you know,
''l don't like the things you say at these meetings.
''l don't know anything about your business,
''l don't have a reason , l don't even work here.
''l just thought l'd come in off the street and give you a piece of my mind .''
''And what gives me the authority? l bought two drinks.''
[ Laughter ]
[ Piano plays slowly ]
[ lndistinct conversations ] l don't really believe in the festivals. l think l have talent.
[ vehicles passing ] l don't have a manager. l don't have an agent. l don't have a deal . l don't have any access to L.A.
You know, Jerry's saying ,
''Go to L.A. , go to L.A.''
This will get me to -- lf l go to Montreal , and l have a good set -- and l can't see how l can't have a good set at this point in my career. l real-- l can't. lt's inconceivable to me at this point.
This is, like, a huge opportunity, but in the scheme of life, l'm the one with talent.
They have a festival , and yet they're making my goddamn knees weak. l've mastered the art. l am ready. l just went in , and l looked at the stage. lt's like it's a woman . l just want to mount it. l just wanna get on that stage and destroy.
Mr. Orny Adams, everybody.
[ Applause ]
Thank you .
Let me just give a little advice to the industry.
Stretch before l go up on stage.
'Cause when you come running after me, l don't want you to pull a muscle or something .
Last year, l thought l had lupus.
Has that happened to you yet?
[ Laughter ] l was on the bus, and there was an ad --
''Chances are, somebody on the bus has lupus.'' l look around , l'm the only one on the bus.
Two nights in a row of not sleeping .
Frantic, nervous energy. l go to sleep for like a half-hour. l wake up. l turn the Tv on . l get bored of the Tv. l shut it off. l put on music. l shut that off. l go back to Tv. l lie down for 1 0 minutes. l get up.
You know, it's nuts. l do some writing , and l'm relaxed . l'm single. . .by choice.
Whoo!
Not my choice.
[ Clears throat ]
Apparently, the women had a meeting behind my back. l got blacklisted or something .
WOMAN : Gay?
No. Thank you for asking , though . l appreciate that.
''Are you gay?''
No. Shut the fuck up and let me do my routine.
Twice in two weeks, and l've never, ever had that before.
People think they look so cool on their cellphones, don't they?
Everybody's so cool , especially the people still talking on the first cellphones ever made.
These people are walking around like, ''Oh , yeah , look at me!''
[ Laughter and applause ]
''Oh , yeah . l work on Wall Street. Yeah .
''Oh , what's that?
''Hang on a second .
Let me put the antenna up.
Excuse me, excuse me.''
[ Cheers and applause ]
Good night, everybody.
[ Cheers and applause ]
Then l walked offstage and l went like this to the Montreal people
'cause they gave me a wink and the thumbs-up.
Hi , Mom . lt's your son .
Good . Good . l was just officially told l got it.
Yeah , so. . .
Yes, you can tell people, you can book airline tickets, you can do whatever you want -- l'm going to Montreal .
[ Laughs ] l got up there and l said one -- l go, ''l'm single by choice.''
And this girl goes,
''Maybe you're gay.'' l know. Bunch of animals.
Bunch of animals.
All right. Bye-bye.
Love you too.
[ Horn honks ]
Running out of people to call . lt's delicate between who you can -- who you call and who you're rubbing it in to.
Everybody's away. l can never be happy. l'm -- l'm unhappy again , everybody.
Oh , God .
Somebody -- Somebody is gonna have to marry me.
Do you realize there is some girl out there right now having fun , and she doesn't even realize she has to spend
[ Laughing ] the rest of her life with me.
[ Laughing ]
She's out there right now, enjoying life, not realizing the rest of it's with me.
Hey, honey? l hope you're having fun now
'cause it's all coming to an end . l was happy for, what, four minutes? l made 55 phone calls in four minutes. . . and now l'm miserable again . l never felt pain until l started doing comedy.

" Something's going wrong "
Oh , they're done. Shit.
What about Carolines?
Think they're still working?
Yeah , is the show still working?
Um , no, actually, the show is almost over.
Oh , right.
Can l still get on?
[ Laughter and applause ]
[ Cheering ]
" Love and happiness "
These comedians, they always complain --
''l can't go up now. l can't follow this.''
How bizarre is this evening now?
[ Cheering ]
You thought it was pretty bizarre, didn't you?
This guy's dancing around with a G-string on and wigs. ls there anything more different from me than that?
[ lndistinct talking ]
And it was fine.
What is this urge to get information we already have?
Whenever l'm in a car and l drive by a mirrored office building , l look in the reflection to see if l'm in the car.
- [ Laughter ]
- Whoo!
This is information l already have.
What am l looking for?
Why am l checking?
And what would l do if l looked and l saw that there was a small
Korean woman driving my car?
[ Laughter and applause ] l don't know what l would do then . l would have to stop the car. . . get out, go up to the reflection . . . and if it was still a small Korean woman , go, ''All right. l stand corrected .
[ Laughter ]
''Apparently, l am a small Korean woman .
Who wants a manicure?''
[ Laughter ]
Thank you very much .
Those people, you know, they came here to see
Angel Salazar. lt's late -- tired , finished . lf -- lf something is good , it's good .
[ Up-tempo music plays ]
Here we go.
Thank God . l'm gonna meet with the guy who's gonna change my life.
George Shapiro.
You don't expect to ever meet
George Shapiro.
You don't expect to ever be taken out to dinner by George Shapiro.
You don't expect George Shapiro to be interested in you . l mean , George Shapiro has worked with some of the best talent in the last, you know,
30 or whatever years that he's been in the business.
So, we're gonna meet Orny.
The best comics in the world are the comics that, you know, get their material from their heart and their soul .
And he seems to have done that.
You know, he did ''Seinfeld .''
Cool .
But was it luck?
Who knows, you know?
You know, lightning's got to strike twice in this business for you to be a legend . l mean , he's already a legend , but, l mean , to be, you know. . .
Here we are -- midtown !
This is where it all happens.
Showtime! l don't know what he's looking for.
You know, he's probably meeting several people. l want George to walk up to me and go. . .
''Let's dance.'' l see it on the left.
See that sign that says ''Bice''?
''The '80s still thrive at this pricey midtown northern-ltalian serving power pastas to beautiful people --'' that's me --
''on expense accounts --'' that's George --
''and Eurotrash .
''lt's a stylish , if no longer trendy, scene that critics call --'' oh , l love this --
'''overpriced , overhyped , over-everything .'''
Bring it on .
We had a very nice, long dinner, and the upswing is George has offered to manage me.
He said , you know,
''We're -- We're very interested .
We think that --''
And this is after hours of just --
We went over everything -- our philosophies -- uh , philosophies on integrity, how do we think we would work together, what they would do as far as Montreal , as far as, like, deals -- how to, you know -- how to go through each deal and find out which is right for me. l-l had all sorts of concerns, and l voiced them differently.
Like, l would say. . .
''Now, a lot of people would say
''George Shapiro has too much money.
He doesn't care.'' l said , you know, ''What's your motivation to get behind me?''
And , uh , he said three words -- uh -- ''love of comedy'' -- that he loves comedy and that he sees my integrity and the way l work. . .
Okay, this is good . l'm gonna go up -- lt's good to finish the interview with him .
Don't you think? lt's awkward .
We're gonna go upstairs. l'll be upstairs in room 7 0 7.
Oh , really? That's. . . l want to hear the game.
Oh , you can't hear?
Well , you know, l feel silly.
Uh , okay, l'm gonna be on the other side.
So if you need me, call me.
You do the interview.
Yeah , do you want to go up -- go up to your room . l don't, uh . . . l can hear it now.
They put it on loud . lt's gonna interfere with the audio, but that's okay.
Um . . .
Man , seven points. . .
[ Laughs ]
Ahh !
''Hey, we'd like to give Orny a $ 7 00,000 --
The Lakers are on !''
Listen , part of me feels like l'm handing George Shapiro a gift.
[ Horn honks ]
[ Laughing ]
SElNFELD: This is really one of those nights -- the classic New York night where you just stand in front of catch --
You know, you did your set, you just stand like this, and try and pick up girls on the street. l always say your number of years in comedy is about your maturity level .
[ Laughs ]
When you're doing it ten years, you're like a ten-year-old .
[ Slurring ] Oh , that's right.
Hmm? Yeah !
[ Laughter ]
1 5 -- you're like a 1 5-year-old -- you're start-- slight bit of maturity.
When you eat salad . . .
Yes?
Then you go to the bathroom . . . do you see the salad? l don't think so.
No?
20 years -- you're, like, kind of a grown-up but still completely infantile.
Excuse me, did you want any dessert, coffee, or anything?
They have great cheesecake, you know. lt's amazing .
What -- apple pie.
You have apple pie?
Mm-hmm .
Yeah , l'll have a piece of apple pie.
We're out of the apple pie.
All right, then you know what?
Cancel it.
[ Laughs ] l still say you're gonna regret not getting that cheesecake. l do that joke all the time, and Jessica always laughs.
- What joke?
- That's a good wife.
''Cancel it''?
When someone says they're out of something , l say,
''You know what -- then cancel it.'' l didn't even get it. l was like, ''Yeah , cancel it.''
Well , you can't cancel something you can't get.
- l get it now.
- lt's automatically canceled . l'm saying at first l didn't get it.
[ Up-tempo music plays ]
Bonjour, Montreal .
Oh , my God , l died ! l had the worst set of my life!
[ Laughs ]
That's me -- ugh -- every night.
''What happened?''
Today's Gazette.
Read -- Read this paragraph to me.
Right there.
May -- don't touch it.
Oh , l'm sorry.
''Young stand-up Orny Adams destroys.'' ls that you?
Orny Adams?
That's your real name?
Get out of town .
No mom would name her kid
Orny Adams.
There was a time in America -- women -- they didn't even have the right to vote.
Then there was a vote to see if they could vote.
Well , how the fuck did we lose that?!
[ Laughter ] l delivered under pressure. l give myself a B-plus. l give myself a B-plus.
But tomorrow night -- same time, okay, Orn?
Here l am .
This kid ripped the front page of my paper, but. . .
''Stand up and deliver.
''Comedyfest can be a career-maker.
Orny Adams calls it
'the draft.'''
This is the best part right here.
''See 'Orny' on page A-1 0.''
[ Laughs ]
'''Orny' continued .'' l think this article was so well-written .
They took three rolls of film , and that's the picture they put in there? ls anybody else shocked with the picture?
God , it looks like the picture they're gonna put in the newspaper when l get killed in a car crash .
''Comic killed !''
You know? l gotta open my own door?
''The National Post'' -- right there, baby, that's me.
Front page today.
Anybody read that?
[ Light clapping ]
Anybody -- nobody reads this goddamn paper?
[ Laughter ] l make it on the front page of my first national paper and nobody reads it?
[ Laughter ] l'm sorry, but this audience sucks.
[ lndistinct talking ] l don't care how you -- how you put it.
They suck.
Because l'm a competent, professional comic that does it every night.
And it's like they're polite and they laugh , but they're not like. . . l'm on the front page of your paper.
[ Laughs ]
That cracks me up. lt's a 7:00 show! lt's 7:00 -- look at this. . .
Anybody ready to go out?
Comedy isn't a daytime thing . l just really thought l could do more with the paper, and l was proud to be in the paper.
And l'm just, you know -- it's too bad nobody reads it.
That show gave me a headache.
[ Guffaws with French accent ]
[ Chuckles ] lt is frustrating . lmagine. lmagine how many -- how many people are out there to see me tonight.
[ Guffaws ]
Heh .
All rise for George Shapiro.
The honorable George Shapiro.

How's it going? Certainly!
Wow!
This is a treasure.
They did an exclusive.

So -- So l take some meetings. . .
Don't get carried away.
- l'm not getting carried away.
- Relax.
George, it's easy to say when you got money in the bank.
Well . . .l'll give you some money. Here. . .
You want Canadian or American?
American , please.
That's the dumbest question l've ever heard .
- [ Laughs ]
- [ Laughs ]
And l'm gonna take it!
That's just a l--
Absolutely take it.
- No, no, no.
- No, you got to take it.
You might have some more fun .
You printed up those cards.
Those cards are worth at least $ 1 ,000 to me to have a card like this that says,
''l'm with George.''
- l can't take it.
- You got to take it. l love it here so far.
- Love it. Love it.

Are you working this weekend? l will be at ''New Faces'' tonight at, uh , Cafe Campus -- l have a 9:30 show -- and , uh , you can come out and see if l live up to that hype.

What have you been -- how long have you been doing it and where have you been holding your sets and all of that stuff?
Well , as soon as the audience quiets down , l will answer that question .
- Ooh .
- Shh .
Ooh .
Thank you .
Just have some fun with it, you know.
This is -- This is your -- no pressure -- but this is your shot.

Whoo!
ADAMS : Hello, everybody, how you doing?
[ Laughs ] l love Cuban people.
They're the most buoyant people in the world .
They'll float over on anything .
They'd come over on this.
They'd be like,
''Come on , everybody!
We're going to America!
Come on !''
[ Laughter ]
Do you think l'm gonna be a big star, George?
They're throwing obstacles in front of you on the way back to the hotel .
They're tricky.
Do you think l'm gonna be a big star?
Yes. And l think you'll still be unhappy.
You'll still be --
Why you gotta curse me like that?
- Only because you told me that.
- l'm ready. l'm ready.
So, now, i-if l blow it, then l don't get to that next level .
Hey, Barry.
- How you doing , sir?
- Did you see it?
- How'd it go tonight?
- Did you see it?
No, l didn't -- l didn't see you tonight. l'm sorry.
- l wish you had .
- His best night of his life. l only, uh . . .
He's got a lot of respect for me, that's all .
No, l do. l had a great roast joke, but l respect you so much that l couldn't do it.
- A joke?
- l do a roast and , uh . . .
What was the joke?
Can l tell you -- but all in good fun?
Yes. l said ,
''George Shapiro --
''l respect this guy so much , you know.
''Represents Seinfeld , now Orny Adams. . .
What's next -- the parrot from 'Baretta'?''
[ Chuckles ] lt's not bad .
But l , uh . . .
That's -- That was soft.
Hear what he says about me to my face.
Yeah , let's hear.
You want to hear the opinion , or should l not say anything? l don't care.
Oh , no, of course not.
This is my opinion of this young man .
This is what l tell him all the time.
All he has to do -- all he ever has to do with his career -- if he can do it -- is just. . .
And let the act speak for itself onstage.
And l told him , ''Steven Wright doesn't walk around
''talking about what's gonna happen here,
''how my life's gonna go,
''what development deal l'm gonna get, what's gonna happen , l got Montreal . . .''
He walks onstage, and he says, ''Thanks.''
And he gets off and says, ''Thanks.''
And where is Steven Wright now?
Steven is one of the most prolific, brilliant stand-up comedians of our generation .
And where is he now?
He won an Academy Award .
For what?
For a film .
A short film . l want you to do well . l'm not telling you this because l want you to suck and have people hate you . l know, but l-l think that l've --
Forget what you think.
Forget anything what you think.
Just take it.
Take what l'm saying .
And just relax and take it.
[ Laughs ] ''Relax'' is something you can tell me. That --
- You're a great comic.
- That's what we all say.
You're doing great.
You've worked so fucking hard , and it's coming together.
So where the act is coming together, take the other side and have it come together. l got to watch this guy.
All right, Barry.
Thank you .
Thank you .

What a cocksucker.
[ Man laughing ]
He's such a cock--
He doesn't know what the f-- l'm gonna sit there and let that guy talk to me like that?
He didn't say anything bad .
He just told you to relax.
Which is what l've been telling you .
Just relax.
Enjoy what's happening -- l'm just gonna start doing what George does -- not listen and just smile.

There was nothing he said that l would -- l would refute.

You know, it's all about doing the hour where you're the entertainment for the evening .
So l booked a date in Washington , D.C. at The lmprov.
We're gonna do the first show on a Saturday. l have this image in my mind of what a comedian is supposed to be that l'm always trying to live up to and that l always fall short of.
This is so exciting . l'm the show for the night. l have to make that evening work for those people. l'll be more obsessed with remembering everything than really caring whether l did well or not.

And l'll bring you the water. l'll just come up --
Would you rather --

Mr. Jerry Seinfeld !
[ Loud cheering ]
[ lndistinct talking ]
Everybody give a big hand . . .
[ Cheers and applause ]
Wow, how did that go by so quick?
[ lndistinct talking ] l don't know why l feel like this --
This is so hard . lt just feel-- l-l guess l kind of got a little ahead of myself, and l think l was expecting more. l thought the performance was, uh . . . lt just didn't have the confidence l wanted it to have.
Have -- Have you been onstage for, like, 53 minutes before?
For that length of time straight?
No. Not in two years.
That's the accomplishment tonight.
You know, you stumbled a couple of times but. . . lt's a whole different ball game. lt's so fucking hard to get comfortable. lt just comes and goes.
There are just, like, just little glimpses, little moments where l feel really like myself and l feel comfortable.
And then the rest of it l'm , like, in my father's suit with these huge sleeves and legs and l'm going . . . l-l'm thinking ,
''What am l wearing?
What --
What am l doing here?''
- " Sometimes l think "
- What's that? ls there weather in East Hampton?
- " l've almost "
- There was a chance of rain .
" Fooled myself " l would think you have to do it four times a week -- on the weekends, do it. l mean , you know, l can't -- l can't really go back to that life.
- " Sometimes l think "
- l don't want -- l can't go back on the road for seven months a year. . .
" l've almost fooled myself "
- You know?
- [ Jessica laughs ] l have another life now.
[ Laughs ]
" Spreading out my wings "

" Above us like a tree "
" Laughing now, out loud "
EMCEE : Everybody, big round of applause.
Why must l overreact?
Eh . . . lt's gonna be all right.
But l really had a good -- l really had a momentum going . l really had some writing momentum and . . . lt's not like it takes it all the way back to square one.
Yeah . l don't know.
Just misstep for a couple days and then you're back.
Yeah . No big deal .
Piece of cake.
[ Laughing ]
You know, when l was starting out l used to sit down and write a couple times a week.
And then one day l was watching these construction workers go back to work and l was watching them kind of trudging down the street. . .
And l was, uh , just -- it was like a -- a revelation to me, and l realized ,
''These guys don't want to go back to work after lunch , but they're going .''
'Cause that's their job.
And l think if they can exhibit that level of dedication for that job, l should be able to do the same.
Just trudge your ass in .
[ Laughter ] ls there a point where we're all gonna stop telling each other to wait. . .for the beep?!
[ Laughter ] lt's the 2 1 st goddamn century.
The Hutu tribesmen of the African plain know about the beep.
They don't leave a message until they hear. . .
[ Speaks African gibberish ]
Beep.
[ Laughter ]
Can we all stop asking each other to leave our name and number?
No one needs this.
Anybody getting messages like,
''This is a woman . Goodbye.''
[ Laughter ]
''l am a lawyer.
Contact me immediately.'' Click. l don't think so!
ADAMS : lt's 3:00 P.M. lt's noon in L.A. l've never been so conscious of L.A. time.
Since Montreal it's like -- that's all l think about --
''What time is it in L.A.?
''Who's talking about me right now?
What conversations are going on?'' l tested for a pilot, and the executive said that my hair made me look like a serial killer.
We're doing ''Letterman .'' l'm under so much pressure.
Because it's like every second of that routine, every word , has to be perfect.
George said , ''Hey, if you don't put him on , we're calling
'The Tonight Show.'''
And that's when they said ,
''We want Orny.
We want him to break on our show.'' l'm gonna go out there and -- and do the best set of my life. . .
So Dave comes -- comes out and says, ''Great set'' and then turns to his producer and says,
''When can we have him back?'' l feel censored , but l don't really feel censored . l mean , they're being fair, but they're changing a lot of the wordings of my jokes.
Like l can't say l'm getting a tumor from my cellphone. l have to say l'm getting headaches from my cellphone.
These little nuances change your rhythm , change your -- the way you would normally say it.
Here are the jokes l'm gonna do on ''Letterman .'' l have rewritten ''future wife,'' the ''lupus callback,'' and the ''cellphone.''
Now, with the cellphone bit last night -- l'm at Gotham -- and instead of picking up the chair, all of a sudden l grab my -- l grab my thing and l started going like this and l'm talking into my --
''Oh , yeah , look at me. l work on Wall Street.'' l'm not compromising now.
Now l'm funny 'cause l got a shoe at my ear. l got everything l wanted this year, and l've never been more stressed and more miserable. l'm sweating now
'cause l'm nervous.
And the insanity makes you just want to drop everything and say, ''You know what? l give up. l give up.''
You know? l haven't even talked to you for a while. l saw Bill Cosby. . .
- three weeks ago.
- Really?
Best comedy show l ever saw in my life.
Really?
'Cause l took, like,
1 5 people.
We'd all seen him before.
We only knew one bit.
He did 2 1 /2 hours.
[ Laughs ]
The best shit l've --
- l feel like a fucking fraud .
- Well , he's the best.
What is this?
What am l? l'm good !
Who says l'm good?
Who says any of us are good?
63 and embracing it. . .
Did he have an opening act?
No.
So, he took an intermission after, like. . .
No, he didn't take an intermission .
2 1 /2 hours straight?
Pow. Pow.
2 1 /2 hours of killer shit.
Killer.
And it's so much more edgy now and mean .
Ooh , you got to see it.
Wow.
Boy, l-l'll have to go.
[ Mid-tempo jazz plays ]
[ Mumbling ]
[ Sighs ]
Look at them lined up.
Look at that.
That's funny.
Hi , everybody.
[ lndistinct talking ]
- Hi . Who's waving at me?
- [ Women screaming ]
Oh , no, l don't need screaming people.
[ lndistinct talking ]
- Hi . [ Laughs ]
- [ Laughs ]
- Come on in .
- Hi , l'm Orny Adams.
Hi , l'm Ally.
But it's gonna be good . l'm ready.
Psoriasis. . .
Psoriasis.
They've requested that l not use the word ''lupus'' at the last minute -- which is -- which is fine.
We're gonna make the joke work. l'm a -- l'm a joke craftsman now, so. . .
What do l do?
Do l pull off the show? l mean , l don't want to go on the show and -- and not be me. l'm all positive -- psoriasis.
Once l learned how to say the word ''psoriasis.'' l didn't really know what it was. l sort of knew it was a skin condition , but l didn't know it was scaly. l didn't know. . .
Originally l thought,
''Let's pick a disease that only women can get'' -- like uterus cancer or something .
But you -- you know, obviously you can't say ''cancer.'' l open by saying ''lupus'' and close by saying ''lupus'' so what -- how do you -- how do you dance around that? So. . .
So, l'm fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
Listen , it's their show. l'm a guest. l'm still thrilled to be here and , uh , it's gonna be -- you know, look at me. lt's gonna be unbelievable, and that's the bottom line.
Let's make the best out of it.
Psoriasis.
Everybody -- to psoriasis.

Orny Adams. Orny. . .
[ Cheers and applause ]
[ Rock 'n' roll plays ]
This is so exciting . l'm happy to be here.
Last year l thought l had psoriasis.
Has that happened to you yet? l was on a bus and there was an ad --
Chances are that somebody on the bus had psoriasis. l look around , and l'm the only one on the bus.
[ Laughter ]
''Looks like l better get to the hospital -- l have psoriasis.'' l got to be honest with you . l-l feel off. l mean , l got up from dinner -- l excused myself 'cause l couldn't even speak. l just -- my eyes started to tear. l don't know what it is. l need to talk to George. l need to know if this is normal .
Did Jerry feel this way when he did this? l mean , am l having separation anxiety?
What is it?
Why do l feel awful? l mean , do you realize l -- l opened my first huge, national network debut set with a joke l've never told before? l've never told -- l've never said ''psoriasis.''
Until this morning , l didn't even know what it was. l don't want to be perfect and be polished and be it because that's the beautiful thing is when you see Jerry and you see Roseanne and you see these people doing it for the first time.
They're not polished .
They're young , they're excited .
This is -- this is the greatest moment, and you see it on their face.
And that's what l wanted this to be like.
But l want people to understand it. l just want people to understand the process -- what we have to go through as comedians -- what it takes to get there. l don't think people understand .
This has been -- you know, l'm 30 years old , and l've been working full-time eight years at this, not to mention l've been daydreaming since junior high , when l wore my inserts walking around , about this moment, and l got there. l did . l used to get up in junior high and repeat the whole monologue from -- from Carson and Letterman . l remember that.
And it's like, you know, l've been waiting for this moment. l've been waiting for it, and -- and . . . l guess, you know, l-l just. . . l'm hard on myself, but l hope everybody else isn't as hard on me as l am on myself.

[ Mid-tempo rock music plays ] l'm not coming here much anymore. l'm done with it. l need to go out and work the road now. l need to go out and do an hour every night.
Well , you got enough .
That's. . .that's how you -- how you get it together.
[ Mid-tempo rock music plays ] l really didn't think l was at this point. l'm still not sure of it, actually.
But l have to see how this holds together and how it feels -- does it feel like an act? l was huge!
[ Laughter ]
Bigger than life! l could be anywhere in the world !
[ Laughter ]
Everything -- it's all crazy. l should be at St. Barths.
Nothing -- Nothing makes sense.
[ Laughter ] l'm in a comedy club in Cleveland .
But that's what's working .

You don't want to go after me.
You want to go before, right?

There's no reason why this should not work.

Yeah , it's all new material .
So why can't l do what l do and you do what you do? lt's just about being together, isn't it? l just want to be with you .
MAN : Please welcome the comic stylings of Mr. Jerry Seinfeld .
[ Cheers and applause ] l can only do -- l swear to God -- like 1 0 minutes. l'm hearing all this for the first time, too. l swear to God .

MAN : Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , and welcome to Rascals.
Tonight we're proud to present an evening with . . .
Jerry Seinfeld !
And now, Jerry's special . . .
We're flying in from L.A. . . . to work in West Orange,
New Jersey, huh?
Any new technology just gets translated into a sexual form .
Home video -- sex video.
Phone -- phone sex! lnternet -- porno website!
Copy machine -- put your ass on it! l'll tell you --
That is a tough , tough fucking gang they got out there.
Every comedian has a fucking excuse -- it's the candles, it's the smoke. . .
Get those candles out! l gotta go on ! l make no excuse. l just wasn't good .
Maybe we'll look into that miserable Governor's out in Levittown .
That's really Alabama.
Long lsland , baby. lt's everything you hate about yourself you see staring right back at you .
Everything you tried not to be but you know, deep down , still are.
[ Laughter ]
- Nice, lively audience.
- Oh , good .
. . .this limo driver, and , uh . . .
What?
Did you hear when l stopped at one point and how many people are talking?
[ lndistinct conversations ]
How well do you have to do before someone's gonna fucking listen up?
You know, how big do you fucking have to be?
What kind of material do you have to have that you're gonna pay attention?
Shut up.
[ Laughter and applause ]
You are in the way.
Well , that was classic!
Clas-sic.
You looked so smooth and in control . lt didn't look like it was bothering you at all .
No, it didn't.
That was like. . . monkeys throwing shit.
[ Laughter ]
Your stuff is great. lt's really strong . lt's really good .
Yeah , yeah . l mean , it's -- it's a smooth transition . l was saying how watching you -- like, l remember what it means to have that polish that l don't have.
You have it. l think you don't realize it.
You know, the only thing you do now that l see is the pause is. . . two seconds longer as you move to the next piece. l was picking stuff tonight. l wasn't sure what to do.
Yeah , yeah . l know.
But, l mean , to the audience, it comes across as a thoughtful pause as opposed to comics -- you know, knowing , ''Oh , he's --''
[ lmitates tape rewinding ] lt's amazing how long it takes to get those out, how -- you know, l mean , some of this stuff l'm doing six months, but even that's like. . .
You know how it is. lt takes you years. lt takes years. lt's amazing . lsn't it weird? l could never do what you did . l could never give it away.
'Cause you always have it in the back --
You know, you always think of your act as like. . . lf you're a comic, your act feeds you . . . it pays the rent. . .
- Yeah , but not at this point.
- lt's like my exercise. l walk two miles on-- but, see, l've never touched a dime of my
''Tonight Show'' money. l live on the money l make as a comedian .
- What are you gonna do with it?
- l don't know.
You don't know?
Think about it. lt keeps you centered .
Like if l get fired tomorrow, l'm a comic. lf you're a custodian -- if you wind up as a custodian -- you're still living with this fear that you're gonna wind up working as a garbageman .
Remember? l know. He claims it.
He -- l swear.
But that's what keeps you going .
No, it doesn't! lt's idiotic!
Stop it already. l remember one time you had a meeting in some office, and you were talking to the security guard for some reason while you were waiting for the elevator, and you're telling me,
''You know, this guy, he was Jackie Kay back in --''
Oh , l remember that guy.
You know who that was. lt was a guy that had two series.
SElNFELD: You believe that this is going to happen .
You don't really believe it, but it just keeps you . . .
The only thing that keeps you going is like -- to me, it's like, l watch you do that great story with your parents and the vCR -- that keeps me going . l would love to have a story that long .
Well , l enjoy doing the act more than l enjoy doing any--
For example, you said to me,
''You can have all the money that you would make and not do the act, or do the act.'' l'd do the act.
You like telling people a joke that they haven't heard .
Yeah . l mean , it's fun telling jokes.
We used to talk about how it's more fun than anything else.
So that's why you run around and do the act all the time when you're not doing the show.
Yeah . lf you don't do it, you don't have it.
What is this helmet with the -- that is very popular now with the motorcycle riders?
You know the helmet l mean -- the slight flaring around the back.
What the hell is going on here?
You know the helmet. lt's not a full Nazi , but it's a slightly Nazi .
What is this shopping moment?
Can you explain to me how this happens?
You walk into a motorcycle store, the man says, ''May l help you?''
''Yes. l need a motorcycle helmet.''
''Well , we have these regular ones over here.''
''No. Not for me.''
[ Laughter ]
''Well , let me ask you this, sir --
How do you feel about the Nazis?''
[ Laughter ]
''Well , to tell you the truth , l kind of had a problem with the, uh , genocide, hatred , racism , and murder.''
''What about the helmets?''
''They weren't bad . l didn't mind the helmet.''
[ Laughter ]
''l didn't like Hitler, but l don't think l had a problem
''with the apparel itself.
Yeah , l'll buy that.''
[ Laughter ] l'm supposed to get the, uh , colonoscopy test.
When you get into your forties, l think -- l've heard -- from health-care professionals that you -- lt's very important to get the camera up your ass. l have resisted this. . . because l feel the press has invaded my life enough .
[ Laughter ]
[ Applause ] l feel that l will draw the line here. . . and say no to the pooparazzi .
[ Laughter and applause ]
Thank you very much .
[ Cheers and applause ] lncredible. Jerry. . .
You -- You got it.
- lt's looking good , huh?
- Oh , fantastic.
- Wasn't that amazing?
- lt was wall-to-wall laughs.
- Yeah .
- lt was sensational .
- lt's really looking good .
- l'm -- l'm thrilled .
[ Horn honks ] l was thinking of doing the ''Letterman'' spot -- a stand-up spot on ''Letterman .'' l always kind of, uh , want to not do the typical --
Okay, someone's doing something , they go on Tv --
''Here l am , and here it is.
Here's the thing that l'm doing .'' lt's interesting as can be, because that's what comedians -- that's what we used to do.
You remember when Johnny didn't call you over?
- Yeah . Yes.
- Were you upset? l was upset once, when it was like my third or fourth time, and Johnny still didn't --
No, you got called over very quickly, l remember.
No. lt was the seventh time.
- Really?
- Yeah . l never forget.
Well , whatever it was, it was sooner than me.
- No?
- Yeah . Definitely.
That would make me feel good , to be frank, but l don't think that's true. l do. l know it's true. l've never wanted a man's approval before then -- before Johnny.

What do you do?'' l'll tell you what l do.
Nothing .
[ Laughter and applause ]
Yeah , l know what you're thinking --
''That sounds pretty good .''
You're thinking , ''l might like to do nothing myself.''
Well , let me tell you -- doing nothing is not as easy as it looks.
You have to be careful , because the idea of doing anything , which could easily lead to doing something . . . that would cut into your nothing . . . and that would force me to have to drop everything .

SElNFELD ON TELEvlSlON :
We're still looking for ways to put more cheese into a piece of pizza?

The whole goddamn thing is cheese anyway, but now somebody figured out,
''We will injection-mold the crust with cheese
''so you have a log of cheese surrounding the pool of cheese in the middle!''

Pizza Hut has developed something new now.
They will actually bake your head into a block of cheese. . . and you just attempt to eat your way out and regain the use of your five senses. l just did things that l wouldn't normally do -- little line -- little words that. . .
You know, l just totally focused on the little, tiny mistakes that l made. l got 30 phone calls, though , which is, like, l think the most l ever had in my life for anything .
With my HBO special , which was a hundred times more difficult to do, l got three calls.

How old -- l was 1 0 years old -- playing his albums and just crying and laughing and just in wonderment at what he was doing and just. . . that l had never heard somebody be so funny before.
Say hello.
This is Gladys Rodgers.
- Just say hello.
- Hello. Gladys?
- Okay. That's enough .
- [ Laughs ] l still have all those albums.
And it's just --
You can't believe that life could be long enough that you could ever even know this person .
Do you normally do two shows?
- Yes.
- Really?
Yeah , because of the theater.
- This is a small size for you?
- l would rather do -- l don't know what this is. lt's 26, 2 7. l'd rather do two of these than one in an eight-seater,
- You know what l mean?
- Yeah .
This is a comfortable size. l feel l can put a little bit of this. . . l can stop, l can go over here, l can veer back, l can come around the side.
This is normal for you -- a 2 :00 and an 8:00?
- Sure, sure, sure.
- Really?
- Wow.
- Sure. l love it.
Do you? l . . .l just. . .love it.
That is a physical effort -- to do two of those shows in one day.
That is quite a physical effort.
Two hours and twenty minutes.
Jesus Christ. lsn't it fun . . . that you have taken . . . what is comedy and what is you , and . . . now you -- you have a body of work that, um . . . l mean , you can go to any bar, you can be like 7 0 years old , you know, and you can stand beside Bill Russell . . .

Willie Mays, Joe Louis. . . and when those guys are saying ,
''you know, l played the shit out of my game,'' you say, ''You know, l knocked the shit out of. . .

- You know what l mean? l . . .l think it's one of the great moments of. . .of being a performer when you can say,
''You know, l took what l had . . . and l knocked it out of the park.''
And that's what you've done. lt is one of the greatest thrills of my career that l even know you .
Thank you . l've already done something , and he reminded me of that, and now, this -- l really just want to do what l love to do, and l want to go where he's gone, you know? l want to be able to explore this thing and maybe find some -- that's what l keep thinking -- that maybe there's something else out there.
Ah ! lt's worth trying . lt's worth exploring . l just feel like l can go somewhere with it. l don't know where.

Funny guy.
He had one of my favorite jokes of all time --
How can you trust a jury?
A jury is made up of 1 2 people too stupid to get out of jury duty.
Oh , Colin .
That's old , man .
Really old . lt's old now, but maybe he's the one that wrote it.
No.
How old is it?
The '50s.
{842}{919}Michael Fish takes a late|look at the weather.
{920}{953}Again, a good deal of cloud.
{954}{1015}A little rain from time to time|for much of the day,
{1016}{1097}but later on that rain is going|to become ever more persistent
{1098}{1135}and eventually,|I think that rain
{1136}{1193}will probably turn out to be|fairly heavy.
{1263}{1349}What you've seen in any|documentary about any band,
{1350}{1450}before or since, is how great|and wonderful everything is.
{1451}{1552}It's not the truth of it.|It's hell, it's hard.
{1553}{1672}It's horrible.|It's enjoyable to a small degree
{1673}{1733}but if you know what you're|doing it for,
{1734}{1776}you'll tolerate all that
{1777}{1869}because the work, at the end|of the day, is what matters.
{1869}{1920}We managed to offend
{1921}{2006}all the people we were|fucking fed up with.
{2549}{2652}The Labour Party, who'd promised|so much after the war
{2653}{2764}had done so little|for the working class
{2765}{2889}that the working class were|confused about even themselves
{2890}{3003}and didn't even understand what|working class meant anymore.
{3004}{3053}It was cold and miserable.
{3054}{3119}No one had anyjobs.|You couldn't get ajob.
{3120}{3169}Everyone was on the dole.
{3194}{3250}If you weren't born|into money,
{3251}{3309}then you might as well have kissed|your fucking life goodbye,
{3310}{3363}you weren't gonna amount|to anything.
{3364}{3426}The germ, the seed|of the Sex Pistols
{3427}{3493}generated from that.
{3633}{3704}Now is the winter|of our discontent
{3705}{3838}made glorious summer --|by this sun of York.
{4008}{4090}England was in a state|of social upheaval.
{4091}{4183}It was a very, very|different time.
{4184}{4241}Total social chaos.
{4241}{4309}There was rioting|all over the place.
{4310}{4357}You have to join|the picket line.
{4358}{4429}There were strikes on every kind|of amenity you could think of.
{4430}{4480}Pound power.
{4481}{4563}The TV channels would|go on and off randomly.
{4595}{4689}People were fed up|with the old way.
{4690}{4764}The old way was clearly|not working.
{4829}{4874}There's a little bit|sticking up there.
{4875}{4932}You can see it|in the reflection.
{4933}{4996}Ultra Bright|gets you noticed.
{5083}{5148}You're told at school,|you're told at the job center,
{5149}{5241}you're told by everyone|that you don't stand a chance.
{5280}{5374}And you should just accept|your lot, and get on with it.
{5400}{5459}That's where you're gonna get|the social strife.
{5460}{5530}Hate and war...|and race hate.
{5740}{5797}When you feel powerless...
{5798}{5878}you will grab any power|you can...
{5879}{5960}to retain some kind|of self-respect.
{6009}{6064}Want something on how many|people have been mugged?
{6065}{6142}Don't lay your hand on me...|I'll break your fucking jaw!
{6143}{6228}That man is sad|'cause he's misinformed,
{6229}{6290}and he's misled,|and he's used.
{6291}{6361}Yes -- I am a racialist.|And why?
{6361}{6410}Who's made me a racialist?
{6411}{6480}This government --|the conservatives,
{6481}{6561}and every stingy,|stinking councillor
{6561}{6624}who sticks up for the nigger.
{6625}{6685}And I'll stand by my words,
{6686}{6766}'cause I don't like these people,|never will do!
{6810}{6852}Words are my weapons.
{6853}{6932}Violence is something|I'm not very good at.
{6933}{7004}I don't think you can explain|how things happen,
{7005}{7061}other than sometimes|theyjust should,
{7062}{7148}and the Sex Pistols|should have happened, and did.
{7149}{7204}We went out in the garden.
{7205}{7249}Get off your arse!
{7621}{7678}I was born|in Queen Charlotte's Hospital
{7679}{7750}on September 3rd, 1955...
{7751}{7824}And I lived with my mother|and my stepfather
{7825}{7885}who I thought was my dad,|in the basement
{7886}{7921}in Shepherd's Bush.
{7922}{7987}And I slept at the edge|of their bed on a camp bed.
{7988}{8064}My real dad, he bailed|when I was two.
{8065}{8166}His name was Don Jarvis.|He was an amateur boxer.
{8167}{8274}I definitely didn't feel|wanted as a child.
{8309}{8393}Well, I was born and raised|around West London,
{8394}{8456}the Shepherd's Bush|and Hammersmith area.
{8457}{8519}It was typically|working class.
{8520}{8622}I met Steve 'cause we lived around|the corner from each other.
{8647}{8705}I went to school|near Paul and Steve,
{8706}{8748}next to Wormwood Scrubs|Prison.
{8749}{8798}Me dad was a factory worker,
{8799}{8869}and mum worked at|a powder puff factory.
{8869}{8940}If you were to look back at me|as a school kid,
{8941}{9004}you'd see a very shy, quiet,
{9005}{9112}Iittle church mouse kind of|character in North London.
{9148}{9198}Irish immigrant parents.
{9199}{9259}My mum taught me|to read and write
{9260}{9348}after meningitis, a serious|illness I had at seven,
{9349}{9412}when I was in a coma|for a year.
{9413}{9510}When I came out of hospital,|I was completely brain wiped...
{9511}{9603}Old memories had been erased...|Didn't remember anything at all.
{9604}{9650}Just backwards in everything.
{9651}{9704}It was like having to start|all over again.
{9733}{9768}# Pictures of Lily... #
{9769}{9871}How does it get from the man|to the egg?
{9872}{9961}I actually got put back a year|'cause I was so stupid.
{9962}{10030}And I would never pay|any attention in class,
{10031}{10076}I was just always|daydreaming.
{10077}{10136}Steve was quite wild at 1 0,|1 1 years old.
{10137}{10202}I think he was always getting|into trouble then.
{10203}{10288}You should make sure that you've|got the thing around the right way.
{10289}{10386}On the other hand --|I got four fingers and a thumb.
{10387}{10459}I question everything,|I always have done.
{10460}{10503}If we were doing Shakespeare,
{10504}{10556}a teacher would give me|a hard time,
{10557}{10606}and he wouldn't tell me|what I wanted to know.
{10607}{10659}I'd ask outright questions,
{10660}{10705}and you're not supposed|to do that.
{10705}{10752}You're just supposed|to accept,
{10753}{10809}"lt's Shakespeare.|It's great, you're not."
{10810}{10845}That's not good enough|for me.
{10898}{10969}I would steal. I mean,|that's all I knew how to do.
{10969}{11066}I used to watch my parents steal|at Tescos when I was six.
{11067}{11115}And I was always|getting in trouble.
{11116}{11171}And so that's all|there was -- music.
{11172}{11253}# Flavors of the|mountain streamline... #
{11254}{11344}I was totally into music --|Roxy Music and Bowie.
{11345}{11422}I thought that musicians fell|from the sky at that point.
{11423}{11476}I didn't think anyone|could be a musician.
{11477}{11594}# School's out forever! #
{11595}{11700}I was very quiet at school|up until about 14 or 1 5,
{11701}{11752}when I decided|I'd had enough.
{11753}{11829}I knew we were being|fobbed off...
{11830}{11930}and basically given a shoddy|third-rate version of reality.
{11931}{12003}So you would not be capable|of questioning your future,
{12004}{12049}because you didn't have one.
{12194}{12277}My mother loved Alice Cooper|as much as I did.
{12277}{12361}She had an extremely|varied taste for everything
{12362}{12442}from lrish folk music|to T. Rex...
{12443}{12496}To some early Bowie.
{12497}{12564}Lots of the heavy metal|that was around at the time,
{12565}{12653}everything.|Extremely Catholic taste.
{12654}{12749}# I want all you skinheads|to get up on your feet #
{12750}{12833}# Put your braces together|and your boots on your feet #
{12834}{12910}There was a lot of black kids|down Shepherd's Bush,
{12911}{12960}and we used to go|to their parties
{12961}{13008}and listen to ska music.
{13009}{13054}It sort of developed|from there really,
{13055}{13110}I think, our interest|in music.
{13111}{13179}I think it was Wally...|the famous Wally Nightingale,
{13180}{13232}who said,|"Well, let's start a band."
{13233}{13300}At the time, Wally said|Steve would be the singer,
{13301}{13360}and I would be on drums.
{13361}{13440}Wally actually played guitar,|and so it was up to each of us
{13441}{13496}to go off and learn|our instruments.
{13497}{13548}We used to rehearse|and rehearse,
{13549}{13620}and just kind of like,|fantasize, really.
{13637}{13672}If I wanted to wear something
{13673}{13719}that T. Rex was wearing|the week before,
{13720}{13767}I'd go down King's Road|and fucking steal it.
{13800}{13877}I always used to end up|at "Let It Rock" which was owned
{13878}{13948}by Malcolm McLaren|and Vivienne Westwood.
{13949}{14001}All the other shops we went in|down King's Road,
{14002}{14057}you'd walk in and you'd get|1 0 poofs on you,
{14058}{14103}asking you what you want,|"Can I help you?"
{14104}{14157}That's why we'd always|end up at Vivienne's,
{14158}{14200}because it was|like a hang-out.
{14201}{14247}I liked the clothes,|they were different.
{14248}{14315}It weren't all flares|and kipper ties.
{14316}{14380}It was Teddy Boy clothes.|It was a lot more rebellious,
{14381}{14448}and obviously|I was drawn to that.
{14449}{14496}The Teddy Boy thing, for me,
{14497}{14555}was all about the idea|of being a peacock,
{14556}{14628}and standing out in the crowd,|but at the same time
{14629}{14706}feeling a sense that you are|part of the dispossessed,
{14707}{14782}which -- at the end|of my art school term,
{14783}{14832}I thought I could make|a profit by.
{14858}{14905}I became friends with Malcolm
{14906}{14980}because he had a lot|of contacts in music.
{14981}{15020}He seemed to know everybody.
{15021}{15073}He finds a way in|with his blague,
{15074}{15121}which is perfect|for a manager.
{15141}{15195}I walked up and down|the King's Road
{15196}{15280}with complete anger|and resentment.
{15310}{15366}People were extremely absurd,
{15367}{15462}and still stuck into flares|and platform shoes
{15463}{15527}and neatly coiffured|longish hair,
{15528}{15596}and pretending the world|wasn't really happening.
{15597}{15662}It was an escapism|that I resented.
{15663}{15710}There was also|a garbage strike
{15711}{15769}going on for years|and years and years,
{15769}{15827}and there was trash piled|1 0 foot high.
{15828}{15886}They seem to have|missed that.
{15887}{15979}Wear the garbage bag,|for God's sake --
{15980}{16053}and then you're dealing|with it.
{16054}{16113}And that's what I|would be doing...
{16113}{16194}I would wrap myself|basically in trash.
{16195}{16267}...and that so lamely|and unfashionable...
{16268}{16349}that dogs bark at me|as I halt by them.
{16350}{16432}I've got news for you.|Dogs bark at me.
{16475}{16578}In a weird way, that whole|persona of, say, "Richard Ill"
{16579}{16651}helped when I joined|the Sex Pistols.
{16652}{16745}Deformed, hilarious,|grotesque --
{16745}{16809}and the "Hunchback|of Notre Dame" is in there,
{16810}{16870}and just bizarre characters
{16871}{16947}that somehow or other,|through all of their deformities
{16948}{16991}managed to achieve something.
{16992}{17036}# ...Just for a short while #
{17037}{17084}# She'll scratch in the sand #
{17085}{17130}# Won't let go of his hand... #
{17131}{17198}Steve was a kind|of a kleptomaniac, really.
{17199}{17260}I'm sure he would be|diagnosed as that, you know,
{17261}{17324}because he couldn't keep|his hands in his pockets...
{17325}{17381}which was quite handy,|really.
{17382}{17453}We'd always know a way in round|the back of Hammersmith Odeon,
{17454}{17501}being our local area.
{17528}{17576}# The Jean Genie... #
{17577}{17659}David Bowie was playing|the Ziggy farewell thing,
{17660}{17729}and while the roadies|was asleep in the front row,
{17730}{17811}he'd be going around on stage|snipping all the microphones off.
{17812}{17880}We had great guitars,|amplifiers,
{17881}{17968}great drum kits,|PA system, everything,
{17969}{18033}but, you know, we couldn't|play it properly.
{18126}{18192}To prevent myself|from being beaten up
{18193}{18263}by what were Uxbridge|Teddy Boys
{18264}{18320}coming in,|pilfering in the store,
{18321}{18372}I decided to go down|another route --
{18373}{18432}rubber and leather|fetish wear.
{18433}{18465}I felt that...
{18466}{18559}that would look fun and exciting|on the King's Road
{18560}{18643}because it would have|a similar effrontery
{18644}{18749}that Teddy Boy clothes had,|except it would be new.
{18750}{18804}Malcolm's shop interested me
{18805}{18875}because of the rubber wear.
{18930}{19020}Fascinating that people can get|themselves into such a predicament
{19021}{19104}that the only way they can|have sex is in a face mask
{19105}{19165}and a rubber T-shirt.
{19199}{19252}With a bollock weight.
{19279}{19363}How does it become that way?|It becomes like that for you
{19364}{19455}because you just cannot|face reality.
{19546}{19590}Steve just came back one day,|and said,
{19591}{19635}"l found a bass player."|I said, "Who's that?"
{19636}{19704}He said, "This guy, Glen,|who works in Malcolm's shop."
{19705}{19769}Lo and behold, I started|rehearsing with them.
{19770}{19882}They had so much equipment that|Steve had "assembled," shall we say?
{19883}{19946}We were always pestering|Malcolm to manage us,
{19947}{20036}and he said he'd be interested|if we got rid of Wally.
{20037}{20095}He came down once, he said,|"You shouldn't sing,
{20096}{20160}you should play guitar.|You should get a singer."
{20161}{20229}We realized wally was gonna|have to go.
{20265}{20328}Alas, poor [ Wally ]...
{20329}{20388}I knew him, Horatio.
{20389}{20446}Round this time|there was a group of guys
{20447}{20497}who came from the north side|of London,
{20498}{20539}who used to come|into the shop
{20540}{20594}probably for the same reasons|we did,
{20595}{20630}you know, on a Saturday,|whatever...
{20631}{20701}there was the group of them,|apparently all called "John."
{20702}{20772}Steve and Paul never believed|we were all called John...
{20773}{20828}They could never take that.
{20829}{20876}Sid's real name is John.
{20877}{20918}Theyjust thought we were
{20919}{21001}Iike a "Clockwork Orange" gang,|you know -- "The Johns."
{21025}{21104}I've no idea why|they picked me out...
{21105}{21201}other than they thought I looked|well different from the pack.
{21226}{21287}We arranged to meet John|one night...
{21288}{21333}in a pubjust down the road.
{21334}{21413}We had a few pints, and then|we came back to the shop.
{21438}{21498}We gave the singer|an audition
{21499}{21578}in my shop, later on,|after the pub had closed,
{21579}{21629}for him to imitate,
{21630}{21701}and for him|to try to sing along
{21702}{21774}with an Alice Cooper track|on the jukebox
{21775}{21839}called "Eighteen",|which I adored.
{21840}{21924}And he sung it like|"The Hunchback of Notre Dame."
{21981}{22035}# I'm eighteen #
{22036}{22098}# And I don't know|what I want #
{22099}{22157}I always did view myself
{22158}{22229}as one damn ugly fucker.
{22230}{22319}I certainly weren't|no belle of the ball.
{22320}{22377}John just started...
{22377}{22442}going into spasms|in front of the jukebox,
{22443}{22496}and singing,|and doing his act,
{22497}{22565}what later became what everyone|knows and loves, you know.
{22591}{22668}And I knew right away then|that he was the singer.
{22669}{22740}He was... gonna be the one,|really.
{22764}{22819}I personally wouldn't|have got him in the band,
{22820}{22865}even though he looked|like a star.
{22865}{22954}I thought he was a wanker for taking|the piss, and he wasn't serious...
{22955}{23012}But then, after speaking to him|for a while,
{23013}{23071}I realize that|that was his own insecurity
{23072}{23146}to take the piss because|he wasn't really a singer.
{23193}{23253}John was from a different world|from me and Cookie.
{23253}{23318}He's more of an intellectual,|John.
{23347}{23411}I knew what Steve was.
{23412}{23512}I knew he had potential|to be a great person.
{23513}{23591}There's something in him|that's genuine.
{23592}{23704}I can see that there's a tragedy|in him, just like in me.
{23705}{23786}Deep down inside,|they're wounded people.
{23787}{23840}And then there's Glen...
{23841}{23936}waffling on about nice things|like the Beatles.
{23937}{24030}We're the very first people|to call each other cunts
{24031}{24074}outright --
{24075}{24138}face on --|and know it.
{24139}{24224}And we are. We all are...|All in our way.
{24225}{24276}You put all this|together, and it...
{24277}{24378}it makes for high drama,|a bit like a Harold Pinter play.
{24379}{24440}It shouldn't work,|but it does.
{25033}{25104}All our first rehearsals|were a nightmare.
{25105}{25165}I couldn't hold|a damn note,
{25166}{25253}Paul couldn't really keep time,|I couldn't play guitar.
{25254}{25346}I fucking hated it.|It was just a fucking noise,
{25347}{25429}but I just stuck in there,|because that's all I had.
{25430}{25483}# ...no lip, child #
{25484}{25553}# And I mean what I say #
{25588}{25648}# Don't give me|no lip, child #
{25649}{25719}# You'll be sorry one day #
{25720}{25799}Oh, fuck, it's awful.|I hate songs like that.
{25824}{25893}Right from the start,|we'd argue --
{25893}{25972}bitterly, bitterly,|from day one rehearsal,
{25973}{26023}pure, full-on row.
{26024}{26077}It would be constantly,
{26078}{26128}"You know, you've gotta|learn to sing."
{26129}{26180}And it's like, "Why?"
{26181}{26245}"Says who?|Who wrote the rules here?"
{26246}{26350}But that's all right, you need|that difference of character.
{26351}{26415}I didn't think,|if I could be a sculptor,
{26416}{26476}I necessarily needed clay...
{26477}{26572}I suddenly thought,|"You can use people!"
{26573}{26689}And it's people that I used,|like an artist.
{26690}{26756}I manipulated.
{26757}{26865}So, creating something|called the "Sex Pistols"
{26866}{26963}was my painting,|my sculpture,
{26964}{27010}my little "Artful Dodgers."
{27011}{27096}Humph --|you don't create me...
{27097}{27146}I am me.
{27147}{27194}There is a difference.
{27195}{27289}Everyone on the planet|knows Malcolm's full of shit.
{27290}{27356}He's convinced people now|that he's full of shit,
{27357}{27434}by all the shit that he says,|it gets worse and worse.
{27435}{27499}And the idea of the name|"Sex Pistols"
{27500}{27605}was sexy young assassins.|"Pistol" meaning a gun --
{27629}{27705}and then "pistol" meaning|a kind of penis.
{27706}{27798}There was never a relationship|with the manager -- for me,
{27799}{27874}other than he would always try|to steal my ideas,
{27875}{27924}and claim them|to be his own.
{27925}{27994}I had to accept|that he was the manager
{27995}{28085}because he was their manager|before I joined the band.
{28086}{28141}I think they're the same|fucking star sign.
{28142}{28195}They're the same kind|of personality.
{28196}{28241}They were always|butting heads.
{28242}{28309}It was definitely John|who steered the ship
{28310}{28350}into the way we looked.
{28351}{28436}Torn, safety pin,|zips all over the gaff,
{28437}{28488}third rate tramp thing.
{28489}{28564}That was poverty, really.|Lack of money.
{28565}{28620}The arse of your|pants falls out,
{28621}{28683}you just use safety pins.
{28684}{28735}And I always used|to call him "rotten,"
{28736}{28793}'cause his fucking teeth|were like, dreadful,
{28793}{28841}they looked like dog-ends,
{28841}{28900}and -- itjust stuck.
{28901}{28995}Steve always looked like|a hairdresser on the high road.
{28997}{29039}He had a perm,
{29040}{29097}and unfortunately,|it became permanent.
{29193}{29257}I don't have any heroes.
{29258}{29307}They're all useless.
{29308}{29361}I mean, there's no bands around,|is there?
{29362}{29402}None.
{29403}{29449}None that are accessible.
{29449}{29508}It's Emerson, Lake and Palmer.
{29620}{29672}All those super bands|at that time --
{29673}{29774}Emerson, Lake and Palmer,|Yes -- they were dinosaurs,
{29775}{29856}They were dreadful, because|they were fucking boring.
{29857}{29952}Uriah Heep...|Fucking, you know... Gong!
{29953}{30046}I wanted the Sex Pistols|to compete
{30047}{30102}with the Bay City Rollers!
{30103}{30204}Can you imagine Johnny Rotten|singing "Shang-a-Lang"?
{30234}{30288}# Shang-a-lang #
{30326}{30372}# Shang-a-lang #
{30396}{30448}# Shang-a-lang,|shang-a-lang #
{30449}{30492}Ugh-hh!
{30493}{30571}Stradivarius --|was a terrible painter...
{30683}{30747}and Rembrandt --|made rotten violins.
{30772}{30827}I got interested in the arts,
{30828}{30889}and ended up going|to St. Martin's for a year.
{30890}{30949}I walked in there and asked|to see the social secretary,
{30950}{30997}and this guy said,|"Well, I am."
{30998}{31052}And it was Sebastian Conran.
{31053}{31099}And he said, "Well, what's|the name of your band?"
{31100}{31157}And I said, "The Sex Pistols,"|and Sebastian went --
{31158}{31244}"The Sex Pistols?|Oh, we must have them."
{31273}{31356}I remembered being|just fucking terrified,
{31357}{31428}and I had to take a Mandrax|to calm down.
{31445}{31484}Hello.
{31509}{31567}Hello,|I'm pissed again.
{31568}{31640}I think I took two Mandrax.|We went up there,
{31641}{31713}and it was all these arty-farty|fuckers in this one room.
{31713}{31759}There was no stage,
{31760}{31815}and there was another band|called "Bazooka Joe"
{31816}{31861}that Adam Ant|was the bass player in,
{31861}{31914}and we were all|knocking the pints back --
{31915}{31986}and it was time to go on,|and the Mandrax were kicking in,
{31987}{32035}and we started playing...
{32056}{32128}# ...you to know|that I ain't your baby #
{32129}{32199}# I want you to know|I don't care #
{32330}{32385}I remembered looking|at John, and thinking,
{32386}{32444}"This is fucking fantastic.|I love this."
{32445}{32494}It was like one of them|magical moments.
{32495}{32573}Everything in the universe|fucking clicked.
{32574}{32633}# What'cha gonna do|about it... #
{32659}{32748}Glen definitely wanted to be|on "Top of the Pops."
{32777}{32850}# I want you to know|I don't care... #
{32851}{32924}# I want you to know|that I love you baby... #
{32925}{32974}To me, that's really naff.
{32975}{33055}It's saying, "l want you to know|I don't care"
{33056}{33118}Comes quite naturally.
{33119}{33199}If I take other people's songs,|I put a twist on them.
{33357}{33423}Finally -- we're actually|playing in a band,
{33424}{33493}I ain't the singer,|I'm comfortable playing the guitar --
{33493}{33541}mind you,|I was fucked up --
{33680}{33742}and next thing I know,|they've pulled the plug on us,
{33743}{33798}and it was all over.|We're just like out of it,
{33799}{33870}and wandering around|down Piccadilly Circus.
{33896}{33962}I die of nerves|before I go on stage,
{33963}{34033}cause I don't know|what I'm gonna do.
{34033}{34118}And because of that,|I'd have to just pull things out
{34119}{34195}from deep down inside.
{34196}{34304}Hello -- # 76 trombones|to the hit parade #
{34353}{34425}Look, there's Arthur Askey|in there.
{34426}{34500}There's Ken Dodd --|# We are the Daddymen... #
{34501}{34559}# We come from Notty Ash #
{34560}{34591}There's even...
{34592}{34652}"There's nothing wrong|with me."
{34653}{34702}- Do we know any...|- Oi...
{34703}{34775}Do we know any other|fucking songs that we could do?
{34776}{34858}What England didn't understand|about the Sex Pistols
{34859}{34922}is that we are music hall.
{34923}{34974}Shall we do "Roadrunner"?
{34999}{35072}I hate that.|It's fucking awful. Stop it.
{35073}{35136}Stop it,|it's fucking awful!
{35199}{35291}There was always a sense|of piss take, and fun to it.
{35292}{35365}Shout out what -- how it starts.|What's the first line?
{35366}{35452}There's a sense of comedy|in the English,
{35453}{35523}even in your grimmest moment.
{35524}{35579}Right-- can you start|at the beginning?
{35619}{35653}I can't hear you, Paul.
{35654}{35692}You laugh.
{35758}{35804}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35836}{35862}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35917}{35957}Who wants a bunk-up?
{35958}{35997}# With the radio on... #
{35998}{36031}"...Deform'd, unfinish'd..."
{36032}{36098}# Roadrunner, roadrunner...
{36141}{36201}"Deform'd, unfinish'd..."
{36260}{36316}Deform'd, unfinish'd...
{36354}{36420}One week we'd be|playing up in high Wycombe
{36421}{36472}opening up|for Screaming Lord Sutch,
{36473}{36560}and I remember seeing|some faces, guys with long hair.
{36561}{36640}"When all other indications|suggest..."
{36641}{36695}When all other indications|suggest...
{36696}{36769}Then, a week later,|we'd be playing at "The Nashville,"
{36808}{36872}...that we're in|for a dirty night.
{36905}{36937}"...a dirty night."
{36938}{37009}And I'd see the same people|with their hair cut short,
{37010}{37066}and wearing a ripped-up|t-shirt.
{37091}{37156}# Goin' a thousand miles|an hour #
{37173}{37255}Every gig you'd see a few more,|and a few more, and a few more,
{37256}{37311}people who just got converted.
{37442}{37561}The Sex Pistols definitely|created new environments.
{37620}{37751}It was incredible good to see|the audience being individual.
{37752}{37819}# ...radio on... #
{37820}{37876}# Roadrunner, roadrunner... #
{37877}{37916}"Ain't nothing wrong with me."
{37917}{37979}Oh, God, I don't know it.|Fucking ridiculous.
{37980}{38088}There was some absolutely stunning|original people out there.
{38118}{38160}"There's nothing wrong with me."
{38185}{38228}Sioux cat woman...
{38229}{38312}That woman required a lot|of skill, style and bravery...
{38356}{38407}to look like a cat.
{38639}{38687}There was a couple|of years there
{38688}{38732}where it was stunning.
{38733}{38846}People that had no self-respect|suddenly started to view themselves
{38847}{38924}as beautiful in|not being beautiful.
{38925}{39000}Women started|to appreciate themselves
{39001}{39059}as not second class citizens.
{39060}{39123}Punk made that clear.
{39187}{39242}I've always talked|to the audience
{39243}{39302}in a one-to-one way|after gigs.
{39303}{39368}"Where do you live?|What's life like for you?"
{39369}{39428}Absolute basics.
{39450}{39508}# She put her bicycle #
{39509}{39564}# under a tree #
{39565}{39647}# I think that girl took|a fancy to me... #
{39648}{39696}But it was fun, I guess,|talking to them.
{39697}{39766}Actually, I didn't give a|fuck about talking about the band,
{39767}{39829}I just wanted to get|me dick sucked, really.
{39830}{39896}That was always the first thing|on my mind.
{39897}{39972}I wasn't interested in talking|about politics after the show,
{39973}{40053}I didn't even know who the fucking|Prime Minister was at the time.
{40054}{40121}# Let's have a ride|on your bike #
{40122}{40187}I pretty much just wanted|to have a bunk-up,
{40188}{40252}Iike any good teenager does.
{40273}{40370}# I was born with a plastic|spoon in my mouth... #
{40577}{40656}# You didn't look me|in the eye #
{40657}{40745}# Crocodile tears|are what you cry #
{40844}{40889}"Substitute" I liked...
{40890}{40969}but I only liked|certain phrases in it.
{40970}{41017}So I'd twist them about.
{41017}{41095}# You're so fat,|I see right through... #
{41133}{41236}"Oh, no you can't do that,|it's a classic,"
{41237}{41278}says Glen.
{41359}{41400}Fuck off!
{41562}{41627}I think when we started|writing our own stuff...
{41628}{41690}is when it got|more interesting.
{41713}{41807}Because that's when it became|our own musical force.
{41862}{41944}Glen was coming up with most|of the ideas for songs,
{41945}{41996}and John would just be|sitting in the corner,
{41997}{42042}scribbling his lyrics out,|there and then,
{42043}{42078}while we were playing along|to it.
{42079}{42128}We had something,|we had a spirit.
{42129}{42185}But what we didn't have,|we didn't have a way
{42186}{42236}of putting that into words...
{42237}{42276}which is what John had.
{42277}{42381}The first line I wrote,|was "l am an antichrist,"
{42382}{42480}and I couldn't think of a damn|thing that rhymed with it,
{42481}{42572}and "anarchist" just fitted|really nicely.
{42591}{42643}The only thing I didn't like|about "Anarchy"
{42644}{42692}was the dreadful rhyme --
{42693}{42767}"antichrist -- anarchist,"|it used to always make me wince.
{42829}{42901}Oh, some decent fucking music|at last!
{43035}{43082}# Right... #
{43083}{43128}# Now #
{43258}{43341}# I am an antichrist #
{43342}{43428}# I am an anarchist #
{43429}{43518}# Don't know what I want,|but I know how to get it #
{43519}{43602}# I wanna destroy passerby #
{43603}{43680}# 'Cause l... #
{43681}{43746}# Wanna be... #
{43776}{43814}# Anarchy #
{43815}{43864}This band wasn't about|making people happy,
{43865}{43910}it was attack --
{43911}{43961}attack, attack, attack.
{43976}{44053}# Anarchy for the UK #
{44054}{44147}# It's coming sometime|maybe #
{44148}{44236}# I give a wrong time,|stop a traffic line #
{44237}{44323}# Your future dream|is a shopping scheme #
{44324}{44394}# 'Cause l... #
{44395}{44454}# I wanna be... #
{44489}{44556}# Anarchy #
{44748}{44836}Sid, he was the total|Pistols fan, really.
{44837}{44896}I fucking loved that band.
{44897}{44955}Along with a couple|of other kids that knew John,
{44956}{45046}I think I was about the biggest|fan they ever had.
{45169}{45263}# How many ways to get|what you want #
{45264}{45342}# I use the best|I use the rest... #
{45343}{45408}Rotten was like, incredible.
{45409}{45469}Just like unbelievable.
{45469}{45543}And Steve was fucking great|as well.
{45544}{45603}Glen was a cunt, as always.
{45604}{45688}# Wanna be... #
{45689}{45746}# Anarchy #
{45747}{45823}What made the Sex Pistols|different was John Rotten,
{45824}{45893}'cause he was a total|anti-star.
{45893}{45957}He didn't like wiggle his bum|or shake his hips,
{45958}{46036}he did robot dances,|and just fucked around,
{46037}{46087}and took the piss|out of everybody
{46088}{46158}in a real nasty, snidy way.
{46253}{46338}# ls this the MPLA #
{46339}{46435}# Or is this the UDA #
{46436}{46521}# Or is this the IRA #
{46522}{46614}# I thought it was the UK... #
{46689}{46773}The Bromley Contingent|all the front row lot,
{46774}{46828}they all ended up in bands,
{46829}{46913}hence you got|the punk movement.
{47038}{47117}# I am an antichrist #
{47118}{47192}# I am an anarchist #
{47193}{47269}To see us playing like,|just three chords
{47270}{47335}gave the message that anybody|could do this.
{47336}{47391}Which was great --|all these other bands started --
{47392}{47450}I enjoyed watching the Clash,|I enjoyed the Damned.
{47451}{47521}Itjust happened so quick,|and it was so exciting,
{47521}{47614}you'd think, "Wow, there's|really a movement starting here."
{47737}{47785}One chick came down|one night
{47785}{47867}wearing a polka dot|see-through mac --
{47868}{47920}and nothing else.
{47921}{48024}I actually saw one tourist|stagger as she came into the club.
{48025}{48086}He was so amazed|by her appearance.
{48187}{48239}Sid was amazing,|because he was
{48240}{48296}a stand out character|in the crowd,
{48297}{48334}because he wasn't|in the band then.
{48335}{48379}He invented the pogo|all by himself.
{48380}{48439}He'd just sort ofjump on|the shoulders of some people
{48440}{48480}to get a better look.
{48481}{48545}In the end he just started|jumping up and down anyway.
{48546}{48620}Yeah, I started it 'cause|I hated the Bromley Contingent,
{48621}{48670}and I invented a dance|that would involve
{48671}{48760}being able to knock them|all over the fucking "1 00 Club,"
{48761}{48824}so I just used to|throw myself about.
{48825}{48889}Leap up like horizontal,|and sideways,
{48890}{48932}just like boing...
{48933}{48977}Boing, boing, boing.
{48978}{49057}You'd like land on them,|and smash them into the floor.
{49081}{49119}Yeah...
{49120}{49171}My name is Nick Kent.
{49172}{49220}I'm a...
{49221}{49305}A once-renowned journalist|for "The New Musical Express."
{49306}{49362}Well, Sid,|as he was known then,
{49363}{49463}who I'd encountered once before,|I'd not actually met him --
{49464}{49533}was obviously under|the influence
{49533}{49592}of some sort of amphetamines
{49593}{49697}or extreme adrenaline|propulsing stimulants.
{49698}{49758}Sid Vicious was looking|for a fight.
{49759}{49818}Just fucking watch out, pal,|all right?
{49819}{49903}Or otherwise I'll fucking|slice you open.
{49904}{49968}He hit me over the head|a few times with a chain,
{49969}{50026}which didn't require|any stitches, fortunately.
{50027}{50092}I sort of wandered upstairs|in a complete...
{50093}{50177}Iather of blood|and confusion.
{50178}{50284}I truly admire|their attitude,
{50285}{50360}I thought it was...|very brave.
{50361}{50451}Immediately before this attack|occurred,
{50452}{50539}John Rotten was deep|in discussion with Sid.
{50540}{50659}I figure that John was --|"Johnny" -- as he's known,
{50660}{50728}was setting me up,|'cause this is all true.
{50729}{50800}In fact, Sid got the name|"Vicious" from that fight.
{50801}{50882}John Rotten christened him|"Vicious" from that fight.
{50883}{50949}Said he, falling|against the door.
{50950}{51034}Sid Vicious got the name|after my pet hamster,
{51035}{51094}that bit him one day...
{51095}{51156}when he was trying|to be sweet to it.
{51157}{51254}And its name was Sid,|and he really liked that.
{51279}{51344}"Your Sid was vicious."
{51345}{51425}The group were doing a very|private, I think, secret show,
{51426}{51479}at "The Screen on the Green,"|lslington.
{51509}{51580}I went along with a couple|of our A&R people,
{51581}{51629}and Chris Wright,|the chairman.
{51653}{51723}Knocked on the door, somebody opened|the door, and said, "Fuck off!"
{51785}{51827}Well we weren't gonna be|dissuaded,
{51828}{51909}so we sort of tapped on the door|again and said, "We're invited."
{51910}{51967}And a head popped 'round again,|and said, "Fuck Off!"
{52027}{52074}They were a particularly|ugly band.
{52075}{52158}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{52198}{52244}# We're vacant #
{52245}{52331}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{52371}{52409}# Vacant #
{52410}{52488}# Don't ask us to attend|'cause we're not all there #
{52489}{52557}# Don't pretend,|'cause I don't care #
{52558}{52629}And there was only a little bit|of a scuffle, nothing much.
{52787}{52839}I've known musicians|to defend themselves
{52840}{52893}if the thing goes|onto the stage,
{52894}{52944}But I've never seen musicians|drop their instruments
{52945}{53007}And sort of dive in|at a small scrap
{53008}{53068}And extend it,|and forget about the music.
{53069}{53119}And I found that a bit much.
{53204}{53271}I went back two or three times|after that,
{53272}{53324}just to make sure that...|you know, they were as bad
{53325}{53368}as I thought they were|the first time.
{53422}{53489}# ...and we don't care! #
{53529}{53575}Ever!
{53576}{53668}Why all the infamous|language?
{53669}{53721}"lnfamous language"?|You're joking.
{53722}{53796}I speak nothing but the fucking|English language.
{53797}{53890}And if that's "lnfamous,"|Then, huh-huh-huh, tough titters.
{53903}{53973}Basically, the Pistols'|attitude to the press
{53973}{54030}was one of completely|like "Fuck you," you know?
{54031}{54099}I mean, just absolutely|"Fuck you."
{54100}{54188}Which was great -- I mean,|it was the perfect antidote
{54189}{54301}to all the 99% of other|stupid rock groups
{54302}{54367}who like, licked the arse|of the press,
{54368}{54434}and, I mean, it worked|perfectly for them.
{54435}{54487}Mostjournalists|are masochists.
{54488}{54543}They're just toss pots,|most of them.
{54544}{54635}Don't accept the old order.|Get rid of it.
{54745}{54807}We've been there|for five years or more,
{54808}{54884}just waiting for this to happen,|and now it's happened.
{54885}{54944}It had to, it was the only thing|that could happen.
{54945}{54997}It was the only thing that|didn't come from the industry --
{54998}{55082}it came from the kids themselves.|Something had to come from the kids.
{55217}{55271}# Come on and join us #
{55272}{55330}# We're the young nation #
{55331}{55390}# Come on and join us #
{55391}{55444}# Nationwide... #
{55565}{55604}# Right... #
{55605}{55650}# Now #
{55790}{55871}# I am an antichrist #
{55872}{55958}# I am an anarchist... #
{55959}{56021}This group are leaders|of a whole new teenage cult
{56022}{56076}that seems to be on the way|to being as big
{56077}{56124}as mods and rockers were|in the '60s.
{56125}{56210}The cult is called "punk,"|the music, "punk rock."
{56211}{56307}Basic rock music --|raw, outrageous and crude,
{56308}{56372}Iike their fan magazine,|"Sniffing Glue."
{56373}{56420}I think our music|is very honest.
{56421}{56531}It's the most honest thing that's|been happening in the last 1 5 years.
{56532}{56563}Nothing to beat it.
{56564}{56633}Finding places to play|is becoming harder,
{56634}{56717}thanks to the reputation punks|are getting as troublemakers,
{56718}{56796}and the Sex Pistols themselves|even had to hire a strip club
{56797}{56882}to get their music heard.|Nowhere else would take them.
{57013}{57049}# Anarchy #
{57050}{57079}From the street.
{57190}{57254}I find the Pistols|very believable,
{57255}{57334}I find it's all related|to violence...
{57335}{57390}in the mind,|not in the body.
{57476}{57530}Malcolm began to get|a little bit serious about it,
{57531}{57602}and he brought in a lawyer|by the name of Fisher...
{57603}{57711}That dreadful lawyer whose name|I refuse to speak --
{57712}{57751}There was...
{57752}{57822}basically an auction|between Polydor and EMl.
{57823}{57888}We came up with a contract|which gave the Pistols
{57889}{57968}total creative control.
{58001}{58054}Malcolm decided|to go with EMl.
{58167}{58215}I went into the A&R department,|I said,
{58216}{58257}"Who are these crazy guys?"
{58258}{58309}They said, "lt's the Sex Pistols,|we just signed them.
{58310}{58338}They're tremendous."
{58339}{58395}And my first actual plug|for them was, after all this,
{58396}{58464}was by phoning up|the "Today" program.
{58465}{58508}They phoned back,|said, "Yes...
{58509}{58580}We'd like to use|the Sex Pistols," you know,
{58581}{58650}"Will that be okay?" I said,|"l'm sure it'll be all right."
{58651}{58733}They slung us in the green room,|with a fridge,
{58734}{58775}and I remember downing
{58776}{58832}about fucking four bottles|of "Blue Nun,"
{58833}{58907}and I was fucking just --|having a good old time,
{58908}{58986}pissed at this point,|by the time we went out there.
{58987}{59029}And that's all I remember.
{59030}{59130}They are "punk rockers."|the new craze, they tell me.
{59131}{59167}They are heroes --
{59168}{59244}not the nice, clean,|Rolling Stones.
{59245}{59316}They are as drunk as I am.|They are clean by comparison,
{59317}{59393}they are a group|called "the Sex Pistols,"
{59394}{59475}I am told that that group...
{59476}{59555}have received £40,000|from a record company.
{59556}{59613}Doesn't that seem to be|slightly opposed
{59614}{59685}to their anti-materialistic|view of life?
{59686}{59736}- No, the more, the merrier.|- Really?
{59737}{59777}- Oh, yeah.|- Tell me more about it.
{59778}{59809}We've fucking spent it.
{59810}{59875}- I don't know. Have you?|- Yeah, it's all gone.
{59876}{59950}No one even heard that one,|'cause he was drunk himself,
{59951}{59996}and he wasn't paying attention|when he asked,
{59997}{60075}"What did you do with the money?"|and I said, "We fucking spent it."
{60076}{60136}- Tell me more about it.|- We've fucking spent it.
{60137}{60204}- I don't know. Have you?|- Yeah, it's all gone.
{60205}{60256}- Really?|- Down the boozer.
{60257}{60296}Really?|Good Lord!
{60297}{60343}Now, I want to know|one thing:
{60344}{60419}Beethoven, Mozart, Bach|and Brahms have all died...
{60420}{60496}- They're all heroes of ours.|- Really? What were you saying?
{60497}{60540}- They're wonderful people.|- Are they?
{60541}{60614}- Yes, they really turn us on.|- But they're dead.
{60615}{60671}Suppose they turn|other people on?
{60672}{60716}That's just|their tough shit.
{60717}{60800}Rotten, he slipped up and said|"shit" under his breath.
{60801}{60864}- It's what?|- Nothing, a rude word.
{60865}{60916}- Next question.|- No, no...
{60917}{60964}What was the rude word?
{60965}{61028}- Shit.|- Was it really? Good heavens.
{61029}{61098}- You frighten me to death.|- All right, so you play games...
{61099}{61174}He's like your dad,|ain't he, this geezer?
{61175}{61203}Or your granddad.
{61204}{61253}Are you worried, or are you just|enjoying yourself?
{61254}{61295}- Enjoying myself.|- Are you?
{61296}{61331}That's what I thought.
{61332}{61387}- I always wanted to meet you.|- Did you really?
{61388}{61458}Siouxsie, she was just being|coy with him,
{61459}{61505}And he said,|"Oh, maybe we'll meet after?"
{61506}{61556}We'll meet afterwards,|shall we?
{61557}{61642}You dirty sod.|You dirty old man.
{61643}{61697}Steve completely understood
{61698}{61759}that he was talking|to a drunk
{61760}{61817}as you would a drunk|in a pub,
{61818}{61872}and he just topped him.
{61938}{61985}Go on, you've got|another five seconds,
{61986}{62043}- say something outrageous.|- You dirty bastard.
{62044}{62091}I just remember|this fucking cunt
{62093}{62160}just started provoking us,|and we coated him off.
{62161}{62211}- Go on -- again.|- You dirty fucker.
{62212}{62280}- What a clever boy.|- What a fucking rotter.
{62281}{62362}That's it for tonight.|The other rocker, Eamonn,
{62363}{62423}and I'm saying nothing else about|him, will be back tomorrow.
{62425}{62478}I'll be seeing you soon.|I hope I'm not seeing you again.
{62479}{62513}From me, though,|goodnight.
{62513}{62569}McLaren was there.|He was terrified.
{62570}{62613}He was shitting himself.
{62614}{62664}He was death-white,|you know, going
{62665}{62722}"We'd fucking better|get out of here, quick!"
{62723}{62789}But the very next day,|it was all his big idea.
{62858}{62952}It was perfect stand-up comedy.|It was Arthur Askey.
{62977}{63054}# Well, I don't mind|the things that you say #
{63055}{63137}# I don't even mind|goin' out of my way #
{63137}{63221}# I try and do|these things for you #
{63222}{63312}# Why should I do it?|I'm always untrue #
{63401}{63473}That's all, a four letter word|done everything.
{63527}{63592}# Goin' outta my head #
{63630}{63670}I loved it...
{63671}{63769}I fucking loved it.|It was like finally, I've arrived.
{63770}{63840}Let the circus begin.
{63894}{63977}# The bog is no place|to see your face... #
{63978}{64024}The committee have decided,
{64025}{64080}that in fairness|to the public of Derby,
{64081}{64169}the Sex Pistols will not|perform here tonight,
{64170}{64248}but we are quite agreeable|that the three other groups
{64249}{64326}that have already been booked|will go on.
{64355}{64415}For the last 1 2 months,|punk rock has become
{64417}{64476}almost a battle cry|in British society.
{64477}{64542}For many people, it's a bigger|threat to our way of life
{64543}{64606}than Russian Communism|or hyper-inflation,
{64607}{64701}and it generates more popular|excitement than either of those.
{64701}{64761}We hope tonight,|by this protest
{64762}{64851}to make Wales know, and to let|the people of this town know,
{64852}{64941}that we do protest|and it is by no fault of ours,
{64942}{64997}that this thing|has come to Caerphilly.
{64998}{65070}When your local council|didn't ban the punk rock concert,
{65071}{65133}you actually went down there|and tried to stop it yourself?
{65134}{65185}No, we never went|to stop it at any time.
{65186}{65237}We went there with a very|positive Gospel message.
{65238}{65304}We have done everything|humanly possible
{65305}{65352}to ban this thing|and to stop it.
{65353}{65401}Sir, can I ask you why|you're here tonight?
{65402}{65497}Because I am...|recognized as a Christian.
{65498}{65585}If I thought one of mine was|in there, I'd go drag them out.
{65586}{65666}They're outside, freezing.|We're in here, we're all right.
{65745}{65800}This one's about|Harold Wilson --
{65801}{65864}It's called "Liar."
{65865}{65907}# You lie, lie, lie,|lie lie... #
{65908}{66038}# Sleep in heavenly peace #
{66039}{66098}# Should have realized... #
{66133}{66197}On the "Anarchy" tour|we was actually followed
{66198}{66264}everywhere across the country,|from gig to gig,
{66265}{66352}and we had to turn up|to show willingness to play,
{66353}{66402}so presumably we would get|the money,
{66403}{66467}although it looked pound to a penny|that they wasn't gonna let us play.
{66528}{66604}Mr. Stabler, you can't watch|punk concerts in Newcastle either?
{66605}{66688}The decision was made when|we discovered it was mere children
{66689}{66746}that would be watching|the performance.
{66747}{66827}The average adult will go see|a strip show, or a blue film.
{66828}{66918}Banned in this town, and being|banned in that town.
{66919}{66990}And it really wasn't|about us playing any more,
{66991}{67063}it was about this controversy|that we were like,
{67064}{67129}throwing up on stage,|and spitting.
{67161}{67220}And I remember going|across the Pennines,
{67221}{67282}being followed by a fleet|of press people,
{67283}{67355}and we went to stop|to get coffee and a sandwich,
{67357}{67412}and we could hear what these|press people were saying.
{67413}{67450}One press guy|said to the other,
{67451}{67486}"Did you get anything?"|and the other one said,
{67487}{67548}"l got two 'fucks' and a 'shit'|from Johnny Rotten."
{67549}{67622}Can I now turn to Bernard|Brook-Partridge in London...
{67623}{67714}Most of these groups would be|vastly improved by sudden death.
{67715}{67779}The worst, currently,|are the Sex Pistols.
{67780}{67838}They are the antithesis|of humankind...
{67863}{67911}And the whole world|would be vastly improved
{67912}{67958}by their total and utter|non-existence.
{67959}{68016}# You're a liar #
{68058}{68117}# Lie, lie, lie, lie... #
{68139}{68212}The day Johnny Rotten goes back on|the words he writes in his songs,
{68213}{68265}is the day he dies.|I know that for a fact.
{68266}{68324}I think people did feel|that this was...
{68325}{68374}this was a sort of|a downhill thing,
{68375}{68452}and was a monster in our|presence, and actually would,
{68453}{68531}cause problems of image|for the record industry.
{68556}{68615}At that point, someone at EMI|took the decision
{68616}{68684}that they no longer wished|to have the act on the label.
{68757}{68804}This is about EMl.
{68851}{68929}They're major labels|with major attitudes,
{68930}{69028}and they want everything to be|fake and easily manipulative.
{69029}{69105}And you can't be having that|with people like us.
{69106}{69191}- Let's call it chaos!|- Itjust doesn't happen.
{69192}{69272}# An unlimited supply #
{69273}{69336}# And there is no reason why #
{69337}{69393}They told us|that they were unable
{69394}{69447}to continue|to promote the act --
{69448}{69492}and would we kindly leave.
{69529}{69570}# E-M-l #
{69571}{69615}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69616}{69656}# E-M-l #
{69657}{69696}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69697}{69740}# E-M-l #
{69741}{69781}"Let's call it chaos!"
{69871}{69905}Ouch.
{69906}{69989}# ...With an unlimited|supply #
{69989}{70078}# That was the only reason #
{70079}{70169}# We all had to say goodbye #
{70170}{70260}# Unlimited supply --|E-M-l #
{70261}{70343}# There is no reason why --|E-M-l #
{70344}{70394}# Unlimited supply #
{70395}{70428}# E-M-l #
{70429}{70475}# Hello, EMI #
{70476}{70538}# Good -- bye! #
{70573}{70667}It started with John and Glen|falling out, really.
{70669}{70716}Over what,|I don't really know,
{70717}{70768}just a clash of personalities,|et cetera.
{70769}{70824}When you talk|like an arsehole...
{70825}{70897}and look like an arsehole,|you're an arsehole.
{70898}{70976}There was obviously a big|problem between me and John.
{70977}{71039}I felt that once John|got his face in the papers,
{71040}{71093}he'd become|a different person --
{71094}{71135}which I didn't|particularly like.
{71136}{71223}When we went to Holland, my last|gig with them was at the Paradiso.
{71224}{71282}I felt everybody|was on my case.
{71283}{71359}He was always complaining|that we were too outrageous,
{71360}{71436}and it's a funny thing,|but he was always washing himself.
{71437}{71485}Whenever we'd get|into a hotel,
{71486}{71560}he'd be washing his|fucking feet in the sink.
{71561}{71609}Me and Steve were like that,|I suppose,
{71610}{71657}and John always felt|on the outside.
{71658}{71720}He thought by bringing Sid in,|he would have someone there,
{71721}{71765}Iike a partner, you know?
{71766}{71808}Someone a bit closer to him.
{71852}{71891}I'd heard that they'd been|rehearsing with Sid.
{71892}{71944}Nobody had the courtesy|to tell me.
{72077}{72149}# I've seen you in the mirror|when the story began #
{72150}{72221}# And I fell in love with you|I love your mortal sin... #
{72222}{72276}It had become like|a cartoon strip band,
{72277}{72349}as opposed to a rock and roll|band that actually plays
{72350}{72389}and does something for real.
{72390}{72443}# I got no emotions|for anybody else #
{72444}{72510}# You better understand|I'm in love with myself #
{72525}{72601}Glen had reached a point|where he decided
{72602}{72688}that the band's direction|was absolutely alien
{72689}{72752}to anything he wanted|to be associated with.
{72753}{72794}That's absolute bollocks.
{72795}{72868}I think one of Malcolm's games|was, sort of divide and conquer.
{72869}{72921}Malcolm had told John|I'd said a lot of stuff
{72922}{72972}which I hadn't said,|and Malcolm had told me
{72973}{73036}John had said a lot|of stuff that he hadn't said.
{73062}{73128}I respect him.|I always did.
{73129}{73177}He taught them to play.
{73177}{73240}I kind of regretted|him leaving...
{73241}{73312}because Sid couldn't play|a fucking note.
{73313}{73388}# ...see his picture hanging|on your wall #
{73513}{73591}I feel guilty about Sid,
{73592}{73704}because I wish I could have|told him more...
{73705}{73759}about what to expect.
{73804}{73875}Well... I was getting|my own group together,
{73877}{73923}"The Flowers of Romance,"
{73924}{73986}and Rotten asked me|if I wanted to join the --
{73987}{74034}there was this big hoo-ha,|and Malcolm said,
{74035}{74092}"lt's all a big secret, man,"|you know...
{74093}{74159}"Come down to this pub|at such and such and that,"
{74160}{74217}and I thought they were|gonna do me over
{74218}{74298}'cause I didn't turn up to one|of Rotten's parties or something.
{74299}{74364}He gets touchy|over things like that.
{74365}{74423}And... I went down there|and he said,
{74424}{74468}"Do you wanna play bass|for the Sex Pistols?"
{74823}{74896}# Turn the page and it's|the scoop of the century #
{74897}{74981}# Don't wanna be I seven|I've had enough of this #
{74982}{75063}# This is brainwash|and this is a clue #
{75064}{75144}# To the stars|who fooled you #
{75177}{75217}Sid was my mate.
{75218}{75266}Very, very close mate.
{75267}{75312}He'd just --|Iaugh at everything.
{75338}{75422}Genius in that way,|and his name was John.
{75552}{75628}# I got you in the camera,|I got you in my camera #
{75629}{75713}# A second of your life|ruined for life #
{75714}{75782}We'd do lots of mad things|together, me and Sid.
{75783}{75836}We used to busk too,|for money...
{75861}{75917}Me with a violin,|Sid with a tambourine,
{75918}{76000}maybe a broken guitar,|doing Alice Cooper songs.
{76001}{76049}"l Love the Dead"|was our favorite.
{76050}{76098}That would get us|the most money.
{76099}{76153}"Just please shut up."
{76154}{76204}"Here -- take the money,|go somewhere else."
{76340}{76418}Why dost thou spit --|at me?
{76489}{76584}The best time of the band of all|was when Sid firstjoined,
{76585}{76669}and he was really determined|to learn the bass
{76670}{76708}and fit in and be part|of the band.
{76709}{76763}He definitely looked great,|Sid...
{76764}{76827}Yeah, he definitely was a face.|A real laugh.
{76828}{76884}He used to take the piss|out of Rotten.
{76885}{76936}All I did was cash in|on the fact
{76937}{77007}that I'm good-looking,|and I have a good figure,
{77008}{77055}and girls like me.
{77057}{77147}What do they want, a fucking|angel in flares and an anorak?
{77148}{77201}'Cause if they want that...
{77202}{77264}that ain't me, baby.
{77326}{77378}Found myself in this rather|curious little shop,
{77379}{77437}in the company of Johnny Rotten,|Sid Vicious,
{77438}{77503}and other assorted|Sex Pistols.
{77504}{77536}Hello, Mr. Nimmo.
{77703}{77755}And the last they heard,|a donkey had him cornered
{77756}{77794}up a back alley in Fulham.
{77870}{77938}After EMI dumped|the Sex Pistols,
{77939}{77984}A&M Records picked them up,
{77985}{78040}and staged a contract signing|ceremony
{78041}{78088}in front of Buckingham Palace.
{78089}{78159}Malcolm was honest|in one respect...
{78160}{78251}That he always said|he had no control over us.
{78252}{78291}And he didn't.
{78292}{78375}And a bloody good punch-up,|in a limo,
{78376}{78483}before a signing|was not really unusual.
{78509}{78563}It was a good fight, too.
{78564}{78612}"No, you're the biggest cunt,"
{78613}{78661}"No, you're the worst cunt,"
{78661}{78722}"No, you're the cunt,"|et cetera, et cetera.
{78723}{78792}There was only one cunt|I wanted to smack,
{78793}{78859}and that was Malcolm.|Then the door opened,
{78860}{78908}and then we had to do|the signing.
{78933}{78979}At this point,|the Sex Pistols,
{78980}{79056}despite having been fired,|were not exactly suffering.
{79057}{79108}Here they were,|signing a new contract
{79109}{79151}that could make them|a lot of money,
{79152}{79223}and they already had a song|to record for A&M
{79225}{79276}in honor of the Queen's|jubilee.
{79277}{79352}Sid's father|was a Grenadier guard.
{79353}{79450}Imagine that -- Sid signing|a very, very expensive contract,
{79451}{79550}while his old man's on guard|inside the fence.
{79551}{79605}It was genius.
{79653}{79735}According to the story,|after this happy signing ceremony,
{79737}{79816}everyone went back to|the A&M offices to celebrate.
{79845}{79913}The four Sex Pistols|apparently overcelebrated,
{79914}{79964}and lived up to|their public image
{79965}{80019}of thorough obnoxiousness.
{80020}{80052}- How are you doing?|- Get away.
{80053}{80096}When we got to A&M records,
{80097}{80150}total bedlam broke out there|as well.
{80151}{80193}I can't remember|what happened,
{80194}{80239}but the secretaries|were terrified,
{80240}{80291}and Sid's foot|was bleeding.
{80292}{80373}I had a black eye,|Malcolm was running around,
{80374}{80439}Steve was flirting|with all the secretaries,
{80440}{80511}and then we got in the car,|then went to the studio,
{80512}{80571}where we were recording "God Save|the Queen" with Chris Thomas,
{80572}{80648}and there's this school next door,|and all the kids come running out
{80649}{80706}'cause we were there.|And they called the police as well.
{80707}{80751}It was just total mad day.
{80752}{80800}The next day we woke up,|Malcolm said,
{80801}{80857}"Well, A&M have fired you."
{80898}{80952}The anti-establishment|Sex Pistols
{80953}{81002}called in|the establishment press
{81003}{81048}to protest|what had happened to them.
{81049}{81123}We feel that we're like|some contagious disease.
{81124}{81165}When you walk|in and out of a company,
{81166}{81215}and the guyjust gives you --|"Look... Take this money
{81217}{81263}and don't come back."
{81264}{81317}What are you supposed|to think about that?
{81318}{81351}Have you had the money?
{81352}{81416}Yes, they gave us the check|last night.
{81417}{81480}Makes it very clear|where their heads are at...
{81501}{81521}Nowhere.
{81522}{81596}We weren't the nice boys|they thought we were.
{81597}{81646}We aren't nice boys.
{81647}{81714}We were fucking|nasty little bastards.
{81756}{81793}And we still are.
{81821}{81857}Virgin Records signed them,
{81858}{81895}and Johnny Rotten|got to record
{81897}{81950}his Queen's jubilee|memorial song --
{81951}{81996}"God Save the Queen."
{82033}{82082}You don't write|"God Save the Queen"
{82083}{82148}because you hate|the English race.
{82149}{82221}You write a song like that|because you love them,
{82222}{82305}and you're fed up|with them being mistreated.
{82782}{82852}# God save the Queen #

{85272}{85318}# God saves #
{85521}{85583}I really don't think what he|was singing about was outrageous.
{85584}{85651}He's not saying "Let's kill her,"|or "Let's fuck her."
{85652}{85712}He was pointing out|what the truth was.
{85733}{85769}# God save the Queen #
{85807}{85855}# We mean it, man #
{85893}{85937}# There is no future #

{86992}{87044}# No future #
{87045}{87114}# No future for you #
{87292}{87356}It alienated|the entire country.
{87357}{87431}If they'd have hung us|at traitor's gate,
{87432}{87511}it would have been applauded|by 56 million.
{87605}{87686}You can't beat that, man.|That's National Gallery status.
{87731}{87790}It's raining silver|in "The Sun" this week.
{87825}{87870}"God Save the Queen"
{87871}{87948}was the alternative|national anthem.
{87989}{88044}What we offered to England...
{88045}{88072}was...
{88124}{88189}a pivotal point.|We were the maypole
{88190}{88243}that they danced around.
{88295}{88394}# Go away, I hate you,|hate you, hate you #
{88395}{88486}# Go away, I hate you,|far across the sea #
{88614}{88685}Where better to celebrate|the release of "God Save the Queen"
{88686}{88737}than down the Thames,|and start playing
{88738}{88769}outside the Houses|of Parliament?
{88770}{88862}"God Save the Queen," and|"Anarchy in the UK" on Jubilee Day.
{88923}{88978}I just wanted out|of the country --
{88979}{89029}and there was no way out.
{89103}{89160}Ever get the feeling|you've been trapped?
{89198}{89245}This is obscene,|the whole thing.
{89276}{89311}All of this,|it's bullshit.
{89347}{89407}Well, I've had enough|of your bullshit.
{89424}{89476}I'm too cold now.|I'm going back downstairs.
{89505}{89568}I loved it. I was getting|my 20 quid a week,
{89569}{89610}thinking everything|was great.
{89611}{89671}I didn't wanna fucking deal|with the business side of it,
{89672}{89713}I didn't really question it.
{89714}{89775}I was McLaren's friend|before the band,
{89777}{89838}so I trusted McLaren|like a friend.
{90202}{90280}# Too many problems|why am I here #
{90281}{90360}# Don't need to be me|'cause you're all too clear #
{90361}{90447}# I can see there's something|wrong with you #
{90448}{90521}# But what do you|expect me to do? #
{90522}{90605}# At least I gotta know|what I wanna be #
{90605}{90691}# Don't come to me|if you need pity #
{90692}{90776}# Are you lonely|you got no one #
{90777}{90858}# You get your body|in suspension #
{90859}{90916}# That's no problem #
{90944}{90998}# Problems #
{91028}{91136}# Problems|the problem is you #
{91137}{91199}The reason we're here|is because it's the Sex Pistols.
{91200}{91258}If it wasn't the Sex Pistols|there'd be no interest in this,
{91259}{91298}in this... boat tonight.
{91299}{91382}Look, we've got Richard Branson|looking like "Catweazel."
{91446}{91512}# They know a doctor|gonna take you away #
{91513}{91597}# They take you away|and throw away the key #
{91598}{91670}# They don't want you|and they don't want me #
{91671}{91749}# You got a problem... #
{91786}{91825}What happened to Malcolm?
{91869}{91938}# Problems, problems #
{91939}{92004}# Problems, problems #
{92005}{92050}# Problems, problems... #
{92177}{92241}# Problems... problems... #
{92328}{92380}# Problems... problems. #
{92453}{92525}We declared war on england...
{92526}{92603}without meaning to.
{92604}{92671}At eight, the Muppets'|"Halfway Down the Stairs,"
{92672}{92733}at seven, the Alessi Brothers|and "O, Lori,"
{92734}{92793}at number six,|Emerson, Lake and Palmer
{92794}{92841}and "Fanfare|for the Common Man,"
{92842}{92894}at five, The Electric Light|Orchestra, "Phone Line,"
{92895}{92944}four --|Stranglers and "Peaches,"
{92945}{92987}three --|Queen, "Lover Boy,"
{92988}{93046}and two,|Eagles, "Hotel California,"
{93047}{93107}the Sex Pistols' current record|"God Save the Queen"
{93108}{93160}is at number one|in the Capital Hit Line today.
{93161}{93237}But the IBA, which administers|the broadcasting act
{93238}{93310}has advised us that|particularly at this time,
{93311}{93368}this record is likely|to cause offense
{93369}{93411}to a number|of our listeners,
{93412}{93480}and have asked us not to play it|in our normal programming.
{93481}{93540}"God Save the Queen"|was never number one.
{93541}{93603}There was no number one|that week.
{93664}{93724}Whatever we were saying|and doing
{93725}{93815}really hit a nerve,|a raw nerve.
{93816}{93868}It was fucked up.
{93869}{93931}I still had to bunk|on the subways,
{93932}{93975}couldn't afford a cab,
{93976}{94069}and all of that the management|didn't want to deal with.
{94070}{94136}Completely|from there on in,
{94137}{94188}walking around|the streets of London
{94189}{94241}on my own,|was impossible.
{94242}{94313}I would be attacked|on sight.
{94328}{94414}You felt like a werewolf|being, like hounded.
{94477}{94558}Constantly in fear|of your life, really.
{94623}{94676}"God Save the Queen",|eh, John?
{94876}{94963}I got a machete blade|ripped down this leg,
{94964}{95047}and the blade stuck|in my kneecap...
{95049}{95102}and they couldn't|pull it out,
{95103}{95160}so I had to like,|walk off with that.
{95161}{95248}I got a stiletto blade|through my wrist here,
{95249}{95355}Iucky not to have had|one of my eyes gouged out,
{95357}{95421}'cause a bottle|was shoved in here.
{95422}{95456}Got to the hospital...
{95457}{95520}first thing they do|is call the police.
{95521}{95652}And I get arrested for|"suspicion of causing an affray."
{95653}{95722}And the telephone call|from the editor...
{95723}{95812}who would say, "Malcolm,|we'll print anything,
{95813}{95865}'cause you sell more papers
{95866}{95920}than we ever did|on Armistice Day."
{95927}{96005}It's 7:00 on Wednesday,|the 1 7th of August.
{96006}{96079}Elvis Presley, at one time|known to millions
{96080}{96120}as "The King|of Rock and Roll,"
{96121}{96178}has died suddenly|at the age of 42.
{96179}{96232}The king of rock and roll|died yesterday.
{96233}{96301}He was found face down|on a bathroom floor.
{96302}{96344}There had been|numerous reports
{96345}{96398}that Presley|was a heavy drug user.
{96399}{96440}All that time|when Malcolm was saying,
{96441}{96508}"We can't get gigs in the UK,"|we could have played abroad.
{96509}{96572}We could have fucking done that,|couldn't we, Julien?
{96573}{96671}Who needs the fucking UK?|It's a load offucking shit.
{96715}{96786}Got a lot of wax|in my ears today.
{96799}{96860}So we were left doing nothing.|I was just sitting there,
{96861}{96924}with -- Iike, we didn't even|fucking rehearse,
{96925}{96984}nobody wanted to fucking|rehearse or do anything.
{96985}{97068}So, like, you know --|it's a logical conclusion,
{97069}{97122}d'you know what I mean?|Boredom...
{97123}{97235}And, like, I'm that way inclined|so what do I turn to?
{97236}{97299}No, I couldn't take them off.
{97306}{97376}My nose is broken,|I'm keeping them on.
{97377}{97459}And she showed up with Sid,|and I was thinking,
{97461}{97552}"Who the fuck is this cunt?|This is an 'orrible person."
{97553}{97600}It was like,|the weirdest thing...
{97601}{97678}I'd never felt such|a negative energy from someone.
{97679}{97742}There was just a dark cloud...
{97743}{97809}Over this bird,|and I fucking hated her.
{97810}{97871}The first time|I came across Nancy,
{97873}{97930}I think Steve was shagging her|in the toilet.
{97931}{97988}I didn't like her.
{97989}{98064}Nancy was a hooker...
{98065}{98166}That was on the coattails|of the "New York Dolls."
{98208}{98289}And I actually introduced her|to Sid.
{98290}{98344}Shame on me.
{98379}{98460}In New York I was dancing|without any clothes on.
{98461}{98520}I used to go down to the guys|and dance in front of them,
{98521}{98566}and then get|tips off them,
{98567}{98610}and you'd do|a little hand job, you know,
{98611}{98671}for... ten bucks,|or they wanted to fuck.
{98705}{98752}I just -- you know...
{98781}{98843}did it, you know, I just --
{98844}{98885}there wasn't really|anything to it,
{98886}{98950}I just give good blowjobs.
{99011}{99067}"lt'll rip your balls off."
{99068}{99127}I read the first Sex Pistols|review,
{99128}{99187}which was shit, and I said,|"l gotta get over there."
{99189}{99256}I wanted to see|something exciting.
{99270}{99388}Nancy, as his heroin dealer/|girlfriend...
{99389}{99506}Was pumping him up with gear|every chance she could get.
{99507}{99567}He didn't like me|'cause I was ajunkie.
{99568}{99643}He tried to keep me and Sid|apart for months,
{99644}{99688}months, months.
{99689}{99760}Everyone knows when a bird|starts poking her nose
{99761}{99827}into a rock and roll band,|that it's suicidal.
{99828}{99886}'Cause that's when he really|started getting fucked up,
{99887}{99934}and not caring about playing.
{99935}{99977}And I didn't want|anything to do with her.
{99978}{100025}We did everything|to get rid of Nancy
{100026}{100078}that was physically|possible.
{100079}{100127}I even dangled her
{100129}{100206}out of a window one night,|by her ankles.
{100207}{100271}And the rest of the band|hated me...
{100272}{100328}'cause I was with|the New York Dolls --
{100329}{100379}Johnny and Jerry,|and they were junkies.
{100380}{100420}# Fix #
{100421}{100477}# My baby... #
{100621}{100677}They definitely brought|a lot of heroin around, too.
{100678}{100755}And I know Sid was totally into|Johnny Thunders.
{100756}{100806}I like the New York Dolls,
{100807}{100895}'cause they were nasty and mean,|and they wore makeup,
{100896}{100935}and they didn't|give a shit.
{100936}{100990}And they played|godawful rock and roll.
{100991}{101056}And they had good names,|and good hairdos.
{101057}{101113}It definitely had|a big effect on me.
{101114}{101160}I thought he was|the coolest thing ever --
{101161}{101202}Thunders, at that time.
{101203}{101251}I started stealing|some of his stances,
{101253}{101305}and his looks, and, you know,|his moves on stage.
{101306}{101367}I look back at it now,|and I'm embarrassed
{101369}{101428}at how much I fucking was trying|to copy him.
{101429}{101492}I didn't need to do that.|I had my own thing already.
{101493}{101556}My invention|to the Sex Pistols
{101557}{101600}was the hanky on the head.
{101622}{101696}It was kind offunny, actually,|when I used to see fans doing it,
{101697}{101757}I thought, "Oh, look, they're|doing something I invented."
{101758}{101807}Cunt, shit, bollocks.
{101808}{101854}Bill Grundy's a poof!
{101855}{101921}Because I've made my self-esteem|rise an inch.
{101955}{102032}Leatherjackets|came with the heroin.
{102033}{102132}Vampirish goth look|came with the heroin.
{102133}{102188}This ruined Sid...
{102189}{102246}Here, want one of these?
{102247}{102316}Because he was a complete|gullible fashion victim.
{102337}{102423}Sid went straight into the worst|kind of rock and roll idiot
{102424}{102484}you could ever hope to have|a nightmare about.
{102521}{102583}He didn't get that|what we were doing was --
{102584}{102641}Who wants|some safety pins?
{102642}{102694}Our culture,|our life.
{102741}{102779}Who else wants|something?
{102781}{102841}Come on if you want|something, you cunts!
{102894}{102982}Alls I can tell you is yes,|I can take on England,
{102983}{103055}but I couldn't take on|one heroin addict.
{103057}{103122}Oh, look, Sid.
{103202}{103270}At a time where we should have|been the tightest,
{103271}{103328}it couldn't be looser.
{103483}{103563}# There's no point in asking,|you'll get no reply #
{103564}{103647}# Oh, just remember|I don't decide #
{103649}{103725}# I got no reason,|it's all too much #
{103726}{103793}# You'll always find us #
{103842}{103892}# Out to lunch #
{103940}{104018}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty #
{104049}{104098}# We're vacant #
{104099}{104152}It's a pity in a way.|All these rich kids...
{104153}{104233}Becoming punks.|I find that revolting.
{104234}{104276}It's like an army now,
{104277}{104354}a faction -- chic.
{104355}{104402}I'm not chic.
{104403}{104462}I could never be chic.
{104463}{104515}I was in it|from its inception.
{104516}{104597}# There's no point in asking,|you'll get no reply #
{104598}{104683}# Just remember|I don't decide #
{104685}{104713}The punks ruined it...
{104714}{104820}They adopted a uniform image|in attitude,
{104821}{104915}and the whole thing|was about being yourself.
{104972}{105056}# We're so pretty,|oh, so pretty... #
{105057}{105127}# Ah... vacant #
{105142}{105232}The cliche punk look|which became the postcard punk
{105233}{105303}with a Mohican, and all black,|with spiky hair and all that.
{105304}{105350}It was never like that|to start with.
{105351}{105402}They didn't have|the money
{105403}{105449}to go out and buy|a 50 quid leatherjacket
{105450}{105520}it was very much a do-it-yourself|kind of thing, you know?
{105548}{105600}# ...and we don't care #
{105654}{105706}And all those garbage,|trashy bands --
{105707}{105768}basically all saying,|"Yeah, we're a punk band,"
{105769}{105881}wrecked it outright.|It became acceptable --
{105882}{105943}absorbed back into|the system.
{105944}{105993}The shitstem.
{106069}{106128}# We're pretty... #
{106136}{106174}# Pretty vacant #
{106175}{106197}I'm a punk!
{106198}{106262}# And we don't care! #
{106372}{106419}Mummy, mummy, come quick!
{106450}{106489}They've killed Bambi!
{106531}{106590}"Who killed Bambi"|was Malcolm's idea.
{106591}{106672}We were musicians.|We didn't want to make a film.
{106702}{106773}Malcolm was very good at|spending other people's money.
{106774}{106829}But there was a load|being put into the film
{106830}{106896}from the band's royalties,|which we didn't know about.
{106968}{107038}I rememberjust turning up|to do a scene...
{107039}{107092}there was this guy there, I thought,|"Oh, he looks familiar..."
{107093}{107156}Do you know the way|to Hindley Airfield, mate?
{107157}{107200}And I said,|"l know you from somewhere,"
{107201}{107241}and it was Sting.
{107242}{107314}It was his motion picture debut,|I believe.
{107315}{107379}So it's flying lessons|you're after, is it?
{107409}{107518}Well, you've come|to the right place, Sex Pistol.
{107519}{107570}Be advised,|drummer boy...
{107571}{107659}We're the sensational|new Blow Waves,
{107660}{107716}and we know how to sell|more records
{107717}{107768}than Malcolm McLaren.
{107769}{107820}And I knew|that it was just trash,
{107821}{107902}rubbishing|the whole point and purpose.
{107903}{107963}We believe|in rock and roll,
{107964}{108030}and we don't need you,|Sex Pistol.
{108031}{108079}The record companies know
{108080}{108125}that our music|means more to them
{108126}{108184}than your sick anarchy|ever did.
{108185}{108228}Get out of my car,|you cunts!
{108229}{108279}He used to really|get the hump, McLaren,
{108280}{108324}when we started asking|for money,
{108325}{108365}so I stopped asking for it.
{108366}{108426}We never had our own lawyer,|which is insanity.
{108427}{108511}That's the closest thing to being|in one of these boy bands --
{108513}{108568}is that they all get reamed,
{108569}{108643}and we were getting reamed|in that department.
{108644}{108718}How can you be a Sex Pistol|with no money?
{108719}{108801}You ring the office,|you get zero response,
{108802}{108875}your checks weren't paid,
{108876}{108980}no rent, no earnings,|a complete disaster.
{108981}{109088}It was wonderful.|"God Save the Queen"!
{109089}{109152}It was a monkey's tea party.
{109153}{109212}What the fuck|was the manager doing?
{109213}{109295}The one that claimed that|he was manipulating everything --
{109296}{109355}manipulated nothing.
{109356}{109416}He was clueless at that point.
{109417}{109473}Once we said,|"We're fucking leaving the group
{109474}{109556}unless you fucking get us some gigs,|you stupid little cunt,"
{109557}{109613}he got something together|the next day.
{109614}{109665}Well, he could have done that|all the time.
{109666}{109759}"Spots" was a good one --|Sex Pistols on tour.
{109760}{109822}But I thought it was dreadful|that we had to, like,
{109823}{109904}not be ourselves, and go|under secret monikers.
{109905}{109981}I'm a Sex Pistol,|and that's it.
{110122}{110186}And we just did these secret|gigs in the small clubs,
{110187}{110264}and it was just packed with fans|who'd never seen us.
{110265}{110306}And they were like|the best shows, man.
{110307}{110352}They were fucking great.
{110524}{110596}# A cheap holiday|in other people's misery #
{110747}{110821}# I don't want a holiday|in the sun #
{110822}{110899}# I wanna go|to the new Belsen #
{110900}{110974}# I wanna see some history #
{110975}{111046}# 'Cause now I got|a reasonable economy #
{111047}{111128}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{111129}{111209}# Now I got a reason,|and I'm still waiting #
{111210}{111284}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{111285}{111344}# To be waiting #
{111344}{111403}# The berlin wall #
{111594}{111697}I thought "Holidays in the Sun"|was our crowning glory.
{111761}{111843}# Sensurround sound|in a two-inch wall #
{111844}{111924}# I was waiting|for the communist call #
{111925}{112007}# I didn't ask for sunshine|and I got World War Ill #
{112008}{112097}# I'm looking over the wall|and they're looking at me #
{112098}{112164}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{112165}{112246}# Now I got a reason,|and I'm still waiting #
{112247}{112325}# Now I got a reason,|now I got a reason #
{112326}{112375}# To be waiting #
{112376}{112431}# The Berlin Wall #
{112749}{112824}Huddersfield, I remember|very fondly.
{112825}{112891}Two concerts, a matinee,
{112892}{112972}with children|throwing pies at me,
{112972}{113071}and later on that night,|striking union members.
{113072}{113131}It was heaven.
{113132}{113196}He wants dad back at work,
{113197}{113268}which I think|is a very good idea, indeed.
{113269}{113315}It was like|our Christmas party, really.
{113316}{113370}I remember everyone being|really relaxed that day.
{113371}{113423}Everyone was getting on|really well,
{113424}{113473}and everyone|was in such a great mood.
{113474}{113527}'Cause it was a benefit|for the kids
{113528}{113586}offiremen who were on strike|around that time,
{113587}{113638}and who'd been on strike|for a long time.
{113639}{113693}And I've written|to Santa Claus today,
{113694}{113746}and I have got you|a skateboard.
{113747}{113800}Lot of love in the house,
{113801}{113877}and Sid was great that day.
{113878}{113971}Everything about it|was just wonderful.
{114013}{114109}Okay, gang, this party|is given to you absolutely free
{114110}{114179}and at the expense|of the Sex Pistols,
{114180}{114225}so let's have a big cheer|for the Sex Pistols.
{114226}{114258}Come on, let's hear you!
{114673}{114743}# She was a girl|from Birmingham #
{114744}{114817}# She just had an abortion #
{114818}{114896}# She was a case|of insanity #
{114896}{114974}# Her name was pauline,|she lived in a tree #
{114975}{115046}# She was a no one|who killed her baby #
{115047}{115125}# She sent her letter|from the country #
{115126}{115191}# She was an animal #
{115192}{115265}# She was a bloody disgrace #
{115266}{115332}# Body #
{115332}{115391}# I'm not an animal #
{115425}{115494}# Body #
{115495}{115542}# I'm not an animal #
{115575}{115634}It's not a question|of an Ml5 blacklist,
{115635}{115701}there are certain groups|whom we do not regard with favor,
{115702}{115763}and whom I personally will do|everything I can
{115764}{115820}within the law to prevent|ever coming to London again.
{115821}{115892}# Fuck this and fuck that #
{115893}{115973}# Fuck it all|and fuck the fucking brat #
{115974}{116052}# She don't want a baby|who looks like that #
{116053}{116129}# I don't want a baby|who looks like that #
{116130}{116189}# Body #
{116190}{116239}# I'm not an animal #
{116284}{116355}# Body #
{116356}{116400}# An unborn kid #
{116436}{116479}# An animal #
{116509}{116560}# I'm not an animal #
{116590}{116639}# I'm not an animal,|an animal #
{116640}{116702}# I'm not an animal|I ain't no animal #
{116744}{116786}# I'm not a body #
{116822}{116888}# I'm not an animal,|an animal #
{116889}{116949}# I ain't no an animal|I'm not an animal #
{116950}{116993}# I'm not an animal... #
{116994}{117040}# Mommy! #
{117241}{117299}I think that was|our last gig in England.
{117332}{117379}- Who's this?|- Sex Pistols.
{117380}{117411}Sid Vicious?
{117412}{117444}Yes.
{117445}{117512}This is Rodney Bingenheimer|from "Rodney on the Roq" show.
{117512}{117587}Oh, hi, man.|No future.
{117588}{117654}Is Johnny Rotten there?
{117655}{117723}- Yeah.|- Hey, how are you doing?
{117724}{117769}I'm doing all right.
{117770}{117836}You'll be coming to America|soon, won't you?
{117837}{117895}Get work,|move to California.
{117896}{117964}- Come to California|- It's the best.
{117964}{118015}Oh, I don't know...
{118016}{118077}Can you get egg and chips?
{118078}{118138}You can do anything|you want here, man.
{118183}{118242}No one is repressed in L.A.
{118243}{118327}Oh, yes you are.|Mentally repressed, dear.
{118328}{118393}Right -- that's true.
{118461}{118521}This week on Don Kirshner's|Rock Concert...
{118522}{118565}The incredible Kansas...
{118566}{118628}Family Funk|from the Sylvers...
{118629}{118710}The outrageousness|of the Sex Pistols.
{118711}{118778}Some slick dealing|from Ricky Jay,
{118779}{118850}and funnyman|Robert Aguayo.
{118885}{118932}We had trouble|getting our visas
{118932}{118987}'cause we had criminal records,|all of us.
{118988}{119048}They strip-searched us|at the airport,
{119049}{119139}and thank god Sid was|the first one they strip-searched,
{119140}{119227}'Cause as soon as they've seen|his underwear...
{119228}{119279}That was it,|we were safe.
{119280}{119372}They had no wish to play
{119373}{119439}with the rest of our willies|after that point.
{119446}{119483}Across the globe
{119484}{119571}they achieved a notoriety|in 19 languages.
{119572}{119667}In the city, voted|"Young businessmen of the year"
{119668}{119711}by the lnvestors' Review.
{119712}{119778}On Fleet Street,|they sold more papers
{119779}{119824}than the Armistice.
{119825}{119883}They didn't care|about the music --
{119884}{119945}they were purely into chaos.
{119946}{119997}Security was tight|for the arrival
{119998}{120087}of the infamous punk rock group|known as the Sex Pistols,
{120088}{120152}that naughty bunch|of counter-culture radicals.
{120153}{120200}Warner records had warned
{120201}{120264}that the group might attack|members of the American Press,
{120265}{120310}but when Steve Jones,|Paul Cook,
{120311}{120372}Johnny Rotten,|and Sid Vicious arrived,
{120373}{120428}this is|what they had to say...
{120482}{120516}Nothing.
{120527}{120572}Well, coming to America...
{120573}{120634}was definitely|a strange experience.
{120635}{120706}Ow-ww! Fucking kick me|in the fucking balls?
{120707}{120747}We had, like,|these bodyguards...
{120748}{120787}With walkie-talkies,|and that...
{120788}{120866}Continually followed by,|like, FBI
{120867}{120946}and fucking CIA,|and 50 journalists.
{120947}{120994}It was kinda scary.
{120995}{121072}And here they are --|at least two of them --
{121072}{121119}in a hotel room in Atlanta,
{121120}{121185}waiting for the other two|to do a promised interview.
{121186}{121228}But they're in|a strange mood...
{121229}{121311}Flaky -- demanding they be paid|ten bucks
{121312}{121392}before they'll do any|"bleep-bleep" interview.
{121393}{121445}Denied that,|they stomp off.
{121446}{121500}"Bleep," they say.
{121528}{121601}When the four young men left,|their spit was on the carpet,
{121602}{121639}their butts on the floor.
{121640}{121701}The dregs of an afternoon's|beer and booze,
{121702}{121782}and a couple of empty boxes|of Clearasil.
{121783}{121878}They left the hotel|to go to a sex devices store,
{121879}{121959}and then to their first concert|in America.
{122068}{122161}We didn't come from America,|we didn't understand America,
{122162}{122220}so how the fuck|could they understand us?
{122220}{122280}Okay, all you cowboys.
{122281}{122319}You faggots!
{122320}{122432}And I said, "You fucking|motherfucking faggot cowboys."
{122432}{122512}They were throwing|a rain of bottles and beer cans,
{122513}{122571}and pigs' noses,|and fuck knows what.
{122572}{122619}Anarchy in...
{122620}{122676}I got a full can of beer|smashed right on my lip.
{122676}{122709}The U-S of A.
{122710}{122781}Fucking big fat lip|with blood dripping down it.
{122782}{122840}The gigs were|pretty frightening,
{122840}{122905}'cause of all the publicity|that had preceded us.
{122906}{122960}People were coming there|just to see this freak show.
{122961}{123014}They thought we were gonna be|sick on stage,
{123015}{123068}crap on stage,|beat each other up,
{123068}{123129}kill each other --|well, it was partly true.
{123155}{123216}# I am an antichrist #
{123217}{123296}# I am an anarchist... #
{123320}{123368}Then Sid started|beating himself,
{123369}{123474}cutting himself on stage,|and totally being out to lunch.
{123475}{123528}# l... #
{123529}{123594}# Wanna be #
{123595}{123655}Birds were better looking|in America, that's for sure.
{123656}{123700}I really enjoyed|that part of it,
{123700}{123733}and they knew|how to suck dick.
{123734}{123787}They learn at an early|age here.
{123815}{123876}Sid loved the Pistols --
{123877}{123924}as a fan...
{123925}{124017}but being on stage with us,|he couldn't cope.
{124018}{124064}He wasn't being himself|anymore,
{124064}{124113}he was trying to be|Johnny Rotten...
{124114}{124165}with the drugs.
{124166}{124239}And that showed, I think,|to my mind, very bad.
{124318}{124391}The fucking Texas patrolmen|took me...
{124393}{124448}and threw me out the door.
{124448}{124489}And they have the authority|'cause they have a badge,
{124490}{124533}and they have a fucking|billy club and a gun.
{124630}{124695}Malcolm, he liked the idea|of Sid being outrageous,
{124696}{124758}however much it|fucked things up for the band.
{124759}{124832}I think he encouraged him.|I remember Sid saying once...
{124833}{124892}"He could never be|outrageous enough."
{124892}{124939}And Malcolm's going,|"Yes, yes, I agree."
{124940}{124995}"You can go mad,|go all the way."
{125028}{125091}It says to me that I should do|what I wanna do, you know?
{125092}{125146}And just fuck everybody else.
{125147}{125202}Just fuck everybody else,|you know? Just fuck 'em.
{125276}{125322}They moved me,|they made me shake
{125323}{125367}more than I've ever|shook before,
{125368}{125421}and that's what...|what makes them the best.
{125536}{125576}I think I heard one time|that they...
{125577}{125608}urinated on the audience|one time.
{125608}{125649}Why, I don't know.|Itjust sounds goofy.
{125650}{125706}- Get outta here!|- What are they saying?
{125707}{125750}Get outta here!
{125751}{125814}It's better than homework.
{125815}{125866}Get the fuck outta here!
{125925}{125970}You faggot fucker!
{126043}{126136}Yeah, the guy fucking tried|to climb up on stage
{126136}{126182}and fucking attack me,
{126183}{126262}so I smashed his fucking brains|in with my guitar.
{126263}{126320}He knew that I meant|physical harm,
{126321}{126376}and I have to say|I was ugly about it.
{126377}{126440}But he came out and hit us|over the head with the bass.
{126441}{126484}They were great.
{126485}{126550}If I could only make out|the words, they'd be greater.
{126551}{126609}That was my first time|in America.
{126610}{126704}Sid would sit next to me,|and we'd look out the window,
{126705}{126807}and we'd stare|at that endless scenery,
{126808}{126874}and imagine John Wayne|and the indians.
{126875}{126958}You wouldn't sleep.|You wouldn't want to,
{126959}{127034}because it was|so first time.
{127247}{127360}Steve and paul flew|around America with Malcolm.
{127360}{127410}Steven,|what kind of badge you got?
{127411}{127459}I don't know.|Safety department.
{127460}{127504}Safety department.|That's very good.
{127505}{127552}Say goodbye.|Say goodbye.
{127553}{127608}They didn't want to be|on the tour bus,
{127609}{127729}'cause they were "really bored|with that reggae, man."
{127757}{127815}Steve and Paul|are a pair of sheep.
{127845}{127907}They do what Malcolm says.
{127908}{127963}Sid was just|looking for smack,
{127964}{128032}and being an idiot.|Rotten got into his ego...
{128033}{128107}itjust got really depressing,|really quick.
{128108}{128176}But the point is,|Sid's my mate,
{128177}{128239}and I don't want him|to be ajunkie.
{128240}{128295}This is why we traveled|on the bus,
{128296}{128361}this is why Sid was to stick|with me,
{128362}{128404}and like, the others|just didn't understand.
{128405}{128481}They thought,|"Oh, you can handle it, man."
{128482}{128534}But, like, dope sickness|isn't like that.
{128535}{128588}It's not something|that you can just blow away.
{128589}{128658}It's the worst sickness|you could ever imagine.
{128659}{128743}He was far too young|for that shit,
{128744}{128828}and un-american|for that shit.
{128829}{128914}I can drink,|and I can drink a druggie
{128915}{128964}out of being a druggie.
{128965}{129036}And I will do that|for my friends,
{129037}{129105}every time, any time.
{129106}{129173}You can't get comfortable,|and you sweat...
{129174}{129250}and you're boiling hot|and you pour with sweat.
{129251}{129305}And your nose dribbles and...
{129306}{129360}and all of a sudden|you get the colds,
{129360}{129412}and the sweat turns|to fucking ice on you,
{129413}{129461}and you put ajumper on.
{129462}{129511}Then you're boiling hot again,|and you take it off, and, like,
{129512}{129581}you get cold again and, like,|you just can't win.
{129582}{129640}And you lie down,|and that's not comfortable,
{129640}{129692}you sit up, that's not comfortable.|It drives you insane.
{129693}{129748}I despise Sid for it,
{129748}{129860}and I'll despise anyone|for messing with it ever since.
{129861}{130012}It is the only drug that really|cancels out all creativity.
{130013}{130072}It is about self-pity.
{130072}{130180}It is the lowest,|worst form of life.
{130232}{130284}Well, he wasn't even playing|at the end.
{130285}{130335}You know, he could barely|play it anyway.
{130336}{130376}Half the time he wasn't even|plugged in.
{130376}{130416}It was like ajoke.|It was like...
{130417}{130457}"What the fuck|am I up here for?
{130458}{130542}What am I doing with this fucking,|like, kind of circus?"
{130543}{130584}I just didn't want|any part of it.
{130585}{130651}In the end, like,|I was the only one
{130652}{130694}who had any anarchy left in me.
{130695}{130751}The rest of the band,|they couldn't fucking take it.
{130752}{130853}And then we got to, like...|Like I said, San Francisco,
{130854}{130924}and Malcolm's in town,
{130924}{130968}and Sid goes off|with Malcolm,
{130968}{131051}suddenly Sid comes back|smacked up.
{131096}{131140}Winterland --|the final countdown.
{131141}{131214}It wasn't|a rock and roll party.
{131215}{131260}It was more|like a dying horse
{131261}{131322}that needed putting|out of its misery.
{131347}{131404}But Malcolm saw it more|as a media circus.
{131405}{131459}He didn't realize|what a great band we were.
{131460}{131520}This is KSAM|in San Francisco,
{131521}{131592}with the Sex Pistols,|live from Winterland.
{131628}{131708}Throughout the show, people|were hurling things at them.
{131708}{131774}From all over --|from above, from the sides,
{131775}{131823}from right down below --|and there were people
{131824}{131887}jumping up on stage|and being carried off.
{131888}{131927}The stage is...
{131928}{131972}Here they come.
{132026}{132116}It's not really impossible|in San Francisco
{132116}{132191}to have monitors that work.
{132192}{132225}...is it?
{132226}{132296}Is it impossible|to have a sound check?
{132297}{132335}No.
{132336}{132391}Here's the encore|of the Sex Pistols.
{132420}{132495}Malcolm would set it up|to look ridiculous.
{132496}{132536}We were all cheated --
{132537}{132621}audience...|and lead singer alike.
{132661}{132722}You'll get one number|and one number only,
{132723}{132770}'cause I'm a lazy bastard.
{132771}{132849}You have to understand,|they stayed in a very nice hotel.
{132850}{132894}This is "no fun."
{132895}{132989}Me and Sid were not allowed|in that very nice hotel.
{132990}{133090}We had to stay with|the road crew in a motel.
{133091}{133196}The sheer lack of respect...|for Malcolm --
{133196}{133256}and him not returning a call --
{133256}{133309}that was it for me.
{133395}{133448}It wasn't connived at all.
{133448}{133489}We got to our hotel|and booked in.
{133490}{133549}I wasn't aware that he didn't|get a room there.
{133550}{133603}So he ended up staying|somewhere else.
{133655}{133737}# No fun, my babe #
{133738}{133792}# No fun #
{133792}{133855}Malcolm was fucking|with me.
{133856}{133961}I had no credit card,|and no money, no ticket.
{133993}{134031}He was trying to wreck
{134032}{134112}the very thing that made|the Sex Pistols great,
{134113}{134174}and he managed to achieve it|that night.
{134175}{134247}# ...fun to be alone #
{134248}{134304}# ln love #
{134304}{134372}# With nobody else #
{134406}{134453}John came over,|and we tried to have
{134454}{134507}a "clear the air" talk,|and we said to him,
{134508}{134561}"l don't wanna carry on,|really much longer
{134562}{134627}the way this is going.|It's, like, just totally pointless.
{134628}{134672}Someone's gonna get killed,|you know?"
{134672}{134732}John said he thought|the problem was Malcolm,
{134732}{134795}and we should get rid|of Malcolm and carry on,
{134796}{134843}and try and work|it out that way.
{134844}{134921}# Fun to be alone #
{134922}{135009}# Walkin' by myself #
{135010}{135087}# Fun to be alone #
{135088}{135146}# ln love #
{135147}{135211}# With nobody else #
{135212}{135247}I didn't really|hang out with John.
{135248}{135315}He was always draining to me.|Took up a lot of energy.
{135316}{135410}Malcolm I got along with, so|I kinda went on to McLaren's side.
{135411}{135456}Another thing I regret.
{135457}{135516}# Maybe call somebody|on the telephone #
{135516}{135582}# Well come on,|my babe #
{135583}{135634}# Come on #
{135720}{135782}I'd have dropped Sid|in a second
{135783}{135841}at that particular point|for the band,
{135842}{135893}because I knew|he was fucking up.
{135894}{135928}# No fun... #
{135928}{135960}That's a load|of cobblers.
{135960}{136015}I was just playing bass,|and going crazy,
{136016}{136063}and leaping up and down.|And he thought I was trying
{136064}{136160}to take over his position|as the "New Johnny Rotten."
{136161}{136201}# No fun #
{136250}{136277}# No fun #
{136278}{136329}I don't wanna be ajunkie|for the rest of my life.
{136330}{136390}I don't wanna be|ajunkie at all.
{136502}{136572}I knew the second|Sid would smack himself up again
{136573}{136627}that was the end.
{136673}{136746}# No -- no fun #
{136747}{136800}# No fun #
{136800}{136881}# Alone -- no fun #
{136882}{136912}# By myself, it's no fun... #
{136912}{136963}I was the one who said|"l've had enough."
{136964}{136998}I couldn't|handle it any more.
{136999}{137071}I didn't want nothing to do|with Rotten and Vicious.
{137096}{137168}Oh, bollocks,|why should I carry on?
{137169}{137246}I regret saying|that I wanted out, and leaving.
{137247}{137300}I regret it,|I really do.
{137301}{137389}And I apologized to John|that I fucking bailed.
{137390}{137443}# No fun #
{137444}{137527}We might have continued|if we'd have got rid of Malcolm.
{137552}{137607}# No fun... #
{137608}{137655}But that's just|the way I felt.
{137656}{137722}And I couldn't get away|from my feelings at the time.
{137785}{137835}I knew it had to end.
{137836}{137884}I didn't think it would end...
{137885}{137977}with them being|total wanker cowards.
{138053}{138128}Steve and Paul|fannied out on me.
{138193}{138267}The last show was the worst show|I think we've ever played.
{138268}{138327}It was just like,|this ain't going nowhere.
{138328}{138405}This ain't going anywhere,|it's fucking over.
{138441}{138499}Cookie agreed,|and we just fucked off.
{138705}{138751}The night the group split up,
{138752}{138816}Vicious was pulled off a plane|at Kennedy Airport,
{138817}{138873}the victim of a drug overdose.
{138896}{138961}Despite all the hassles,|what was it that you thought
{138962}{139008}the Pistols were really|trying to do?
{139009}{139073}Was itjust like really kick|the establishment up the arse?
{139116}{139156}Sid?
{139157}{139256}Sid, he's not interviewing me.|Please try and wake up.
{139257}{139305}Ow-ww!
{139359}{139423}Sid, damn you!
{139468}{139512}Fuck.
{139587}{139647}Everybody was for Sid --|I mean, Sid was like...
{139648}{139701}I don't know if you saw|any of the gigs,
{139702}{139772}but Sid was like,|really shining out.
{139772}{139840}And John was being|like, nothing.
{139892}{139961}The only people... the only|two people that I can think of...
{139962}{140034}that I would like|to play with...
{140191}{140240}Sid...?
{140241}{140285}Oh, my God...
{140286}{140402}I feel nothing but grief,|sorrow and sadness for Sid.
{140403}{140447}To the point, like,
{140448}{140502}if I really like,|talk about it,
{140503}{140555}I just fucking burst out|in tears.
{140556}{140615}He was someone|I really cared for.
{140616}{140698}You see?|He's one of the Johns.
{140699}{140772}I care about every single one|of the Johns.
{140773}{140835}The gang of Johns|should have been the band.
{140836}{140908}- Wake up, Sid.|- Yeah, okay. I'm waking up.
{140909}{140950}Now what's|the next question?
{140951}{141012}I can't be more|honest than that.
{141013}{141077}Don't drop it|on me again.
{141671}{141748}Well, the room was...|very bloody.
{141748}{141816}There was blood on the sheets,|and blood on the mattress
{141816}{141882}there was tracks of blood|leading into the bathroom,
{141883}{141971}where the body of the female|was found lying under the sink.
{141972}{142028}She was stabbed|in the stomach.
{142184}{142241}The whole thing lasted|no more than three minutes,
{142242}{142299}and out they went.|Vicious made no attempt
{142300}{142356}to duck the cameras waiting|outside the courtroom,
{142357}{142434}but he refused to respond to any|of the reporters' questions,
{142435}{142494}and shoved persistent|microphones out of his path.
{142495}{142585}The grand jury will decide whether|or not to indict Vicious for murder.
{142586}{142676}If indicted, the case moves to the|Supreme Court for further action.
{142677}{142727}Vicious was ordered|to Ryker's lsland.
{142728}{142784}If convicted of the stabbing|death of Miss Spungen,
{142785}{142849}Vicious faces 1 5 years|to life in prison.
{142850}{142911}# No fun... #
{142912}{142984}Are you having fun|at the moment?
{142984}{143025}Are you kidding?
{143026}{143092}No, I'm not|having fun at all.
{143159}{143209}Where would you|like to be?
{143240}{143288}Under the ground.
{143321}{143362}Are you serious?
{143363}{143404}Oh, yeah.
{143714}{143778}I've lost my friend.
{143779}{143867}I couldn't have changed it.|I was too young.
{143868}{143929}God, I wish|I was smarter.
{143930}{144004}You can look back on it,|and go,
{144005}{144074}"l could have done|something."
{144075}{144149}He died,|for fuck's sake.
{144213}{144318}Theyjust turned it|into making money.
{144319}{144376}"Ha, ha, ha, ha..."
{144377}{144445}How hilarious for them.
{144446}{144490}Fucking cheek.
{144491}{144576}I'll hate them forever|for doing that.
{144708}{144814}You can't get more evil than that.|Can you, Julien? You know?
{144877}{144933}No respect.
{144934}{145001}Vicious... poor sod.
{145148}{145205}# No fun... #
{145236}{145285}# No fun! #
{145286}{145369}# No fun -- no fun #
{145370}{145430}# No fun... #
{145485}{145566}# No fun -- my babe #
{145567}{145620}# No fun #
{145663}{145744}# Fun to be alone #
{145744}{145829}# Walkin' by myself #
{145830}{145903}# Fun to be alone #
{145904}{145952}# ln love... #
{145976}{146059}And I said, "You fucking|motherfucking faggot cowboys,
{146060}{146128}you can throw any fucking thing|in the world at us,
{146128}{146177}and you won't get us|off this stage."
{146178}{146251}# Maybe goin' out|maybe stay at home #
{146252}{146322}# Maybe call somebody|on the telephone #
{146323}{146376}# Come on #
{146377}{146427}# No fun #
{146593}{146651}We gave it fucking 200 percent
{146652}{146706}for, like two years,|and that was it.
{146707}{146743}I think we run out|of steam.
{146744}{146794}You dirty fucker.
{146795}{146836}I loved being|a Sex Pistol.
{146837}{146894}I'll always be|a Sex Pistol.
{146895}{146945}But at least, you know,|when I die
{146946}{146994}at least I can say|I've done something.
{146995}{147036}# No fun... #
{147037}{147115}Press the self-destruct button,|and start again.
{147116}{147157}Which is what it|was all about.
{147247}{147288}# No fun... #
{147288}{147400}So creating something|called the Sex Pistols
{147401}{147480}was my painting,|my sculpture,
{147480}{147549}my little artful dodgers.
{147576}{147640}Are you still waffling,|Malcolm?

KNOW ANY ENGLISH,

HE DIDN'T REALLY

HE CAME HERE...

WOULD BE CLOSING FOR HIM
TO GO TO WASHINGTON
AND SEE ANGELA
BECAUSE THIS IS
WHAT HE CAME HERE FOR.
HE DIDN'T COME
OUT HERE TO WORK.
I MEAN, THAT'S PART OF IT.
BUT THE CLOSING

TO GET TO GO TO

THE BETTER SHE LIKED IT.

SHE WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE,
"I DON'T HAVE
ANY OPPORTUNITIES"
WHEN SHE HAD
NO IDEA WHAT OPPORTUNITY MEANT.

BUT SHE LIKED THE SOUNDS.

SHE HAD NO OPPORTUNITY.

AND THEY WERE GOING TO
SEND THE EIGHTH GRADE REPRESENTATIVE
TO THE "TAMPA TRIBUNE"

ALL WE DID WAS
TRY TO WIN.
OH YEAH. I WANTED
TO BEAT HER.
THEY WOULD BE LIKE,
"OH, NUPUR, WE'RE GONNA GO OUT THERE
AND WE'RE GONNA BEAT
YOU. WE'RE GONNA TRY SO, SO, SO HARD."
SHE HAD THIS
LITTLE TACTIC. SHE WOULD...
SHE ACTED
LIKE SHE WAS NOT NERVOUS.
AND THEN I REMEMBER,
ONE OF THE BOYS,
ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHO
HAD SEEMED VERY CONFIDENT,
HE GOT THE WORD
MONGREL, AND SUDDENLY HE BLANKED OUT.
I SPELLED IT
M-O-N-G-R-O-L.
I DON'T KNOW...
I GUESS I WAS JUST
PRETTY NERVOUS.
AND THEN IT WAS
THE THREE OF US,
TWO OF THOSE BOYS AND ME.
WE WENT ON FOR, I THINK,
11 OR 12 ROUNDS.
WELL, I GOT OUT
ON "STETHOSCOPE".
HE WAS A FAST SPELLER.
HE DIDN'T LIKE
DEFINITIONS.
SO HE STARTED
GOING, "S-T-H-T-..."
AND THEN ALL OF
A SUDDEN HE GOES...
AND THEN HE COVERS
HIS FACE WITH HIS HANDS
AND HE'S LIKE, "NO."
MY WORD WAS
"IRIDESCENT."
I, LIKE...
I THOUGHT IT
HAD TWO Rs.
WE ALL THOUGHT
IT HAD TWO Rs. YEAH. EVERY...
A LOT OF
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT HAD TWO Rs.
AND THEN THEY
STARTED LOOKING IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY,
SO WE WAITED UP THERE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.
AND I REMEMBER HIM
WRINGING HIS HANDS THE WHOLE TIME,
WONDERING, "OH MY GOSH.
AM I RIGHT? AM I RIGHT?"
HE WANTED TO WIN. HE
WANTED TO WIN VERY BADLY.
HE WAS WRONG.
SO THAT'S OUR
STORY. SHE BEAT US.
AND THAT WAS THE MOST
NERVE-WRACKING EXPERIENCE OF THIS ENTIRE...
OF ALL THESE
PRELIMINARY BEES.
Ms. Whitehurst:
SHE WAS VERY HAPPY,
AND HER MOTHER
WAS VERY HAPPY.
I WAS BOO-HOOING, SOBBING,
YOU KNOW, SO HARD
THAT THEY CAME OVER
TO ME AND SAID,
"YOU MUST BE HER MOTHER."

THEY ARE PART OF THIS COMMUNITY.
PEOPLE ACCEPT THEM
FOR WHO THEY ARE
AND CAN
LOOK BEYOND DIFFERENCES,
YOU KNOW, TO
FIND THINGS THAT ARE COMMON.
[ Shouts of excitement ]
Man:
WE'RE VERY COMMUNITY INVOLVED.
WE SAW ONE OF THE PEOPLE
FROM OUR COMMUNITY
BEING RECOGNIZED AS A
SPELLING BEE CHAMPION,
AND... SO WE RIGHT
AWAY PUT IT UP AND CONGRATULATED HER.
LAST YEAR, I WOULD SAY
THE ONLY BAD EXPERIENCE
I HAD THE ENTIRE BEE WAS GETTING OUT.
THIS YEAR I CAME BACK WITH
A LOT MORE DETERMINATION.
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD ALWAYS COME BACK NEXT YEAR."
AND SHE SAID, "OH,
I AM. I'M COMING BACK NEXT YEAR."
SHE SAID, "I KNOW WHAT
TO DO. I'M GONNA WORK."

YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

THEY JUST TALK ABOUT THE SAME THINGS.

HE TALKS ABOUT IS TRUCKS.
SO ANYTHING YOU SAY TO
HIM THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH AN ENGINE

RUNS, BESIDES REAL BASIC ENGLISH,
HE WON'T UNDERSTAND

BE IN JAIL.

SHORT OF BEING A GENIUS.

YEAH, I'VE NEVER BEEN

TO FIT IN."

NOT BE A LOT OF THEM,

WE BROUGHT THE

WE BROUGHT CLAUDIA

AND LAST YEAR I
WAS JUST, LIKE...
WHEN WE HAD TO
FILL OUT A FORM TO SAY WHO WE'RE GOING TO BRING,
I WAS LIKE,
"MOM, YOU FORGOT THE AU PAIR. YOU FORGOT MARIE,"
WHO WAS OUR
THEN AU PAIR. AND SHE'S LIKE,
"WELL, I DON'T
THINK WE'RE GOING TO BRING THE AU PAIR THIS YEAR."
AND I'M LIKE,
"WHY NOT?"
YOU KNOW? BUT
THEN WE WENT,
AND IT WAS LIKE
A FAMILY THING.
IT WAS LIKE A REAL
TIME TO BE WITH MY MOM AND MY DAD
AND... IT WAS NICE.
Mother:
YOU'RE GOING ON TRIPS, YOU'RE GOING TO PICNICS.
YOU'RE GOING
TO ICE CREAM SOCIALS.
AND I WAS VERY
IMPRESSED. AND WHEN...
ON THE FIRST...
BUS TRIP WE HAD
BEFORE THE ACTUAL
SPELLING BEE,
I SAT WITH A
MOTHER OF A GIRL
WHO WAS NOW
BACK FOR HER SECOND YEAR.
AND I VIVIDLY
REMEMBER SAYING HOW WONDERFUL THIS ALL SEEMED.
AND SHE HAD SAID,
"WELL I THINK IT'S A DIFFERENT FORM OF CHILD ABUSE,"
WHICH SORT OF
TOOK ME ABACK.
AND THEN THE NEXT DAY
EMILY IS, YOU KNOW,
OUT ON THE FIRST ROUND,
AND ALL THE EMOTIONS
THAT CAME
WITH THAT,
AND YOU SEE YOUR
CHILD WHO'S REALLY WORKED HARD
SEEMINGLY, YOU
KNOW, KNOCKED DOWN PRETTY HARD,
AND YOU START
TO THINK, "WELL MAYBE... "
AND IT'S LIKE,
YEAH, IT IS.
"MAYBE THIS
WOMAN IS RIGHT."

WE TALKED ABOUT WHETHER

IF I DIDN'T DO
AS WELL AS I DID LAST YEAR.
Suzanne:
MY DAUGHTER IS VERY CAPABLE AND TALENTED
AND I KNOW SHE
COULD DO WELL.
SO THERE'S A PART OF
ME THAT WANTS TO SEE HER STRIVE FOR THAT.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I KNEW
IT WOULD BE A STRESS
AND I REALLY FELT THAT
IT WAS HER DECISION.
I HEARD THE
WINNING WORD WAS SOMETHING THAT I HAD STUDIED,
I WOULD JUST BE
LIKE, "OH, THAT WAS DUMB," YOU KNOW.
DOESN'T MEAN YOU
WOULD'VE GOTTEN THAT WINNING WORD THOUGH.
[ Mumbling ]
Emily:
OBVIOUSLY I'D LIKE TO WIN.
EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE
TO WIN. I DON'T THINK THAT'S REALISTIC.
PEOPLE HAVE TOLD
ME I'M UP THERE
BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THE
FEW RETURNING SPELLERS,
YOU KNOW, THAT
PLACED HIGH.
I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH
FOR ANYTHING GREAT.
[ Ringing of bell ]
MY LIFE IS LIKE A MOVIE.
Interviewer:
HOW'S THAT?
BECAUSE I GO THROUGH
DIFFERENT TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS,
AND THEN I FINALLY
OVERCOME THEM,
YOU KNOW?
[ Giggling ]
IT'S HARD.
IT'S HARD.
WITH THE JOBS AND
EVERYTHING, AND...
ECONOMY BEING LIKE
IT IS, IT'S HARD.
AND THE HEALTHCARE
SITUATION...
IT'S HARD.
I DON'T REALLY
GO OUTSIDE MUCH
BECAUSE IT'S BORING TO ME
BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE ANY...
PEERS AROUND HERE,
AND IF I DO,
WELL, I DON'T...
I RARELY SEE THEM.
OUR PLAYGROUND'S
OVER THERE.
IT'S CALLED KIDS' VIEW.
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S
VERY FUN FOR THE BOYS
BECAUSE THEY
PLAY BASKETBALL.
IT'S LIKE,
WHEREVER YOU GO,
IF THERE'S A
BASKETBALL COURT,
THE BOYS ARE
ALWAYS ON THERE.
GIRLS JUST...
STAND AROUND
TALKING AND THINGS.
Woman:
PERMEABILITY:
USE, ESPECIALLY
OF A SUBSTANCE,
THAT ALLOWS
THE PASSAGE OF FLUIDS.
PERMEABILITY.
PER-ME-A-BILITY.
I LOOK AT ASHLEY...
THIS IS FUNNY...
LIKE A LITTLE ANGEL.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU
KNOW THIS PERFECT CHILD.
IT'S LIKE, OF THE FULL
PACKAGE ALL AROUND.
THINK ABOUT IT.
IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE "OASIS?"
MM-HMM.
Ms. Williams:
I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WON CITYWIDE
AND I SAID, "WHAT'S NEXT?
WHAT DOES SHE STUDY FROM?"
THEY SAID,
"THE DICTIONARY."
[ Chuckling ]
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
HERE. YOU
OPEN IT UP.
AND WHEREVER
YOU GO, THAT'S WHERE WE GOING TO START.
Ms. Williams:
WHERE DO YOU START WITH THE DICTIONARY?
"A", IN THE MIDDLE?
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
WHERE DO YOU START?
I HOPE THERE'LL BE
A BIG TURNOUT ON...
ON... WHAT DAY IS THAT?
DURING THE SPELLING BEE.
I DONE CALLED EVERYBODY.
I JUST HOPE THEY HAVE
ENOUGH SEATS FOR 'EM.
TWO OF HER
UNCLES ARE INCARCERATED, BUT...
THEY'LL WATCH IT ON TV.
THEY'LL BE THERE
WITH HER, REGARDLESS.
MM-HM.
WHAT I WOULD LIKE
FOR HER TO DO
IS WHEN SHE... I'LL
BE EXTREMELY HAPPY
WHEN SHE CROSSES THAT
STAGE AT 12th GRADE WITH HONOURS.
Ashley:
I'LL HAVE A JOB THAT PAYS WELL,
AND I WILL LOVE
MY PROFESSION.
AND I'LL HAVE
A HOUSE AND...
AND WHENEVER MY MOTHER OR
A FAMILY MEMBER NEEDS ME,
I'LL BE THERE FOR THEM.
Angela:
I MEAN, THEY FOCUS ON CHILDREN DOING CRIME
AND ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT NEGATIVE,
AND THEN THEY
HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S FROM THE DISTRICT,
THAT'S REPRESENTING
THE DISTRICT, AND THEY'RE NOT GIVING...
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GIVING ASHLEY HER PROPER...
YOU KNOW... HER PROPS.
PUT IT THAT WAY.
Ashley:
THEY TOLD ME I WOULD RECEIVE A CERTIFICATE
AND A BAG FULL OF GOODIES
BY THE SUPERINTENDENT
OF D.C. PUBLIC SCHOOLS
FOR WINNING THE
CITYWIDE SPELLING BEE.
THERE WAS A BOMB
THREAT IN THE BUILDING.
WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN... THERE WAS A BOMB THREAT?
BECAUSE SOMEBODY
CALLED AND TOLD THEM
THAT THEY WERE
GOING TO BOMB THE BUILDING.
Angela: [ Reading ]
"HINES STUDENT IS TOP SPELLER, ASHLEY WHITE."
THEY MADE AN ERROR.
11 YEARS OLD. SHE'S 13.
YOU SEE HOW
THIS STUFF IS GOING ON NOW,
AS FAR AS
PUBLICITY-WISE?
THEY'RE NOT
PUBLICIZING MY...
OR RECOGNIZING
MY DAUGHTER.
THEY'RE NOT
RECOGNIZING MY DAUGHTER.
BUT IT'S FINE.
IT'S OKAY.
'CAUSE SHE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.
ASHLEY, TELL THE TRUTH.
WHEN DID YOU GET
YOUR SPELLING...
YOUR SPELLING MATERIAL?
YOUR REAL
SPELLING MATERIAL?
MARCH SOMETHING...
MARCH WHAT?
YOUR CONTEST
WAS MARCH 24th.
IT WAS LIKE, EARLY IN
THE BEGINNING OF MARCH.
AND IF SHE WINS THIS,
PROVE ME WRONG,
BUT I KNOW SHE WON
THE RACE EVEN IF SHE LOST AT THE NATIONALS.
BUT I'M NOT THINKING...
PESSIMISTICALLY.
I'M THINKING
OPTIMISTICALLY.
MY BABY GONNA WIN.
AND THE WORD COMING UP
FOR YOU IS "PLAGUE."
PLAGUE.
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A
DEFINITION, PLEASE?
A DESTRUCTIVELY
NUMEROUS INFLUX
OR MULTIPLICATION
OF A NOXIOUS ANIMAL.
PLAGUE...
PLAGUE.
P-L-A-G-U-E.
I THINK, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, WE FOUND OUR CHAMPION.
Angela:
MAN, THAT WAS THE GLORIOUS DAY OF MY LIFE.
LORD HAVE MERCY.
MY BABY SPELL THAT RIGHT.
GO GIRL,
GO GIRL...
SEE? LOOK
AT HER.
SHE CAN'T
BELIEVE HERSELF.
THAT WAS THE HAPPIEST
MOMENT OF MY LIFE.
I FELT REALLY GOOD.
I THINK I PRAYED.
I PRAYED THAT NIGHT ALSO.
I'VE BEEN PRAYING...
I THINK I'M A
PRAYER WARRIOR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT
IT'S SOME REASON I JUST CAN'T STOP PRAYING.
Angela:
SO WHATEVER HAPPENS, I'LL BE HAPPY FOR HER.
AS LONG AS SHE
PLACE IN THE TOP 50.
BUT I WANT HER TO
WIN IN FIRST PLACE.
I WOULD LIKE FOR HER TO.
AS I GO HIGHER, MY
GOALS GO HIGHER ALSO.
AND SO, I JUST GOTTA
KEEP ON REACHING, KEEP ON REACHING.
SO THIS YEAR, I ROSE
ABOVE ALL OF MY PROBLEMS
AND I WENT STRAIGHT
THROUGH THE LOCAL,
STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE REGIONAL.
I WAS DETERMINED THAT
I WAS GOING TO WIN THE CITYWIDE SPELLING BEE.
I TOLD THE PHOTOGRAPHER.
HE WAS LIKE, "SO WHAT
ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN YOU GET TO CITYWIDE?"
I SAID, "I'M GONNA WIN."
AND SURE I DID.
I WON CITYWIDE
SPELLING BEE.
NOW I'M GOING
TO THE NATIONALS.
Man:
"HYBRID."
Boy:
H-Y-B-R-I-D.
"HYDROPHYTE."
H-Y-D-R-O-P-H-Y-T-E.
"HYGIENE."
H-Y-G-I-E-N-E.
"HYMENEAL."
H-Y-M-E-N-E-A-L.
I-D-E-N-T-I-F-Y.
"IDEOLOGY."
I-D-E-O-L-O-G-Y.
"IDIOSYNCRASY."
I-D-I-O-S-Y-N-C-R-A-S-Y.
EXCELLENT.
YOU'VE DONE 4,000
WORDS AND YOU GOT ONE MISTAKE.
YOU'RE DOING
GOOD NOW.
WE DID ALL
THE WORDS
THAT WERE EVER
GIVEN TO SPELLERS IN THE COMPETITION.
WE COLLECTED THE
DATA FROM ALL THE PREVIOUS SPELLING BEES
AND SAW WHY
PEOPLE WERE FAILING ON CERTAIN WORDS
AND TRIED TO
CORRECT THAT FOR OUR KIDS.
SO TO DERIVE A
COMPLETE NUMBER WOULD BE HARD,
BUT I CAN TELL
YOU THAT IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE COMPETITION,
WE'RE DOING
BETWEEN 7,000 TO 8,000 WORDS A DAY.
VERY GOOD.
"SACROSANCT."
S-A-C-R-O-S-A-N-C-T.
SACROSANCT MEANS
MOSTLY HOLY OR OVERLY SACRED.
"SARDION."
S-A-R-D-I-O-N.
WHAT WE DO IS, TO GET
THE MEANING OF THE WORD,
WE GET THE
LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN,
WE GET THE
ROOT WORD,
WE TELL THEM TO USE
IT IN A SENTENCE,
WE TELL THEM TO
RE-PRONOUNCE THE WORD,
WE UNDERSTAND THE
MEANING IN OUR HEAD.
SAY THE SPELLING
ALPHABETICALLY INSIDE YOUR OWN HEAD.
MATCH IT WITH THE
SOUND THAT YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT WITH
THAT YOU JUST PRONOUNCED,
RE-PRONOUNCE THE
WORD IN THE HEAD,
AND THEN SPELL THE
WORD OUT LOUD SLOWLY.
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.
THERE ARE 46
WORDS AND YOU MISSED 3 WORDS.
THAT'S NOT BAD.
AND WE STILL
HAVE 25 DAYS. YEAH.
SO, THANK GOD
FOR WHAT WE HAVE.
IT IS DEFINITELY A
BONDING EXPERIENCE.
WE WERE CLOSE,
BUT THIS WAS LIKE A CRISIS,
AND WE ALL HAD
TO PITCH IN TO HELP
WHICHEVER WAY WE COULD.
IF I COULD HELP HIM
PULL HIS CLOTHES OUT
AND MAKE SURE THAT
THEY'RE READY FOR HIM WHEN HE TAKES SHOWER
AND HE CAN SAVE
TWO MINUTES,
THAT ALSO WAS IMPORTANT.
Darshana:
WHEN YOU FIGHT IN A WAR,
EVERYBODY HAS
THE SAME GOAL.
Rajesh:
HE'S ONLY 12 YEARS OLD.
HE'S IN THE 8th GRADE.
SO HE COMES OFF THE
SPELLING BEE CYCLE
BECAUSE HE'S ACADEMICALLY
ADVANCED EARLY ON.
SO THIS IS HIS FIRST
AND LAST CHANCE.
Neil:
THIS IS MY TROPHY
FOR WINNING THE
ORANGE COUNTY SPELLING BEE.
AND FOR, LIKE, THE
REST OF THAT AFTERNOON,
I WAS SEEING, LIKE,
WHITE FLASHES AND STUFF.
I DON'T KNOW WHY. I
GUESS I WAS JUST, LIKE, TOO HAPPY OR SOMETHING.
AT THE
SPELLING BEE, I MEAN,
YOU'LL FIND A
LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT ARE
BOOKWORMS,
DO WEAR REALLY
THICK GLASSES.
YOU KNOW THE
STEREOTYPICAL,
QUIET, SHY,
STUDIOUS TYPES.
AND THEN YOU'LL
FIND PEOPLE LIKE MY BROTHER
WHO'S, LIKE, AN ATHLETE,
HAS, LIKE, ALMOST
A BLACK BELT IN TAE KWON DO.
HE HANGS OUT WITH
HIS FRIENDS, YOU KNOW.
WE GO... I MEAN, YEAH,
WE DO WATCH MOVIES.
WE WATCH TV.
WE HAVE A LIFE.
Darshana:
I DON'T THINK EVERY CHILD CAN EXCEL.
AND THE REASON
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN
IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE
A WAY OF CONCENTRATING
ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
I THINK IF
EVERYBODY MEDITATED,
THE COMPETITIONS
LIKE SPELLING BEES
WOULD BECOME VERY,
VERY DIFFICULT.
Rajesh:
WE ARE VERY BLESSED AND LUCKY TO HAVE KIDS LIKE NEIL,
AND TO BE BLESSED
WITH THIS ABUNDANCE.
I AM SO INDEBTED TO MY
SPIRITUAL MASTER AND TO GOD
AND TO THIS COUNTRY,
YOU KNOW, WHICH WILL ACCEPT A STRANGER COME IN
AND GIVE THEM THIS
OPPORTUNITY AND...
AMERICA IS JUST GREAT.
THIS IS OUR LITTLE HOUSE.
ME AND MY BROTHER BUILT
THIS HOUSE OURSELVES.
EVERY SINGLE THING
THAT YOU SEE HERE, WE HAD NO CONTRACTOR.
WE GOT THE SUB-CONTRACTORS
AND WE DID IT ALL.
GRANITE, MARBLE,
FIREPLACE...
STUCCO WORK,
SHEFFIELD DOORS,
BACKYARD, HYPO-ALLERGENIC
TREES ALL AROUND.
THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN
FAIL IN THIS COUNTRY.
THAT'S ONE GUARANTEE
IN THIS COUNTRY
THAT IF YOU WORK
HARD, YOU'LL MAKE IT.
AND THAT'S NOT EXISTENT
IN THE REST OF THE WORLD,
AT LEAST IN MANY
PARTS OF THE WORLD.
Rajesh:
I AM A FIRM BELIEVER OF HAVING THE BEST COACH
FOR THE PROBLEM
THAT YOU HAVE.
"DISSENT."
D-I-... OH, WAIT.
THERE'S TWO.
YEAH, THIS...
NOT COMING DOWN.
THIS IS TO
DISAGREE.
D-I-S-S-E-N-T.
UH-HUH.
WELL, I WORK WITH
NEIL MONDAY, TUESDAY,
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.
Hill:
WE WORKED ABOUT 3 TO 3 1/2 HOURS
AND I GET HOME ABOUT
WE DID THAT 4
NIGHTS A WEEK.
AND THEN SATURDAY, I
WOULD SOMETIMES COME UP
AND WORK ANYWHERE FROM
4 TO 8 HOURS WITH HIM.
I'M TUTORING
HIM IN FRENCH.
HE ISN'T TAKING
FRENCH AS A SUBJECT,
BUT I'M TUTORING HIM
IN THE FRENCH WORDS
THAT MAY COME UP IN THE
NATIONAL SPELLING BEE.
SAME THING
WE DID WITH A SPANISH TEACHER
WHO CAME AND
SHOWED THEM THE SPANISH WORDS
OR WHY TO BREAK
THEM DOWN.
AND THEN WE GOT
A GERMAN TEACHER TO COME IN
AND BREAK DOWN
THE GERMAN WORDS.
Rajesh:
NOW FORTUNATELY FOR BOTH OF THEM,
THEY'VE GOT EXCELLENT
LATIN TEACHERS AT SCHOOL.
BUT NEIL IS STUDYING
REALLY HARD.
I MEAN, HE'S... HE'S
STUDYING REALLY HARD.
O-H-M-M-A-T-E-R.
YOU'RE
WRONG, NEIL.
Rajesh:
THERE YOU GO.
OKAY, WE'RE DONE
WITH THE STATE BEE PREPARATION.
I THINK HE'S MORE SERIOUS
ABOUT IT THAN I WAS.
NO. YOU'RE
FORCING IT ON YOURSELF.
I WANT YOU TO
STEP BACK, TAKE A DEEP BREATH
AND USE YOUR
TECHNIQUE AGAIN.
RE-PRONOUNCE
THE WORD, PLEASE, FOR ME.
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SPELL? S-A-D-E-R.
GREAT, NEIL.
NOT MISSING A SINGLE WORD.
"SENILITY."
I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE
TO ADMIT IT IS HARD.
BUT WHAT IS... WHAT
IS VALUABLE IN LIFE
THAT IS EASY TO ACHIEVE?
NOTHING.
IT'S A ONCE IN A
LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.
AND... I MEAN, AFTER
YOU'VE STUDIED SO HARD,
IT WOULD... IT
WOULD JUST BE...
IT WOULD JUST FEEL GREAT
TO BE UP THERE AND WIN.
"EPITAPH."
E-P-I-T-A-P-H.

GOING, CHAMP. "DESCRIPTION."
D-E-S-C-R-...
HERE SHE IS,
WINNING A BEE IN...
THIS WAS SEVENTH GRADE.
AND BILLY, HER BROTHER,
LOOK WHAT HE PUT...
ANOTHER FACE ON IT.
HE MADE A LITTLE CARTOON FACE.
MY MOM AND DAD BOTH
LIKE TO PLAY WITH WORDS
AND MAKE FUNNY SAYINGS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
Mother:
"AIN'T MIS- BEE-HAVING."
AND I HAVE STATIONARY
THAT SAYS "BEE HAPPY."
B-E-E.
AND IT'S BUMBLEBEES
FLYING AROUND.
I THINK THAT'S WHERE MY
LOVE OF WORDS CAME FROM.
WELL, YOU'RE FULL OF
JABBERWOCKY TONIGHT,
AREN'T YOU?
I'VE GOT ANOTHER
WORD FOR IT.
[ Chuckles ]
THEY REMIND ME OF
EDITH AND ARCHIE BUNKER
BECAUSE ARCHIE'S
ALWAYS GETTING MAD AT EDITH FOR BEING DUMB.
[ Barking ]
AND THE COVER IS JUST...
HAS FALLEN OFF.
SHE WAS REALLY GLAD
TO GET THE NEW ONE
BECAUSE THIS ONE HAD
GOTTEN KIND OF BATTERED.
HOWEVER, WE'LL
NEVER THROW IT AWAY.
SMITHSONIAN MATERIAL.
I THINK I WORKED
PRETTY HARD AT...
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO HARD.
IN THE SUMMER, I
KIND OF WORKED...
AROUND EIGHT TO
NINE HOURS A DAY.
BUT... AS SCHOOL BEGAN,
I JUST WORKED ABOUT
FIVE OR SIX HOURS A DAY.
OUR LIVES HAVE
REVOLVED AROUND APRIL AND THE SPELLING BEE.
I MEAN, I
HARDLY COULD SEE MY FRIENDS.
THEY WOULD CALL
ME UP AND SAY,
YEAH.
"WHEN CAN WE GET TOGETHER FOR LUNCH, BREAKFAST,
WHATEVER YOU
CAN SQUEEZE IN?"
WELL, THE
SPELLING BEE'S COMING UP,
AND THIS
WAS JUST THE REGIONAL.
THIS IS THE
REGIONAL WORD LIST
AND SPONSOR
BEE GUIDE COLLECTION.
I ENDED UP GOING
THROUGH THIS BOOK THREE TIMES IN ALL.
AND I'VE PRETTY
MUCH MEMORIZED IT.
Gale:
SHE DIDN'T EVEN LIKE TO GO TO THE MALL.
YEAH.
IT BECAME WHERE THAT WAS ACTUALLY...
RIGHT.
A YOUNG GIRL THAT DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO THE MALL.
I MEAN, WITH
GIRLFRIENDS. RIGHT.
NOT WITH HER
PARENTS, WITH HER GIRLFRIENDS.
RIGHT.
"I CAN'T... I CAN'T GO.
THEY WANT ME TO
GO FRIDAY NIGHT
BUT I CAN'T
GO BECAUSE I GOTTA STUDY. I CAN'T..."
AND WE'D
SAY, "APRIL, LIGHTEN UP,"
YOU KNOW?
IN THE CLASSROOM,
IF THERE'S A BREAK,
RIGHT AWAY, OUT COME THE
CARDS AND THE NOTEBOOKS.
I'M ALSO THE
SOFTBALL COACH HERE, AND SHE WAS PART OF THE TEAM.
BUT ANY BREAK IN PLAY,
IF IT WAS STOPPED OR FOR WHATEVER REASON,
OUT CAME THE
SPELLING WORDS.
THE KIDS USED
TO TEASE HER. YEAH.
EVEN IN THE
BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR,
THEY WOULD SAY, "OH APRIL.
WHY DON'T YOU GET A LIFE?"
HOW COULD ANYBODY
WANT TO STUDY WORDS
AND NOT HAVE
ANOTHER INTEREST?
BESIDES SPELLING, I LIKE
TO RIDE ROLLER-COASTERS...
AND I'M A VEGETARIAN.
AND I LIKE TO DRINK COFFEE.
HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. LOOK.
I CAN'T EVEN
PRONOUNCE THESE WORDS.
IT'S... RATHER
SAD, BUT...
I KNOW SHE CAN.
IT'S JUST...
A WORLD OF...
OF KNOWLEDGE
HERE. I'M...
I WANT TO GO BACK TO
SCHOOL, TELL YOU THE TRUTH.
Al:
I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE BAR BUSINESS 45 YEARS.
YEAH, I WAS BORN
ACROSS THE TRACKS.
THAT WAS THE DEPRESSION
CENTRE BACK THERE.
THAT WAS ALL THE HOUSES
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WORKED IN THE ASBESTOS MILL.
AND THEN THEY FOUND
OUT THAT THE ASBESTOS STUFF WAS COMING UP,
SEEPING THROUGH
THE GROUND, SO THEY CLOSED IT ALL OFF NOW.
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
THIS TOWN HAVE ASBESTOSIS.
DIED FROM CANCER.
I DIDN'T GO FAR.
I WENT FROM THAT SIDE OF
THE STREET TO THIS SIDE OF THE STREET, REALLY.
NOT A REAL SUCCESS STORY.
I'D ALWAYS...
USED TO DREAM THAT I'D
GO DOWN ON AN EASY WORD
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I NEVER DREAMED
OF DOING WELL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
I PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS HAD
A PESSIMISTIC ATTITUDE.
Gale:
ONLY ONE NIGHT DID SHE SAY TO ME,
"MOM, I WOULD REALLY
WANT TO WIN THIS THING."
AND I SAID, "OH,
I KNOW, APRIL."
I DIDN'T WANT HER TO
GET DISAPPOINTED THOUGH,
OR HAVE TOO BIG A GOAL.
BUT I LOVED HEARING
THAT SHE WAS GIVING THAT THOUGHT
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
HER CONFIDENCE WAS A BIT SHAKY.
SO I WAS HAPPY TO
HEAR THAT THAT WAS IN THE BACK OF HER HEAD.
"I WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO WIN THIS BEE."
[ "Star-Spangled Banner"

Boy:
WAIT, I CAN'T... I'M GONNA START OVER.
OKAY. MOSHE AND IZZI
ARE WORKING IN A FACTORY,
AND MOSHE ASKS
IZZI, "WHAT TIME IS IT?"
AND HE SAYS, "IT'S
3:00 O'CLOCK."
AND LATER HE
ASKS HIM AGAIN,
"WHAT TIME IS IT?" AND
HE SAYS, "IT'S 3:30."
AND LATER HE
ASKS HIM AGAIN,
"WHAT TIME IS IT?" AND HE
SAYS, "IT'S 4:00 O'CLOCK."
AND LATER HE ASKS HIM
AGAIN, "WHAT TIME IS IT?"
AND HE SAYS, "IT'S 4:30."
THEN IZZI ASKS MOSHE,
"WHEN YOU GO HOME AT NIGHT AND IT'S DARK OUT,
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?"
AND HE SAYS, "OH, THAT'S
SIMPLE. I GET OUT MY HORN,
BLOW A LITTLE
TOOT-TOOT ON MY HORN
AND EVERYBODY... AND
EVERYBODY PULLS UP THEIR SHADES AND YELLS OUT,
"YOU IDIOT! WHAT ARE YOU
PLAYING YOUR HORN FOR?
IT'S 3:00 O'CLOCK
IN THE MORNING!"
I GUESS YOU COULD
CALL ME TALKATIVE.
NOT REALLY. I MEAN...
IF... I MEAN...
BUT, YEAH, SORT OF.
Interviewer:
WHAT'S THAT? THIS IS A DICTIONARY,
A BIG DICTIONARY.
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT'S IN MY ROOM.
Interviewer:
OKAY, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOT
ALL SORTS OF
PIECES OF PAPER IN THERE.
OH YEAH. UM...
WELL THAT WAS SO
MY MOM COULD FIND THE DEFINITIONS
OF THE WORDS
WE WERE STUDYING.
THIS THING ISN'T
EDIBLE, IS IT?
[ Goofy chuckle ]
IN FOURTH
GRADE, HARRY ENTERED...
THEY HAVE
IN GLEN ROCK A 4th/5th GRADE BEE
WHICH IS NOT RELATED TO THE
HOWARD SCRIPPS AT ALL.
AND HE WAS OUT... HE WAS
THE FIRST PERSON OUT.
THE VERY FIRST PERSON OUT.
HOW MANY HOURS
A DAY WOULD YOU SAY
YOU SPENT
STUDYING WITH YOUR MOM?
[ Mimicking whirring of mechanics ]
[ Imitating robot ]
MAYBE ONE-HALF, OR ONE,
OR MAYBE ONE-QUARTER.
I DON'T KNOW. I
REALLY DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY ONE-HALF.
THAT IS MY GUESS.
DOES THIS SOUND LIKE
A MUSICAL ROBOT?
Fay:
THIS YEAR, I SAW AN AD IN "THE RECORD" ABOUT THE BEE,
AND WE DIDN'T PRACTICE
FOR IT AT ALL BECAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE...
I FORGOT WHAT DAY IT WAS.
HARRY NEVER CAME
HOME WITH A PAPER.
ONE DAY, IT'S A FRIDAY.
I COME HOME FROM...
I USUALLY COME HOME
ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS HE DOES FROM...
FROM MY OFFICE. HE'S NOT
HOME. I WAIT AND WAIT.
IT'S, LIKE, 3:30.
HE'S NOT HOME.
I CALL UP THE SCHOOL.
CALL THE LIBRARY.
ALL THE PLACES I THINK
HE MIGHT BE AT THE SCHOOL.
FINALLY SOMEONE GETS
ON THE PHONE AND SAYS,
"OH, I HAVE SOME
GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
HARRY WON THE
SPELLING BEE." [ Chuckle ]
HARRY AND THIS
BOY, OSHGAY,
THEY WERE THE LAST
TWO IN THE LAST BEE,
AND THEY WENT FOR
A VERY LONG TIME.
THEY TOLD ME THEY'D NEVER
HAD A BEE GO THAT LONG.
WE WENT FOR QUITE
A WHILE BEFORE...
BEFORE HE FINALLY HE
MISSED "DISCOTHEQUE".
IN MY GENERATION,
EVERYBODY KNOWS "DISCOTHEQUE",
BUT IN THIS GENERATION
THE KIDS REALLY DON'T.
BUT WE HAD STUDIED
"DISCOTHEQUE",
AND HARRY KNEW AS SOON
AS... YOU COULD SEE IT.
HE'S THERE AND
HE'S LIKE...
HE JUST COULDN'T WAIT TO
GET UP THERE AND SPELL IT.
AND THAT WAS, OF COURSE,
ONE OF THE WORDS THAT STUCK IN MY HEAD,
FOR SOME REASON.
LOOK AT THIS.

THERE'S ONLY GOING TO BE
ONE CHILD AT THE VERY END

HIGH ABOVE THE HEAD.
I WOULD SPELL ALL THE

THEN ASK FOR THE

CAME RUNNING UP
BECAUSE HE SAID HE
WANTED TO TELL ME
THAT HE REALLY
ENJOYED HEARING OLD ENGLISH PRONOUNCED.

THE TOP 5, TOP 10.
IT REALLY DOESN'T
MATTER TO ME. IT'S...
I MEAN, SPELLING
IS SOMETHING THAT I LOVE TO DO.
HOW CAN YOU
COMPETE AND BE SCARED?
YOU'RE TRYING
TO WIN.
LYCANTHROPE:
L-Y-C-A-N-T-H-R-O-P-E.
LYCANTHROPE.

Woman:
THAT CONCLUDED ROUND ONE.

"MATTOCK."
MATTOCK...
CAN I HAVE THE
DEFINITION, PLEASE?
A MATTOCK
IS A TOOL...
April:
MY MOM TELLS ME THAT SOMETIMES,
I WOULD BE SAYING
WORDS IN MY SLEEP.
I WAS SO SCARED
AND NERVOUS
'CAUSE I REALLY WANTED
TO GET PAST THAT FIRST DAY.
WELL, IT'S MORE
INTENSE THAN ANY COMPETITION
BECAUSE IN
BASEBALL, YOUR KID GETS UP IN THE FIRST INNING;
HE STRIKES OUT.
HE GETS UP IN THE THIRD INNING.
THEN HE GETS UP
IN THE SIXTH INNING AND THE NINTH INNING.
THIS ONE,
ONE LETTER,
AND YOU'RE OUT.
MATTOCK:
M-A-T-T-O-C-K.
[ Applause ]
Earl:
TED'S... HE IS REALLY COMPETITIVE.
I DON'T KNOW IF
HE CAN MEMORIZE ALL THOSE WORDS OR NOT.
YEAH, HE
PLAYS TO WIN.
"DISTRACTIBLE."
DISTRACTABLE:
D-I-S-T-R-A-C-T-A-B-L-E.
DISTRACTABLE.

Cameron:
DISTRACTIBLE IS D-I-S-T-R-A-C-T-I-B-L-E.

Interviewer:
HOW YOU FEELING?
FINE.
JUST KIND OF ANNOYED.
I WAS SURPRISED
THAT...
THAT AN EASIER
WORD GOT HIM
AFTER PRACTICING
THOSE REAL LONG JAW-BREAKER WORDS.
I THINK
TED'S GOT THE ADVANTAGE
OF PARENTS THAT
THINK IT'S GREAT THAT HE'S HERE, IRREGARDLESS.
HE'S A CHAMP IN MY EYES.
I STILL THINK
HE SPELLED IT RIGHT.
"WHEEDLE."
"WHEEDLE."
WHEEDLE?
"WHEEDLE"
OR WHEEDLE.
Angela:
WHEEDLE...
WHEEDLE...
IF I WIN THE
NATIONAL SPELLING BEE,
OH MAN, I'D
BE... ECSTATIC.
I WOULD LIKE
FOR HER TO...
TO BE SATISFIED WITH
WHATEVER PLACE SHE GETS.
HOWEVER, FROM WHAT
I SAW YESTERDAY,
THERE ISN'T ANY REASON
WHY SHE CAN'T WIN.
COULD I PLEASE HAVE
THE LANGUAGE OF ORIGIN?
THE ORIGIN
OF THE WORD IN UNKNOWN.
WHEEDLE...
"WHEEDLE",
WHEEDLE.
WHEEDLE... WHEEDLE...
W-H-E-E-D-L-E.

THANK YOU.
[ Chuckle ]
THANK YOU, DR. CAMERON.
Woman:
THAT'S CONCLUDED ROUND TWO.
AT THIS TIME, WE
ARE GOING TO TAKE
OUR 15-MINUTE
MID-MORNING BREAK.
SPELLERS, YOU NEED
TO LEAVE YOUR PLACARDS ON YOUR CHAIRS,
AND WE WILL RESUME
SPELLING AT 10:20.
SO THIS TIME,
YOU JUST WANT TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT ROUND.
THIS TIME, I WANT
TO GET A WORD LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE PASIMOLOGY,
WHICH I KNOW
PASI MEANS SIGNS.
OR I WANT TO
GET A WORD THAT I'VE STUDIED,
LIKE SOMETHING
NAT'S NOTES THAT I ACTUALLY REMEMBER,
WHICH IS,
LIKE, 5%. RIGHT.
Woman:
WHAT'S REALLY SPECIAL ABOUT BEING AT THE BEE
IS WHEREAS IN NEW YORK,
WHERE WE COME FROM,
AMY IS CONSIDERED
KIND OF LIKE A GEEK,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
SHE'S INTO THE WORDS
AND SHE'S INTO
THE VOCABULARY,
AND THE KIDS LOOK AT HER
WHEN SHE USES THESE WORDS
THAT SHE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND...
THAT THEY DON'T
UNDERSTAND;
WHEN WE COME HERE,
IT'S SO REFRESHING
TO SEE ALL OF THESE BRIGHT
KIDS IN ONE ENVIRONMENT.
AND HERE SHE'S
ACCEPTED. HERE SHE'S ONE OF THE CROWD.
HERE SHE'S POPULAR.
EVERYBODY LOVES HER HERE.
NO, I'VE NOT HAD ANY LUNCH
OR DINNER OR BREAKFAST,
NOTHING, BECAUSE
I JUST CANNOT EAT.
NEIL'S PATERNAL
GRANDFATHER IN INDIA
HAS ACTUALLY
PAID 1,000 PEOPLE
TO BE CHANTING AND
PRAYING AROUND THE CLOCK FOR NEIL TO WIN.
AND SHOULD HE WIN,
I BELIEVE HE'S GOING
TO PAY TO FEED 5,000 PEOPLE IN INDIA.
SO THERE'S A LOT
MORE RESTING ON THIS
THAN JUST MAYBE
THE $10,000 PRIZE
AND ALL THE GLORY
HE'D GET HERE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF
HUNGRY PEOPLE IN INDIA
THAT COULD BE FED
IF NEIL WINS.

PLANKTON TYPICAL OF SMALL BODIES OF STILL, FRESH WATER.
H-E-L-I-O-P-L-A-N-K-T-O-N.
[ Chiming of bell ]
HELEOPLANKTON
IS H-E-L-E-O-

Cameron:

ME. I THOUGHT
IT WAS RIGHT!
I DID, I DID, I DID.
MAN...
HELEOPLANKTON,
I NEVER WOULD
HAVE GUESSED IT WAS H-E-L-E-O...
I KIND OF
FEEL RELIEVED
BECAUSE I DON'T
HAVE TO PREPARE FOR SPELLING BEES ANY MORE.
BUT I THINK
I WILL KIND OF MISS THIS.
Reporter:
...ALL THE TIME PREPARING,
IS IT PRETTY
DISAPPOINTING WHEN YOU'RE UP THERE?
OR WHAT
GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND? NOT REALLY.
I ALREADY FEEL
LIKE A CHAMPION JUST GETTING HERE.
I MEAN, I THINK
THAT'S ENOUGH
BECAUSE A
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN ACCOMPLISH THAT.

"COROLLARY."
COROLLARY?
MAY I HAVE THE
DEFINITION, PLEASE? A PROPOSITION...
Nupur:
LAST YEAR I GOT OUT IN THE THIRD ROUND,
AND I WAS ALREADY
NERVOUS BECAUSE...
THAT WAS KIND OF,
LIKE, MY JINX ROUND.
EVEN BEFORE THE BEE,
IT'S LIKE WE WERE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH LISTS,
WHICH WE DIDN'T DO
LAST YEAR AT ALL
BECAUSE I THOUGHT,
"SHE'S SO CLOSE THAT MAYBE THIS WORD
OR THE OTHER WORD WE
DO OR MAYBE..." YOU KNOW.
IT COULD BE JUST
ONE OF THOSE WORDS THAT WOULD HELP HER.
Nupur:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. MAYBE I BLANKED OUT,
MAYBE THE PRESSURE WAS
GETTING TO BE TOO MUCH.
BUT I ASKED WHETHER
IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE WORD COROLLA.
DOES IT HAVE TO DO
WITH, LIKE, A COROLLA?
WHAT'S A
COROLLA?
I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE THE CAR.
[ Laughter ]
I'M SORRY.
WE NEED A...
WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION IF YOU COULD...
EVERY TIME SHE WENT TO
PRONOUNCE THE WORD, I...
FOR SOME REASON,
I CLOSED MY EYES.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
I'M CLOSING MY EYES.
BUT I JUST DON'T
KNOW WHY I DID IT.
I GOT SO NERVOUS THAT...
I JUST KEPT... WHEN
SHE WALKED UP, WHOA.
IF I HAD BLOOD
PRESSURE, IT WOULD'VE ROCKETED HIGH SKY.
MAY I HAVE THE
DEFINITION AGAIN?
A PROPOSITION THAT FOLLOWS
UPON ONE JUST DEMONSTRATED
AND THAT REQUIRES
NO ADDITIONAL PROOF.
COROLLARY:

I THINK IF I GET OUT REALLY EARLY,
I'M GOING TO BE, LIKE,
A LITTLE BIT OF RELIEF,
KIND OF LIKE,
"OH, IT'S OVER. I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN.
I CAN BE A
NORMAL KID."
BUT MOSTLY,
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE,
"HOW COME
I DIDN'T DO AS WELL?"
YOU KNOW, I
DON'T WANT TO GO BACK HOME AND TELL KIDS,
"OH, I GOT OUT
IN THE FIRST ROUND AGAIN,"
OR, "I GOT OUT
IN THE SECOND ROUND THIS TIME."
K-O-O-K-A-B-U-R-R-A.

[ Applause ]
"ECCLESIASTICAL."
WOULD YOU GIVE ME THE
DEFINITION, PLEASE?
THIS IS AN
ADJECTIVE.
IT MEANS

EC-CLEVIASTIC?
ECCLEVIASTIC?
"ECCLESIASTICAL."
ECCLESIASTICAL?

AM I PRONOUNCING THE WORD CORRECTLY?

Angela:
OH, IS SHE CRYING?
YOU DID GOOD.
YOU'RE
FINISHED, OKAY?
THAT'S GREAT.
I'M PROUD.
THAT'S RIGHT.
SHE DID GOOD.
YOU DID
GOOD, BABY.
IT WASN'T YOUR
FAULT, HONEY.
YOU REMEMBER
THAT NOW,
BABY, YOU
CAME TO THE NATIONAL.
YOU CAME,
THAT'S WHY. YOU'RE STILL A WINNER.
Woman:
THAT MAKES A TOTAL OF 104 SPELLERS
THAT WILL BE COMING
BACK TO SPELL TOMORROW,
AND WE'LL SEE EVERYONE
BACK HERE IN THE MORNING
TO BEGIN PROMPTLY
SPELLING AT 8:00 O'CLOCK.
OH, I JUST DIE.
Interviewer: RELIEVED?
I JUST DIE.
I JUST DIE...
WELL... WAIT
FOR THE WORD.
AND I HEARD
"DISCLAIMANT."
I SAID, "OKAY."
I KNOW SHE COULD HANDLE THAT.
AND THE NEXT WORD
WAS KOOKABURRA.
I HAD NO CLUE
WHAT THIS WORD WAS.
AND SHE... SHE
SAW ME PAINED.
AND SHE... SHE
SMILED AT ME AND TOLD ME, "I KNOW THIS WORD."
OKAY. SUPPER.
YOU EAT NOW? I'LL EAT.
FIRST FOOD
TODAY.
I COULD SPELL
SOME OF THE WORDS
BUT I COULDN'T SPELL
ALL OF THEM, AND...
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT
THERE IS SOME RELIEF,
LIKE, "OH, I DIDN'T GET
THAT WORD. I'M SO HAPPY."
AH, BABY.
EVERY TIME IT WAS NEARING
FOR APRIL TO SPELL,
MY HANDS WERE WET RIGHT
IN THE CENTRE HERE.
JUST REAL WET.
AND THEN WHEN SHE
SPELLED HER WORD AND I BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF,
THEY WOULD
DRY INSTANTLY.
I WALKED AROUND THIS HOTEL
THREE TIMES, OUTSIDE.
RIGHT BEFORE SHE
GOT READY TO SPELL, I WALKED AROUND, AND...
THEN I WOULD COME BACK
JUST AS SHE WAS SPELLING.
THREE TIMES IN A
ROW. THAT'S TOO... IT'S TOO MUCH.
I DON'T EVEN EXPECT
TO GET PAST THE FIRST ROUND TOMORROW.
BUT...
WE'RE MORE
OPTIMISTIC, AND...
AND THAT... FEELING
SHE HAS THERE...
I WISH SHE COULD
JUST SHAKE IT
BECAUSE SHE HAS A
LOT GOING FOR HER.
AND I THINK SHE'S
GOING TO DO VERY WELL.
I DON'T KNOW. HUH.
I JUST... I'M MORE
OF A PESSIMIST. BUT...
THE WORDS GET
REALLY HARD AND...
IT'S REALLY THE
LUCK OF THE DRAW.
Man:
ONE THING I REMEMBER
THAT AS THE SPELLING BEE
APPROACHED ITS END
WITH THREE,
AND THEN TWO AND SO ON,
MY FATHER
WAS RIGHT ON THE STEPS
LEADING UP
TO THE...
THE STAGE, AND AS SOON AS I
SPELLED THE WORD CORRECTLY,
HE RUSHED ONTO THE STAGE.
HE WAS NOT AN EMOTIONAL
MAN IN GENERAL,
BUT HE WAS VERY
EMOTIONAL THAT TIME.
IT WAS A BIG THING,
GETTING TO THE NATIONAL
SPELLING BEE, OF COURSE.
AND MY OLDER BROTHER
HAD MADE IT TO THE
SECOND DAY OF COMPETITION,
GOT A WORD THAT HE
UNFORTUNATELY MISSPELLED,
AND THAT REALLY
BROKE MY MOTHER UP
AND SHE WAS CRYING
IN THE BALCONY.
AND I TRIED TO COMFORT
HER AND I TOLD HER,
"MOM DON'T WORRY. I'LL
WIN IT FOR YOU SOME DAY."
1985, I WAS SO
FOCUSED ON THIS
THAT THEY ACTUALLY SELECTED
FOUR PEOPLE TO LAY A WREATH
AT ARLINGTON CEMETERY
AT THE TOMB OF THE
UNKNOWN SOLDIER.
AND SO THEY CALLED ME
A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE THE CHAMPIONSHIP
AND THEY SAID, "HEY,"
YOU KNOW, "YOU'VE BEEN SELECTED.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE
THERE AS PART OF THIS?"
I DIDN'T EVEN
ASK MY PARENTS.
I'M LIKE, "NO.
I GOTTA STUDY."
IT'S AN EXTREMELY HEADY
EXPERIENCE FOR ANY CHILD.
YOU KNOW, YOU
GO FROM BEING RELATIVELY ANONYMOUS
TO BEING MOBBED BY
ALL THE MAJOR MEDIA IN THE UNITED STATES.
I DON'T THINK IT
REALLY HELPED ME...
IN MY LOVE LIFE, MY
NASCENT LOVE LIFE.
I THINK THAT HAVING WON
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
COULD BE REGARDED AS BEING
A SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY.
Woman:
WE GOT LETTERS FROM PLACES
THAT WE'D NEVER HEARD OF
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT APPEARED IN ALL THE NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS.
SO FROM A LOCAL NEWSPAPER,
SOMEBODY PUT A CUTTING
IN AN ENVELOPE AND
THEN ADDRESSED IT TO BALU NATARAJAN:
"HE WON THE NATIONAL
SPELLING BEE."
PEOPLE ALWAYS
KNEW ABOUT IT.
"OH, SHE'S THE GIRL THAT
WON THE SPELLING BEE."
AND IT'S CERTAINLY
SOMETHING
THAT HAS ALWAYS
CAPTURED PEOPLE'S ATTENTION AND IMAGINATION.
IT'S JUST A GREAT
AMERICANA TRADITION
THAT HAS BASICALLY
FILTERED OUT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE WORLD.
ONE THING HE SAID,
"THEY'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER
IS YOU WON THE
FIRST SPELLING BEE."
AND THAT IS TRUE.
I GET THE... CREDIT FOR BEING THE FIRST.
Kimble:
YESTERDAY, WE BEGAN WITH 249 SPELLERS.
TODAY, 104 REMAIN.
BY MID-AFTERNOON, ONE
OF THEM WILL BE DECLARED
THE 1999
SCRIPPS HOWARD NATIONAL SPELLING BEE CHAMPION.
AT THIS TIME, I
WOULD LIKE TO TURN
THE 72nd ANNUAL
SCRIPPS HOWARD NATIONAL SPELLING BEE
OVER TO
DR. ALEX J. CAMERON,
WITH THE 605th WORD
OF THE COMPETITION.
THANK YOU.
[ Applause ]
THE WORD
IS "BANNS".
IT'S A
PLURAL NOUN.
THIS BANNS MEANS
NOTICE OF A PROPOSED MARRIAGE
PROCLAIMED
IN A CHURCH OR OTHER PLACE PRESCRIBED BY LAW.
[ Whispering ]
BANDS, BANDS, BANDS, BANDS,
BANDS, OH...
THERE'S GOTTA
BE SOMETHING I CAN THINK OF.
Woman:
TAKE A DEEP BREATH, HARRY,
AND LET'S FINISH
THE WORD, PLEASE.
[ Exhaling ]
ALL RIGHT, I'M
STARTING OVER.
LET'S SEE. WHAT DO
I'VE GOT SO FAR? BANDS.
I'VE GOT
B-A-N-D.
GOTTA THINK
OF SOMETHING.
Woman:
HARRY. TURN TOWARD THE MICROPHONE
AND LET'S FINISH
THE WORD, PLEASE.
OKAY, THEN.
B-A-N-D-...
[ Heavy sigh ]
...S? BANDS?
[ Chiming of bell ]
BANNS IS
B-A-N-N-S.
[ Applause ]
I DIDN'T KNOW. I WAS
JUST TRYING OUT ANYTHING.
BUT... WELL, THE
GUY PRONOUNCED IT WRONG ANYWAY.
Interviewer:
HOW DID HE SAY IT? "BANDS."
I DIDN'T KNOW IT.
PEOPLE TOLD ME THAT IF I WAS CATHOLIC,
I MIGHT'VE KNOWN
IT, BECAUSE IT'S A CHURCH WORD.
IT'S...THEY PUT UP...
IT'S SOMETHING
TO DO WITH SOME CERTIFICATE THEY PUT UP
WHEN SOMEONE'S GOING TO
GET MARRIED IN THE CHURCH.
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE
TRIED SOMETHING LIKE D-E-S
OR T-S, OR...
OR EVEN N-D-S.
AND I FELT BAD FOR
THE BOY WHO WAS FROM TEXAS AND GOT "YENTA."
"YENTA."
YENTA?
...OR EVEN D-Z. SOMETHING.
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
I DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE...
WELL, YOU CAN'T REALLY
CALL THEM GOOD IDEAS.
AND I WENT WITH... BUT I
WENT WITH THE WORST IDEA,
WHICH WAS D-S,
AND I GOT OUT.
I GOT OUT.
BUT STILL, HE DID
PRONOUNCE IT WRONG
EVEN THOUGH I DID
MAKE MY WORST GUESS.
"DARJEELING."
CAN I HAVE THE
ETYMOLOGY, PLEASE?
IT'S FROM A...
BENGALI
GEOGRAPHICAL NAME.
Neil:
DARJEELY?
Woman:
SAY IT TOWARD US AGAIN, NEIL.
DARJEELY.
Woman:
SLOW DOWN THE ENDING.
DAR-JEELY.
Cameron:
NO. DARJEELING.
DARJEELING.
Neil:
SO THIS IS A NOUN.
Cameron:
A NOUN.
CAN YOU PRONOUNCE THE
WORD AGAIN, PLEASE?
"DARJEELING."
Neil:
THIS IS THE LAST SPELLING BEE I'M EVER GOING TO GO TO.
AND SO, IT WOULD FEEL GOOD
TO COME OUT SUCCESSFUL
AT THE LAST ONE.
BUT...
I'M STILL HAPPY
IF I GO INTO THE COMFORT ROOM AND...
AND AT LEAST IN, LIKE,
ONE OF THE HIGHER ROUNDS.
AFTER NEIL FINISHES
THIS SPELLING BEE
AND AFTER HE'S DONE
WITH ALL THIS,
AT LEAST HE'LL HAVE
FOND MEMORIES OF WHAT...
WHAT IT WAS TO
STRIVE FOR SOMETHING THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT
AND TO KEEP YOUR
MIND FOCUSED, WHETHER YOU SUCCEED OR NOT.
YOU STILL CONTINUE TO
STRIVE IN OTHER THINGS.

I DON'T THINK I'D REMEMBER ANY LETTERS.
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE...
I SIT THERE
WITH THE CAMERA SO NERVOUS.
AND DON'T TAKE
ANY PICTURES.
IT'S LIKE,
I'M, LIKE...
PARALYSED
BY SEEING HER AT THE MIC.
YOU CAN KNOW EVERY SINGLE
WORD IN A ROUND BUT ONE
AND GET THAT ONE.
IT'S STATISTICAL.
I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO DO WELL
WITHOUT HAVING TRAINED.
IS IT FROM FRENCH?
YEAH, LATIN,
BUT FROM FRENCH TO US.
FROM THE FRENCH WORD
VIANDE, MEANING MEAT?

"PALIMPSEST."
PALIMPSEST.
AM I PRONOUNCING
IT CORRECTLY?
PALIMPSEST?
Parag:
THIS IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE
TO BE A BEST SPELLER
IN THE WORLD.
IN YOUR SPARE TIME, IF
YOU CAN DO THE SPELLING
AND THEN DO WELL,
THAT'S GOOD.
OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT THAT IMPORTANT.
Sid:
WELL, SHE HAD THOSE WORDS DOWN.
SHE WAS DETERMINED
TO COME BACK THIS YEAR.
COME BACK.
SHE WANTED TO GO THE WHOLE WAY.
PALIMPSEST:

I DID TOO.

Kimble:
THIS CONCLUDES ROUND FOUR.
THERE ARE 48
SPELLERS REMAINING.
AT THIS TIME WE ARE
GOING TO TAKE OUR BREAK.
YOU NEED TO LEAVE

Male commentator:
WELCOME TO WASHINGTON, D. C.
FOR THE 72nd ANNUAL
SCRIPPS HOWARD NATIONAL SPELLING BEE.
WE'RE AT THE
GRAND HYATT HOTEL
WHERE YESTERDAY
249 SPELLERS BEGAN COMPETITION.
THROUGH THE FIRST
3 ROUNDS, OVERNIGHT, 104 SURVIVED.
WE'RE NOW IN
THE 5th ROUND.
THERE ARE 46
SPELLERS REMAINING.
WELL, IT'S AS
DIFFICULT AS HANDICAPPING, SAY, THE BELMONT STAKES.
BUT CAN YOU
GIVE ME A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TO WATCH TODAY?
I DO HAVE
A COUPLE FAVOURITES TODAY.
LET'S WATCH FOR
EMILY STAGG.
SHE'S FROM CONNECTICUT,
AND SHE'S DONE A GREAT JOB
WITH FOREIGN LANGUAGES,
WHICH HELPS A LOT
WITH SPELLING.
AND THIS IS HER
THIRD VISIT HERE.
MY OTHER FAVOURITE
IS GEORGE THAMPY.
HE'S FROM MISSOURI AND HE
PLACED FOURTH LAST YEAR.
HE'S HOME-SCHOOLED AND
HE SEEMS TO STUDY SPELLING AROUND THE CLOCK.
I'D PUT MY MONEY
ON GEORGIE.
HE WAS IN THE
TOP FIVE LAST YEAR,
AND HE HAD A VERY
GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORDS.
I MEAN, YOU COULD TELL
THIS KID WAS PROCESSING THE INFORMATION.
I THINK THAT
GEORGE THAMPY WILL DO... PROBABLY DO WELL.
HE WAS INCREDIBLE
LAST YEAR.
HE REMEMBERS
EVERYTHING HE STUDIED
WHEN HE WAS FOUR OR
FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD.
WHATEVER HE LEARNED
AT THE AGE OF FOUR,
HE STILL REMEMBERS
EVERY BIT OF IT.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
REVIEW ANYTHING AT ALL.
Father:
THIS COUNTRY NEEDS GODLY VALUES.
WE ARE IN
A BANKRUPT SOCIETY
WITH RESPECT
TO PRINCIPLES AND CHARACTER.
Man:
GEORGIE THAMPY IS GOING TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AGAIN
FOR THE NATIONAL
SPELLING BEE WHERE HE CAME IN FOURTH LAST YEAR.
I BELIEVE HE'S GOING
TO WIN IT ALL THIS YEAR.
BUT YOU KNOW, THAT'S
NOT THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT GEORGIE.
HIS FATHER HAS TOLD ME
ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS
THAT GEORGIE HONOURS HIS
FATHER AND HIS MOTHER.
THAT IS A LOT MORE
IMPORTANT TO GOD,
AND THAT'S A LOT
MORE IMPORTANT TO GEORGIE'S FUTURE.
Georgie:
THERE'S THREE TIPS I HAVE FOR OTHER SPELLERS,
ONE: TRUST IN JESUS.
TRUST AND
BELIEVE IN JESUS.
TWO: HONOURING
YOUR PARENTS,
AND THREE: HARD WORK.
Commentator:
ALL RIGHT. 46 SPELLERS ARE READY TO BEGIN COMPETITION.
THE SPELLER ON STAGE
RIGHT NOW IS NEIL KADAKIA.

THIS IS GREEK.

David:
I THINK IT'S A PECULIARLY AMERICAN TRADITION.
COMPETITION IS...
A MORE IMPORTANT
PART OF AMERICAN CHILDREN'S UPBRINGING,
I THINK, THAN IT
IS A EUROPEAN... EUROPEAN CHILD'S.
THAT'S
PART OF MY MISGIVINGS NOW.
IT'S KIND
OF JUST LIKE EVERYONE SAYING,
"OH, YOU'RE
GOING TO WIN."
I'M LIKE, "NO,
I'M NOT. I'M REALLY NOT."
UM... THE BEGINNING,
DOES IT COME FROM THE ROOT
A-, MEANING, LIKE, "NOT?"

I DON'T SEE THAT LISTED HERE.

I MADE IT THROUGH THE FIRST DAY,
AND I WAS PRETTY
HAPPY WITH THAT
BECAUSE THAT WAS
THE FIRST GOAL I SET.
AND THEN ON THE...
ON THE SECOND DAY, MY
SECOND GOAL WAS TO...
WAS TO MAKE IT TO ESPN
AND THEN I MADE IT
TO ESPN, AND SO...
AND THEN I SET ANOTHER
GOAL TO MAKE IT INTO THE TOP 10, WHICH I DID.
TO COME 9th AT
12 YEARS OF AGE IS PHENOMENAL.
BECAUSE HE'S IN
THE 8th GRADE, HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO COME BACK,
BUT I KNOW THAT
IF HE'S 14 AND HE WAS IN THE 8th GRADE,
WE WOULD HAVE
AN EASY STREET, 2 MORE YEARS IN A ROW.
BUT THAT'S
NOT WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT.
SO FOR US
IT WAS GREAT.
JUST
PHENOMENALLY GREAT.

THERE ARE 8 SPELLERS REMAINING.

CAN YOU PRONOUNCE THE
WORD ONE MORE TIME?
"CLAVECIN."
CLAVISON...
CLAVISON?
CLAVISON:
C-L-A-V-I-S-O-N.
CLAVISON.
[ Chiming of bell ]
Cameron:
CLAVECIN IS C-L-A-V-E-C-I-N.
[ Applause ]
WE ARE INCREDIBLY
PROUD OF EMILY.
ABSOLUTELY.
ABSOLUTELY.
EMILY DID A
PHENOMENAL JOB. SHE DID.
THERE'S A BUNCH
OF KIDS IN THERE AND THEY WERE ALL VERY GOOD.
AND SHE'S
UP THERE. YEAH. I THINK...
I THINK THE
KIDS IN THE END ALL...
ALL HAD THE
CHANCE OF WINNING.
I THINK THE
LAST... PROBABLY THE LAST EIGHT.
PART OF ME IS KIND
OF JUST LIKE...
YOU KNOW, "IT'S OVER. THIS
PART OF MY LIFE IS OVER."
AND THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
OF A LETDOWN, BUT...
I CAN THROW
AWAY THE BOOKS.
DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.
[ Applause ]
Cameron:
"CABOTINAGE."
COULD YOU REPEAT THE
WORD AGAIN, PLEASE?
"CABOTINAGE."
CABOTINAGE?
Nupur:
INSIDE I HAD BUTTERFLIES IN MY STOMACH.
MAY I HAVE A
SENTENCE, PLEASE?
LIKE, AND MY HEART
WAS POUNDING, MY HANDS WERE CLAMMY.
I WAS JUST TRYING NOT
TO DWELL ON THE FACT
THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE.
"CABOTINAGE."
CABOTINAGE:
C-A-B-O-T-I-N-A-G-E.
Woman:
YES.
[ Applause ]
Kimble:
4 SPELLERS REMAIN.
APRIL, YOU MAY ONCE AGAIN
STEP TO THE MICROPHONE
TO BEGIN ROUND 10.
Cameron:
THERE IS A HOMONYM TO THIS WORD.
THE WORD IS
"TERRENE," OR TERRENE,
AND THIS ONE MEANS
RELATING TO THIS WORLD OF LIFE, MUNDANE.
April:
DOES THIS COME FROM THE ROOT TERRA, MEANING EARTH?
Man:
YES.
OKAY.
TERRINE:
T-E-R-R-I-N-E.
[ Chiming of bell ]
TERRENE IS
T-E-R-R-E-N-E.
[ Applause ]
SHE CALMED ME BECAUSE SHE
WAS VERY COOL UP THERE.
SHE MANAGES TO
STAY THAT WAY
AND YET...
MAYBE WHEN WE GO BACK
TO THE ROOM, SHE'LL FALL APART A LITTLE.
BUT UP ON THE STAGE,
SHE REALLY KEEPS A VERY GOOD PRESENCE.
SO I'M REAL PROUD.
I'M HAPPY WITH
MY PLACEMENT.
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
BECAUSE I ONLY
MISSED ONE LETTER.
I GUESS I WOULDN'T BE
ANY HAPPIER IF SHE WON.
IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE
ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME.
IF SHE HAD WON OR
COME IN SECOND...
I MEAN, SHE JUST
DID SO GOOD.
CURTLE...
C-U-R-
T-L-E.
CURTLE?
[ Chiming of bell ]
Various:
OH-H-H....
KIRTLE IS
K-I-R-T-L-E.
[ Applause ]
Kimble:
THAT CONCLUDED ROUND 10.
THERE ARE 2
SPELLERS REMAINING.
AT THIS TIME WE
WILL BE MOVING
TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP
WORD SUB-SECTION.
"OPSIMATH."
OPSOMATH? OPSOMATH?
OPSOMATH:
O-P-...
S-O-M-A-T-H.
[ Chiming of bell ]
OPSIMATH IS
SPELLED O-P-S-I-
M-A-T-H.
[ Applause ]
Commentator:
NOW, THAT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE NUPUR THE WINNER.
"LOGORRHEA."
Nupur:
LOGORRHEA. MAY I HAVE A DEFINITION?
PATHOLOGICALLY
EXCESSIVE AND OFTEN INCOHERENT TALKATIVENESS.
Nupur:
LOGORRHEA. MAY I HAVE A SENTENCE, PLEASE?
THE PATIENT'S
LOGORRHEA
WAS INDICATIVE
OF DEEP EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS.
SOMEHOW OR OTHER,
IN AMERICA,
SPELLING, ALTHOUGH IT'S A
FAIRLY MECHANICAL PROCESS,
IN SMALL COMMUNITIES
IT WAS IDENTIFIED WITH, YOU KNOW,
THE BEGINNING OF BEING
ABLE TO READ AND WRITE AND HANDLE LANGUAGE.
IN THIS COUNTRY,
SPELLING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COMMUNITY PROCESS.
Dorothy:
WE TRIED TO RAISE HIM THAT...
TRY, AND IF YOU
DO IT, GREAT,
AND IF YOU
DON'T...
JUST ROLL ON.
OH, MY GOD. I'M SIXTH,
BUT I COULD'VE WON.
I KNEW THOSE WORDS THAT SHE WAS SPELLING.
DID YOU KNOW
THE WORDS THAT SHE GOT?
NOCICEPTOR
AND LOGORRHEA? YEAH.
YES. THAT'S
WHY I'M SO MAD.
I KNOW. I'M
JUST LIKE, "OH, I COULD'VE WON."
April:
SOME PART OF ME WANTS TO THINK
THAT I COULD HAVE
GOTTEN THAT WORD RIGHT,
AND IF I'D GOTTEN
THAT WORD RIGHT
THEN MAYBE I'D HAVE
A CHANCE AT WINNING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Gale:
THERE'S SUCH A THING, I GUESS,
AS COMING TOO CLOSE
AND YET NOT COMING,
YOU KNOW, CLOSE ENOUGH.
BUT THAT'S... THERE
HAS TO BE SOMEONE IN THIRD PLACE, RIGHT?
Ashley:
IF I LOSE,
IT'LL BE OKAY BECAUSE...
I'LL BE UPSET FOR
A LITTLE WHILE,
AND THEN I'LL
RISE ABOVE IT
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST
ANOTHER OBSTACLE.
IN AMERICA, BACK IN
THE 18th CENTURY,
PEOPLE HAD THIS
SENSE OF OPPORTUNITY.
YOU COULD LEAP OUT
OF ONE'S SOCIAL CLASS.
YOU COULD MOVE UP, AND
I THINK THEY UNDERSTOOD
EDUCATION WAS A
BASIC PART OF THAT.
Rajesh:
THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH SOME- THING THAT COMPLEX,
THAT HARD, AND YOU
STILL PUT IN ENERGY WITH A PASSION.
AND IF THEY CAN DO
THAT IN ANYTHING ELSE,
THAT THEY TAKE IN
THESE VERY QUALITIES
WILL MAKE THEM SUCCESSFUL
AND HAPPY AT WHAT THEY DO.
WHOOO-OOO!
[ Mooing of cows ]
I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULD
DO THAT FOR MY FAMILY.
I DON'T KNOW
THAT I COULD SAY,
"WELL YOU KNOW, WE'RE
GOING TO ANOTHER COUNTRY
SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE
A BETTER WAY OF LIFE."
Angela:
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE OF MY BACKGROUND
THAT I WORK SO HARD.
Jorge:
HE HAS SAID THAT IF HE WERE TO DIE TODAY,
HE WOULD DIE
A HAPPY PERSON
BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE...
WE HAVE...
ACCOMPLISHED WHAT
HE WANTED US TO.
OH, YOU WANT
TO TALK TO HER TOO.
WE'VE GOT
NUPUR-MANIA HERE.
I GO TO COLLEGE,
AND I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING IN NEUROLOGY.
JUST FORGET ABOUT ALL THE
PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE.
FORGET ABOUT ALL
THE OTHER SPELLERS...
SEE, RIGHT
NOW WE'RE SEEING VIDEO OF YOU COMING HOME,
AND YOU SAID
IT KIND OF SHOCKED YOU
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ACTUALLY SHOWED UP FOR THAT. YEAH. IT...
Meena:
YOU CAN GET A SENSE OF BELONGING IN AMERICA
OUTSIDE OF INDIA,
WHICH YOU DON'T GET ANYWHERE ELSE.
WE WANTED OUR CHILDREN
TO HAVE THAT.
LOGORRHEA:
L-O-G-O-R-R-H-E-A.
Kimble:
THAT IS CORRECT.
[ Cheers/applause ]
Man:
SCRIPPS HOWARD IS MOST PROUD TO PRESENT
THE 1999 NATIONAL
SPELLING BEE CHAMPION

{1183}{1238}-Whose idea was this?|-I don't know.
{1242}{1310}This is fun. I don't even|want to go in the limo.
{1314}{1373}-You're gonna snag it up.|-No, but it floats.
{1376}{1419}I'm looking forward to that show.
{1422}{1498}Oh, man. It sold out.
{1502}{1553}-Good cast.|-That was a beautiful cast.
{1592}{1662}He can cast great.|He just can't catch anything.
{1666}{1730}He's a great caster.
{1743}{1778}Want to do a fishing show?
{1782}{1828}All you think about is fishing shows.
{1832}{1890}I hate those. Every cast,|they catch a fish.
{1894}{1988}We got $5000 worth of gear here,|and we can't get the bugs to bite.
{1992}{2059}First time I went fishing,|I was going with this girl.
{2063}{2103}We were going down to the lake.
{2107}{2174}She wanted to make love on a horse.|I'd never done it.
{2178}{2263}We did it. I'm trying to keep|my balance, and she fell off.
{2268}{2362}Then the manager of the Wal-Mart|come out and unplugged him.
{2366}{2498}I didn't want to make love on a horse.|I wanted to do it on a rocket ship they had.
{2502}{2594}Oh, man. Shut up.
{2598}{2665}Who do you think has been|with the ugliest woman here?
{2669}{2750}-Have you ever been with an ugly woman?|-The ugliest woman I've been with...
{2754}{2794}...I was with last week.
{2799}{2913}And I'm starting to miss her.
{2930}{2987}You remember that movie 9 1/2 Weeks?
{2990}{3059}When that fella had that woman|blindfolded and fed her fruit?
{3062}{3116}I had this idea to try that at my house.
{3120}{3240}Apparently, bologna and string cheese|is not a big turn-on for a woman.
{3244}{3318}Choose your condiment correctly.
{3322}{3400}One of those shows I was watching|said the big thing now...
{3404}{3466}...is to talk to your partner|while you're making love.
{3470}{3516}I heard that. Yeah.
{3520}{3616}Which, where I come from, means,|"Ain't no cars coming. Relax."
{3718}{3752}Hey, there's David.
{3756}{3812}-David!|-Does he see us out here?
{3817}{3906}We're in the middle of a lake, in a boat.|If he can't, I ain't riding with him.
{3910}{3982}-Come on, guys.|-Better get your stuff in.
{3986}{4022}Man, are you serious?
{4027}{4068}Come on! Got a show to do!
{4771}{4808}Have you ever had makeup on?
{4812}{4891}One time, but I was young|and needed the money.
{4947}{4971}-Hey, guys.|-David!
{4975}{5059}I didn't want to interrupt you.|Listen, I took the liberty...
{5063}{5163}...of doing a little shopping for you guys.|Now, as we discussed before...
{5167}{5275}...I just think you should give some color,|bring it to the stage, pizzazz.
{5280}{5351}David, this is the most dressed up|Larry has been all year long.
{5355}{5403}That's great. Listen, guys, pick a suit.
{5407}{5459}They're all labeled. Try them on.
{5468}{5541}Knock it out the box, and I'll be back|in a minute. Okay, fellas?
{5545}{5601}Do we put them on now?
{5639}{5672}No way!
{5680}{5768}Special sale? He bought stuff|that was on sale?
{5772}{5842}We're trying to get people's|favorite Jeff Foxworthy jokes.
{5847}{5963}You know you're a redneck if you go|to a family reunion looking for a wife.
{5967}{6054}-You might be a redneck--|-lf your tires cost more than your truck.
{6057}{6085}You might be a redneck--
{6090}{6141}If you find yourself climbing|a water tower--
{6145}{6184}To erase your sister's name.
{6188}{6264}If your wife has said, " Move this|transmission, so I can take a bath!"
{6268}{6352}I'm not just dead sure|I've got underwear on.
{6378}{6429}There ain't no way I'm squeezing|into these.
{6484}{6528}First of all, Tammy Faye Bakker...
{6532}{6608}...I want to say--|I'm kidding you! Come on!
{6612}{6648}You know you're a redneck if:
{6653}{6725}-Your mother can tell a state trooper to...|-Kiss her ass--
{6729}{6801}...kiss her ass without taking|the Marlboro out of her mouth.
{6805}{6843}You might be a redneck if you--
{6848}{6888}Got a motor swinging from a tree.
{6892}{6933}An engine swinging from a tree.
{6938}{6993}Look at this belt, fellas.
{7025}{7097}I didn't even know they made|a 28-button suit.
{7164}{7201}You know you're a redneck if:
{7204}{7238}You might be a redneck if--
{7242}{7281}You know you're a redneck--
{7286}{7329}-Mow your lawn--|-Mow your front yard--
{7333}{7403}If you mow your grass, and you find a car.
{7407}{7477}You might be a redneck if they|say at a dance " Do the hoedown"...
{7481}{7532}...and you throw your girlfriend|on the floor.
{7543}{7604}What's up, G?
{7609}{7669}A lot of white people in here this evening.
{7672}{7724}Where's my whores? Where's my whores?
{7729}{7853}You look like my relatives!|You can't go on-stage dressed like that!
{7945}{8013}Phoenix, Arizona, this is it!
{8017}{8059}Are you guys ready to laugh?
{8063}{8177}Make some noise, please,|for Mr. Ron White!
{8307}{8404}Yesterday I was sitting in|a beanbag chair naked, eating Cheetos.
{8435}{8511}I was flipping through the television,|and I saw Robert Tilton.
{8515}{8643}He's a televangelist from Dallas,|and he was staring at me.
{8679}{8725}He said this. He said:
{8728}{8773}"Are you lonely? "
{8813}{8859}Yeah.
{8868}{9017}He said, " Have you wasted half your life|in bars pursuing sins of the flesh? "
{9021}{9054}This guy's good!
{9116}{9194}He said, "Are you sitting in|a beanbag chair naked, eating Cheetos? "
{9267}{9312}Yes, sir!
{9317}{9431}He said, "Do you feel the urge|to get up and send me $1 000? "
{9435}{9559}Close! I thought he was talking|about me there for a second.
{9616}{9754}So anyway, I flew here from Flagstaff|because my manager doesn't own a globe.
{9816}{9880}I flew here on a plane that big...
{9884}{9964}...Iike a pack of gum|with eight people in it, just:
{10033}{10167}We took off from the Flagstaff Airport,|Hair Care and Tire Center there.
{10229}{10335}We're traveling at half the speed|of smell.
{10345}{10429}We got passed by a kite.
{10436}{10553}There was a goose behind us,|and the pilot was going, "Go around!"
{10623}{10711}We get halfway to Phoenix,|we gotta go back.
{10716}{10785}It's a nine-minute flight...
{10797}{10875}...can't pull it off with this equipment.
{10909}{10989}We had some engine trouble.|We lost some oil pressure in one engine.
{10993}{11065}They told us about it over|the speaker system of the plane...
{11068}{11147}...which was stupid|because they could have just went:
{11151}{11229}"Hey, we lost some oil pressure."
{11345}{11372}Heard you!
{11409}{11488}Everybody on the plane was nervous,|but I'd been drinking since lunch.
{11491}{11571}I was like, "Take it down. I don't care."
{11577}{11615}You ever have one of those days?
{11667}{11769}"Hit something hard. I don't wanna|limp away from this wreck."
{11797}{11903}The guy sitting next to me|is losing his mind.
{11908}{11980}Apparently, he had a lot to live for.
{12067}{12141}He goes, "Hey, man. Hey, man...
{12144}{12237}...if one of these engines fails,|how far will the other one take us? "
{12256}{12328}All the way to the scene of the crash...
{12529}{12623}...which is pretty handy|because that's where we're headed.
{12636}{12752}I bet we beat the paramedics there|by a half-hour.
{12859}{12940}I saw something today that came close|to truth in advertising.
{12945}{13035}The De Beers people are almost saying|what they really mean...
{13039}{13147}...because the old De Beers slogan was,|" Diamonds are forever."
{13151}{13263}Then they changed it to,|"This year, take her breath away."
{13268}{13411}The new slogan is,|"Diamonds, render her speechless."
{13419}{13479}Why don't they just go ahead and say it?
{13483}{13575}"Diamonds, that'll shut her up!"
{13837}{13889}For a minute.
{13939}{13996}It's good to be here.|I was here last summer.
{14001}{14125}They took me tubing down the Salt River,|and I was baffled by this.
{14149}{14249}I had never done it before.|Twenty-one of us met to go tube the river.
{14252}{14359}We had six ice chests full of beer|with the tubes wrapped around them.
{14364}{14481}We floated down that river drinking beer|for six and a half hours.
{14487}{14570}Not one person had to pee.
{14745}{14803}Is that normal?
{14815}{14908}I'd like to think my friends|wouldn't pee on themselves.
{14913}{14959}I know I would.
{14972}{15011}That was the best thing|about tubing.
{15015}{15123}You could just paddle up|to somebody you don't even know...
{15177}{15269}...talk to them|while you're peeing on yourself.
{15273}{15329}That's relaxed, right there.
{15345}{15472}If you're floating down a river,|drinking a beer, peeing on yourself...
{15477}{15539}...there's no tension there. Is there?
{15652}{15739}I guess we'd been floating down|that river for an hour before I realized...
{15743}{15807}...everybody's just peeing on themselves.|And I thought:
{15811}{15871}"Hell, I'll just pee on myself."
{15875}{15916}Everybody got mad at me.
{15951}{16008}Of course, I was in a canoe.
{16081}{16148}Standing up too.
{16175}{16289}Not everybody got mad. A couple people|viewed it as a photo opportunity.
{16293}{16395}And I know that because I got|their Christmas card last year.
{16399}{16461}I don't remember it being|that cold that afternoon.
{16655}{16712}So I just got back from 1 0 days|in Los Angeles.
{16717}{16828}If you ever have a chance to do that,|pass on that.
{16833}{16893}I learn things when I go to L.A.|I learned this:
{16897}{16957}They have bikinis now|made out of seashells.
{16961}{17009}I didn't know that.|I also didn't know this:
{17013}{17119}If you're on a beach and you see a girl|dressed in a bikini made of seashells...
{17123}{17225}...and you pick her up|and hold her to your ear...
{17273}{17343}...you can hear her scream.
{17399}{17472}I thought I'd hear the ocean,|but not over that woman.
{17529}{17609}We got in last night. Some guys asked|if I wanted to go to a topless bar...
{17613}{17699}...and I didn't want to go.
{17716}{17839}I ended up going because, you guys back|me up, you've seen one woman naked...
{17843}{17915}...you wanna see the rest of them naked.
{17928}{18004}It could be an old biker chick.|You know they'll hang down to here.
{18009}{18047}"You want to see me naked? "
{18064}{18104}Yeah, I do.
{18207}{18289}All right, that's enough.|Roll them back up.
{18431}{18499}Things that make you go:
{18560}{18583}It was a wild night.
{18587}{18647}I got back to the Phoenician Hotel.|They're so snooty.
{18651}{18725}I got back to the hotel|at 7:30 this morning...
{18729}{18820}...and I went up to the desk to leave|a wake-up call for 7:00.
{18855}{18960}And the lady goes,|"Mr. White, it's past 7."
{18980}{19032}"No, the next one.
{19059}{19127}You got another one coming around,|don't you?
{19131}{19203}Why don't you put me on that one?
{19207}{19280}Hear they're running two a day|through Arizona."
{19443}{19596}I'm from Texas. In Texas, we have|the death penalty, and we use it!
{19691}{19825}That's right. If you come to Texas|and kill somebody, we will kill you back.
{19848}{19894}That's our policy.
{19897}{20025}They're trying to pass a bill right now that|will speed up the process of execution...
{20029}{20109}...in heinous crimes where there's more|than three credible eyewitnesses.
{20114}{20224}If more than three people saw you, you|don't sit on death row for 1 5 years, Jack.
{20229}{20277}You go straight to the front of the line.
{20282}{20373}Other states are trying to abolish|the death penalty.
{20377}{20469}My state's putting in an express lane.
{20537}{20639}Thanks for playing along.|I hope you enjoyed it. Good night.
{20935}{20962}Fellas, look at this!
{21004}{21029}Let's go in!
{21033}{21073}-No, no, no!|-It's Victoria's Secret!
{21078}{21119}-Come back here.|-Come on!
{21123}{21213}-I wanna get my mom something.|-The last time you were in there--
{21217}{21268}Hi, welcome to Victoria's Secret.
{21272}{21317}Let's just get in, get him out of here.
{21321}{21375}I want to get my mom something|for her birthday.
{21379}{21435}-Something like this, perhaps?|-Look at these!
{21440}{21527}-See, they're stretchy, you know.|-These are small. You got anything larger?
{21532}{21570}Yes, I'm sure we have something.
{21575}{21669}These are cool. Look at these.|See, this is what I'm talking about.
{21673}{21715}-See how big it is?|-You can't do that.
{21721}{21836}This will cover the moles and the hair|coming out the top and the whole deal.
{21840}{21884}-She's got all sorts of problems.|-Ron.
{21904}{21931}It ain't for me.
{21934}{21999}These are cool. You got any|with other sayings on them?
{22003}{22109}Other sayings? Yes, we have|"just married" or "sexy" or "foxy."
{22113}{22182}-You can have them embroidered.|-I'd put "get her done" there.
{22186}{22245}-Yes.|-I could put some "get her done" drawers.
{22249}{22279}-We gotta go.|-Come on!
{22283}{22358}I got a good-looking girl here.|We're looking at leopard bikinis.
{22362}{22423}-I'm really sorry for him.|-I'll come back.
{22427}{22485}She showed me all kinds of furry britches.
{22489}{22541}-See you later!|-Bye!
{22545}{22603}Remember when you used to get|plastic dog turds...
{22608}{22675}-Black light bulbs.|-...the plastic vomits, and the...?
{22679}{22769}Nothing says, "Happy anniversary,|sweetheart" like rubber dog turds.
{22773}{22817}I love this store.
{22823}{22881}-This is the best store on the planet.|-lt is.
{22916}{22984}This is-- I'm telling you, Jeff,|this is art...
{22987}{23032}...Iike you have never heard.
{23127}{23179}It's remote-control fart?
{23183}{23254}You put it under somebody else's chair|and walk out of the room.
{23258}{23355}That's beautiful. How much is that?
{23384}{23412}Have a good day.
{23419}{23524}This man has made enough money|to buy anything in the mall...
{23529}{23629}...and he gets|the remote-control fart machine.
{23660}{23692}Very proud.
{24057}{24096}Oh, my God!
{24189}{24233}You know, if we'd grown up together...
{24237}{24347}...he would've been the guy we put|in the trunk and pushed down the stairs.
{24375}{24425}Sorry about that.
{24452}{24487}Oh, my God!
{24684}{24793}-Maybe I'll get some.|-lt lasts for 1 8 hours.
{24822}{24871}I apologize. I'll be back.
{24875}{24962}-Are you downwind or what?|-Yeah, I'll be back. I'm sorry.
{24967}{25003}This is a long-lasting product--
{25041}{25154}He's still trying to sell the product|the whole time I'm farting on him.
{25167}{25230}Phoenix, Arizona, I give you the one...
{25233}{25337}...the only, Larry the Cable Guy.
{25387}{25432}Get her done!
{25491}{25552}Boy, good to see you.|Good to see you.
{25556}{25647}I had a horrible nightmare last night.
{25652}{25719}I dreamt I drunk|the world's largest margarita...
{25724}{25831}...and woke up this morning,|there was salt on the toilet lid.
{25905}{26011}Thank God I didn't eat the worm|in there. I'll tell you that much.
{26015}{26103}Boy, that wouldn't have been good,|right there.
{26111}{26140}It was a crazy week.
{26144}{26255}I called one of them 900 talk-dirty numbers|the other day. You ever call one of them?
{26267}{26299}Yeah!
{26303}{26378}That's it? Two people? That's it?
{26381}{26471}And those voices sounded familiar,|to be honest with you.
{26475}{26505}Don't call. It's a rip-off.
{26509}{26636}I got a girl that stuttered,|and it cost me $1 700 on that deal.
{26639}{26695}Can you believe that?
{26713}{26736}But I love women.
{26741}{26837}I used to date this one girl|had one boob bigger than the other.
{26841}{26988}And she got in a wet T-shirt contest and|took first and third place at that contest.
{27015}{27147}Bless her heart. I was so proud|of my sister, bless her heart.
{27200}{27311}I used to date this one girl looked|like Michelle Pfeiffer, only shorter...
{27316}{27388}...and the face was different.
{27405}{27467}I was drinking,|it looked like Michelle Pfeiffer.
{27471}{27556}Next morning, Barney Pfeiffer's lying|in the bed next to me.
{27561}{27591}She was ugly.
{27597}{27647}I had one girl had a beauty mark|on her cheek.
{27652}{27691}That was sexy, like Cindy Crawford.
{27695}{27792}We get to kissing, and I was looking at it.|It was a tick!
{27797}{27903}I know. I disappeared like a set of rims|at a Puff Daddy concert.
{27907}{27983}I'll tell you what, I was out the door.
{27987}{28041}Out the door.
{28077}{28145}So I went shopping around today.|Went to the mall.
{28149}{28229}You ever seen this PETsMART?
{28232}{28279}The critter store? You been in there?
{28300}{28392}You know what they got in there?|A dog water-purifying machine.
{28395}{28549}You believe that? $75.|Dog water-purifying machine.
{28553}{28668}I'm like, "What's that thing do? " She says,|"lt purifies your dog's drinking water."
{28672}{28751}"He just ate a turd 1 0 minutes ago.
{28755}{28837}You got any turd-purifying machines|in here, for Pete's sake? "
{28840}{28967}What in the world? That's like wiping|before you poop. It don't make sense.
{28971}{29055}Doesn't make any sense at all.
{29068}{29123}Pete's sake.
{29143}{29231}Then I went in there--|I went in there to Victoria's Secret.
{29236}{29304}You ever been in there?
{29331}{29446}Get her done. That's right. That's like|a grown-feller Chuck E. Cheese in there.
{29451}{29557}I like that joint. I was there the other day.|I was sniffing around a couple hours...
{29603}{29663}...Iooking for some gift ideas.
{29667}{29711}You know what they got in there?
{29715}{29783}Underbritches with holes in the crotch.
{29787}{29811}You believe that?
{29815}{29916}Twenty-four dollars women paying|for undershorts with holes in the crotch.
{29919}{30032}I'm like, " Dadgum, I got a whole drawer|full of them at the house, for Pete's sake."
{30035}{30136}I bet I'm sitting on two, $300|worth of them underdrawers.
{30167}{30229}A girl put a pair of them on|for my birthday one time.
{30234}{30295}I come home, she's like,|"You want some of this? "
{30305}{30363}I'm like, "No, look what it did|to your undershorts."
{30393}{30480}Good Lord! What in the world?
{30494}{30599}Looked like a good place for one of them|Plug lns or something, for Pete's sake.
{30603}{30681}Vanilla Plug lns or something.
{30719}{30819}They got all kinds of stuff out there.|They got this deal now...
{30833}{30955}...britches you eat. You ever seen that?|Eating britches?
{30963}{31038}Who in the world thought|of eating britches?
{31041}{31135}"What do you want to do tonight? "|"Let me eat your undershorts.
{31139}{31220}Give me a glass of milk.|I'll gobble them up right here, I tell you.
{31224}{31349}Honey, put some in the refrigerator.|I'll make a sandwich later."
{31375}{31488}I was with a girl that liked that stuff.|I was seeing her for about six weeks.
{31493}{31565}And then somebody took|my binoculars out of the truck.
{31631}{31690}She was a midget stripper.|And-- Seriously.
{31694}{31788}I met her at a party one night,|and she popped out of a cupcake.
{31791}{31881}But anyway, she liked|all them edible underbritches.
{31884}{32005}And I bought her five pairs|of the strawberry eating-britches.
{32020}{32139}I bought five pair because I always eat|two or three pair on the way to her house.
{32179}{32233}They're pretty good.
{32241}{32352}Thank God they don't make them in|biscuits and gravy. I'll tell you that much.
{32357}{32452}Doggone right. I'd be getting fat|just on undershorts.
{32457}{32533}Need some SnackWell panties.|That's what they need, right there.
{32537}{32585}Get her done. That's right.
{32589}{32685}"Honey, I'm on a diet. Put on some|Fruit Roll-Ups, would you? "
{32743}{32784}That's right.
{32791}{32897}Went in for a checkup the other day.|Doctor stick his finger up my hind end.
{32901}{32947}Didn't even tell me, just does it.
{32951}{33071}I'm standing there. I'm like, "You gonna|watch the ball game? What in the world? "
{33109}{33161}Then he said he found something.
{33165}{33257}"Found something? I didn't even know|you was looking for nothing up there."
{33261}{33341}I'm all bent out of shape.|"What in the world's in my hind end?
{33345}{33441}Hope it's the remote control.|I ain't seen it in three weeks.
{33446}{33585}Dadgum, no wonder every time I fart|the volume goes up on that TV set."
{33589}{33667}Found something in my hind end!
{33671}{33797}That's the worst dentist I've been to|in about five years. I'll tell you straight up.
{33801}{33862}Tell you straight up.
{33867}{33973}A lot of people don't know it, but I used|to be a real psychic at fairs and stuff.
{33977}{34025}You know what I can do?|I was at the fair.
{34029}{34135}I used to be able to grab on|to girls' boobs, seriously...
{34139}{34198}...and tell how old they was|by doing that.
{34201}{34280}I used to be at the fair.|I had a little stool right there set up...
{34284}{34327}...had some key chains on it.
{34331}{34414}I'd tell them, "l can tell how old you are|by rubbing on your boobies."
{34418}{34491}So I'd be like, "Hold on."
{34767}{34823}I'm like, "You're 33 years old."
{34828}{34925}She's like, "You ain't even close."|I'm like, "Here's a key chain."
{34949}{35011}Get her done. That's right.
{35047}{35103}That's right.
{35113}{35219}I seen a girl walking around the other day|with earrings all over the place.
{35223}{35295}I was with a girl one time that|had nine earrings in this ear...
{35300}{35400}...seven earrings in that ear,|a ring in her nose, bolt in her tongue.
{35411}{35510}It was like making love to her|and working on my truck at the same time.
{35513}{35641}I didn't know if I should kiss her|or adjust the torque in her butt crack.
{35659}{35751}And my sister got one of them.|My sister's a big old girl.
{35755}{35887}I had to hire a rodeo clown to distract her|when I brung home the groceries last week.
{35909}{35956}But she got a belly ring. You believe that?
{35961}{36050}You don't get a belly ring if you're big.|You get onion rings.
{36097}{36192}I don't care who you are.|That's funny, right there. That's right.
{36196}{36273}I didn't know what it was. She walks in,|"What do you think of that? "
{36277}{36336}I'm like, "Hey, you got a hitch.
{36352}{36467}Yeah, now we can pull you away|from the buffet every night.
{36471}{36552}It's about time you done something,|for Pete's sake."
{36556}{36612}That's right.
{36615}{36719}I was watching the TV the other day.|People suing everybody nowadays.
{36723}{36833}You believe that? People getting sued|for smoking the cigarettes.
{36837}{36951}They say it cause cancer. They gonna get|sick. It says on the box you gonna get sick!
{36955}{37083}I'm gonna sue Hustler Magazine for giving|my wrist carpal tunnel. How's that sound?
{37087}{37142}That's right.
{37169}{37264}That's funny. I don't care who you are.|That's funny, right there.
{37268}{37373}You can't laugh at that, you need to|get out of here, 'cause that's funny.
{37389}{37484}That's funny. They want to take|the Winston out of NASCAR.
{37489}{37572}Did you know that?|They say that's offensive.
{37577}{37705}What in the world? Who's gonna sponsor|NASCAR? Stayfree mini-pad?
{37717}{37779}That'd be pretty good racing,|wouldn't it?
{37783}{37893}"We got 43 cars this year|in the Kotex Cup.
{37897}{38027}There's Jeff Gordon in the number 24|strawberry douche Chevy Monte Carlo."
{38050}{38135}"How did you get tickets|to the Tampon 200? "
{38139}{38251}"Well, we pulled some strings,|and we got some good seats in there."
{38269}{38341}Get her done!|Y'all, thank you very much!
{38345}{38430}Thank you all for a great show!|Thank you!
{38610}{38677}-ls this where it is?|-"Mist Spay."
{38681}{38731}-"Spa."|-Whatever.
{38736}{38780}I hope they can get rid of backache.
{38784}{38809}-Now, behave.|-Hello.
{38814}{38876}Hi there, we're with|the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.
{38881}{38995}Yes, we've been expecting you. Thanks|for coming. Have you been to a spa before?
{39037}{39063}-No.|-No.
{39069}{39120}Is this a non-smoking spa?
{39128}{39211}Yes. Well, why don't we do a tour?
{39241}{39292}Now, behave.
{39315}{39413}So this is kind of like|a really expensive wet T-shirt contest.
{39417}{39441}You got a dollar?
{39445}{39561}-How does it feel? What does it do for you?|-Put a dollar in the towel.
{39564}{39642}Go ahead and show.|Come on, baby, I got three dollars.
{39646}{39726}Shoot, I'll give you a $1 0 bill right there.|Look at that.
{39729}{39798}Get four, 35 and a half.|What do you bid now? Five.
{39803}{39874}What do you bid now? Five and a half.|What do you bid now? Five.
{39878}{39961}All right. By God,|you done made almost $60.
{40029}{40136}You got any more rooms with women|dipped in chocolate sauce like that one?
{40140}{40197}Do you have an opening|as a towel boy here?
{40217}{40240}What's she doing?
{40244}{40344}I believe you're doing it wrong. Hold on,|you go like this. You kind of hit on them.
{40348}{40400}That's nice. Do you like that? See.
{40405}{40481}-I love that.|-Now, that's how you give a massage.
{40497}{40582}Make sure you hit her hind end a couple|of times, like Wipeout or something.
{40728}{40758}Okay.
{40762}{40821}Okay, this feels really funky.
{40844}{40906}Hey, what kind of joint|you running in here?
{40911}{41006}There's nothing like a single-malt Scotch|at 1 0 in the morning with a little mud rub.
{41010}{41041}That's what keeps me going.
{41046}{41085}Hey-- Oh, God!
{41094}{41129}Hey, Ron!
{41132}{41214}Hey, Ron, I bet you look like|the monster from the Black Lagoon!
{41218}{41300}Shut up! I'm doing pretty good in here.
{41305}{41398}So I say we get naked and throw ice|at each other. What do you think?
{41409}{41461}-Hey, Larry?|-Over here!
{41466}{41585}Just remember, when you gotta go|to the bathroom, get out of the tub!
{41589}{41615}Too late!
{41686}{41788}-I'm starting to feel a lot better.|-Oh, my God.
{41825}{41885}I feel like a new man.
{41898}{42005}Ladies and gentleman, please welcome|a native of Winslow, Arizona...
{42010}{42100}...a very funny man, Mr. Bill Engvall!
{42104}{42188}What' s up?
{42277}{42380}It is great to be here tonight.
{42418}{42506}In fact, it' s just great to be|out of the house.
{42510}{42630}I'll tell you why. My wife and I had an|argument last week that was so stupid...
{42633}{42710}...that it bears repeating.
{42715}{42820}My wife collects twist-ties.
{42858}{42890}Welcome to my world.
{42938}{42989}What happened was,|I went to make a sandwich.
{42994}{43076}I took the bread, took the twist-tie off,|threw it down, made my sandwich.
{43080}{43140}Did I put the twist-tie back on the bread?
{43145}{43197}No. I did what every man|in America does.
{43201}{43316}I spun the loaf of bread|and tucked it underneath.
{43380}{43440}But apparently,|that's where I went wrong.
{43485}{43514}I got a great family.
{43518}{43592}I got a 1 6-year-old daughter|who just got her driver's license.
{43596}{43685}So drop to your knees and thank|the good Lord above that you live here...
{43690}{43750}...and not where we live.
{43754}{43835}She is without a doubt|the worst driver on the planet.
{43840}{43901}She's got no depth perception at all.
{43905}{43965}We came up to this intersection.|There's a car stopped.
{43970}{44027}I'm like, "He stopped. He stopped!|He stopped!"
{44031}{44133}She goes, "l can see that."|I'm like, "Oh, my God, she's her mother!"
{44208}{44320}The other day, my neighbor asked, "When|did you put the CD boom box in your car? "
{44324}{44356}I said, "What? "
{44361}{44461}He goes, "l saw you and your daughter|driving down the street, and I heard this--"
{44466}{44588}I said, "That was me stomping on the|imaginary brake on my side of the car."
{44666}{44782}I'm convinced there needs to be|a teenage driving lane on the highway.
{44785}{44881}And it's just lined|with mattresses and tires.
{44994}{45070}God, she's growing up,|and I don't know when it happened, man.
{45075}{45159}I used to buy her Minnie Mouse panties|and little Winnie the Pooh underwear.
{45162}{45237}I was helping my wife fold clothes.|I picked up a pair of skimpy underwear.
{45242}{45286}I looked at my wife and said:
{45314}{45356}"When you gonna wear these for me? "
{45360}{45432}She goes, "l can't.|They're your daughter's."
{45458}{45507}No, no, no!
{45564}{45629}There was nothing to them!
{45634}{45753}When the how-to-wash tag|is the biggest piece of cloth on there....
{45804}{45923}She's just growing up, and she's smarter|than me. And she's starting to realize that.
{45942}{46004}She came home and goes,|"Can you help me with my math? "
{46008}{46068}And I said, "Yeah, baby,|let me take a look at it."
{46204}{46261}"When did they start putting|letters with it? "
{46326}{46428}She's got a lot of friends. She's friends|with the popular kids, the unpopular kids...
{46432}{46494}...and she's in the middle,|which is where you want them...
{46498}{46584}...until they bring home one of their friends|you don't see eye to eye with.
{46588}{46698}She's got a little friend who's|into this goth stuff. Oh, my God.
{46702}{46758}Have you seen these little freaks?
{46773}{46806}What happened?
{46810}{46947}The black nail polish, black lipstick, black|eyeliner, black hair, Liquid-Paper-white face.
{46951}{47050}I'm sorry. Didn't we used|to call that Halloween?
{47068}{47166}They walked in the front door, and l|looked at that little girl and just went:
{47226}{47315}I'm trying to be nice, and my daughter|said, "Daddy, this is my friend Lucy."
{47319}{47442}And I said, "Hey, Luci...fer."
{47510}{47628}She looked at me like,|"l will set you ablaze right now."
{47644}{47698}Nobody tells you about that|when you have kids.
{47702}{47764}Nobody tells you about the stuff|you never hear about.
{47768}{47876}Nobody told me kids would get out|of their bed and come into your room.
{47880}{47972}My son developed this really bad habit.|He would come to my side of the bed...
{47976}{48032}...and he'd get that close to my face.
{48037}{48106}And just stare at me.
{48162}{48269}You ever get that feeling when you know|you're being watched? He'd be like:
{48330}{48380}"Dad.
{48416}{48470}Dad.
{48509}{48560}-Dad."|-"What? What? What? "
{48564}{48620}He starts crying.|My wife goes, "You scared him!"
{48624}{48684}I'm like, "Hell, he scared me!
{48688}{48773}Jesus, put a bell around his neck!"
{48812}{48881}And if I ever find out who told|my son this, I will kill him.
{48884}{48984}Apparently, somebody told my son|there's a wiener thief out there.
{48988}{49058}And if he takes his hand off it,|they gonna snatch it away.
{49104}{49223}His hand doesn't leave his pants.|It's like his own little worry stone.
{49228}{49280}He's just:
{49416}{49524}I told him. I said, "Boy, that thing's|got a shelf life. Trust me."
{49687}{49735}Then we had to have the big talk this year.
{49757}{49868}I was on the road. My wife called and said,|"You need to have a talk with your son."
{49872}{49912}Guess he's in trouble.
{49915}{50016}She goes, "His friends taught him to go on|the lnternet, and he brought up a sex site."
{50020}{50061}And I said, "Oh, God."
{50076}{50129}I said, "Baby...
{50133}{50200}...did you write down|the name of the site?
{50252}{50297}Just for reference."
{50312}{50358}She goes, "Shut up."
{50381}{50474}I wanted my talk to be more informative|with my son than my dad and l's was.
{50478}{50575}I said, "Dad, when will you|tell me about sex? " He goes:
{50584}{50655}"Here, just read this Penthouse Forum."
{50668}{50738}So I wanted my talk|to be a little more informative.
{50742}{50838}I wanted my son to know about things|that could actually happen to him.
{50941}{51056}I'm still waiting on the VW bus full of|cheerleaders, but that hasn't happened yet.
{51078}{51149}But I know kids today are much more|advanced than you and I were.
{51153}{51215}So I said, "Son, I know|you already know a lot of things.
{51219}{51295}So why don't you|tell me what you know...
{51299}{51376}...and I'll just fill in the blank spots."
{51380}{51440}About 30 minutes later...
{51444}{51513}...I'm sitting there with a pen|and a pad of paper.
{51541}{51597}I'm going, "You can do that? "
{51741}{51818}God bless my family. They've been good|to me this year. It's been rough.
{51822}{51928}I've been trying to quit smoking. It'll kill|me quicker than the cigarettes would've.
{51932}{52009}Anybody who's ever tried to quit|knows exactly what I'm talking about.
{52013}{52102}It is the hardest thing|you will ever do in your life.
{52106}{52177}And people who have never smoked|just don't get that.
{52181}{52258}My wife goes, "l don't understand why|you just don't put them down and quit."
{52263}{52311}I go, "Baby, I am trying. It is hard."
{52316}{52376}She goes, "l don't understand why|you just don't quit."
{52380}{52436}I go, "All right.|Why don't you quit yelling?
{52514}{52563}Because you can't."
{52567}{52661}And I've tried everything.|I've tried the gum. I couldn't keep it lit.
{52725}{52796}I tried the patches.|They pulled the skin off my lips.
{52865}{52947}Finally, my wife goes,|"Why don't you try acupuncture? " And I go:
{52952}{53023}"lsn't that where they screw needles|into you? " She goes, "Yeah."
{53026}{53084}And I go, "Why don't you try waking up?
{53088}{53200}I won't let somebody screw needles|into me." She goes, "It's your last option."
{53204}{53284}So we found this lady named Dr. Chang.|I had one question for Dr. Chang.
{53288}{53357}Anybody know what that question|might have been? "Does it hurt? "
{53362}{53420}She goes, "Oh, no. It no hurt."
{53424}{53510}From a door three feet away from me,|I hear a grown man go:
{53514}{53600}I go, "What was that? "|And she goes, "He big baby."
{53629}{53680}I said, "I'm a big baby."
{53683}{53748}Next thing I know,|I'm lying on this bed in my underwear.
{53752}{53830}She has screwed a needle into the top|of my head, three in each earlobe...
{53835}{53910}...one in each pec, one in each shin|and three between each of my toes.
{53914}{54027}I'm lying on that bed thinking, "Dear God,|I could use a cigarette right now."
{54088}{54167}I can hear her and her partner talking|in Chinese. I don't speak Chinese.
{54171}{54249}And then they start laughing.|I'm like, "Oh, my God!
{54253}{54311}They're filming this."
{54353}{54424}She comes in at the half-hour mark.|I think she'll take the needles out.
{54428}{54492}No. She puts a cotton ball|on each of the ones in my legs...
{54497}{54572}...Iights it on fire and leaves the room!
{54576}{54631}Now I'm freaking out|because all I can see...
{54636}{54761}...is smoke drifting up from between|my legs, and I cannot inhale it. Okey-dokey?
{54863}{54982}Finally, at the hour mark, she comes in,|she takes the needles out and she goes:
{54987}{55096}"You come back for another treatment."|I said, "Well, let's just book that right now.
{55100}{55188}After that, I'll schedule a prostate exam.|Just be a big day for me."
{55229}{55290}I put my ball cap on.|I'm gonna go home and take a shower.
{55294}{55333}I've sweated through this whole ordeal.
{55337}{55426}I'm standing in the bathroom in front|of the mirror. I took my cap off and I went:
{55430}{55492}She left the needle in my head!
{55665}{55715}I took my family|on an RV trip last summer.
{55719}{55771}I thought RV stood for|"recreational vehicle." No.
{55775}{55848}It stands for "ruins vacations."
{55855}{55952}I had never driven one of these things.|Dear God, It's 35 feet long, 8 feet wide...
{55956}{56028}...and got two mirrors that stick out|three feet on each side.
{56032}{56132}Good Lord, I was like a passenger|trying to land a 747.
{56137}{56191}I'm weaving all over the road.
{56195}{56272}I'm getting flipped off by kids|in car seats, all right?
{56320}{56424}Don't know why they put a reverse on these|dumb things. I never learned to back it up.
{56428}{56525}If I pulled into a Quickie Mart|too far past the pump to get gas...
{56529}{56584}...there was no backing up.
{56587}{56698}It was, go all the way around the block|and try it again.
{56718}{56748}Thank God I wasn't the only one.
{56751}{56850}Sometimes there would be seven or eight|of us just circling that Quickie Mart...
{56855}{56932}...just like a white trash road race.
{56982}{57074}I took my family camping|because I'm an idiot.
{57077}{57170}We're gonna go camping. We live in L.A.|We don't have any camping gear.
{57173}{57225}So I go to this store,|and I'm buying camping gear...
{57230}{57308}...and I saw this product.|And when I saw it, I just started laughing.
{57311}{57377}Because we've become|so ecologically-minded now...
{57381}{57497}...they've developed a product called|"Rapidly Dissolving Toilet Paper."
{57553}{57630}Just how rapidly are we talking?
{57641}{57753}Because I don't want to have to play|Beat the Clock in the thicket, all right?
{57803}{57850}If it's dark,|I can't see what's going on.
{57854}{57964}I got to know that toilet paper|is gonna be there to finish the job.
{58054}{58124}But the reason you|go on these RV trips...
{58129}{58190}...and these camping trips|is because as your kids grow up...
{58194}{58258}...they also grow apart from you,|and it tears your heart out.
{58262}{58358}My little girl is 1 6. She's at that age where|she's in her room listening to her stereo...
{58362}{58426}...online with her friends,|and boys are starting to call.
{58430}{58560}Oh, my God. We had a kid call the house|at 2 in the morning.
{58564}{58611}I lost it.
{58616}{58670}First off, I'm sound asleep|in la-la land...
{58674}{58752}...with Shania Twain|in the mountains somewhere.
{58789}{58890}I hear a phone ring and I'm like,|"Who's got a phone in the mountains?!"
{58895}{58974}So when I realized it's my phone,|I'm already ticked off. I went, "Hello!"
{58978}{59044}And this little voice goes,|"ls Emily there? "
{59049}{59105}And I go, "Dude...
{59109}{59194}...if you have a brain in your skull,|you will hang this phone up right now."
{59208}{59286}And my wife goes,|"Bill, you gotta be nice."
{59290}{59378}I said, "No, ma'am,|nice stops at midnight."
{59413}{59481}She said, "What will you do|when these little boys come over? "
{59485}{59581}"I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm gonna|pull the young man in tight next to me...
{59585}{59651}...so only he and I can hear|the conversation.
{59654}{59769}I'm gonna whisper in his ear.|I'm gonna say, 'Boy, look at me.
{59800}{59930}You see that little girl there?|That's my only little girl. She's my life.
{59933}{60031}So if you have any thoughts|about hugging...
{60035}{60128}...or kissing,|you remember these words:
{60141}{60232}I got no problem going back to prison.'"
{60498}{60576}God bless my wife. That's what|she puts up with every day of the year.
{60580}{60662}On our 20th anniversary,|I got to thinking about the difference...
{60666}{60759}...between that first year of marriage|and that 20th year. Wow.
{60763}{60881}Remember that first year? You'd pick a fight|just so you could make up and have sex.
{60885}{60973}Twenty years later, you pick a fight|just so they'll sleep in the other room.
{61095}{61168}That first year, you'd come home|from a bad day at work. You go:
{61173}{61223}" I've had a bad day."|Your new bride would go:
{61227}{61292}"Let me get you a beer|and you tell me all about it."
{61297}{61364}Twenty years later, you walk in the door,|"What a day at work!"
{61368}{61456}They go, "You want to hear|what went on at this house today?!
{61461}{61525}While you were at your job? "
{61611}{61687}That first year of marriage,|if you had to go to the bathroom...
{61690}{61778}...you shut the door, lock it,|turn the faucets on, turn the shower on.
{61782}{61855}God forbid they knew you|were going poop.
{61859}{61935}Twenty years later,|bathroom door is wide open...
{61940}{62000}...and you're screaming,|"Bring the camera!"
{62082}{62160}That first year, your new bride was gonna|do laundry and you freaked out...
{62164}{62243}...because you might have had|dirty underwear. So you threw them away.
{62250}{62331}Twenty years later,|you're just hoping to gross them out.
{62336}{62431}If you can get your wife to scream,|"Oh, my God!
{62436}{62489}Did you hit a deer? "
{62668}{62726}Sex changes when you stay married|for a long time.
{62731}{62803}I think it has to because|things advance, you know?
{62808}{62874}One night, my wife and I had|a little interlude, and it was hot.
{62878}{62942}I mean hot, hot, hot!
{62946}{63063}She's arching her back and moaning,|and I said, "Yes, ma'am.
{63067}{63121}You are welcome."
{63125}{63229}I said, "I'm really turning you on, huh? "|She goes, "No, you're on my hair! Get off!"
{63322}{63401}You never see that in the movies.|Do you, ladies?
{63405}{63511}I hate love scenes in movies. They're|not real. Show me a real love scene.
{63515}{63616}Show me a couple in bed, and their dogs|are watching them at the edge of the bed.
{63659}{63730}That's real, my friends.
{63736}{63786}You're trying to throw down|your best moves...
{63791}{63910}...and there's these eyes|at the edge of the bed, just like:
{63929}{63995}"Nice move there, Bill.
{64000}{64050}Jeez, don't that hurt your back? "
{64091}{64170}I take my wife's bra off|and throw it across the room.
{64173}{64227}Dogs bring it back.
{64242}{64317}I can always tell when I'm doing good|because the dog growls.
{64359}{64414}"She's loving this."
{64440}{64504}You ever get that cold nose?
{64616}{64679}But you gotta be able to laugh.|That's what's important.
{64684}{64768}Three years ago on my wife's birthday,|I had it planned to the tee:
{64772}{64820}A bottle of champagne|chilled by the bed...
{64825}{64930}...candles on the headboard, some soft|music playing, and we just got into it.
{64934}{64991}Just that hot pig sex, all right?
{64995}{65080}You're not even talking.|You're just rooting around, baby.
{65084}{65175}But we forgot about the candles|on the headboard.
{65178}{65271}I'm lying on my back. Apparently,|that headboard was doing a little moving.
{65274}{65349}Because all of a sudden,|hot wax just goes:
{65413}{65478}And my wife goes, "Yes, sir.
{65497}{65533}You are welcome."
{65538}{65609}God bless y'all. This has been great.
{65993}{66088}-Where's Fox?|-He went running around. He's like a kid.
{66092}{66171}-My granddaddy had this exact truck.|-Did he really?
{66176}{66261}Yep. 1 934 Chevrolet 31 00.
{66265}{66305}Can you see me now?
{66310}{66353}-Can you see me now?|-You guys see Jeff?
{66358}{66407}Yeah, we can see you.
{66430}{66469}-Where you going?|-Looks good, though.
{66488}{66541}Boy, they're making some money in here.
{66545}{66640}-Can you see me now?|-Yes, Jeff. We can see you.
{66644}{66700}Look at this bass.
{66711}{66769}-Look at that catfish.|-It's huge.
{66772}{66811}Jeff, we can still see you.
{66816}{66861}-Where?|-He's right there. Let's go.
{66865}{66932}-Good God!|-Let's go. Jeff, go take it off.
{66935}{66995}Dude, that's pretty good.
{66999}{67068}-That's pretty good right there.|-Get out of here.
{67087}{67164}-Coleman camp stove.|-That's beautiful.
{67168}{67210}Jeff, we see you.
{67232}{67280}-Can you believe that?|-That's a fake tree.
{67285}{67373}-That's Jeff again, trying to scare us.|-It's a fake tree.
{67454}{67526}-How did you do that?|-See what you started?
{67580}{67652}-I like any bait called "Spanky."|-Where might we find the stink bait?
{67656}{67750}-Does anybody work in this store?|-There's got to be a stink specialist around.
{67754}{67838}-We need stink bait.|-Do y'all have stink bait?
{67842}{67936}How would you rank the stink?|We want stanky stink.
{67941}{68049}-Stanky, sure enough stanking stink.|-Probably this one right here.
{68070}{68146}That's a good stank right there.|Y'all need to smell that.
{68150}{68198}Oh, God.
{68218}{68315}-Five bucks says you won't eat any.|-I ain't eating stink bait.
{68318}{68356}Just taste it.
{68366}{68437}-Oh, man! God. No!|-He did it.
{68441}{68484}-He did it.|-He did it.
{68488}{68514}Oh, my God.
{68519}{68577}-I cannot believe you ate it.|-Does he need the money?
{68649}{68726}Ladies and gentlemen,|the man you've all been waiting for:
{68730}{68798}Mr. Jeff Foxworthy!
{68881}{68934}Thank you very much.
{68996}{69048}Thank you very much. How are you?
{69118}{69174}Phoenix in July.
{69209}{69317}Apparently, the people that book|these things don't get the Weather Channel.
{69321}{69368}It's been one of those years for me.
{69371}{69488}In February, I was doing a show|in the northern part of Minnesota.
{69492}{69589}It was so cold-- Beautiful place.|It was so cold. It was like 1 5 below zero.
{69593}{69671}After the show, we were talking|to some guys backstage...
{69674}{69767}...and they were trying to talk us|into going ice fishing with them.
{69771}{69848}It's 1 5 degrees below zero.|I said, "Guys, I appreciate it.
{69852}{69903}I don't really think I want to be that cold."
{69907}{70048}One of the guys goes, "It's not that cold.|We build a bonfire out on the lake."
{70093}{70166}And you call us stupid in the South?
{70187}{70235}But I got to thinking about ice fishing...
{70238}{70345}...especially from the point of view of|the fish that gets caught and thrown back.
{70349}{70381}In the animal kingdom...
{70386}{70491}...that has got to be the closest thing|to one of those out-of-body experiences.
{70494}{70569}That fish that gets thrown back|goes back and tells his buddies:
{70574}{70657}"Dudes, I was swimming along...
{70661}{70789}...and all of a sudden,|I felt myself being drawn towards the light.
{70793}{70901}It was getting brighter and brighter.|And then I went through this opening...
{70905}{70988}...and I saw my dead relatives|all around me.
{70993}{71124}And I saw God. He was wearing|a flannel shirt and a Budweiser hat.
{71128}{71228}He held me and said,|'It's not yet your time. Go back.'"
{71333}{71438}One cool thing about doing this tour|is we've been everywhere in the country.
{71443}{71553}Traveling is never a lot of fun,|but since 9/1 1 it's so much more difficult.
{71558}{71663}I live in Atlanta. In the Atlanta airport,|where you go through the metal detectors...
{71666}{71765}...they have now built|a giant Plexiglas box...
{71769}{71818}...that contains all the things...
{71823}{71896}...that are no longer allowed|in your carryon luggage.
{71900}{71993}And in that box, there is a leaf blower...
{71998}{72065}...and a Coleman lantern.
{72070}{72202}So if you are an international yardman|that likes to work nights...
{72205}{72285}...you are S.O.L. right now.
{72289}{72396}A leaf blower. Who is hijacking a plane|with a leaf blower?
{72400}{72496}"Turn the plane around. I mess your hair up|so bad, your mother never recognize you."
{72571}{72630}If your job requires|you use a leaf blower...
{72636}{72726}...and you have to get on an airplane|to get to that job...
{72731}{72814}...it is really time to review your territory.
{72913}{73021}They tell us now the economy is bad.|You see it in the airports.
{73024}{73092}Because everywhere we go now,|all the rental car places...
{73095}{73160}...are selling the used rental cars.
{73162}{73218}I've driven some bad vehicles in my life.
{73222}{73329}I have never been so desperate for|an automobile I wanted a used rental car.
{73334}{73448}You know what people do to rental cars.|My mother will not drive 55 miles an hour.
{73452}{73575}You put her in a rental car, she's doing|doughnuts in the grocery store parking lot.
{73579}{73634}Buying a used rental car...
{73639}{73768}...is kind of like going to a house|of ill repute looking for a wife.
{73772}{73912}Anything that's been driven that hard|by that many people...
{73915}{73979}...you really don't want|to put your key in it.
{74167}{74229}There's no incentive|to take care of a rental car...
{74233}{74294}...because if you pay|the extra insurance...
{74298}{74374}...you can total that rental car,|and they'll bring you another one.
{74378}{74442}Always get the additional insurance.|They're like:
{74446}{74546}"Would you like the additional coverage? "|I'm like, "Yes, I would.
{74551}{74615}You got a Ford Fiesta|that's about to see more air time...
{74618}{74669}...than a skateboard at the X Games."
{74784}{74889}So welcome to our job. We feel|like we have the coolest job in the world.
{74894}{74970}It's funny, because you get|to meet a lot of people backstage.
{74974}{75046}When you're a comedian,|the number one thing people say to you:
{75050}{75091}"Where do you come up with material? "
{75096}{75145}The honest answer, at least for us, is...
{75150}{75240}...the best stuff is not stuff you make up.|It's true stuff.
{75244}{75305}That being said,|I have to share this story with you.
{75309}{75407}Last year, I was hosting a show|for the children's hospital in Atlanta.
{75411}{75457}A couple came up to me.
{75460}{75556}The man said to me,|" I bet you done heard every redneck thing."
{75560}{75641}I was thinking, "I've heard a lot of them."|But I love talking to folks.
{75645}{75686}I said, "No. Go ahead."
{75690}{75728}He said, "Well...
{75733}{75827}...my wife and I decided if we ever had|the chance to meet you...
{75831}{75916}...we had to tell you about the time|we were down at her family's house.
{75921}{76058}While we were there, her brother|got his nipple bitten off by a beaver."
{76226}{76291}I said, "You have my attention."
{76326}{76409}It's kind of hard to walk away|from a story like that.
{76414}{76525}You're almost required to say,|"How did that happen? "
{76529}{76583}They were happy to share the whole tale.
{76587}{76643}The brother and his buddy|were driving down the road...
{76647}{76718}...and a beaver ran across the street.|They accidentally hit it.
{76722}{76790}Then the beaver went down|into the ditch on the side of the road.
{76794}{76893}So they decided they were going down|in the ditch to find this thing...
{76897}{76973}...because they wanted|to take it to the taxidermist.
{76978}{77053}We know how pretty they look|on a Thanksgiving dining room table...
{77057}{77117}...just holding that turkey up.
{77179}{77261}So he said he went down in the ditch.|He found the beaver.
{77265}{77332}He picked it up by the tail.
{77336}{77479}And he said, "Look at it.|It ain't cut up or bloody or nothing."
{77483}{77625}Apparently, "nothing" is the word that|brings a beaver back to consciousness.
{77629}{77746}At that point, the animal lurched out|and bit his nipple off.
{77750}{77805}Did not bite it, bit it off.
{77809}{77892}O-F-F, off. Bit it off.
{77895}{77958}That is a new kind of hurt right there.
{77974}{78035}And it is so rare,|I am at a loss for words.
{78039}{78169}The only reply I could come up with, I said,|"l bet that is the only time in history...
{78173}{78259}...the headline of the paper could include|the words "beaver" and "nipple"...
{78263}{78331}...and nobody'd be offended by it.
{78431}{78478}The other question I get asked:
{78482}{78552}"When you say somebody might be|a redneck, what do you mean? "
{78556}{78680}For the record, my definition of "redneck" :|a glorious absence of sophistication.
{78684}{78767}That's all it is.|It can be full-time or part-time.
{78772}{78819}Most of us are guilty of it.
{78823}{78918}And if you're not guilty of it,|you do have relatives that are.
{78922}{79002}Think back to the last family reunion,|when at the end of it...
{79006}{79110}...you got in the car and looked|at your spouse and said, "Oh, my God.
{79114}{79178}What is wrong with them?
{79182}{79298}The little one is not right.|I guarantee you, the little one is not right."
{79373}{79415}I got rednecks in my family.
{79418}{79550}I got an uncle who climbs in and out|of the car through the driver's side window.
{79554}{79669}The door's not broke or anything. He just|likes to pretend he's a NASCAR driver.
{79711}{79771}Got a few NASCAR fans|in Phoenix, huh?
{79844}{79938}I love NASCAR.|It's a difficult thing to talk about on-stage...
{79942}{80010}...because NASCAR fans|will start fighting with each other.
{80014}{80080}Every NASCAR fan has got|that one driver they love...
{80084}{80174}...and every NASCAR fan has got|that one driver they can't stand.
{80178}{80223}Jeff Gordon.
{80227}{80291}It's always Jeff Gordon.
{80296}{80384}I've figured out why a lot of NASCAR fans|don't like Jeff Gordon.
{80388}{80492}It's not because Gordon won the points|championship and wins a lot of races.
{80495}{80614}A lot of NASCAR fans don't like|Jeff Gordon because he enunciates.
{80682}{80788}There's not a place in NASCAR|for that kind of stuff.
{80792}{80861}See, true NASCAR fans|want an interview with a driver...
{80865}{80949}...where you have no idea|what he's talking about.
{80962}{81061}"Boy, I tell you, we run pretty good|all day long and developed a bit of a push...
{81065}{81159}...and brought her in, booger-jacked some|wedge in her and she run like a spotted....
{81301}{81383}Did get trouble in the middle of the race|when Ricky puked a motor...
{81387}{81427}...and I touched Dale on the backside.
{81430}{81583}But for the most part, the Hardee's-Burger|King-Taco Bell-KFC Chevrolet is awesome.
{81715}{81806}As Southern as I am,|I'm like, " Dude, what?
{81811}{81873}Were there any words in that? "
{81902}{82013}Speaking of words, I do have|a few new redneck words for you.
{82063}{82147}First one: "mayonnaise."
{82197}{82279}Mayonnaise a lot of people|here this evening.
{82322}{82426}It's kind of a gift. They come to me|in my sleep. I write them down.
{82491}{82571}Brand-new one: "aorta."
{82587}{82705}Aorta cut that grass down by|the ball field so them kids don't get hurt.
{82766}{82856}Is this not the stupidest thing|you've ever heard in your life?
{82859}{82911}"lnitiate."
{82926}{82985}My wife ate two hamburgers...
{82989}{83075}...initiate a bag|of potato chips.
{83228}{83323}And last but not least: "with you, did you."
{83336}{83383}With you, did you.
{83389}{83465}You didn't bring your truck with you,|did you?
{83676}{83782}Somebody will be using|"with you, did you" tomorrow.
{83821}{83907}I always felt like you couldn't talk|about rednecks unless you are one...
{83910}{83960}...and I are one.
{83964}{84027}Growing up,|I didn't know that's what I was.
{84030}{84105}Now, looking back, it was so obvious.
{84109}{84207}I'm not making this up.|My entire childhood, our mailbox...
{84211}{84338}...had the letters m-a-l-e|painted on the side of it.
{84358}{84472}By the time I was in the 1 1 th grade,|I was like, "That ain't right.
{84475}{84540}That M is supposed|to be capitalized, isn't it? "
{84645}{84761}That is a true story. When I was in|the 3rd grade, my uncle did that as a joke.
{84765}{84809}And nobody got it.
{84951}{85080}Not only am I a redneck,|I married into a special breed of them.
{85083}{85201}My wife and her entire family|are from the great state of Louisiana.
{85205}{85280}We were down there|about six or seven months ago.
{85285}{85373}My wife's cousin got married|in Baton Rouge. We went for the wedding.
{85377}{85447}We had my wife's|entire family together...
{85451}{85545}...for the rehearsal dinner at Hooters.
{85574}{85643}If I'm lying, I'm dying.
{85652}{85790}And our waitress that night|was qualified to work there.
{85794}{85895}Matter of fact, I'm pretty sure|she was on a scholarship.
{85899}{85949}The first time she walked up|to the table...
{85954}{86018}...my wife's uncle, Bud, looked|at her and went:
{86023}{86081}"Where did you get them things, girl? "
{86190}{86331}I thought she was gonna get mad. She didn't.|She was cool. She said, "l bought them."
{86335}{86436}Then Bud's wife, Lois, said,|"I've been thinking about buying me some."
{86439}{86556}Bud turned to Lois and said,|"You are 62 years old.
{86559}{86613}You getting a boob job|would be like hanging...
{86617}{86685}...a new chandelier in a haunted house."
{86809}{86864}She said,|"lf I put new lights in the house...
{86868}{86949}...you might stay in it|longer than two minutes."
{87095}{87175}My children share these genes.
{87198}{87276}I will say this in defense of my in-laws:|My in-laws are nuts...
{87280}{87322}...but I know why they're nuts.
{87326}{87429}A long time ago, they looked at each other|and said, "Why don't we have children? "
{87493}{87584}I know I'm on my way to being crazy|like my in-laws because I'm a parent.
{87587}{87662}I'm the proud father of two little girls.|They're 8 and 1 0.
{87667}{87704}Thank you.
{87715}{87797}I live next door to my brother.|He has three children, all girls.
{87800}{87844}Their ages are 6, 8 and 1 0.
{87848}{87930}My mother has nine grandchildren.|They are all girls.
{87934}{87985}The oldest one is 1 3 years old.
{87993}{88083}I live in the estrogen ocean...
{88087}{88179}...in the middle|of the naked Barbie Woodstock.
{88184}{88248}Naked Barbies as far as the eye can see.
{88252}{88358}There are days I have fantasies|about being G.I. Joe on a three-day pass.
{88396}{88447}"Hello, lady."
{88572}{88651}But I love these girls.|I have learned so much about girls.
{88655}{88778}I've learned girls can be|a little bit more emotional than boys.
{88782}{88877}I spend half my life trying to figure out|what people are crying about.
{88881}{88973}" Honey, calm down,|and just tell me what happened."
{88977}{89045}" I came in, and I was gonna go|and play with them...
{89049}{89131}...but then they locked the door|and called me a stupid-head.
{89134}{89202}They said I couldn't be in their club.
{89206}{89289}I was looking for you,|and I was calling you and calling you--"
{89294}{89413}I'm like, "Honey, calm down. You'll scare|the children. Tell me what happened."
{89527}{89639}Men have no idea what to do with crying.|Men have been taught not to cry.
{89643}{89710}We can be out cutting firewood|with our buddies...
{89714}{89840}...we'll chainsaw our leg off at the knee.|We're like, "I'm all right. I'm all right.
{89844}{89920}Throw the leg in the cooler.|Hand me a beer. I'm all right."
{90135}{90209}Kids are great for a comedian|because kids are funny...
{90212}{90271}...without even trying to be funny.
{90275}{90396}My wife and my mother-in-law had ordered|bathing suits through the mail. Mail order.
{90399}{90477}So the bathing suits arrived.|They're trying them on.
{90481}{90561}My mother-in-law walks out|in her bathing suit.
{90565}{90610}My daughter looked at her and said:
{90614}{90729}"Gamma, you shouldn't draw on your legs|with a blue Magic Marker."
{90884}{91005}Needless to say, I had to mop up|the milk I had been drinking...
{91015}{91089}...because it was on the other side|of the room...
{91093}{91199}...which is pretty good distance|through your nose. That's right.
{91217}{91300}That's gonna sting a little while.
{91344}{91398}I was doing a thing not long ago|for HBO...
{91402}{91463}...and they were asking|serious questions.
{91467}{91547}One of them was,|"What's your earliest recollection in life? "
{91551}{91655}I said, "l remember being 3, standing on|the front seat of the car with my dad.
{91659}{91782}Every time he would turn the corner,|I would make the sound of tires squealing.
{91817}{91879}My dad would go,|'Quit squealing my tires.'"
{91884}{92035}All of a sudden, it dawned on me. What was|I doing standing on the front seat of the car?
{92038}{92155}Back then, kids weren't too good to go|through the windshield with the rest of us.
{92159}{92231}When my kids were 3,|I couldn't back out of the driveway...
{92235}{92331}...unless they were in a car seat|with a shoulder strap and a safety fit.
{92335}{92420}Think back. I can vividly recall|riding all the way to Florida...
{92425}{92482}...Iaying in the back window of the car.
{92603}{92694}People behind us going, "Harold,|is that one of those bobbing dogs? "
{92699}{92785}"No. That's a skinny kid with a big head.|Boy, what a big head."
{92796}{92922}My dad slammed on the brakes, you went|bouncing around the car like a pinball game.
{92974}{93093}I remember as a child, my mom would leave|me, my brother and my sister in the car...
{93098}{93153}...while she ran into the grocery store.
{93158}{93287}If you did that to a poodle now,|they would fry you on the 6:00 news.
{93309}{93382}Now that I'm grown|and have kids of my own...
{93386}{93483}...I understand why my mother didn't want|to take three young'uns in the store.
{93487}{93612}I would rather take a beating with a brick|stick than take kids in the grocery store.
{93616}{93657}Soon as those doors slide open...
{93661}{93769}...those kids start begging|like homeless people at Christmastime.
{93806}{93908}The worst aisle to take kids|down in the grocery store is...
{93911}{93987}...the cereal aisle.|I hate the cereal aisle.
{93992}{94126}You know why? Because kids buy cereal|the same way grown men buy lingerie.
{94131}{94264}They will buy stuff they care nothing about|just to get the prize that's inside.
{94318}{94365}You forget about the cereal aisle.
{94369}{94458}You're in the store trying to keep them|from putting stuff in the cart.
{94462}{94545}You turn the corner, and there it is.|And they're like:
{94587}{94661}"You gotta buy|the Fruity Frosted Pebbles.
{94665}{94753}Please. Please. Please buy|the Fruity Frosted Pebbles. Please."
{94757}{94870}"We bought it before. You didn't even eat it.|It went stale. We had to throw it away."
{94875}{94953}"We'll eat it today.|We'll eat it in the car on the way home.
{94957}{95057}I promise. I swear. I promise."|"l said I'm not buying it. Put it back."
{95062}{95165}"You gotta buy it! You gotta buy it!|You gotta buy it!"
{95496}{95550}And that is the point...
{95555}{95651}...when I very calmly walk up|to the child, and I say:
{95656}{95754}"Where are your parents? "
{95957}{96027}Everything has changed.|Even their toys have changed.
{96031}{96145}I noticed every toy my kids get has tags in it|showing you somebody has inspected it...
{96149}{96267}...to make sure there's no way a child|could hurt themselves playing with that toy.
{96271}{96413}I remember being 9 years old.|My parents bought me a wood burning kit.
{96417}{96503}What could possibly go wrong|with a toy like that?
{96507}{96607}A sharp, metal stick that heated up|to 5000 degrees.
{96612}{96678}Our dogs and cats didn't have tags|around their neck...
{96682}{96782}...but everybody in the neighborhood|knew who they belonged to.
{96796}{96886}"The Circle F brand.|That's a Foxworthy cat right there."
{96985}{97050}You remember the wood burning kits?|Remember those?
{97055}{97121}The cord on it was about that long.
{97125}{97252}So you're always guaranteed to be right|next to the drapes while you played with it.
{97261}{97336}What were they thinking?|Did anybody else have the swing set?
{97340}{97431}My parents were too lazy|to actually pour the concrete in the ground.
{97436}{97554}With our swing set, every time you swung|above this high, the front legs would go:
{97722}{97848}There were stuntmen|that would not swing on our swing set.
{97875}{97953}What were they thinking,|some of those toys?
{97965}{98017}Lawn Darts.
{98030}{98079}Twelve-pound darts!
{98083}{98147}You could kill an elk|with a Lawn Dart!
{98151}{98213}There were no directions.|They came in a box of eight.
{98217}{98289}We pulled them out of the box,|threw them straight up in the air.
{98294}{98323}Catch one with your head...
{98328}{98410}...you're getting coloring books|for Christmas for the rest of your life.
{98497}{98570}A lot of guys say to me, "Man,|how you live with all those women? "
{98575}{98622}I love living with all those women.
{98626}{98720}I've accepted the fact they just about|have me trained the way they want me.
{98724}{98805}A lot of men go through their lives|never realizing they're being trained.
{98809}{98947}If you got a wife, girlfriend, mother|or daughter, you are being trained.
{98952}{99065}And just because they ain't using|the cattle prod don't mean it ain't happening.
{99077}{99161}I been married 1 8 years|to an awesome girl.
{99165}{99242}It did not dawn on me until|about year five she was training me.
{99246}{99340}I remember the night I realized it.|We were both in bed reading one night.
{99345}{99392}And my wife said:
{99403}{99451}"I'm hot."
{99468}{99539}And I closed my book...
{99545}{99598}...got out of bed...
{99604}{99699}...walked over to the wall,|I turned on the ceiling fan...
{99703}{99829}...I was almost back to the bed|and I went, "Whoa!
{99897}{99960}I wasn't hot."
{99965}{100023}I guarantee the next morning|she called her mother and said:
{100027}{100107}"Mama, it is working so well.
{100111}{100215}Last night, I said, 'I'm hot.' And he got|out of bed and turned on the ceiling fan."
{100220}{100307}And I'm sure her mother said,|"Baby, I am so proud of you.
{100312}{100363}I'd put your daddy on the phone|and let you tell him...
{100367}{100451}...but I just said, 'I'm hungry.' And|he ran into town to get me something."
{100500}{100585}Guys, do you know why|they are able to train us?
{100589}{100638}They are smarter than us.
{100757}{100811}It ain't that big a deal.
{100815}{100899}That's saying you're smarter than|a creature that takes off its underwear...
{100903}{100956}...tries to grab them with its toes,|flip them in the air...
{100960}{100995}...and catch them with its hand.
{101016}{101095}You are smarter than that.
{101106}{101198}It is a good feeling when you catch them|on the first try, though.
{101209}{101259}Got my underpants, right there!
{101344}{101439}Women are smart,|and women keep men confused.
{101444}{101560}A lot of times, men and women can say|the exact same thing to each other...
{101564}{101618}...and get totally opposite responses.
{101622}{101671}A woman can say to a man:
{101675}{101728}" I'm not wearing any underwear."
{101731}{101802}The man's first thought is,|"All right!
{101806}{101846}Might get lucky."
{101850}{101941}But if a man says, "I'm not wearing|any underwear," her first thought is:
{101945}{102054}"Oh, no! I'm gonna have|to wash those pants twice."
{102244}{102310}And I've found from living|with all these women...
{102314}{102381}...men and women worry|about totally different stuff.
{102385}{102453}I wish I had a dime for every time|in 1 8 years of marriage...
{102456}{102527}...my wife has said, usually when|we're walking out of the house:
{102531}{102578}"How's my butt look? "
{102582}{102665}If you've been married longer than|1 0 seconds, you know the answer.
{102670}{102721}"Great!
{102725}{102805}It's so small I could barely see it|in this light."
{102835}{102923}Apparently, women put a lot of thought|into what their butts look like.
{102927}{102991}Ladies, do you know men are not|even aware of the fact...
{102994}{103086}...we have a butt till it starts itching?
{103108}{103218}A lot of guys aren't aware that|scratching it in public might be offensive.
{103275}{103343}Mr. President, how you doing?|Good to see you.
{103399}{103480}And men ought to keep our hands|off our rear ends. We should.
{103484}{103522}For a lot of reasons.|The biggest...
{103526}{103619}...is because we are causing|our own butt-erosion.
{103623}{103672}We are. Have you ever seen|an old man's butt?
{103675}{103804}No, because they don't have one anymore.|They've scratched it all off.
{103808}{103885}An old man's butt looks like|you made a frog stand up...
{103889}{103953}...and put on a pair|of double-knit pants.
{104036}{104154}When you go to sleep tonight,|I want that to be the last visual image.
{104158}{104221}That frog pulling them britches up.
{104521}{104616}I have lots of theories about women,|and I'm sure none of them are right.
{104620}{104689}But I found out women have|just as many theories about men.
{104693}{104765}Probably the most common theory|women have about men...
{104769}{104860}...I bet I've heard this one in every state,|goes something like this:
{104865}{104957}" If he's got big feet...
{104985}{105022}...then you know."
{105026}{105080}Or if he's got big hands.
{105084}{105133}Or if he's got a big nose.
{105137}{105178}If he's got big ears.
{105182}{105289}Well, he better be packing,|'cause that's one goofy-looking guy.
{105406}{105473}And, silly as it is, men do|worry about these things.
{105476}{105506}Ladies, bless your heart.
{105510}{105604}You have come up with all|these expressions to reassure us.
{105608}{105746}"Honey, it's not the size of the ship,|it's the motion of the ocean."
{105750}{105802}Which might be true,|but it takes a long time...
{105806}{105876}...to get to England in a rowboat.
{105923}{106011}Couple of ladies writing that down,|"Takes a long time...."
{106055}{106133}Time is something else|I've learned in 1 8 years of marriage.
{106137}{106198}Guys, when it comes to romance,|don't be in a hurry.
{106202}{106269}Because women are like diesel engines.
{106272}{106389}What I mean by that is it may take|a little while to get them warmed up.
{106393}{106428}But once you do...
{106432}{106560}...they can run a long, long time!
{106569}{106668}Whereas men, on the other hand,|are more like...
{106671}{106722}...bottle rockets.
{106979}{107080}You guys have been great. Thanks|for listening to me. I appreciate it.
{107129}{107173}Thank you very much.
{107272}{107320}I want you to do me a favor.|Keep this going.
{107325}{107413}Bring my buddy Bill Engvall|out here one more time. Billy!
{107451}{107560}Ladies and gentlemen,|Jeff Foxworthy, right there!
{107623}{107746}Keep it going. Bring back Ron White|and Larry the Cable Guy!
{107875}{107904}Ain't they great?
{107908}{107991}They are. You guys|have been simply awesome.
{107995}{108035}Bless your hearts.
{108046}{108094}Bless your hearts.
{108136}{108190}I gotta tell you...
{108194}{108330}...this show has been the most fun thing|I have ever done in show business.
{108334}{108452}The first night we started doing this,|we had no idea of how to close it.
{108456}{108571}When you're a comedian, the greatest|thrill in the world is making people laugh.
{108575}{108611}Your adrenaline goes so much...
{108614}{108682}...that there's no way|you can go to sleep at night.
{108685}{108740}We've all been friends|for about 1 5 years.
{108744}{108808}So we have spent so many nights|at the Waffle House...
{108813}{108901}...at 2:00 in the morning,|sitting around and telling stories.
{108905}{108988}So we decided that's the way|we would close this thing every night...
{108991}{109082}...is to come out and tell stories that|made each of us laugh through the years.
{109086}{109160}Everybody's got great stories, but...
{109165}{109202}...ying-yang, here....
{109242}{109356}You gotta tell the story about when|you took your sister to the flea market...
{109360}{109428}...because she was all bummed out.|Remember that?
{109433}{109487}I hope she's hot!
{109582}{109666}Yeah, she'd make Ray Charles flinch.
{109840}{109909}-My sister--|-You sick bastard!
{109913}{110038}My sister is covered with moles.
{110050}{110146}She's got moles all over her face,|bunch of moles.
{110150}{110234}And we used to call her "Old Moley."
{110240}{110370}But she went down to church and got saved.|Now we call her " Holy Moley."
{110425}{110486}It ain't funny, to be honest with you.
{110524}{110648}But she was feeling bad about her moles,|so we figured we'd lift her spirits.
{110651}{110744}Took her up to the flea market|to get her something nice.
{110771}{110838}She's already feeling bad|about her moles...
{110843}{110947}...and then the night before,|she got this horse and it busted its leg...
{110951}{110990}...and I had to shoot it.
{110994}{111102}And now it's got a broken leg|and a gunshot wound.
{111188}{111281}I don't know what you're supposed|to shoot it for.
{111317}{111423}I guess it helps in the healing process|or something. I ain't sure.
{111427}{111518}If it ain't better by next week,|I'm gonna shoot it again.
{111538}{111598}But we's at the flea market--
{111602}{111700}My grandma couldn't make it up there.|She got arrested at the bass pro shop.
{111723}{111807}She was eating a corn dog|and got the farts in there.
{111811}{111954}They accused her of stealing a duck call|and some stink bait at the bass pro shop.
{112148}{112175}It's ridiculous.
{112185}{112315}She didn't even have any pockets|on that nightgown she was wearing in there.
{112341}{112411}So we's up at the flea market...
{112415}{112500}...and my sister is feeling bad|about her moles.
{112503}{112562}She's complaining all day long|about her moles.
{112566}{112625}"My moles this. My moles that."
{112629}{112734}So we walk past this feller|up there at flea market.
{112738}{112779}Got no legs.
{112783}{112828}All right? Selling boots.
{112991}{113096}That's right. Got no legs,|half an arm, one ear.
{113100}{113130}His name was Lucky.
{113252}{113402}So I told my sister,|"Listen, Dee Wayne." I said:
{113470}{113554}"You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
{113557}{113603}You ought to be ashamed.
{113613}{113713}'Cause here's a feller got no legs,|selling boots...
{113717}{113770}...whistling, enjoying himself...
{113774}{113838}...and you is complaining|about a few moles.
{113843}{113903}Be thankful for everything|the Lord give you."
{113907}{114021}And she said, "You're right. I ought|to be thankful for what the Lord give me."
{114024}{114114}She started to get a little extra hitch|in her giddyup.
{114117}{114237}Started smiling a little more. As soon|as we passed that feller with no legs...
{114241}{114384}...I heard him say to his buddy, "Good Lord!|Did you see the moles on that girl's face? "
{114410}{114469}That's right. True story.
{114530}{114633}Larry, thank you so much|for sharing that with everybody.
{114640}{114712}Makes you feel better|about your family, don't it?
{114716}{114790}Yeah. Kind of like going|to the state fair every time--
{114794}{114839}Feel better about your own relatives.
{114872}{114934}It's Ron's turn.|I'll let you guys pick tonight.
{114937}{114987}He can either tell....
{114992}{115113}Either the story about when they put|the BENGAY in his grandmother's girdle...
{115122}{115225}...or the time he got thrown|out of the bar in New York City.
{115259}{115314}-We gotta go with the bar.|-New York.
{115318}{115354}All right, New York.
{115396}{115513}I got thrown out of a bar|in New York City.
{115517}{115585}When I say I got thrown out of a bar...
{115589}{115654}...I don't mean somebody|asked me to leave...
{115659}{115724}...and we walked to the door together...
{115728}{115808}...and I said, "Bye, everybody,|I gotta go."
{115821}{115943}Six bouncers hurled me out of a nightclub|like I was a Frisbee.
{115952}{116070}Those big old New York bouncers|that think bouncing is a cool job to have...
{116074}{116120}...they just think about bouncing.
{116124}{116201}They hang out with other bouncers|talking about bouncing.
{116205}{116296}They go home every night, watch|Road House and fondle themselves.
{116358}{116408}I walk into a bar with a hat on.
{116411}{116483}This guy, real pissy, goes,|"Take off the hat!"
{116547}{116623}I'm like, "What's the deal? "|He goes, "I'll tell you what the deal is.
{116628}{116732}Gay people in this area wear hats.|We're trying to keep them out of our club."
{116744}{116808}I was like, "Really?|The only way we can tell in Texas...
{116811}{116907}...is if they have their hair cut|like yours."
{117048}{117102}And he got all pissed.
{117109}{117151}But he walked away,|I took the hat off.
{117155}{117206}An hour later, I'd been drinking|and I forgot.
{117211}{117271}You ever forget? It happened to me.
{117292}{117365}I put the hat back on.|The guy comes over to me.
{117370}{117510}I'm between 6' 1 " and 6'6", depending|on which convenience store I'm leaving.
{117648}{117683}I weigh 230 pounds.
{117687}{117799}The guy comes over, poking me in the|shoulder with two fingers and says, "Out!"
{117803}{117865}I'm like, "l don't think so, Scooter."
{117903}{117959}And I was wrong.
{117979}{118031}They hurled me out of that bar.
{118036}{118150}They squared off with me in the parking lot|and I backed down from the fight...
{118154}{118274}...because I don't know how many of them|it would have taken to whip my ass...
{118284}{118364}...but I knew how many|they were gonna use.
{118647}{118729}That's a handy little piece|of information to have.
{118743}{118822}They called the police because|we broke a chair on the way out...
{118825}{118967}...and I refused to pay for it|because we broke it over my thigh.
{118976}{119040}The cops showed up,|and at that point...
{119045}{119158}...I had the right to remain silent...
{119170}{119238}...but I didn't have the ability.
{119384}{119518}And the cop says, "Mr. White,|you are being charged with drunk in public."
{119523}{119594}I was like, "Hey, hey, hey.
{119598}{119672}I was drunk in a bar.
{119685}{119815}They threw me into public.
{119850}{119911}I don't wanna be drunk in public.
{119915}{119976}I wanna be drunk in a bar...
{119981}{120024}...which is perfectly legal.
{120034}{120089}Arrest them."
{120163}{120252}He didn't arrest them. Instead,|he made me do a field sobriety test.
{120256}{120341}You stand on one foot, raise the other foot|six inches off the ground...
{120344}{120389}...and count to thirty.
{120392}{120430}I made it to:
{120505}{120568}"ls that gonna be close enough? "
{120584}{120699}It wasn't close enough,|so they call in for my arrest record.
{120719}{120792}There's some good news.
{120806}{120897}Satellites are linking up in outer space...
{120902}{120997}...computer banks at NASA are kicking on...
{121000}{121074}...there's a telegraph|in Fritch, Texas, going:
{121451}{121481}This part takes a while.
{121564}{121595}Shorthand.
{121713}{121798}Now, I told you that story|to tell you this story.
{121819}{121972}When I was 1 7 years old,|I was arrested for being drunk in public.
{121984}{122060}There kind of seems|to be a pattern there, Ron.
{122069}{122171}If you knew Morse code,|you'd already know that.
{122386}{122507}And one DWl, which was|a bogus charge because it turns out...
{122512}{122640}...they were stopping every vehicle|traveling down that particular sidewalk...
{122704}{122765}...and that's profiling.
{122802}{122880}And profiling is wrong.
{122895}{122944}On the drunk in public charge|in Fritch, Texas...
{122948}{123102}...the arresting officer, who I had|literally known all my life. You know?
{123106}{123215}This guy lived four doors down from me|in a town of less than 400 people.
{123219}{123269}We've met.
{123284}{123388}He takes me to jail. When we get there,|he asks me if I have any aliases.
{123426}{123534}And I was just being a smart-ass|and said, "Yeah. They call me...
{123538}{123594}...Tater Salad."
{123680}{123740}Seventeen years later|in New York City...
{123744}{123816}...I'm handcuffed on a bench|with blood coming out of my nose...
{123820}{123930}...and this cop goes,|"Are you Ron 'Tater Salad' White? "
{124022}{124063}"You caught me!
{124074}{124138}You caught the Tater."
{124142}{124207}Thanks a lot. Thank you very much.
{124274}{124317}Love that story.
{124402}{124483}It is your turn,|and you don't get a choice.
{124487}{124592}You have got to do some|"Here's your sign" jokes.
{124694}{124728}Thank you.
{124733}{124823}I had the great opportunity this year|to take my family to the Winter Olympics.
{124827}{124896}It was great being an American|and being in our home country.
{124901}{124993}We were renting a car up in Salt Lake City,|and it's got a ski rack on it.
{124997}{125048}We was putting the skis up in the rack.
{125051}{125139}The guy at the car next to me goes,|"You going skiing? "
{125159}{125252}I said, "Nope, we put them on top of the car|in case we flip over on an icy road.
{125279}{125341}Here's your sign."
{125456}{125497}This last year, I went elk hunting.
{125501}{125578}I got me a nice one, had it hung|on the den wall in the house.
{125582}{125660}My neighbor comes over and goes,|"Did you shoot that thing? "
{125664}{125736}I said, "Nope, he ran|through the wall and got stuck.
{125760}{125823}Here's your sign."
{125830}{125949}Tell them about the one when we did|the show in Buffalo. When they lost the--
{125953}{125978}Oh, God!
{125982}{126074}We did this show up in Buffalo, New York,|and we land at the airport.
{126079}{126152}We go to get our luggage,|and mine didn't show up, which happens.
{126156}{126267}So I go down to the lost luggage office|where everybody is in such a good mood.
{126272}{126343}Who applies for that job?
{126348}{126425}Who says,|"l wanna work in lost luggage? "
{126429}{126476}You don't have a good day.
{126479}{126584}That's like having a job emptying|Port-a-Potties. You'll catch crap all day.
{126617}{126712}That is beautiful.|Did you just make that up?
{126715}{126806}-It's beautiful.|-I like to use analogies in my show.
{126853}{126907}That's where they compare things.
{127155}{127290}"That's funny. I don't care who you are,|right there. That's funny, right there."
{127491}{127566}So I'm trying to be nice to this woman|in the lost luggage office.
{127570}{127632}I said, "Excuse me."|She goes, "Can I help you? "
{127637}{127684}I said, "Yes, ma'am,|you lost my luggage."
{127688}{127775}She looked me right in the eye|and said, "Has your plane landed yet? "
{127780}{127819}Swear.
{127873}{127972}I said, "No, princess,|I'm having an out-of-body experience.
{127983}{128050}I'm just checking on it.
{128054}{128109}Here's your sign."
{128168}{128234}I hate to stop you,|but I've got one for you...
{128239}{128292}...and I know you have|so many of these things.
{128297}{128406}This happened to me last week. We're|in the process of remodeling our house.
{128410}{128468}We've been doing it for a while.
{128471}{128553}We have the painters in there.|They're putting sheets over the furniture.
{128557}{128622}And we have a regular,|up-against-the-wall piano.
{128626}{128755}Last week, one of the painters says to me,|" Is that y'all's piano? "
{128786}{128895}"No, that's our coffee table.|It just has buckteeth.
{128915}{128983}-Here's your sign."|-He did not.
{129001}{129072}I'll keep that one.|I'm gonna keep that one.
{129099}{129232}Let me try one of these Bill Engvall,|"Here's your sign" deals.
{129275}{129361}I'm sorry. I did not mean to start this.
{129365}{129415}No, you can use this.
{129448}{129531}Your next album will go aluminum.
{129779}{129875}My grandma is covered with moles.
{129880}{129903}Oh, my!
{129987}{130100}No. My grandma recently|just passed away.
{130104}{130161}Hundred and four years old.
{130165}{130224}That's right.|But they saved the baby.
{130319}{130376}I don't think he's kidding.
{130400}{130492}My grandma just passed away,|1 04 years old.
{130496}{130621}So I go up there to the flower feller|to get her flowers...
{130624}{130696}...and a card up there|at the flower feller.
{130715}{130774}-Wait. No, wait.|-And I was walking in there--
{130778}{130886}You bought a card|for your dead grandmother?
{130929}{130985}They had them there.
{131019}{131109}I know I'm gonna regret this.|What did it say?
{131130}{131194}"Get well soon."
{131225}{131275}I knew it was coming. I knew it!
{131278}{131315}So anyway....
{131357}{131391}But anyway....
{131395}{131506}Hundred four years old. Passed away.|I go up there to the flower feller.
{131511}{131592}He said, "What is this for? "|I said, "My grandma passed away at 1 04."
{131597}{131689}He said, "Oh, 1 04!|How'd she die? "
{131694}{131747}How'd she die? She's 1 04!
{131757}{131831}"She wrecked her Harley|up here at Bike Week.
{131872}{131922}Here's your sign."
{131930}{131965}I love it!
{132080}{132169}It was better than I thought|it was gonna be.
{132191}{132215}Bill?
{132221}{132280}Bill? I got one.
{132314}{132355}My son...
{132359}{132390}...Tater Tot...
{132525}{132589}...is covered with moles.
{132665}{132762}My son, when he was 6 years old, was|gonna fly by himself from Dallas to Austin...
{132766}{132799}...to be with his grandmother.
{132803}{132868}I'm putting him on the plane,|his grandmother's taking him off.
{132871}{132926}The lady I was buying|the ticket from says:
{132930}{133047}"ls there gonna be somebody in Austin|to pick him up when he gets off the plane? "
{133147}{133300}I said, "No, I'll pin a $20 bill to his collar|and wish him the best of luck.
{133315}{133372}Here's your sign."
{133378}{133436}Those were three good ones.
{133540}{133633}-Bill, what do you say you try one?|-Yeah, let me give it a shot.
{133675}{133721}A couple weeks ago,|my car broke down.
{133725}{133810}I was on the side of the road, the hood up,|smoke pouring out of the motor.
{133815}{133907}This guy stops to see if I'm all right,|but he asks the stupid question.
{133911}{133974}He goes, "Did your car break down? "
{133978}{134063}"Nope. Car wanted a cigarette,|so I pulled over.
{134086}{134125}Here's your sign."
{134137}{134197}I was in the store buying some pants.
{134202}{134246}I put the pants up on the counter...
{134251}{134314}...and the girl behind the counter goes,|"You gonna buy those? "
{134318}{134418}"Nope, gonna steal them. Just wanted you|to see them before I left the store."
{134458}{134584}Tell them about the one that you|done did over at what-you-call-her.
{134611}{134738}"Yeah, Bill, tell us about the one|you done did over at that deal there."
{134743}{134849}He just ended a sentence|in nine prepositions.
{134879}{134942}He's an overachiever.
{134959}{135044}I don't know about all that,|but tell it.
{135065}{135119}I know the one you're talking about.|All right.
{135123}{135161}I came out of the mall one day.
{135165}{135271}The guy parked next to me is standing there|with a coat hanger in his window.
{135275}{135340}And I could not stop myself.
{135351}{135422}I said, "You lock your keys in your car? "
{135459}{135567}He said, " Nope. Just washed it,|gonna hang it up to dry.
{135593}{135644}Here's your sign."
{135694}{135722}But the best one....
{135731}{135805}The best one I've seen yet|happened in Los Angeles, California.
{135809}{135896}I got stuck behind a big rig that wedged|his trailer up underneath an overpass.
{135900}{135964}Me and the trucker are waiting|on the tow truck driver.
{135968}{136074}The highway patrolman pulls up and looks|at the guy's rig and at the trucker.
{136078}{136132}I'm thinking, "Dear God, he can't say it."
{136139}{136195}'Cause I'll start laughing.
{136199}{136276}Sure enough, he goes,|"You get your truck stuck? "
{136297}{136359}God bless this trucker,|without missing a beat, he goes:
{136363}{136467}"Nope. I was delivering that overpass|and I ran out of gas.
{136477}{136537}Here's your sign."
{136614}{136648}Thank you.
{136682}{136739}Well, folks, I can speak|for the rest of these guys.
{136744}{136804}This has been one of the most|awesome nights of my life.
{136807}{136886}And I know it's been good for y'all,|but I know...

{139934}{139986}No. I got one better.
{139990}{140095}If you've ever opened a beer|during a eulogy...

{140250}{140349}-I'm guessing one of your relatives.|-My uncle Jack.
{140353}{140454}I swear to you, Jeff, we were sitting--|We weren't even outside.
{140458}{140511}We were in the church.
{140515}{140603}The reverend had just finished|the eulogy and we heard:
{140643}{140743}We look in the back, he's sitting there|with a beer and he goes, "What? "
{141032}{141104}"Mama looks good, don't she? "
{141208}{141272}"That ain't Mama."
{141394}{141488}"No, that's her.|They just shaved her beard off."
{141690}{141738}Oh, my God.
{141797}{141848}"Forgot my beer."
{141980}{142125}As long as you're telling ones|on your relatives, I'm telling one on you.
{142142}{142247}This is one he did, and it's|about 1 2 years ago, in lowa.
{142251}{142334}I want you to think back.|A couple of DJs told me about this.

{142998}{143021}One more on you.
{143026}{143088}If you ever empty the bed|of your pickup truck...

{147553}{147608}-I feel like a hundred pesos.|-Look at this!

{148183}{148266}And now, I'd like to do a little something|from my honeymoon.
{148309}{148372}I'm doing a book signing in Alabama.
{148376}{148436}This guy comes up and said,|"Will you personalize it? "
{148440}{148488}I said, "I'll write whatever you want."
{148492}{148532}He said, "l want you to write:
{148535}{148690}'To Josh, please quit flicking your boogers|in your daddy's truck.'"
{148697}{148785}I'm trying to make conversation with the guy|and I said, "How old is your son? "
{148789}{148884}Thinking he's gonna say four or five.|And he goes, "22."
{149138}{149223}-2786. All right, big fella.|-Hold on, they're still flying.
{149322}{149367}This is stupid.|What do they do with these?
{149371}{149407}Take them to Hooters.
{149452}{149533}-I could sell used cars in Texas.|-You could.
{149631}{149728}Earlier today, we were in Victoria's Secret.|This is from Rhonda's Secret.
{149732}{149799}I found something that will remind you|of your prom night.
{149904}{149991}I'll have the Texas cheese steak.|The hash browns, I want with...
{149996}{150098}...cheese, onions, chilies,|jalapenos and hot sauce.
{150103}{150144}-What is wrong with you?|-What?
{150148}{150216}Does your cardiologist know|that you eat this way?
{150220}{150277}Believe me, Fox,|I didn't get to where I am today...
{150282}{150354}...worrying about what I was|gonna feel like tomorrow.
{150401}{150443}You're gonna let me die, aren't you?
{150522}{150570}-Oh, my God!|-Oh, no!
{150592}{150680}Go down there and stand like that,|and I swear I'll get it right by you.
{150688}{150724}How do you do this?
{150759}{150808}You son of a bitch!
{150856}{150912}This is beautiful. Look at this.
{150939}{151052}You might be a redneck if you've|ever slept in the Waffle House.
{151056}{151103}I'd like to go on the record and say...
{151107}{151181}...I don't think any of this is funny.
{151185}{151276}The director of this film|is easily amused.
{151643}{151735}Saddle that cow.|I'm gonna ride it till it spits.
{151748}{151803}Don't tell nobody I done that.
{151807}{151843}That's just for you.
Jerry and i met a long time ago...
...when we both tried to learn how to play bluegrass music.
And we both did, somewhat.
Then we formed our own styles because bill monroe...
...said the best thing you can do is go get your own style.
So jerry, he started the "dead" style of music.
He's the pioneer of that.
David, he started "dawg" music.
The last time we got together we played bluegrass.
Now we try to fuse our styles.
So we have a new tune that's kind of a combination of dead and dawg...
...or as we call it, "grateful dawg."
They were like two peas in a pod.
There they were, beards of a feather.
They were born out of the same cosmic egg.
They looked similar and did crazy things the same way.
How they'd grown up paying attention to music...
...the sum of those parts created an awesome duet.
There was a communication that was soulfully connected.
Each knew where the other was coming from.
David tightened jerry up.
Jerry loosened david up.
Friends that are great musicians.
They had a musical friendship.
They played music...
...they talked about music, they listened to music.
I've traditionally been more of a disciplinarian.
Jerry was more an in-the-moment type guy, and everything was cool.
So he kind of adopted a little bit of my attitude...
...and i adopted a little of his.
It was okay that he was his way...
...but when we got together, we tried to be more like each other.
Jerry and i met in 1964...
...at a place called sunset park in west grove, pennsylvania.
We were both there to hear bill monroe and his bluegrass boys.
He came from california, i came from new jersey.
People would come to hear the entertainers...
...but during intermission...
...they'd go in the parking lot and pick.
Then they'd hear bill monroe come on and then they'd go back.
An awful lot of friends were made in the parking lot.
People would jam, swap instruments.
I believe we did some picking then.
I knew who david was.
I had friends that had played with him.
There was the new york crowd, the cambridgelboston crowd.
There was a chicago crowd.
There was a berkeley scene, and l.a.
These people were aware of each other.
Somebody would make a pilgrimage.
Eric thompson came out to new york from berkeley.
David and jerry's roots...
...came from the same place.
They both loved the music from the south, the bluegrass tunes.
When they got together, that came out together too.
Jerry had that little lope.
You'd think he ain't gonna make it back there...
...but he always hit on the right spot to give it dynamics.
Others wouldn't have taken those risks...
...spending your career playing an electric guitar...
...and then playing banjo or acoustic guitar.
Beautiful instruments came into jerry's hands...
...through his connection with david.
Stemming from their love of music.
It was fun to give jerry stuff.
We gave him that huge banjo book.
It's, like, this big. It was $500.
One day, dave and i brought it.
"Here's a present. It weighs a ton."
- Nineteen pounds.
- One book, just on banjos.
He was, like, "wow!" trying to blow away the guy who has everything.
He turned us on to lots of stuff.
- Real pleasure.
- An endless source of imagination.
We had a banjo picker who was...
...a very deep person and multifaceted in his expressions in life.
And he could give nicknames.
He gave good nicknames.
He gave one to vassar.
Vassar smokes a pipe a lot so he was called clamp.
- Where is my pipe?
- Or clem, depending.
Me, of course, i was red, for "panama red."
John kahn played the bass, and both were called mule.
And the mandolin picker, he was known as david "dawg" grisman.
The man who gave us the names, his nickname was spud.
Spud boy. Jerry "spud" garcia.
When we met, david said,
"garcia lives just up the hill."
"He likes to play banjo."
We walked up there...
...and there's a little sign that says "sans souci."
Which, i think, in french means "no problem."
And there was this guy with a beard...
...and a blue dungaree shirt and jeans on and sandals...
...picking banjo, coming to the gate to greet us.
That's when the band was born.
After a few hours of picking, he said,
"we're old & in the way."
I thought the world of all of them.
What i really liked about it is, everybody got along so well.
And everybody wanted to play and to rehearse.
And it's hard to find that in a group of people.
That anytime anybody said rehearse, let's go.
We both lived in stinson beach.
So was peter rowan.
We started playing bluegrass for fun.
One day jerry said:
"I can get us gigs.
We need a bass player."
He invited john kahn, his bass player.
He also played upright bass.
That was the genesis of our little band.
I knew i was gonna get together with old & in the way.
I thought, " maybe we will go out and play bluegrass festivals."
People ask, " how is it playing with guys with long hair?"
I don't notice their long hair.
I notice how they play, what kind of people they are...
...what kind of heart they have.
That's what matters.
It's interesting how old & in the way approached bluegrass.
We decided to go ahead and play modern and traditional songs...
...and original songs...
...with the same approach that we played old songs.
In a way, it was too loose for me.
I'd played in tight bluegrass bands.
I'd played with the kentucky colonels and red allen...
...and i had this real discipline for bluegrass.
David was more the leader...
...of the music of old & in the way.
David could be tortured in a moment if the music wasn't right.
Jerry would say, "well, it's just another note, another set."
We did a lot of things with bluegrass, and you can tell by the effect it had.
Just 10 songs from a live tape...
...spawned a whole generation's interest in bluegrass.
To us, it was just a casual thing.
The record didn't come out till '75, two years after it was all over.
So this band had a career without ever really existing in real life.
My dad bumped into jerry.
They hadn't seen each other in 12 years...
...because of a silly business thing that had gone awry...
...that had nothing to do with them.
But you know how you have situations with friends.
The more time goes by, the more you're embarrassed to contact the other.
It's amazing they never saw each other...
...being in similar circles.
We both were booked on a session for pete sears...
...a local musician.
Sure enough, jerry comes walking up the steps and it was... it was like nothing had passed between them.
We just had a long talk for about two hours or something...
...and kind of re-connected.
We saw each other again at the village music christmas party.
David credits that as the initial genesis...
...when the garcialgrisman band idea came to them.
So david had been talking to me for several years...
...about playing at one of my parties.
When the garcialgrisman thing happened...
...i thought, "that'd be fun.
Want to do a christmas party?"
He said, "let me talk to jerry."
A week later he said, "we're on."
At my parties we had lots of musicians.
It wasn't just playing for your friends.
It was playing in front of a lot of musical peers.
It was a private function...
...but where there's a will, there's a way.
It resonated so deeply for me.
By hook or crook, i had to be there.
They wanted to do a duo but then thought of a rhythm section.
I said, "well, i have a pretty neat rhythm section. It's acoustic."
Jerry said, "let's try that."
We went through an audition.
I think jerry wanted to check it out.
He wasn't familiar with what jim and i were doing...
...or sonically how it would tie in.
I guess jerry dug it.
It was fun to see jerry...
...taking cues from others.
He was looking at all of us, and we were making it all happen.
He was a true member of the band...
...and he was ready to listen to what we were doing...
...and make that part of what he was doing.
For me to see him, especially at that point in his career...
...in the intimacy of the sweetwater...
...with david grisman, doing material that was up my alley...
...it was heaven.
They'd been apart for so long.
They revisited each other musically and emotionally, and it came through.
They got back together at a time...
...when they both needed it.
They both needed to do that together.
That was destiny.
Jerry said,
"we should make a record."
I asked him,
"aren't you under contract?"
He said, "no."
I said, "well, i just started my own little label."
He said, "we'll do it."
It was simple.
Jerry had a huge fan base.
But david was well-respected...
...for the music he had created.
So when jerry came to the studio, he wanted to put this stuff on tape...
...whether it was the jazz or bluegrass or jimmy cliff songs.
He wanted that music to come out in this form.
He appreciated what david was doing.
The fact that his work was calling attention to it...
...and allowing these other pieces to come out made him feel great.
Jerry went back and forth between electric and acoustic.
He had fun playing both instruments.
It was a chance to play acoustic music on a high level.
Jerry's one of those few guys...
...whose tone is the same on acoustic and electric.
- He had...
- and it's him.
It came through on both.
It's rare that somebody can do that.
I never considered myself an acoustic player.
I don't enjoy what i'm playing.
But now i'm developing the foundation.
I like the stuff we're coming up with.
Garcialgrisman was about everything.
It wasn't just bluegrass.
It was all the musical idioms...
...and styles that they both enjoyed tremendously.
It's american music. It runs across a lot of different styles...
...from rockabilly to modern jazz...
...to old-time and bluegrass and a little swing.
Gypsy, rock 'n' roll, reggae music...
...whatever they felt like playing.
They played well off of each other.
As a musician, i can really hear that.
That's hard for me to explain...
...but when two great musicians get together, that's what happens.
Both david and jerry were musicologists.
They wanted to feel they were part of a tradition.
They'd unearth these things and share them with people.
This was music we'd appreciated for a long time...
...and not tried to play.
We learned whaling ballads from a.l. Lloyd and ewan maccoll...
...who made a few obscure records in the late '50s and early '60s.
They were called blow boys blow and thar she blows.
It was just great stuff.
You know, old sea chanteys.
The sea chanteys are outrageous.
I've never tried that.
But i love the music.
We both share a love...
...for all different kinds of styles.
So we're trying all kinds of things.
It all feels good.
This is their connection with each other.
It's what brought them together in old & in the way...
...and it's what reunited them years later with garcialgrisman.
You play some acoustic music and play those old tunes.
You go back before you were born.
It's an older style of music...
...where the music ethos was completely different.
Jerry's very consistent with his emotional output.
He always has a great deal of depth.
He might hit a clinker, he might forget some words...
...but the emotional content...
...of what he's conveying in that music is, to me, pretty deep.
He had a way of really telling a story...
...with those tunes, those ballads.
He took on the character of the tune.
That was the biggest knockout.
Those songs were written before the recording industry.
Sung in town squares.
They were songs of the day, written by people.
The songs that interested jerry were the subtle ones...
...that had to do with aspects of life that we don't really think of.
When you go to sea on a whaler...
...you'd sing for people far away from their loved ones.
I just think that was something that rooted jerry...
...in experiences that he didn't have in his life.
It was the role of music in the richness of real life.
Not performing life, but real life, and how it sustained people.
Not for kids only was an idea i had.
I thought it would carve a new niche in kids' music.
Actually, the concept of kids' music... there shouldn't be a distinction.
Kids are people.
I think that's why we came up with that title...
...and that's why so many people who aren't kids like the record.
It's really not for kids only, but it is for kids too.
It exposed jerry garcia of the grateful dead...
...who was known for many things, but not...
...for turning children on to music.
David tried to get jerry to do kids' songs...
...but he said he didn't want to...
...because of this patriarchal image people foist on him.
He didn't want to feed that.
I remember that we wanted him to do the cover art for not for kids only.
One day he was there, and he sat in your dad's studio...
...and he drew a preliminary sketch for not for kids only.
He had to leave.
We'd say, " before you leave...
...draw a freight train.
Draw a little bumblebee."
That's how the artwork to not for kids only kind of happened.
Personally, this is also kind of a reaction...
...to the revisionist revamping of children's songs...
...that's current in the children's music world.
Well, anyway...
...there's a lot of nice, traditional songs that kids haven't heard.
A generation of kids, at least one, that haven't heard these nice songs.
How would you describe these?
What are they?
Bloodthirsty, violent.
American, you know.
I said, " hey, jerry, you want to try this kids idea?"
And he said, "okay."
I said, " i got this book...
...with 2,000 songs.
There's 'freight train'."
"Oh, yeah, 'freight train's' cool."
So we did "freight train," then we did "jenny jenkins."
We did three or four songs...
...and they came real easy and they sounded good, just the two of us.
And then jerry said,
"yeah, this could be cool."
The studio was so relaxed, it felt like someone's basement.
As kids, we'd play in a basement and have fun.
I imagine that it was like that for them.
"Arabia" was interesting, a kind of collaboration with everyone.
It came out of the drama happening in the real world at the time.
That gulf war was going on, and i had this middle eastern line.
I just tossed it out to jerry.
We played the parts that were there.
Jim knew this cuban song.
He threw that in for his bass solo.
It's just a hodgepodge of related things.
We kind of stitched this all together and it worked.
We did about 44 sessions.
There was never an agenda.
Never a planned agenda.
It wasn't, "today, we'll record..." we never knew what we'd do.
But there was so much spontaneity with how it would just evolve.
We'd sit out in the basement, around in chairs, and play.
Then they'd go, "great."
We'd take five steps into the recording room and turn the tape on.
Every time we got together was a recording session.
- Are we starting again?
- Yeah.
No, i mean, we will be.
- Say when.
- The tape was always rolling.
It was very relaxed.
A lot of great stuff musically, and everything between takes.
That's the attitude, man.
- Yeah, no matter what.
- We got a door open here.
No matter what, we're ready for you.
- Even if nothing's plugged in.
- Fuck, yeah, man.
They wanted to expand the tune.
I played this piece that i learned, which was a cuban revolutionary song.
I played it as we worked on the tune.
I was just messing with it.
They wanted to incorporate it into the piece.
We knew it'd be a long opus-type thing...
...that would tell a story.
It didn't matter that it was arabic in nature.
We just made it musical.
It's all like african music.
That's why we're trying to get over there with this song.
Right.
Incursions into the middle east.
Yes, sirree.
You want one take in a tune like
"arabia," which kept changing.
It kept building.
That was tough. You do one take...
...and then you do one more.
- And the next.
- We did it in sections.
We do stagger it.
Wait until we're all in...
...before you make the trip.
You've done that.
- I mean, here's the thing.
- He has been.
I do this.
I do that once.
Now, the next time...
...i won't play that part.
That's your part.
I play harmony, but that time...
...i had to play it three times...
...by myself, which i would cut out.
I mean, by that time... whatever. I think we all understand each other.
Dave, how are we doing for tape?
- You ready?
- Ready, ernie.
Yes, sir.
I mean, yes, sir.
My approach doesn't work with something like "arabia."
It's complex.
It has lots of parts to it...
...and it wants to be very precise.
It's good to have something rigorous.
It's mental discipline.
You know?
That's something that i shied away from most of my life.
Just sliding along on good luck.
The contrast between your approach and jerry's was great.
You would tend to want to push and jerry would say:
"That's great. That's good."
So, in your differences you had a great dynamic...
...in the way you sort of directed the sessions.
David would start things out faster than jerry expected.
Jerry would say, "are you kidding?"
We balanced being supportive and then kind of ribbing each other.
They would bicker and have spats about what kind of... if there was an introduction here, or whatever.
But they'd support each other.
You played a good solo though.
Whatever.
We sat across from each other.
I felt this kind of...
...electric wave going back and forth, or something like that.
It was really cool. It was just being in sync, you know.
With jerry, it was a collaboration.
I didn't take that much initiative...
...or try to organize anything any more than he did.
It would have been pointless because we were having too much fun.
I mean, we still got down to a lot of music.
David's a hard worker.
No doubt.
Anybody in his band is a hard worker, including jerry.
David made an effort to keep it very relaxed and comfortable.
There was no pressure for jerry to be here...
...or if he didn't wanna be here, no big deal.
Whatever jerry wanted was fine.
That was the premise.
Once he got jerry here...
"how about we do it this way?"
I was surprised at how many takes jerry would do.
I'd usually leave it up to him and he ended up being a perfectionist.
I'd like you to meet my friend jim.
Jim kerwin.
Jim's drinking a white seltzer.
Jim, are you enjoying your beverage?
It's a vanilla cream too.
- What do you think?
- It's like the rock group cream.
- I'd like you to meet my friend jerry.
- How are you?
He's a little weird.
- And this is david.
- I'd like you to meet my friend david.
- This is david's hair.
- Turn this way.
This is the padded cell that we play in.
We've just been to arabia.
This piece is a bitch.
At first i didn't know whose video it was.
It turned out to be mine.
In terms of ideas for it, i thought of how the song struck me...
...more than an image for jerry and dave.
We put them in an interesting setting with many characters.
We got them in suits and made a gangster motif.
They just had to perform.
I was as surprised as anybody...
...at what that they let us do.
I remember there was some haircutting.
They put a lot of hours into this project.
I don't think either of them woke up one day...
...and said, " let's spend
12 hours on a set."
The neat thing about jerry and david doing this video...
...is, it's them together.
They were together musically, but they didn't have a lot of time...
...to kill all day swapping stories.
They were both very encouraging and not just on this project... to do more videos and keep working on what you love.
Watching them doing that...
...it was inspiring that life could have those possibilities for me too.
- That's a good one.
- I love that rhythm.
That's a good song.
Shit, i love those songs, man.
They have freaky melodies.
It sounded great.
I gotta get these lyrics.
Certain amount of them anyway.
Tell you what, man, you can have the whole book.
I've gotta get it out of here.
That's the last good tune in it.
We've burned it out.
There's nothing left.
I'll type out the ones you want.
That'll be good.
I'll practice the good ones.
- You need a pencil?
- Yeah.
The two of them together created a big, comfortable living-room space.
And you felt that feeling of the easy chair...
...and the relaxed atmosphere.
I think jerry coming over and hanging with my dad was... it was a safe haven.
He could come and there was no pressure to be jerry.
He had a burden being the king of the deadheads.
Jerry garcia of the grateful dead, icon of '60s american rock 'n' roll.
Here, he was just one of the guys.
It was about hanging out, playing music, talking about music...
...and eating some food...
...and doing some more of all of the above.
He used to call me "squirt."
Just squirt, for short, of sam.
I don't remember him calling me that, but my dad's always saying it.
I think he loved the idea that it was at a home...
...david's home, and david's family was there.
It was just something very warm and cozy.
Jerry enjoyed that david had created that.
I think we should do a project like my bluegrass thing...
...but get different guys to do tunes with.
I'm into doing that in the fullness of time.
That's the only problem, getting hunks of uninterrupted time.
- It's really a bitch.
- Right.
If i knew in advance certain days, i could set things up.
- Right.
- Whatever.
We'll do it. It'll all come together at various times.
At the end of this next year...
...i'll have four or five months.
I don't wanna put any pressure on you.
No pressure.
I love it. It's good for me.
Jerry said, "we can do this for the rest of our lives."
And we did.
We were always in the process.
But once he died, i realized,
"well, this is it."
- You need something?
- No, i was just remembering something.
He liked all genres of music.
He was just a great guy.
When we lost him, it was beyond tears for me.
I knew that a part of me and a part of him were just lost.
He'll still always be inside of me, but i just... that's a shame.
A lot of great music has been played in this house...
...but something about jerry and david together made it possibly...
...more fun than we have ever experienced in this house.
It was a place that they went to in the studios or the warfield...
...where they both left their worlds.
David was a little more in his world.
Still, they had another world that they created together.
It sounds like they couldn't wait to be together...
...each time to play together.
Whether they said it or not, it comes off that way.
Jerry saw something in david...
...that resulted in this flowering of garcia's music...
...through david's efforts in jerry's last years.
David's pushed me a long way now.
I'm happy with my progress.
And insofar as we keep doing this, it keeps challenging me.
I hope to get better yet.
Jerry left behind quite a legacy.
Thousands of grateful dead tunes and recordings.
But there was a whole part of him...
...that hadn't been expressed the way he wanted.
It came out in those last five years.
He expressed that with my dad, and it's on tape...
...for all to share and listen.
That's jerry.
I pretend like he didn't go anywhere.
I won't see him anymore.
I keep all those good aspects, hanging out with me, you know.
I could imagine how he would react to something.
I just adopted a philosophy of...
..."take up a little slack, become a little more jerry-like."
I was born in Berlin, Germany.
My father and mother had a fur business in Germany.
And I have a brother who was a year younger.
We lived very comfortable, had a nice life in Germany.
I remembered that huge, beautiful building... with gardens all around and a stream going through it.
I lived there with my grandmother.
I went to a Jewish school- a private school.
Had a nice girlfriend there,
Anna-Marie... whom I was very friendly with, and we spent a lot of time together.
My sister went to another school.
She was older.
I had my dolls.
My mother made clothes for my dolls.
My father was a peddler in Germany which meant basically... he would go to a place and buy textiles... cut in three-yard length.
Then he’d go into villages and sell them door-to-door.
Usually when my father would return, if it was a successful trip... he brought back toys from the various villages, and that was exciting.
We used to go to the suburbs of Breslau on picnics.
In the winter we went to Czechoslovakia... to a place called Spindleruv Mlyn... where my parents went skiing and I went sleigh riding.
Jews in Germany felt at home and felt it was their vaterland... where they could live forever, and they felt at home with German culture.
They felt proud of
Germany's achievement... and of Jewish contributions to Germany.
While on the one hand German Jews- especially when Hitler rose- started writing a spate of books called Jewish Contributions to Germany...
Jewish Contributions to Civilizations- were not aware of the fact that the
Germans looked at it quite differently.
Instead of saying, look how much we contributed to law... to journalism- created a whole new genre- to medicine and science... the Germans said,
"You took over our science.
You took over our law.
You took over the newspapers. "
In 1933, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party rose to power in Germany.
They immediately acted on their ideology of racial discrimination and violence.
I came home from school... and the Nazi party was marching on the street... and everybody's standing on the side and saluting.
Suddenly they said-
That means "Hit the Jews. " They grabbed a few people and started beating them.
They were yelling,
"We are no Jews. We are no Jews. "
They kept on beating them for the cameras that were set up.
Till one day, in the usual ice cream parlor... we couldn't go in anymore... and we were just beginning to learn how to read.
That's when the signs came up all over.
"No Jews, no dogs" in the stores.
"No Jews, no dogs" on the benches.
Couldn't quite understand what this was all about... but I remember my grandmother taking us by the hand and says, "Haroldchen. "
That's how she used to call me.
"We can't go in here anymore.
We'll get ice cream some other place. "
Yeah, this "Jews and dogs forbidden" was all over.
I had non-Jewish boys to play with... and then sometime-
I don't remember what year it was- none of my non-Jewish friends... would play with me, talk to me- just disregard me.
My next memory actually was of our doorbell ringing at midnight.
I imagine it was shortly thereafter.
My parents wondering who's ringing the doorbell at midnight.
It was my uncle, my mother's brother.
He says, "I've got my chauffeur waiting downstairs.
I'm on my way to France via Switzerland... because it's the end for the Jews in Germany.
I think you should come with us. "
He had always been a bit of an eccentric, this particular brother... so, when my father heard it, he says,
"The meshuggener Leo.
What a crazy idea he has.
This madman's not gonna last. Things like that have happened before to the Jews.
Impossible. Besides,
I fought in the First World War... and we've been German for generations.
We've lived here.
Let's wait and see. "
In July, 1938...
President Roosevelt convened the Évian Conference... to try and solve the refugee problem in Germany.
But the conference ended with no solutions.
The refugees had nowhere to go.
Every country was told at the Évian Conference... that they do not have to take more than their usual quota.
Britain won out in that Palestine was not mentioned as a haven.
Goebbels writes in his diary...
"They are shedding crocodile tears.
They want us to do their job for them... and they really don't want the Jews as much as we don't. "
So the Évian Conference showed Hitler... that the world didn't give a damn.
In 1938, a young Jewish man... enraged at the treatment of his parents by the Nazis... shot and killed a German diplomat in Paris.
The Nazis used the incident as a pretext to orchestrate violent riots against Jews.
Thousands of shops were looted and destroyed... and virtually all synagogues in Germany were burned.
Ninety-one Jews died, hundreds wounded.
The police were told not to interfere.
This night was called Kristallnacht.
"The Night of the Shattered Glass. "
When the ninth of November came along... and the Nazis wanted to get into our house... the Hausmeister, who was a big Communist before 1933-
After 1933, of course, he became a big Nazi.
He was standing in front of the building in his uniform... and saying, "There are no Jews in this building. Keep on going. "
That saved us at that time.
My father put on the radio, and all he heard was martial music.
He went out.
He wasn’t sure.
He didn't like to see what was happening.
He decided to go into hiding.
When we got out the next few days...
I saw the glass... and the burning synagogues and all that.
We walked over to my grandmother's house to see if they were all right.
I remember the crunching glass under my feet.
Even now, more than 60 years later,
I can still remember it.
The day after Kristallnacht, my parents and I walked out of our house... and the grocery store near us, which was owned by a Jewish family-
The windows were shattered and had "Dirty Jew" on it.
Then we walked to the synagogue which we attended... and as we walked by we saw in the courtyard of the synagogue... there was a mound of ashes.
It was clear that these were prayer books.
Sticking out of the center of the mound were the scrolls of the Torah.
I remember being terrified by that... because I had just learned... that if the Torah was dropped in the synagogue, even by accident... the whole congregation would have to fast for 40 days.
And here I saw the Torah is being burned.
Internally I said to myself...
"There's no safety for us anywhere. "
All of a sudden... almost all Germans sought a way out.
"Where can we go?
Where can we find a haven?
Where can we get out?"
Of course, the lines on all the embassies and consulates... were blocks long with the attempts to find a haven.
The American consulate closed their doors... and no visas were ever given out again.
You couldn't get into America.
You couldn't get to England.
You couldn't get to any of these places because we had no passports, no visas.
The quota numbers were very small.
Among non-Jewish people that lived in our house... one of the men was a very high officer in the German air force... who warned my father not to stay in Europe.
He says, "We are going to conquer all of Europe. "
My father fortunately felt the same way.
He was a peddler... and arranged with 11 other people... to pay someone to get him across the border to Belgium.
They did make it across the border... and they were picked up by the Belgian authorities... who turned them back to the Gestapo who turned them over to Dachau.
One of the ways in which the Austrian Jews were encouraged to leave... was to arrest the men... and incarcerate them... in concentration camps... and then saying, "The only way you're going to get your men back-"
To these women who were left behind, the families that were left behind.
"The only way you can get them is if you leave within a month...
24 hours, two weeks, two months," or whatever they decided.
My father decided to come out of hiding.
It seems the Christian landlord told him, "Don't. "
He went to the friend's house to pick me up.
It so happened the Gestapo was in the same house.
He got picked up, and he was sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp.
I was picked up on the street... taken with all other Jews to Sachsenhausen.
We were standing there, and the command came out...
"Anybody below 14 and over 80, step forward. "
So, I was 13.
I stepped forward.
They put us on a truck, and they sent us back home.
I spent one day.
So, all of a sudden, there developed- first in Vienna- a haven that nobody dreamed of before.
There's a place you can go to without a visa, without papers.
It was extraordinary.
How could there be such a thing?
It was hard to imagine.
Where are you going?
8,000 miles away.
Shanghai... a sprawling port city on the east coast of China... was forced by the British to trade with the West... after the Opium Wars of the 1840s.
Powerful and decadent... tremendously wealthy and miserably squalid... voracious and corrupt... it became the commercial center of China.
To sustain their booming trade... the West created a section of the city where Western law ruled.
It was called the International Settlement.
Later on, the French created their own settlement called the French Concession.
The International Settlement... had grown up, since mid-19th century... outside of the walled town of Shanghai.
Shanghai was a town with walls around it... and the International Settlement grew up outside of it.
They built up those ports.
They built up all of them- not only Shanghai, but that was the biggest one- into a major world harbor... where the settlement created a tremendous boom.
There were two Jewish communities in Shanghai.
The first group came following the British during the late 19th century.
They were Baghdadi businessmen and their families.
As British subjects, they were able to take part in the booming Shanghai trade.
They were English-speaking.
They did business with the British.
They did very well by doing business with the British.
Some of them were enormously wealthy... like the Kadoorie... the Sassoon... and the Hardoon families.
The second community consisted of Russian Jews... who immigrated to China mostly to escape the Communist revolution in 1917.
Although not as affluent as the Baghdadi Jews... they also had a rich community life.
The Russian Jewish community which existed- the second one- grew up parallel but not identical... or mixed with the Sephardim.
They were separate and unequal.
In 1937.. began the war to attack the Chinese garrisons... in the outskirts of China.
From that time began the Sino-Japanese War.
In the Sino-Japanese War of 1937.. the Japanese conquered large parts of China... including Shanghai.
As it turned out, that was the only avenue of escape-
Shanghai- without papers.
All you needed really was passage on a ship.
What is not widely known, in '38, before the beginning of the war... you could get out of Dachau if you could leave the country.
If he could have left the country... he wouldn't have gotten smuggled into Belgium.
So, he was in Dachau for about 20 days.
During that time my mother found out... that you could go to the Japanese-occupied portion of Shanghai without a visa.
One did not need a visa to come to Shanghai.
But that is wrong.
Because visas were indeed required... in order to purchase a ship ticket.
Passport control, however... after July, 1937... was no longer in Chinese hands.
As a matter of fact, nobody controlled passports... because the foreign powers did not want to control passports... because then the Japanese would have said, "We want to control passports"... and the foreign powers... did not want the Japanese to control passports of foreigners... and therefore nobody controlled passports.
She decided to buy steamship tickets for Shanghai.
How did she have the money?
It wasn't that easy either.
We had money, but the bank accounts were frozen.
However, we were allowed to draw household expenses from our own moneys.
So my mother inflated, as much as she was able to, what she needed... and was very frugal on spending it.
But she did go and get the steamship tickets... for leaving on the Hakozaki Maru... a Japanese steamer... the following February from Naples, Italy.
My father was always very careful with money.
He had money put aside.
Most of that went for... bribing the NYK Line people to give us tickets... because if we hadn't gotten out by the middle of May...
I wouldn't be sitting here today.
I remember my grandfather- It's one of those things that sits in your ear-
You hear it.
He used to say to her, "Fuffchen. "
He called her Fuffchen.
"Where you taking the kid to?"
"To the Chinesin. "
"No, no. Forget it. "
He said, "Yeah.
I'm taking my boy. I'm getting out. "
On my mother's birthday, which was
December 5, 6:00 in the morning... the bell rang... and at that time if you heard a bell ring at any hour... but particularly at an ungodly hour, you might say... it did not sound too good.
I remember all of us huddling in the little hallway... as my mother opened the door, and there was my father.
He had come home from Buchenwald.
With much trepidation, she told my father...
"We're not waiting for a United States visa.
I got tickets to go to Shanghai. "
She expected him to make a big fuss... and all he said was... in today's vernacular...
"If we had left yesterday, it wouldn't be soon enough. "
We left Germany in...
1939 in May.
We said good-bye to my grandparents.
It was chaos.
My mother was screaming.
My aunt was screaming.
They were very volatile.
It was terrible. Awful.
And, you know, the Germans never came out to say good-bye.
They watched from behind the curtains.
We could see them, and they didn't come out.
They knew my mother since she was a little girl.
They didn't come out. They didn't say anything. They were really terrified... and also probably glad to see us leave.
At the train station there was the whole family there.
I see it like you’re sitting in front of me.
I see it like you're sitting in front of me.
Under Anhalter Bahnhofin Berlin.
Everybody.
Everybody. Bruno.
Omi-Sozia, Ada, Mietek.
The cousins-Judith, Margot.
All names today are-
It's a long time ago.
But a lot of people.
A lot of people.
And they're all gone.
I had to say good-bye to Anna-Marie, my girlfriend... and all of that.
I give talks in schools... and I talk about Anna-Marie, especially to the age group that- the nine-year-olds, the 10-year-olds.
I always talk about
Anna-Marie and say...
"If you ever hear about anyone called Anna-Marie Wallenberg... let me know. "
I get letters from them.
One little girl wrote a letter back, and she said...
"Don't worry if you don't find Anna-Marie.
When you go to heaven, you'll find her there. "
When the train reached the Italian border... and the Gestapo came on board the train... and my mother telling me...
"I want you to be very quiet.
Don't say a word.
Don't look up. Don't move.
Don't ask for anything.
Just sit. "
Funny how kids sometimes know that it's really serious business.
I was eight years old, and I did just that.
So I remember the Gestapo coming aboard the train to check papers... but I didn't see faces
'cause I was looking down.
My mother told me not to look up.
All I saw was black boots marching back and forth... and them saying "Papiere, " you know, "papers. "
The passports and whatever else was needed- the permission.
They went through the whole train... and after they got it from everybody, they left the train... and the train started again and crossed the border into Italy.
Everybody cheering and clapping.
They had champagne corks popping.
We were out of Germany.
Shanghai became a real option... for those Jews who had no place to go.
They scrambled to buy all the luxury ship tickets... to go to Shanghai... because that was the only way you can go at that point.
Got on the ship.
That was the Kashima Maru.
It was weird because it looked like a pleasure cruise... with the streamers and the music- the orchestra- a Japanese real snappy orchestra.
We thought we were on holiday, my sister and me.
I was nine, and she was 11.
So we had fun. We had a stewardess who was assigned to take care of us... and they gave us little cakes and little dolls.
We had tea parties.
We took a ship in Naples- a Japanese ship by the name of Hakusan Maru.
It was a beautiful four-week trip.
Long, beautiful trip.
I enjoyed every moment of it.
I didn't realize really what was going on in the world. We were too young for that.
My mother bought first-class passage.
So we had a relatively luxurious cabin... and there was more food than anyone could ever eat.
I remember vividly throughout the trip... my mother kept saying
I should eat everything in sight.
At that time we were kosher.
We basically ate the fruits... and the vegetables and much of the pastry.
In Port Said, the ship actually anchored... and I remember those sand dunes on both sides.
They later told us that a few young Jews-
German Jews, Polish Jews- jumped the ship... and actually tried to make their way to Palestine.
What's Israel today.
I don't know.
There was a recurrent theme.
She was saying, "Eat, eat, eat"... because who knows what will happen when we get to Shanghai.
Got off the ship in Shanghai... if I remember correctly... that was the shock of a lifetime.
It was completely different from anything you could imagine.
Absolutely different.
Nothing could prepare you for what we saw there.
I actually remember feeling very, very afraid.
I didn't know where I was.
I t was a whole different world... in overnight from white to black or from black to white.
In 1937, what was conquered was not the International Settlement... not the French Concession... but the Chinese portion of the town.
The Japanese did not want to establish a concession of their own... but they took a piece of the International Settlement... and that they said is under our military control.
And that is Hongko.
Hongko- or Hongke was some called it- was one of the poorest sections of Shanghai.
Badly battered in the war with the Japanese... it was home to poor Chinese... occupying Japanese and many Jewish refugees... who had little means to support themselves.
We landed in Hongkew, which is the place where all the ships landed- particularly the refugee ships.
It was very dirty.
It was terribly hot and very humid.
The heat is terrible there.
And crowded and smelly.
Thousands of people running around.
Chinese beggars with open sores.
It was just awful.
Shanghai was not prepared for this kind of an influx- for these waves and waves... shiploads- shipload after shipload.
One of my father's friends who had gone there before us... had rented us a room... in one of the little lanes that they have in Hongkew.
The room was fairly clean... but it was just one small room for our family... another small one for my uncle and my aunt.
No kitchen facilities. very poor bathroom situation.
No what they called WC's over there- water closet.
No flush toilets.
Buckets.
The first home was also on Wayside Road.
Further down on Wayside Road in a lane in an alley.
All of Shanghai was alleys and lanes.
Cars don't go through there. Bicycles.
With a wagon you can pull through there.
Very narrow, very crowded, very tight.
Not too much air.
Not too much light.
That's how people lived in those days.
So, a major problem arose already in December at the very beginning:
How to support these people, how to house these people... how to feed these people of already hundreds upon hundreds.
The Jewish Baghdadi families stepped in to help.
They established soup kitchens and temporary shelters called homes... or Hei me in German.
We were picked up by the Jewish Committee on trucks... and they took us to a camp... which was a converted school and a Kinchow camp.
The camp was normal. We had a little breakfast, a little lunch and no dinner.
We had to fend for ourselves.
We had a little money.
The first one to create what you call the international committee- or I CU- was the COMA Committee... which was subsidized by Sassoon. victor Sassoon said... that it was the cheapest place in the world to support a refugee.
For five American cents you could support a refugee.
But as more refugees were arriving daily, more help was needed.
The JDC- the Joint Distribution
Committee- took action.
It was an overseeing organization of Jewish-American communities... uniting their philanthropic efforts.
The JDC was the main source of hope and help for the refugees.
It financed the temporary shelters... the soup kitchens and the makeshift hospital.
Later, Laura Margolis, an American professional social worker... became the JDC's head official in Shanghai.
Under her effective management... the JDC was able to sustain close to 10,000 refugees... who had no means to support themselves.
One morning... the phone rang.
The boss at that time was Mo Levitt.
Moses Levitt.
He said, "Laura, how you doin'?"
Although "How you doin'?" was not an expression in those years.
But he said, "How are you?"
I said, "Fine. "
"Busy?"
"Yeah, we’re very busy here. "
He said,
"How would you like to go to China?"
I have to laugh when I think of it.
I said, "Where in China?"
"Shanghai. "
I said, "Sure. I'd like to go. "
I had no idea what he was talking about.
She came in May, 1941.
She was a professional social worker... who had worked in Cuba before that.
I found a news clipping in the Joint archives... describing "Laura Margolis from Cuba... is coming to straighten out the mess in Shanghai. "
Because you had the local relief organizations... by volunteers.
Laura Margolis, a highly intelligent woman... sent back weekly- sometimes even daily reports... describing precisely the situation as she saw it.
The relief organizations and how poorly they're managing... and the refugee problem and so on and so forth.
Now came the Polish Jews... and the Lithuanian Jews and the religious Jews and the yeshivot.
They wanted to be taken care of separately... because they were intellectuals... and they had to have their prayer books... and they had to have kosher food... and chicken on Friday.
It was very, very difficult.
Very difficult.
Yet again, the Jewish communities did try to accommodate them... did respond.
"These are religious people.
They need to be treated differently. "
So we went to the camp kitchens... for our first meals like everybody else did.
They had set up these homes- Heime- which didn't look much like Heim- or a home- for people who had no place to go.
They had kitchens, and they had a hospital.
Fortunately, we didn't have to live there.
That was even worse than living in the room- much worse.
It was kind of odd to see people there.
They all had these new German clothes they had bought before they left... if they had enough money left.
They were all decked out.
The men usually with hats and suits.
In that heat.
The women with nice suits and heels and all that... with a tin plate in their hand, waiting for food from the communal kitchen.
The summers would get so hot... that today you use a heat index or humidity index.
Under those conditions, the temperature could go up as much- measured that way-
140 in the shade.
The sanitary conditions were about the worst in the world that you can think of.
Every disease- known or unknown to man- was rampant in epidemic proportions.
Non-flushable toilet.
A Chinese woman would come every morning... pick that huge pot up... take it down the stairs and dump it into a wagon in the street.
So the street usually smelled not like Chanel Number 5.
You could not drink the water.
In Shanghai, at the time, you could not drink.
You drank water, guaranteed to get sick.
The older generation.
But when you were young, you do things.
I remember distinctly the first time
I drank the water from the tap.
You had to boil the water.
Eventually we were able- most of the younger people- to drink the water from the tap.
There was a way to do the rice that I remembered... and I usually tell that to people- how my mother used to put it out on the windowsill.
We had these wide windowsills.
If you left it sitting there for four or five minutes... the bugs would come crawling out.
My sister and I would count who had the most.
In summertime... the river would overflow on a regular basis.
Everyday, at certain hours, the streets were flooded.
You'd have swimming in there.
You name it, and it was swimming in there.
Most of the refugees came almost penniless to Shanghai.
The German government had confiscated most of their assets.
Many sold whatever salable items they had- clothes and furniture... which they brought from Europe in large crates called "lifts. "
The refugees now scrambled to find jobs in Shanghai to sustain themselves... although they did not know for how long.
My father had studied to be a typewriter mechanic before leaving Germany.
Also with the proceeds of what my mother sold... we established a typewriter business in the British foreign settlement... hiring a Chinese mechanic.
My mother stayed home.
She and my aunt knitted.
They opened up the old sweaters and the old shawls... and knitted for sale to make a little money.
My father and my uncle went to look for jobs in the city of Shanghai... with Chinese companies.
My father got a job with a chemical company... knowing absolutely nothing- not a shred of knowledge about chemicals.
But he learned.
He used to study every night.
She supported her husband and myself... with making hats.
She was an excellent hat maker.
Since the climate was cold, people wore hats.
The hope was always... create a temporary refuge so they can get to America... or elsewhere in the western hemisphere-
Canada, South America.
Nobody expected Shanghai to be a refuge for 10 years.
It was unintended to be more than anything temporary.
As bad as were offin Shanghai... we were still better off than most of the Chinese around us.
The Chinese were very poor, very hardworking... and were under direct oppression of the Japanese.
The poorer Chinese people... lived even... a poorer life than the Jewish refugees, it seemed.
The relief organization helped the refugees- the Jewish refugees- according to their standard.
The Chinese had this coexistence with the refugees- a sort of benign tolerance.
They had their own problems.
They kind of accepted us in their midst there.
I never once saw a sign of anti-Semitism... or disgust or criticism.
I never saw it at all.
The lot of the Chinese people was a very hard one to watch... beginning with the coolies- these poor guys who were carrying all daylong... and then the rickshaws.
A human being lugging a little wagon with two wheels... and rich people and running with them through the streets for hours and days... with the veins popping out of their legs.
It's inhuman.
The wintertime, there was no heating... and some just froze to death.
Then you'd see in the streets in the morning... little packages wrapped up where the children passed away... and they wrapped them up in a little straw mattress... and when the garbage truck came, they just picked them up.
Children play with other children.
It doesn't matter whether-
My sister writes in her diary...
"I gave the little Chinese girl next door a piece of white bread. "
Big deal, you know.
That's the way this worked.
Herfather gave me a pencil.
That's how these things evolved.
They didn't make lifelong friendships out of this... but they coexisted quite well.
So there was never-
We were lucky with that. After all, we were sitting on their territory...
20,000 of us pushing20,000 of them out... because they were already there... and overflowing, living really in poverty, many of them.
Because that was the poor section of town.
On the one hand, the white and the Chinese were simply two different worlds. very few understood Chinese or spoke Chinese.
What refugees had a lot to do with Chinese was in pidgin English.
They bought from them.
They bought the cheapest- the last bit of vegetables... and what was left in the stands when nobody else would buy... when they couldn't afford anything else.
Sometimes the Chinese were very good to the refugees.
They gave them credit, or they let them buy on credit.
There was this very sweet Chinese man... who came with his bamboo stick with two little baskets hanging on each side... and became a real friendship with my mother.
Used to come by-
I don't know about everyday- but very often- a good few times a week.
Then he'd be downstairs-
We lived on the second floor- and he used to call, "Ufi. Ufi, " and then my mother went down.
He had some vegetables... or fish and some chicken.
He always had something that she bought from him.
"Ufi. " She was his best customer.
In Shanghai... there was a Russian newspaper... for the Russian community.
And in this paper there was a Yiddish page.
In that Yiddish page... they recorded their reaction to Shanghai.
It is the most beautiful, heartwarming poetry that I've read.
I mean, it is just-
It's not self-pitying.
Some of the poems are sort of reaching out to the Chinese population.
Like, "Oh, my God.
This is terrible what is happening to you. "
This kind of sympathetic response.
So it comes straight from the heart.
Instead of saying, "Oy, poor me. "
You know,
" Gevalt! Who did this to me?"
They're saying,
"Oh, no. You poor Chinese. "
The utmost influence... the Jews asserted... on the Shanghai Chinese society... was on music and on medicine.
The Chinese themselves, many of them felt also sympathy for the Jews.
They're both being oppressed by the Japanese.
The Chinese worse. When the Chinese crossed a bridge they had to bow down... and Japanese sometimes stick 'em with a burning cigarette... or jab them.
But the Chinese got the better part of it.
They turned around and smiled.
And that killed the Japanese.
In other words, their smile-
In other words, they withstood the torture and the embarrassment... and said you-know-what to them in that language.
That hurt the Japanese more than anything else.
Every Chinese hated the Japanese very much.
Theykilled300,000people... when they occupied Nanjing.
I saw once... a Chinese stealing a canister of kerosene... and he was caught.
Right on the spot the Japanese tied up his hands... and chopped them off.
And that's it.
I couldn’t watch.
I ran away.
But in my opinion, man could never survive.
Although passport control was not in anyone's hands after 1937... the Japanese controlled the Shanghai harbor.
In spite of their alliance with Germany... they let the Jewish refugees into Shanghai.
I t is quite clear that they do not wish to antagonize American Jews.
They do not wish to antagonize world Jewry... because this stereotype of the Jew, which is still alive today in Japan... was very much alive then.
Jews are rich,
Jews have power...
Jews control governments.
Jews are compared to a blowfish or fugu.
If the skilled chef... can know how to cut the little poisonous sac out of the fish, it's a delicacy.
If not, it's a poisonous thing.
If we have such a great power like the Jews... we have to know how to utilize them on behalf of Japan.
Japanese had to be very careful... about being prejudiced against Jews... because they had complained... about German prejudice against Asians.
So, it was the Japanese,
Hitler's Axis partner... that determined, based on their concept of what the Jew was in the world- on their control of the West... and Western Jews being synonymous in their ideas- they thought, "If we are good to the Jews in East Asia, they will be good to us. "
Meanwhile, war was raging in Europe.
In September, 1939,
Germany invaded Poland.
In 1940, Denmark.
Then the Netherlands, Belgium... then France.
It seemed like
Hitler was unstoppable.
The beginning looked like total devastation- we don't have a chance.
The Germans were running across Europe... and the Japanese were storming all across Asia.
Till things started turning around, we didn't really know. It looked hopeless.
We got once a postcard from my grandfather.
We tried in Shanghai... to get some of my mother's family out... or my father's, but it was too late.
You had to go via Siberia, and as I said to you... the war was on already, and you could not come anymore.
My other uncle, though-
Leo who had gone to Paris- when he saw that it wasn't that great in France... he wrote my mother he’d like to come to Shanghai.
My mother immediately got things moving.
The European part of HIAS was called HICEM. H-I-C-E-M.
She went to the HICEM... in Shanghai... and sent papers.
At that particular time... you needed- it wasn't really sponsors... but you needed somebody to write a letter to say you wanted somebody to come.
It was very easy.
It was a semiofficial kind of thing.
There was no problem.
We did the same thing.
The HICEM took care of it.
And we got another letter from my uncle... that he was now interned at Septfonds.
"Please get me out as quickly as you can. "
My mother couldn't understand.
Why didn't he get the papers?
She went to the HICEM, and he assured her the papers were sent.
Well, nothing happened, and finally my mother got very upset... and she went back to the HICEM, and she says...
"You know, it doesn't take that long for papers to get to Europe.
Something must have happened. "
The man said, "No. We sent them. "
"I want the receipt... because you said you sent them registered mail.
I want the receipt that you sent them. "
They weren’t very nice to her, but she wouldn’t leave the office.
Finally he took out his file... and the way she said, his face blanched.
She said, "What's the matter?"
He said, "The papers were never sent.
They're in this file. "
So, my mother says...
"I'm gonna take the papers, and I will send them. "
She took the papers, 'cause they had to go to the HICEM in Marseille... and they he could have gotten on a ship.
She took the papers... and she immediately sent them out, registered mail.
They got to the HICEM in Marseille the day France fell.
They never reached my uncle.
To the day she died... my mother said, "Leo's gonna think his sister deserted him... that his sister didn't want him to come. "
She always spoke about that- how she sent him these papers.
They were overworked,
I guess- the HICEM.
She always says, "Why didn't I ask to see the file earlier? Why, why?"
Because he could have come.
There were various schools available in Shanghai... including French and British schools.
There was also the Kadoorie school in Hongkew.
It was built and financed by the Kadoorie and Sassoon families for the refugees... and was staffed by refugee teachers.
There was also an existing school: the Shanghai Jewish School... which was administered by these two families... the Sassoon and Kadoories.
It was a private school.
You had to pay tuition
If you could not pay tuition, you went for free.
It was a school run under the British school system.
The curriculum was made up in Cambridge, England... was sent to Shanghai, meticulously followed.
Examination papers were sent back to Cambridge for marking... and then returned to Shanghai.
There were kosher lunches... and there was a big, beautiful Sephardic synagogue, still in existence today... on the grounds of the Shanghai Jewish School.
Had a very, very lovely
English lady... in our Shanghai Jewish School-
Mrs. Beresford- who every weekend... would take from her class... one kid to her house.
I remember I was there twice.
Her son was a boy named Maxwell Beresford.
That was in downtown Shanghai.
They were beautiful- beautiful woman, beautiful people- and for two days you lived again in a different world.
When we kids had nothing to do... in the afternoon, after school... we got active and we had athletic competitions.
We had a soccer league, where we played soccer every weekend.
There also was a small boxing club... because there were some Jews from Germany-
Some of them were champion of Germany.
They had a little time on their hands... and they started to teach us to be boxers.
We had a very good boxing league.
I was pretty good.
I was very good at boxing.
I had a very strong right.
I won most of my fights by knockout.
Now as a man of72 years old... it doesn't look the same and it doesn't feel the same... but I was very strong and I was very good.
So were others in our group.
They were really good.
We had good trainers and we trained very hard.
We took enormous pride to win.
All of us wore the Magen David, which was important.
When you're always on the bottom, and everybody spits and laughs at you... you are finally on even keel-
It was important.
Here you have a community... that despite these disadvantages that I mentioned to you... created a viable cultural life... that would have done justice to a city of 100,000.
Newspapers, dailies, weeklies, monthlies-
An incredible array of newspapers.
Of course one person bought it... then gave it out to 10 other people to read.
These were read and read and reread until they were torn.
From Vienna, the sausages and bakery and other things-
The café house, which was a standard in Vienna and Germany... they brought to Shanghai.
Architects created a whole new area... where the bombed-out part of Hongkew had been rebuilt... to create apartments, rooms for refugees.
They created a theater, and this included a German theater and a Yiddish theater.
They had cabaret evenings in these little restaurants... that were fabulous.
We would go there-
Once in a great while my father would come out... with enough money for us to go to one of these places.
We would go there, and we'd listen to them sing and make jokes.
People like Herbert Zernik and Raya Zomina- she sang in Yiddish.
These two were so funny, and they were so good.
There was a lot of that going on.
You have this attempt... to bring some kind of cultural life.
It's not only the café houses.
It's not only recreating Little Vienna or Little Berlin... as some people have written.
It is much more.
Several newspapers-
The Gelb Reports, Shanghai Chronicle-
Many more that stopped and started.
Even books.
Poetry. People were writing wonderful poetry in German... not only in Yiddish.
It is that kind of thing which I think is moving.
Among the squalor, the poverty, the hunger... and this feeling of,
"What's going to be with us?
Where will all this end?
Will it ever end?"... there still is the human spirit reasserting itself.
The Jewish refugees built... an almost self-sufficient, beautiful society.
There's sports clubs, there's soccer clubs... there are recreation clubs, there are boxers.
It's an amazing story.
My father had come out of Buchenwald... where his war wound had acted up and had not been treated.
He got sick, then he got well, then he got sick.
He got checkups.
They didn't know what it was.
They pulled his teeth, they thought it was that.
He kept getting fevers, and it was called "Shanghai Fever. "
But he functioned and ran the business with a Chinese mechanic.
My mother went knocking on doors getting customers.
She did the bookkeeping, she did the correspondence and appointments.
My father did the repairs together with a Chinese mechanic.
Then he got sick again... and he died, just like that.
He was 43years old.
They were never sure what it was... but they presume it was some kind of a parasite... that he harbored from Buchenwald.
When he fought in the First World War... he was at the Battle of Verdun in France... which was a very big, important battle.
I think it was in 1916.
He was born in 1897... so he was about 19 years old.
He was a kid, really.
As he was standing with his gun... he sees a young French soldier... on the other side of him, opposite him.
That's the enemy... so naturally you shoot your enemy or he's gonna shoot you.
My father tells the story.
He sees this French soldier... and he raises his gun to shoot him.
At the same moment that he's shooting the soldier... the soldier shoots him.
And as my father fell-
He had a stomach wound, lying there- he heard the young French soldier say, "Shema Israel. "
That always affected him.
He killed a Jew.
All of a sudden, he wasn’t a German soldier killing a French soldier... it was a Jew killing a Jew.
It affected him all his life.
It must have, because he always told that story... and then my mother repeated it.
Although the situation in Shanghai was bad... it was far better than Europe, where war was still raging.
The refugees felt relatively safe in Shanghai under Japanese occupation.
That was about to change.
In December, 1941...
Japan attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor.
The United States entered the war.
Pearl Harbor was not only a major shock... which verified to some that the Gestapo had a long arm... and it reached out to the Far East.
It was a double shock.
Here they thought, "We have difficulties, but we're out of danger from Germany. "
All of a sudden, with Pearl Harbor they find Germany and Japan are allies... and Germans again are involved in their affairs.
We got very frightened.
With America at war, we're not going to get out of Shanghai.
Looked out the window... and all the ships in the harbor were burning.
Japanese had come across the bridge... marched into our hotel, occupied the hotel.
We were at war.
The Japanese quickly took over the International Settlement.
The British and the Americans were now enemies of Japan... and were regarded as prisoners of war.
The Japanese imprisoned them... in internment camps at the outskirts of Shanghai.
That group included the Baghdadi Jews who were also British subjects.
The Sephardic community, which had been helping the refugees... was no longer in the elite position that they were before.
They themselves were reduced... as to how much money they could take out of the bank.
Most of their money was confiscated.
Within three quarters of a year or so- certainly by the end of the year- all the enemy aliens- meaning American, British and Dutch nationals- were interned.
I remember when they locked all the British up.
A few of our guys- I was with them- knew where the camp was.
Long way to walk, the way I remember it today.
We gathered whatever we could steal- some cans, some this, some that.
We walked for kilometers, the way I remember it.
We brought them some. They were all locked up in the British camp.
We paid back.
With America at war with Japan... all lines of communication between
Shanghai and the US were suddenly cut.
Laura Margolis was cut off... without money coming from America to support the soup kitchens... the local shelters and the makeshift hospital.
Foreseeing such a problem, she had already obtained permission from the JDC... to borrow money from local businessmen... who were confident that they would be repaid by the JDC... at the end of the war, as indeed they were.
But without the Japanese approving the operation... everything could fall apart... leaving thousands of refugees with no means to support themselves.
So I phoned up Captain I nuzuka.
He remembered me... because we had been to social affairs together... and received me very nicely.
Made the tea ceremony, very nice, very cordial.
Then we got to the nitty-gritty of what I came for.
It's true that I'm an enemy alien.
I don't know what’s going to happen with me next.
But for the foreseeable future, apparently I'm free.
I would be able to take over the whole operation in Shanghai... and keep feeding the people... if he would give me permission to raise the money.
I said...
"You, as an occupying power... can not afford to have hungry people riot.
You're responsible for them.
On the other hand...
I can help you so they won't riot... if you’ll give me an okay... to raise the money. "
And he did.
The war years were very difficult years... in the sense that there wasn't enough food... and everybody had dysentery.
Having diarrhea was just usual.
Food got to be very difficult in '43, '44, '45.
There wasn't a lot of food.
Lot of people were clearly suffering from malnutrition.
You had a sense-
As a young kid, I remember... the people were shrinking into their clothes.
They looked gaunt and shabby.
Little Chinese boys would be chasing grocery trucks.
They'd have a knife.
They'd cut a hole in the sack.
The noodles would fall into the gutter.
They'd sweep them up, and they would be sold very cheaply.
Then my mother and I would sit around the kerosene lamp... or whatever was available in the way of light... and we’d separate the noodles from the debris.
Debris being broken glass, rusty nails, stones- whatever is swept up from a gutter.
I remember we were sitting on the balcony once-
Werner, my second father, and I-
Tiny little balcony.
My mother was in the streets.
She had just bought bread.
And we saw some young kid came up... grabbed the bread from her arm and started running.
When she came up, she said, "He must have been even hungrier than we are. "
Those were-
There wasn't much of anything.
Since the Baghdadi Jews were imprisoned in internment camps with the British...
Laura Margolis called upon the Russian Jews to help the refugees.
The responsibility for the refugees... fell now on the Russian Jews.
And I would say-
They had no choice, but we accept the responsibility.
But also they did their best.
They cannot be faulted.
After that, they simply had to do whatever was possible.
My parents and quite a few other people... had their kids go to a Catholic school.
Saint Francis Xavier's College-
SFX- which was an all-boys school.
Discipline extremely strict.
If I learned anything at all, that's where I learned it.
It was a Catholic school. All brothers, with the long black gowns.
Religious Catholics from all over the world-
Brother Leo,
Brother Ladislaus from Hungary.
There was one big redhead,
Brother John.
I'll never forget... every morning when we walked into school...
Brother John would give us... a little insight into what the political situation was.
He was very, very anti-Allies.
He was very much pro-German and pro-Japanese.
He was a real nice guy. He was very nice, especially to us Jewish kids... and yet... his actions showed different and the words that came out of his mouth were different.
After the war was over... it came out that Brother John was actually a very high officer in the British army.
He was no brother.
Not a religious man, but set up in there.
Apparently he was one of those... that gave a lot of information of what was going on in Shanghai... as far as the the Japanese army was concerned, to the Allied forces.
The refugee community was very worried what was happening... because after all the enemy aliens of Japan and Germany were interned... what was gonna happen to us?
Knowing that Jews were always first in line... when it came to bad things happening to good people, so to speak... what did they have in store for us?
On February 18, 1943... the Japanese issued a proclamation... ordering all stateless refugees who came to Shanghai after 1937.. to move to a segregated area in Hongkew.
That's when the German influence became much more crucial.
German influence pressured the Japanese into creating a ghetto.
This was the tendency of the Japanese in ruling.
Here this whole puppet-state concept comes into play.
If you have them nice and compact all together... you can watch them and you know what they're doing.
Then what you do is you give them... someone to watch over them.
No direct rule.
That's the puppet government that watches over them.
It's exactly what they did in Shanghai.
It wasn't a real ghetto.
It wasn't a ghetto that we know from Europe. It wasn't that.
It was a different concept.
It was a very Japanese concept.
And yes, all foreigners need to be watched.
The ghetto didn't have any walls around.
It didn't have to... because if you saw a European face in downtown Shanghai... and they were not German or Russian, they had to be one of us... because all the Americans and all the
British were put into internment camps.
So we moved into that ghetto area.
My mother sold a bunch of the possessions we had just to make room.
We had a very tiny room.
There were at the end- three, four, six- ten people in this house.
We lived in a Chinese house owned by a Jew... but there were five families in a ghetto... and we had the attic which was like this.
We were not able to stand straight, only in the middle of the attic.
On the side it went all the way down.
The major problem we had was my brother contracted polio in China... which was a disaster.
Food was scarce.
Eventually we couldn't get out from the ghetto anymore... so I started a job.
I worked in the kitchen.
The school had a kitchen.
We all had to move into one room to 51 Chusan Road... which was right smack in the middle of the ghetto.
They never called it a ghetto.
They called it a segregated area... but it was a ghetto.
I went back there too... and took a look.
Yes.
- We lived upstairs, you know?
- There you go.
Take care.
- Be careful on the steps.
- Take care.
Yes, on the steps.
It all comes back.
It all comes back.
The roof looks the same.
It's amazing how it didn't change.
I can't believe it.
We used to have the rice on this windowsill... and take the bugs out of the rice- my sister and me.
There was another window and we had a little kitchen... where there's now a wall here... with one little stove, two rings of gas.
We never used it because we didn't have enough gas.
And a little sink with cold water running.
We put a curtain across it... so that nobody would come in when we washed ourselves.
Never took a bath during the war, just sponge bath...
'cause the bathroom down the hall was so dirty.
Everything comes back.
We did everything in this room.
We lived here... we slept here, we argued here.
I learned to dance in this room with my father... to the radio.
Voice of America. We tried to get it, but it was forbidden... so we had to be very careful.
My mother always had flowers on the table.
You could buy flowers.
All the time we were wondering what happened in Germany.
We didn't know what was going on... all during the war.
It's just amazing how it all comes back.
To exit the ghetto for jobs or school... the refugees had to get special passes.
The Japanese authorities were represented by two officials;
Akura and Goya.
Goya- They called him "Meshuggener Goya" or "Paranoid Goya"- who had a-
He was really schizophrenic in many ways.
I'm giving you not a professional evaluation.
He could be very good to the children.
He'd give out candies to children.
He loved to play music, even though he was a lousy musician.
He always forced the refugees to play with him.
He liked to be called "King of the Jews. "
He was a short, ugly fellow.
He would stand on the desk and yell at some Jews.
There was one Jew who really caught his psychology.
A brilliant idea.
He saw the kind of person he was.
He had a silk top hat he'd put on.
He gambled.
He'd say, "You're making fun of me?"
He wore a silk hat when he went down the line to get a pass.
He said, "No, I only wear it... when I meet royalty and important people. "
He caught onto the psychology of that person... and he was always put in front of the line.
Anytime he came, he got his pass immediately.
Mr. Goya was a very short, little man... and my stepfather Werner was a very tall man.
He was about 6 foot 2, 6 foot 3.
The little Japanese man didn't like that.
So he pulled out his gloves... and he slapped my father across the face.
He jumped on the table and slapped him across the face... and yelled at him to get out and "no pass. "
I remember
Werner coming home that day... and he was a shattered, broken man.
So now my mother's typewriter business... definitely was down the drain altogether... because many refugees now were not just dying of disease... they were dying of starvation, because there was so little food around.
And what she decided was a ruse.
She wrote to one of her customers in the French Concession, a French lady... and asked her to send a letter... saying that she was still servicing her typewriter.
The lady wrote that letter.
Armed with that letter... she made an application for a special pass with Mr. Goya.
She stood in front of Goya, and Goya said, "You repair typewriters?"
She says, "Yes, I was in business.
My husband died here, but it was his business originally.
I still know how to repair them. "
She got a pass, and armed with that pass... she decided what she was gonna do.
She had no intention of servicing typewriters.
She got a pass to go to the French Concession.
What she did that was not legal... she got off the tram before she got to the French Concession.
She went to the parts of the city... where Westerners did not go, the Chinese parts.
She bought up sundries like sunglasses... nylon stockings, belts, scarves, stuff like that.
She would put them under the toolbox that she carried with her... and bring them back to the ghetto area... and then give them to the peddlers on consignment in the ghetto.
Even though it didn't bring in much money... it brought in just enough... to keep us slightly above the starvation level.
One night when my parents thought I was asleep... they were talking to one another... and my mother said that there were only $17 left.
I had no idea what 17-
It was a fair amount of money... but it was clear that when that was gone... we would be in terrible shape.
We had what they called a "paocha"... so the Japanese didn't have to do it... and we were happy they didn't have to do it.
Everybody was assigned a couple of hours a week... where you got an official armband and a stick... and you were standing and controlling... that the people don't go out without a pass- out of the ghetto without a pass- and that they came in on time.
But as I said to you,
I worked for Russians... and there was a Russian club.
The Jews that had Soviet passports could live outside the ghetto.
They had the radio and everything... and they got movies of the war going on with Germany.
The way to get back into the ghetto after the hour-
What I did is-
The ghetto did not have a wall around it.
This side of the street was the ghetto, the other side was not the ghetto.
So I walked on the other side of the street which was not the ghetto.
There was one street where the police station was.
Just as I came to the police station...
I walked across the street and into the police station.
If anybody would ask,
I'm going in to the police... but then I looked around, said, "I think I'm in the wrong place"... and I walked out again.
This was maybe 10:00 at night.
Anywhere else I walked... they would have caught me going into the ghetto at 10:00.
I was supposed to be home by 6:00.
There was this White Russian boy.
He was good friends with the Japanese kids there.
Whenever he got a hold of me,
I got my daily-
If I couldn't run fast enough,
I got my daily beating.
I remember one time I came home, my mother almost fainted.
A black eye and bleeding, no shirt, one shoe missing-
I took a bad beating.
George was his name.
Family name's not important.
George and his gang, always two or three guys. They get you.
I used to go to bed at night,
I remember that vividly... and I’d say, "Someday, I don't know,
I will get even.
I have to get even.
This can't go on. "
I took a beating maybe three or four times a week.
They'd catch you, you'd get it.
Butter was very valuable, very expensive.
I recall that my parents-
Later on there wasn't any butter, but my parents in '43, '44... would buy half a quarter of butter, two ounces... and they would watch and make sure that I ate it.
I remember once, vividly... walking out where my mother was washing the dishes.
I noticed that she licked the last bit of butter off the plate.
Till we moved into our-
Can't say a flat-
Till we moved into a room of a larger flat... which was shared... by probably four or five families-
11, 12 people all in all.
We had one room in there.
Bathroom facilities, if you can call it that... shared by about 11, 12 people, if I remember correctly.
In that one room, my mother made hats... and that's where we lived and slept and worked.
I can't explain.
I don't think people today... will understand what this is all about unless you see it.
Here we had our windows painted black... and if a little light would shine out... the Japanese would be cursing from the streets.
I don’t want to tell you what they cursed.
I could repeat it if I wanted to.
They used to yell from down there,
Bagero!
If a little light shone out, they'd come smashing the doors in.
So we made sure the windows were all blacked... with shmattes covering so nothing would shine out.
Werner and Fufi would lie under the blanket at night.
They had a tiny little radio- I don't know where they got that one from- and all covered up, they'd listen to the news.
Fufi understood a little Russian... so they used to listen to the news in
Russian- what happened in World War II.
We'd hear from the Soviet Union... that the Russian armies had started turning things around... and pushing the Germans back.
That gave us a little bit of hope- gave us a little bit of hope for the future.
It didn't all seem that bleak in those days.
Otherwise, that's about it.
From here we went to school, here we came home after we got beat up.
This room has a lot of history.
My mother was a very fine lady.
She made big pots of soup with all sorts of things inside... and then she fed another three or four people... who came for lunch on a steady basis.
There was a painter,
Kurt Frankenstein.
There was a Mr. Rouget who in turn taught me Russian for the food he ate.
There was another gentleman whose name I forget right now.
We always had three people... eating the same soup every day for lunch. I remember them.
Yeah, my mom was a nice lady.
She was a good gal.
In the place where we worked, we had a map... and every day... we put pins in for the advances of the Russian army... or the German-
We had the news through the Russian club.
We had the newspaper in the ghetto, in German.
And the official news came through.
The victorious German army withdrew from Harkoff.
We knew they got kicked out of Harkoff.
Shanghai, apart of the Japanese empire... was under attack by American forces, mostly by air.
So far up to this point...
Shanghai itself had not been bombed.
There were strafings.
We'd see Japanese and American fighter planes up in the sky.
Kids have no fear.
We’d be up on the roof.
We'd bet with marbles who would shoot down whom... as shrapnel was falling all around us.
When I think of it now, how foolish.
We could have gotten killed.
But nobody ever got hurt by that.
I don't know.
We must have been immune.
They would push the dining room tables together... and put mattresses on top and we would crawl underneath... and that was supposed to be a shelter.
It was July 17, 1945.
My mother was on one of her illegal forays in the city.
I was on my way to see Sue and Chaya, who were living together.
They lived on the exact opposite end of the ghetto from where I lived.
It was a very, very hot summer day... and in Shanghai the clouds used to hang... just a couple hundred meters above your head. You would choke.
There was an air raid alarm in the morning... and then it was called off.
I think two or three times and called off.
I remember I went to a haircut.
I'm walking down the road... and I stopped-
Next to the prison was a hospital.
And that hospital had become a prison hospital... for American and British POWs.
They always had them out on a balcony on a top floor... which was maybe the fifth or sixth floor.
We used to stop there and wave to them.
Sure they must have been wondering who we were.
They used to wave back and we'd wave to them.
Suddenly you thought the world was coming to an end.
Absolutely the world- Afterwards they said it was about a hundred B-29s... over Shanghai, just over the clouds.
That's a-
That's a ear-cracking noise.
It is unbearable.
Just as I'm starting to continue to walk over there... the dreaded siren went off that the city was under attack.
No bomb shelter, but a trench.
Jumped into a trench with some other people... and within a split second the bombs were flying.
And then the bombs started flying.
The bombs, when they go down, they go-
You hear that whistle.
I'll never forget that whistle... right before the thud.
We were always taught when the bombs start falling... you take an inside post of the building.
Never stand in the middle.
So everybody ran, grabbed some inside post of a building.
People screaming, and then you heard the sirens of the ambulances.
It was over very, very quickly.
Then we started running home.
Thirty-one refugees died, as well as hundreds of Chinese... in an attack by American forces... trying to hit a Japanese radio station in Hongkew.
The Japanese were terrific.
They had supplied the ghetto hospital... with medications and emergency equipment... in the event there would be a disaster.
They had the ambulances.
They came and they took care of everything immediately.
Didn't matter whether you were Chinese or white or green or yellow.
We had shrapnel coming into the window of the room where we lived... on my sister's bed, actually.
On her pillow.
And I kept that piece for many, many years.
You could see the evidence of the destruction all over the place.
There were shells of houses... and you could see that only walls had remained where houses had been. and there was rubble strewn everywhere.
I n the afternoon we went for a walk around the district... and that was devastating.
Dead bodies, blood, this, that-
I remember I couldn't fall asleep for a whole month.
I used to sit in bed all night long with nightmares... and I couldn't fall asleep.
I couldn't do my schoolwork.
My head was just not there anymore.
Then we heard about the first atomic bomb... on Hiroshima, then on Nagasaki.
We said, "Oh, my God. They're now going to drop it on Shanghai. "
It was a terrible fear for us... because we knew Shanghai was a military target.
Otherwise, why would there be strafings on the outskirts?
After the war was over, it suddenly got very quiet on the streets.
That was in August when that part of the war was over.
It got very quiet out there and the Japanese soldiers were gone.
We looked out through the blackout curtains... and there was nobody out there.
We waited a while to see if it was safe... and then we went out and there was nothing.
They were gone from the check posts around the ghetto.
They were out of there.
That's when we found out that it was over.
And when the war was over... we were in good shape.
We're strong kids, played a lot of soccer.
I went out to the streets.
Everybody was running wild. The Jews-
Suddenly, everything opened up.
I went out and two buddies came with me.
I went to look for George Bremen.
George Bremen saw me from a block away... and he knew this was the end, and he started running.
But I ran like a wild animal... so he couldn't have gotten away from me, no way.
I got a hold of George Bremen, and I was never a violent kid.
If those two guys would not have been with me-
I probably lost my mind.
I probably would have killed him.
I let out three, four years of anger... lots of pain.
I hit him with everything I could... and if those two boys weren't there,
I probably would have killed him... because I lost all humanity at that time too.
After the war was over... the Red Cross released lists of surviving family members in Europe.
The refugees rushed to see who survived.
Few did.
Soon after, news of what happened in Europe reached the refugees.
I remember we got a few letters... from the Warsaw ghetto, which I have... where my Uncle Mietek... wrote to his sister, my mother... if there’s anything she can do to help us get out of the Warsaw ghetto... and of course there was nothing to do.
There was nothing to do.
I have some of the letters in Polish, in German.
They're very sad letters... of „Help us get out of here," but there was nothing my mother could do.
A completely lost situation.
And those were the last letters.
I always admired the people that resisted.
I've taught my children that.
I thought by being an athlete, showing a different way of a Jew... that I contributed something... that we Jews are different and it can never happen again.
It won’t happen again.
I will have nothing to do with Germany.
Germany decimated my whole family.
Germany changed my whole life.
My father who fought for the country-
In my mind, they murdered him.
I have no aunts and uncles that I know of.
I grew up without cousins.
My mother had a very difficult life.
Everything was taken away from her.
I can't forget that.
Jewish life continues... which is not guaranteed, unfortunately.
I always say that if my grandchildren don't grow up Jewish...
Hitler won the war.
And it's a problem.
Anti-Semitism never bothered me as much as assimilation.
Most of the rest of the family... that I'd gotten to know from our yearly visits-
I spent a month or two in Poland every summer- did not survive.
When we heard about the concentration camps...
I remember vividly... that my only recollection of some of the people that did not survive... were things that I was very unhappy about.
That was long before
I learned about survivor guilt... because there was the feeling of we had survived and they had not.
I remember the last time I saw-
One of my cousins who lived in Dembitz... and his mother and I understand his father survived-
I was always very jealous of him.
He was clearly the brightest of all the cousins.
We must have had eight, nine cousins.
When we get together, he could solve any puzzle and stump the rest of us.
But he was physically somewhat more awkward than I... and I remember vividly that the last time we got together...
I had a big fight with him... and his eyeglasses were broken.
I remember when I heard after the war that he had not survived... that was the only memory that kept coming back to me.
How could I possibly have fought with him the last time I saw him?
But on the whole they didn't know what was happening... so they focused on their own life and on the misery of life in Shanghai.
Lo and behold, after the war they found out they're living in paradise... compared to what happened to their brethren in Europe.
That's what it was.
It's all a relative thing.
You don't know you’re living in paradise until you're kicked out.
After American liberation... the living conditions in Shanghai improved greatly.
In the following years... all the refugees left Shanghai and China... and spread around the world.
The Israeli government had chartered three small Greek ships.
These three ships sailed up the Yangtze River, the Whangpoo... with Israeli flags... which is still a very moving moment to me... because obviously if there were an Israel... there wouldn't have been a Holocaust.
It's as simple as that.
Of course, anybody who wanted to was welcome to go aboard the ship.
And no one-
These are still moving moments for me.
No one was ever asked for a visa or for a ship's passage... and if that had been true we wouldn't have been in Shanghai... and there wouldn’t have been six million
Jews killed during the Second World War.
Many of the Jews in Shanghai did go to Israel... and others- most came to the United States, some to Australia.
We came to the United States on a US troop transport- the SS Marine Lynx... which was a beautiful ship for transporting the US Army.
Beautiful ship that took us from Shanghai... through Yokohama and Hawaii to San Francisco.
Couple thousand Jewish refugees on the ship.
Ship got into San Francisco
3:00 in the morning.
I thought the ocean would overflow with all the tears of the refugees... when they see San Francisco at 3:00 in the morning.
But on the transcontinental train from San Francisco to New York...
I happened to be on the train with two black soldiers.
And usually as soon as the train would stop... we'd get off just to stretch our legs, get a different environment.
We got off at Albuquerque, the black soldiers didn't get off.
I didn't understand why.
Then I walked into the station... and there's a sign,
"White Men" and "Colored Men. "
I remember vividly
I felt as if I had been slapped.
I also felt that I couldn't face the black soldiers.
It's not that I was that racially conscious at the time.
Of course I knew about discrimination.
It wasn’t anything new to me.
But I'd never encountered it firsthand since we left Germany.
And the one thing I learned... having lived among
Japanese and Chinese people... is that I can't find it in myself to hate a nation... or a people.
In the early '80s, a friend gave me... a record that complicated my life.
It got me hooked on Latin jazz.
In 1 995, for the final scene of my film, Two Much... some of my favorite musicians... played in Miami's Lincoln Road.
It was a highlight of my filmmaking career.
A magical night.
I was filming the miracle of music.
That's when I began dreaming... of a whole film about this most exciting form of music.
"CALLE 54"
"New Jersey"
Paquito D'Rivera was born with a sax.
Tito Rivera, his father, a classical saxophonist... ordered Paquito's first sax when he was only three.
Paquito became a child prodigy.
"The world's smallest sax player"
"Paquito D'Rivera"
I owe a great debt to Paquito.
There's no remedy for the blues like the sound of his sax.
A Paquito solo can brighten the darkest day.
Dad's best gift wasn't my sax but my mother.
Eliane Elias--
Latin jazz in all its elegance.
Born in Sao Paolo, she was the daughter of a classical pianist.
She began playing piano in her teens with Vinicius de Moraes... remaining with him until his death.
"Puerto de Santa Maria"
"(Cadiz, Espana)"
For years, there were many attempts to merge flamenco and jazz.
Most remained attempts, impressive as some were.
Chano Dominguez was the first
"bilingual"musician of the form.
His music produced a miracle-- a handshake between
Monk and Camaron.
"The Bronx"
"(New York)"
In the late '60s...
Puerto Ricans clashed with police.
It climaxed in an assault on a Bronx precinct house.
The quarter was dubbed
"Fort Apache. "
Hence the name of the group formed by the Gonzalez brothers...
Jerry and Andy.'
The Fort Apache Band.
Andy visits the old family home where he andJerry grew up.
Some of the big hits of the '70s were created here.
Here, tradition and the avant-garde, old and new, merged.
Dizzy Gillespie played with them when they were still kids.
The room under the stairs was Jerry and Andy's.
Jerry's back in his parents'homeland--
Puerto Rico.
"San Juan"
"(Puerto Rico)"
He's the poete maudit of Latin jazz, the last Caribbean pirate.
No one's ever seen him without his trumpet.
Yeah. And I wanna hear three clicks before the downbeat.
Let's do it! Okay.
"Betty Talks about Liz"
Michel Camilo is one of the top all-round musicians.
Whether it's jazz, classical,
Latin American music or film music...
Michel is in his element.
Every time I see him play...
I feel like I'm witnessing a miracle.
"New York"
Little horsey, how's it going?
Gato Barbieri was the revolutionary of Latin jazz.
Aproduct of May '68, he is one of the last survivors.
I was famous from the '7 0s up till '82.
It was a great time because things... were electric between music and filmmakers.
We formed one big family--
Glauber, Godard, Pasolini...
Antonio das Mortes.
It's impossible to live without Rossellini.
I stopped recording in '82... and I only started again in '96... because I saw music was like a toboggan... going downhill fast.
For years I lived in a cocoon... cut off from everything.
The mood wasn't like before, understand?
The cinema back then, the music back then... that's all changed now.
All I want is to play.
That's what makes me feel free.
It's cold out, but... it was a nice journey.
I wrote this piece... like it was for a movie.
First we're in Macchu Picchu, then we'll be in Bolivia.
I'm quiet as a lagoon bird... but sometimes I'm a puma.
This is my mother,
Ercilia Ortiz Puente.
Okay, let's get started.
This is the restaurant ofTito Puente.
At your service.
Let me show you a few of our murals... designed to help our young people... remember our music, our culture.
This is the king of Latin jazz, who wrote "Manteca"...
"Tin Tin Deo" and "Night in Tunisia"... and all those famous standards,
Dizzy Gillespie.
We're indebted to him for the growth of Latin jazz.
Here's one of my mentors,
Mr. Mario Bauza.
Mario is another pillar of Latin jazz... the author of standards like "Tanga."
Another mentor, the great Machito... who contributed to our music... and the spread of Latin American music here in the US.
Cal Tjader, the great vibes player of Latin jazz.
Also very famous.
Next to him is my brother,
Charlie Palmieri... a great veteran pianist.
He started the Duboney Orchestra... and conducted several recordings for me.
The great Miles Davis... the famous trumpeter who loved Latin music.
He'd hang out in Latin bars listening to congas and bongos.
This is Mongo Santamaria... a master of the conga for years.
Next to him is the great Cachao.
Double bass player.
He's still king of the bass.
Next to him is the great Chano Pozo, the composer of "Manteca"... and other standards with Dizzy Gillespie.
All these musicians are pillars of Latin jazz in this country.
I grew up with them.
Today, Tito has his place in the Latin jazz pantheon... alongside the fathers of the music of which he was the king.
"Tito Puente's"
"La Habana"
"(Cuba)"
I'm taking a walk. I haven't been here in years. It's changed.
How's it going?
When Chucho Valdes was a kid, his father, the great bebo... head of the Tropicana Orchestra, brought him to hear the stars here.
Bebo, my father, took me to the shows.
Everything playing at the Tropicana.
I think the Tropicana was an important stage... in the careers of Cuban musicians.
The best in Cuban music... and the best artists came through there.
I'm the sender.
I'm gonna treasure this shirt!
"New York"
Sundays, Chico O'Farrill, a Cuban of Irish stock... who came to New York in the late '40s... conducts his big band at the club.
This is it.
Birdland.
Chico started out playing trumpet... but turned to composing and arranging... for the bands of Machito, Count basie...
"Jazz Nightly"
Stan Kenton and benny Goodman.
Chico was the architect of Latin jazz which he launched worldwide.
As he says.'
"The big band is my instrument. "
"Birdland"
The next one we would like to play for you... the band recorded version... by "the Bird", Charlie Parker,
Flip Phillips, and Buddy Rich.
It's called "Afro Cuban Jazz Suite."
Alright!
"Stockholm"
"(Sverige)" bebo Valdes, Chucho's father... was bandleader at the Tropicana when he left Cuba in 1 960.
On a European tour, he fell in love with a Swede.
Abandoning everything, he retired to Stockholm with his new family.
He spent 20 years playing in hotel bars.
I fell madly in love with this woman.
And I still love her.
It's been 37 years.
I'm old now, but I look at her and it's still like the first day.
I invited bebo to play with Israel Lopez "Cachao"... a Cuban 20 days his junior and a friend for more than 60 years. both started playing in short pants... but this is their first recording together.
Go on, say "seven!"
Cachao, say "seven!"
Afro-Cuban music and Caribbean music... have the same roots.
These roots are in Africa.
When Monk played the piano, he'd suddenly jump up and dance.
He'd do steps that were signals to the percussionist... to hit harder-- and bang-- with the foot... like a rumba dancer.
I think the basic rhythm comes from Africa.
When he got up to dance, he was like a rumba dancer.
A genuine rumba dancer, really African!
Afro-Cuban music and jazz... are like cousins.
And their common grandfather is Africa. bebo Valdes had boasted of a granddaughter... who won an Italian prize for piano.
Like his other Cuban grandchildren, he'd never met her.
"Sony Music Studios"
Chucho Valdes hadn't seen his father in five years.
We met in New York. I invited them to do a dialogue with two pianos.
Hey, you're as fat as a toad!
Everything's fine, Dad.
Glad to be back here.
I used to visit all the very gay places those come what made places where one relaxes on the axes on the wheel of life to get the feel of life
I had deep respect for Henry Kissinger his knowledge his background and his philosophic out well I thought he was intelligent charming and just a good
I'll i can be respected I think he has been a major force in our lives dr. Kissinger is perhaps one of the major scholars in America and the world a day in this area he was a fascinating mixture of power and strategy it wasn't just that power made you a celebrity it sometimes that just creating yourself as a celebrity gave you more power requirements mall everyone has a new york dream thank you so much for visiting our planet dr. Kissinger it was fun I don't want to know if your glasses turn up
I think isn't it was clearly an extraordinarily brilliant man but he did have this i think this fatal floor of preferring to act without public scrutiny one harper's magazine this month there's an article called the case against henry kissinger in the making of a war criminal explain Christopher
I think he's a war criminal
I think he's a liar
I think he's responsible for kidnapping or murder my own view is that if we held
Henry Kissinger to the standards we have begun to hold other leaders other policymakers and the standards to which we help policymakers in germany and in
Japan after World War two yes Kissinger ought to be the subject of an international tribunal ought to be what are we to make of these accusations
Henry Kissinger is the recipient of the
Nobel Peace Prize in the most famous
American diplomat in history yet armed with recent evidence his critics claim that some of his past actions amounted to crimes against humanity in a new climate of international justice re-examination of kissing his career may be an honor the important thing before people die or go senile like finisher here is to punish them to provide retribution for the victims a sense that they haven't all their relatives haven't died in vain and to provide a tarrant to make dictators tyrants crew people will be there a generals or national security advisors now I think that if they take the wrong course and abuse their power they may be held to and may be punished at some time in the future mmm yeah yeah well if I ask myself why i began my investigation into tender kiss again it would go back as far as when I'm i realized that he was a frightened now because I became aware that he was personally frightened by the consequences of the rest of General
Pinochet with the news of that here chili general augusto pinochet has been arrested by police in London the 82 year old generals being held at the request of the authorities in Spain who accused him of the murder of spanish citizens when he was in power in 1998 the front page of the New York Times announced that in cooperation with the case against General Pinochet the US government would release classified documents revealing American involvement in killings and torture in Chile
Kissinger may have received the news with some concern as suggested by a phone call with his publisher that's mr. quarter for dr. Kissinger
Henry hi how are you no I wasn't calling out of the patient's i was calling only to say that you're getting all the publicity you would want to the new york times but not the kind that you want they'll release these papers he this is astonished judge appealing to an
English Court about a chilean head of state so it's it yeah but it's also Spain has no Ratan national jurisdiction over events in
Chile anyway so that it makes absolutely no sense the day the British police an arm of state power go out to the house of agosto picture and declare him under house arrest is a victory for an idea litigator with a special interest in human rights and universal standards of so that's that's our bases now the next question is what we're gonna sue
Tyga thinks that Henry Kissinger may have reason to be concerned about the new precedent set by the events surrounding the Pinochet arrest in
London you know here's this magistrate that everybody thought he's a good friend of maggie thatcher and he's just going to toss the case out right well he writes one law for one world that's what he wrote his judgment for me
I tell you something the most dramatic moment of the hearing about furniture was the testimony of the
Scotland Yard officer on such a tight
I was handed a warrant and i went to a house 1130
I was showing and i went in and i turned right and then went into a room I saw men that I recognized as the prisoner president is not a grateful the prisoner and I walked up to him and he stood and I said Augusta pitch at you thought busted by well I never like to miss a chance to confront Henry Kissinger and I don't get the area of so now he has canceled that's four times now this year what I yearn for is the chance for some quality time with him he refused to want to confront him and make him realize that sir me we're not going to stop asking in early two thousand and one author christopher hitchens published the trial of henry kissinger first released is to articles and Harper's Magazine the book accuses the former secretary of state of war crimes and crimes against humanity and asks for a formal legal inquiry the statement Henry Kissinger is a war criminal the statement i've been making for many years is now not a piece of rhetoric not a matter for her it's a job description across the u.s. kitchens improbable crusade attracted interest with a pen for a lance he was tilting at the windmill of kissing his reputation christopher hitchens as you no doubt know is out with a new book called the trial of Henry a Kissinger it is very rough on you and as a book devoted to criticism out and i'm going to deal with with good to the kitchen he's a man who attacked the mother
Terry's that Jackie Kennedy a set the
Holocaust never existed and I'm not gonna do him the favor of getting into a debate with him
I can't have it set of the hymen anti-semite or not just emphasize that
I'm story is too much it crosses my line and dr. Kissinger by now we'll have knows to be 4i haven't read his book
Frank the was so disgusted by his magazine piece sure pipe sucker he sucks the sewer pipe I was not concerned that Kissinger would sue harper's magazine because then he
Kissinger would have to go to some form of legal disclosure I mean if you accuse the magazine or you accuse Hitchens of libel then that allows our lawyers to ask questions and subpoenaed documents and try to establish the truth of the matter and that is not something i think that Kissinger would welcome Kissinger's & Myers. to his impact is a global strategist during the Cold War era he saw international diplomacy as a grand game of finding the right balance between opposing superpowers
I think that kissing his greatest accomplishment was a triangle and diplomacy in which he was able to balance China off against the Soviet
Union and have America retain a role in the world after Vietnam when it would have been natural for us to retreat indonesia and chile where Kissinger may have needlessly sacrifice human lives to pursue strategic goals that this man could operate at such a horrible level and not get exposed for a year after year after year after year how many people came out against them is an embarrassment to my profession I gotta tell you the dark side of Henry
Kissinger is very very dark born and first germany in 1923 Henry
Kissinger was 10 years old when the nazis came to power the son of Jewish academics he was increasingly alienated from the society in which he lived
I think Henry Kissinger grew up with that odd mix of ego and insecurity that comes from being the smartest kid in the class from really knowing that you more awesomely intelligent than anybody else but also being the guy who got beaten up because he was Jewish in 1938 the Kissinger family fled to the
United States and settled in New York
City
Henry Kissinger was 15 in 1944 just six years after emigrating to America
Kissinger return to Germany this time wearing an American uniform Kissinger was in the counterintelligence Corps and was stationed to some place and the
American occupation zone and once or twice
Jewish refugees that was obviously something that weighed on as we got out early and we didn't suffer the ultimate consequences of being the enemy in a totalitarian society when the war ended
Kissinger returned to his hometown a hundred miles south of book involved the synagogue with his family worshipped had been burned to the ground
13 of his relatives had died in the camps consciousness that societies can take a very evil turn this separates me from many Americans who have never seen it can't imagine it I think you can come out of the Holocaust experience with many different outlooks but they're two extremes one of which is you say never again and you have a very moralistic foreign policy at the other extreme is a great realpolitik of realism in foreign policy
Kissinger of course had a mix of both but he was mainly on the spectrum of the power politics player he believed that in the end what really mattered was power after the war Kissinger was admitted to Harvard as an undergraduate and a graduate student Kissinger and renowned as a student of foreign policy in his writings he expressed an interest in metonymic and otto von bismarck men of power cunning and skillful diplomacy his grounding was European not just because he came from Europe because he was a he was a young man when he left but historically his intellectual interests the diplomatic age of europe he was fascinated with the art of diplomacy and of course in those days a lot of diplomacy was secret and some of it even duplicitous kisses flair for international diplomacy brought him to the attention of Nelson Rockefeller
Republican politician from one of
America's wealthiest families to let the Russians of sentiment a hundred eighty six miles into the sky and return him recommendations of the Rockefeller report it indicates that the residents have rocket engines of very great for us and probably upgraded trust can be have at the moment
Henry Kissinger published a book called nuclear weapons and foreign policy in which he argued for a bomb shelter in every house and a doctrine of limited nuclear war in the new york times he received an admiring review from Edward
Teller the father of the hydrogen ball believe up there acapella group is that we have to go into production on
Barbara's at the same time that we build up our middle forward as Rockefeller campaign for the Republican presidential seat of political power in Washington but at the convention Rockefeller would lose the nomination to Richard Nixon his political ambition stalled Kissinger was offered a position in the Nixon campaign he declined but he would soon find an unlikely route to power through the
Vietnam War yeah no account indochina wars is complete without the name of Henry Casilla it's one of those occasions where the will to power of an individual really counts as historical fact by 1968
Kissinger had visited Vietnam three times and had become an advisor to the
Johnson administration his impression was that the war was unwinnable but a withdrawal of US forces would damage
American credibility accordingly I shall not see to devote his full attention to finding peace in vietnam
President Johnson decided not to run for re-election in 1968 at your pro
Johnson's withdrawal left vice president hubert humphrey to face just end to the war
I would not use atomic weapons in
Vietnam
I would not invade North Vietnam and it's a deadly i would not invade any of the other countries in the area of vietnam in Paris representatives of the johnson administration were negotiating with the North Vietnamese in an effort to end the war we had been in Paris since may of 68 and we got nowhere because retrospect there was only one issue with the United
States going to get out and be defeated and nobody was prepared to say yes we've lost the war is over Kissinger was an adviser to the negotiators who are authorized to provide him with privileged information
Kissinger was in Paris in September of
I thought he was intelligent charming and just a good companion but what davidson and other members of the
Johnson team did not know was that on
September tenth Kissinger had contacted the Nixon campaign by telephone we certainly did not know it was in your shared his analysis of what was happening with them and he was probably right for the most brilliant mind available to them and the most sophisticated analyst Nixon as it will recognize talent when he sees it he doesn't like Jews he doesn't like intellectuals but he loves <year> fifty six </year> it was because he knows what to do without being told Richard Nixon himself says that he admired kissing of his ability to supply secret information
Nixon was afraid that a peace accord in
Paris might cost him the election cousin of notices something richard nixon is prepared to undercut mr. Johnson and mr. Humphrey the
President the Vice President and the negotiations in Paris kissing you had a very conspiratorial in sometimes manipulative character he really like to please various sides you like to ingratiate himself in the Paris peace talks he was willing to talk about the Johnson
Humphrey camp as well as the Nixon camp
Kissinger told the Nixon campaign the
Johnson team was close to an agreement with North Vietnam until the deal was final the Johnson team wanted to keep the negotiations secret from South
Vietnam but Nixon had opened a secret channel of communication with south vietnamese president to the go-between was an ashen no information information information and knowing that i traveled to Asia quite frequently messages to solve Vietnam always gone through me in late-september Kissinger return to harvard as the election approached he kept in contact with both negotiators in
Paris and with members of the Nixon campaign he was getting information from both sides he probably giving information to both sighs - whoever when he's going to go to their size by the way Kissinger expected to work for whoever the next president was you offered me a job the next administration in September of
1968 really is independent of the president's name right on October thirty-first Henry Kissinger called the
Nixon campaign to say that there had been a breakthrough in the talks
I've got some important information said
Kissinger they're breaking out the champagne in Paris 12 hours later the announcement was made the bombing of
North Vietnam would cease and final negotiations would begin the prospect of peace give Humphrey a last-minute surge in the polls and then finally just a few days before the election we're moving to substantive negotiations for the first time and they're great hopes that time but just three days before the election President to defied
Johnson and refused to join the peace negotiations certainly one reason is the advice they got from Nixon's people it's clear that they were being told to hold out and not go to Paris the FBI surveillance of the Nixon teams contacts with to confirm this hold on he was told we're gonna win and without the participation of south vietnam the peace talks collapsed richard nixon won the popular vote by a margin of less than one percent and we know further that mr. cousins opinion of mr. Nixon was very low why is he suddenly doing this tremendous favor George election campaign to someone for whom he has nothing but contempt why it's in the hope of a political reward dr. henry kissinger has agreed to come with the White House staff as the assistant to the president elected for national security affairs
I was sitting in the lobby waiting to get the sea the president-elect and there was this
Rockefeller man as he was described to me going in to see him and what happened was that the Nixon stoli the crown jewel out of his longtime adversaries crown and that was Henry Kissinger the most brilliant man on the Rockefeller staff dr. Kissinger is perhaps one of the major scholars in America and the world a day in this area he has never yet had a full-time government assignment and he will bring to this responsibility a fresh approach
I did not voted Nixon when he appointed me as its security advice it in fact i had spend three presidential campaigns backing governor nelson rockefeller against richard nixon so when you read about how carefully I plotted my way into Nixon's proximity and want to teach that to your children say support the opponent of the man you for whom you under work - I think he saw what he did is betrayal of the peace process or the move by Johnson to stop the bombing halt
I really think this guy doesn't see it that way you saw it as a means to an end which is why it's such a good apparatchik is n was getting that job i Richard bill calls Nixon do solemnly swear upon taking office Nixon and
Kissinger moved to structure the administration in a way that would give the new national security adviser unprecedented power dr. Kissinger is setting up at the present time a very exciting new procedure to revitalize the National
Security Council it's centralized control gave Nixon you know and and Kissinger on foreign policy a tremendous amount of sort of day-to-day control they can control the paper movement they can control a lot of the policy options it's true also that Henry kissing your chaired most of the committees and subcommittees and that gave him unusual authority for my staff Kissinger personally selected a team of policy experts drawn from academia
I like to very much and I was happy to follow him I told him in September any generation since since world war two
Kissinger also invited Harvard scholar roger morris to join the National
Security Council Nixon set the general line of American policy but Kissinger really is the conductor of the train he's the engineer he's the the policymaker the most importantly is in liaison with the Pentagon with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff with the CIA he's conducting the diplomacy as well as the military policies the major immediate goal of our foreign policy is to bring an end to the war in Vietnam
Nixon renewed his campaign pledge to bring an honorable end to the war in private
Moscow had been convinced that we were going to do everything necessary to win that war and when it promptly they would advise their clients to pull back
Kissinger's definition of an honorable indoor of a decent into the war I think
I had nothing much to do with with honor or with decency it had to do with American credibility these of the the Soviets and in the long run visa be the Chinese that Kissinger was concerned and so was Nixon at the
United States not appear weak or indecisive or vacillating as Kissinger is supposed to have said and I don't know if he ever did that our goal is to have a decent interval between with toral American forces on the rape and the first version they were looking for remember what the 68 campaign was about they had a plan they were looking for an easy way to get out the vietnam war had just done done the the predecessor President Johnson it's it's hard for you to understand what a huge burden this was on these people in order to achieve peace with honor
Nixon and Kissinger wanted to show ha noi that the new president would use extreme force to prosecute the war that he was capable of anything it was an idea called the madman theory less than a month into Nixon's presidency he and Kissinger began planning an attack against North
Vietnamese sanctuaries in neighboring cambodia the Americans started bombing
Cambodia in 1969 soon after Nixon came into office because they had a problem the problem was that whole areas of eastern Cambodia which was in theory a neutral country not on the side of the North Vietnamese or the South Vietnamese whole areas of the country had been taken over by the North Vietnamese communists and they were using them as staging areas and basis for their attacks on the south vietnamese army's in south vietnam and on the American army in South Vietnam
Cambodia Thailand they were overrun the whole Peninsula this became one of those the greatness of the Vietnam War was that the key to success was getting rid of the the vietnamese communist bases on the
Cambodian side of the port
Cambodia's and magnetic Princess Fiona can manage to keep his country out of the Vietnam War he hoped to avoid taking sides and so prevent an open violation of cambodia's neutrality this led to all sorts of problems because taking the war secretly into a neutral country meant you had to to to destroy the actual records or to conceal them very effectively to lie in fact well it was a because the motivation was for the secrecy because it was illegal so I mean that simple require the approval of the US Congress
I don't know that Congress would have allowed it the last thing Congress wanted then was an expansion of a war in
February 1969 in a secret meeting on Air
Force One Kissinger and his aide alexander haig met with air force colonel raise certain to plan for the secret bombing of Cambodia with
Kissinger want it done was they are sitting to find a way in the master bombing so nobody would know what's going on and sit in it menu and each of the targets were different all supposed to be different North
Vietnamese bases in Cambodia and they were called after names of meals breakfast lunch dinner snack starting with breakfast Kissinger approved a plan to conceal the Cambodian bombing missions from military records under this duel reporting system b 52 pilots would be pre assigned targets in south vietnam in mid-flight their planes would be re-routed by ground radar stations and guided to secret targets in Cambodia the returning pilots would report that their bombs have been dropped on South Vietnam
Cambodia would never appear in the record I think Kissinger was clearly an extraordinarily brilliant man and brilliant and also a manipulative and also very secretive under Kissinger supervision the US for 3600 secret missions over
Cambodia in 14 months dropping a hundred and ten thousand tons of bombs Colonel sittin recalled that
Henry Kissinger was intimately involved in the direction and timing of the bombing raids real attention to the cruelties of the details to say that a country can occupy a part of another country kill your people and that then you are violating its neutrality when you respond against the foreign truths that are on that neutral territory
I it is a little hypocrisy one week after the first bombs had fallen and
Cambodia rumors of the operation began to surface in the press
Kissinger contacted the FBI to request that wire taps be used to find the source of the leaks close relations it legitimized me there was a reporter writer commentator for the New York Times and everybody felt a little creepy about uses mix an apologist to writing for the time but then when it turned out that i he wiretapped aids & associates in the
Pentagon
I was one of the people who was wiretapped while serving under him
I cannot forgive him for being a party to it or four never apologizing it was not one of the things that filled me with a while joy on the other hand it also seemed the way by which it could be demonstrated that my staff was loyal but i'm sure they were complex of reasons that that to fortify his position as nixon's deputy he was endlessly playing off his own staff one against the other and playing them off against the President and there was a lot of Jackie as much power as possible to him or Beijing or any of our rivals in the world the real Hospital powers were the rest of the American government the
Department of State the White House stand the CIA the Defense Department those were Henry's principal adversaries because they were the rivals for for power in Washington like a moth to flame
Henry Kissinger was always attracted to his critics and the best way to get him to return your phone call was to write something negative he understood more about my profession the most of us he always understood if you could get the three networks and
Time and Newsweek he was home free what makes a man sexy what you know what is it is it money the whole thing and
Henry says power it is the ultimate aphrodisiac he cultivated the press before anybody even knew it was possible to do he realized that in this celebrity-obsessed aid that if you became a celebrity and said are you a swinger and I said
I'm too busy to any public swinging and
I don't want you to think that I don't do any swing so why don't you just
Henry used his flamboyant personal life to cover up his professional life and it gave him a lot of cover he could go and have meetings he could do things he could take stand and everybody is concentrating on our kissing to the swinger you love the thrill of dating starts dating beautiful women these were as a sense of fun a sense of knowing that he could be in the limelight that he could be with beautiful people that he got a thrill from it and we get to the restaurant and
Sinatra who was terribly paranoid he's saying
Oh everybody says i have mafia connections I don't have mommy connections and Henry said that's too bad
Frank I need somebody to take care of my enemies
Kissinger as enemies in Vietnam continue to haunt him while the war dragged on an official state department delegation met with the
North Vietnamese in Paris but Kissinger was confident he could secure more favorable terms he opened a second channel of secret talks with North
Vietnamese negotiator lay duct oh and we were told that those negotiations were to be kept secret not only of course from the public not only from the media but also from the rest of the US government neither the secretary of state nor the
Secretary of Defense were to know anything about it and Henry was flying off quite to secretly on weekends to meet with late
October and swan tree in Paris at a safe house this was all very conspiratorial full of intrigue which he loved he put out the story that he was meeting a girlfriend
Jill st. John or someone in New York when in fact he was in Paris negotiating with the North Vietnamese how do I get out of it because we're having a meeting today sir well do something for friday have a you'll be meeting again tomorrow sir we expect alien Kissinger secret talks made little progress toward peace in vietnam but they did expand his power in
Washington the negotiations that he conducted their way of exercising his own control establishing his own authority in the negotiating process as it became apparent that Nixon would turn to Henry for strategy he gained in that influence they gain some more self-confidence and made an enormous contribution to Nixon's policy secret bombing had failed to destroy the sanctuaries the North Vietnamese had formed an alliance with Cambodian communists and had moved deeper into the country
CIA supported cool the Cambodian coo set off a kind of chain reaction inside the American government in Richard Nixon and Henry
Kissinger denying CIA support for the coup Kissinger and Nixon announced us support for the coup leader Ion all who probably attacked the North Vietnamese means North Vietnam counter-attacked and moved even deeper into Cambodia they saw that as a challenge again to American strength to the credibility of American foreign policy
Nixon decided to invade cambodia to send a message to North Vietnam a few days before the invasion the president wants you to know Henry that if this doesn't work it's your ass
Kissinger told his staff are peerless leader has flipped out but Kissinger defended and implemented the decision to invade saying which scared North Vietnam Nixon would be more emphatic he said let's go blow the hell out of them
I decided to resign felt that that the Cambodian invasion was a betrayal of the president's pledge to seek an honorable and just peace in vietnam
I knew that that piece was within our grasp I was intimately involved in the negotiations
I knew that the other side was ready to agree that we were ready to agree and that the Cambodian invasion really destroyed all of that devastated it for years to come and literally cost tens of thousands of
American lives hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese lives in April thirtieth 1970 US forces invaded Cambodia Vietnam attacks are being launched this week to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on the Cambodian explosive nearly 500 American universities shut down and on the morning of May fourth national guardsmen opened fire on 15 students at Kent State
University killing for as Nixon promise publicly to remove forces from Cambodia
Kissinger review to plan to increase the pressure on North Vietnam to surrender
Henry Kissinger began in the fall of nineteen sixty-nine in September to plan a savage brutal blow against North
Vietnam these were his words he said to us as a
Planning Group
I can't believe that a fourth-rate power like North Vietnam does not have a breaking point for 11 days in december of 1972 and what became known as the Christmas bombing a hundred and twenty-nine b-52 bombers dropped 40,000 tons of bombs on how am I and high farm hitting a hospital and other urban centers what many did not know was that
Kissinger had struck a piece of cord with North Vietnam two months before but
South Vietnam is present to the man who had undermined the 68 peace talks will not accept the deal without proof that the Americans would enforce it the Christmas bombing had much more to do with the South Vietnamese than with the North it was a gesture to the two regime it was a way of saying the United
States is willing to make this this one great last brutal blow against the North they buon the North Vietnamese simply to persuade the South Vietnamese that they meant it was a demonstration bombing it was a public relations mass murder from the sky the bombing did appease the south and
Kissinger persuaded the North Vietnamese to make a few cosmetic concessions in january nineteen seventy three kiss and terms of peace were almost identical to the terms that johnson administration and nearly secured before the election of 1968 half the names on the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial incised in stone for dates after january nineteen sixty-nine there is enough marble in Washington to put all the names on one wall we wouldn't dare try and put up a wall that had the names of all the enemies on you don't end up here then I shall receive the award to get over it my old colleague in the search awarded the nobel prize for peace symbolize the end of the anguish and suffering but to his embarrassment
Kissinger was unaware that lady octo would not attend the ceremony in Oz low the Vietnamese counterpart with me shared history took to refuse to accept the prize on the perfectly excellent pragmatic grounds that there was no peace in vietnam to celebrate so there shouldn't be a price for it
I thought it was a a terrible travesty that he should be awarded a a peace prize when in fact he was a war maker not a not a war in der adapted Kissinger what would you say was the high point of your tenure as Secretary of State and i would say you 19 in 1973 then I run to know about Peace Prize for ending the Vietnam blah and the wall. i'd say 1975 when the vietnam war ended once the paris peace accords were signed in December of 72 that was that ended the American direct involvement in Vietnam but to preserve peace with honor
Nixon and Kissinger decided to defend the anti communist regime and Cambodia it was to be a secret mission air strikes against communist forces directed by the American Embassy in phnom penh it made free the American Air
Force they could not bomb in Laos they could not bomb in Vietnam so that began the the incredible bombing of Cambodia and this is when the number of bombs
Elizabeth becca covered the war in
Cambodia from 1972 to 1974 we would be able to hear the conversation between the pilot the American pilot in the air and the American Embassy which was illegally directing the air strikes we couldn't understand why there are so many civilian casualties in this war why were they hitting all these civilians and villages it was every nightmare of how you fight a war from nineteen sixty nine to nineteen seventy three more than 500,000
Cambodians die
I 1974 the bombing had disrupted the nation's agricultural system and a famine ensued over 2 million refugees poured into overcrowded cities American policy in those years towards cambodia helped create the conditions perhaps the only conditions in which the
Khmer Rouge can't power the Khmer Rouge drew strength from the chaos of the country when they seized power in 1975 they force populations of entire cities back to the countryside then they began a policy of exterminating the enemies in execution grounds that came to be known as killing fields by 1979 another three million
Cambodians had lost their lives no one you what the Camaro's we're going to do
Khmer Rouge that sir disgracefully dishonest thing to try to do but the carelessness with which the
United States treated cambodia as a sideshow to Vietnam did lead to disaster to Cambodia congress authorized money for bombs in south vietnam and they went into Cambodia and there's a criminal act for you you know line and therefore I think anybody who died in Cambodia you could argue criminally that they were guilty of murder one people did nobody authorize them the bomb Cambodia there was no american war in Cambodia before President Nixon and dr. Kissinger that is totally incorrect
I think we inherited a tragedy we attended to and succeeded in extricate
America with other from this tragedy oh we inherited it no you did not inherited you created your the designers of the Cambodian policy crimes against humanity are crimes but comprise genocide or torture or mass murder committed on a widespread and systematic basis against innocent civilian populations you're talking about war crimes for example when world war two started and that's that was criminal behavior you bomb troops you didn't Brown bomb innocent civilians but the time the war was over we had virtually wiped out virtually burned to the ground so was that criminal perhaps in July 1973 the detection of
Nixon's taping system would lead to the discovery of the Watergate cover-up the indictment of key members of the
White House staff and the end of the led eventually to the employment of the plumbers which was a secret White House team employed to stop leaks which led to
Watergate which led to the fall of Nixon so in a way the bombing of Cambodia was the first step in the chain that led to the fall of nixon nixon resigned rather than face impeachment one of the original articles of impeachment address the concealment of the Cambodian bombing from Congress when the impeachment was dropped so was the investigation into the secret bombing the new president gerald ford retain Henry Kissinger as his secretary of state and pardoned Richard Nixon
Nixon managed to carve a shameful plea accept a pardon his attorney general former campaign manager John Mitchell is put in an send down the river no attorney general to have been to jail before but there are more members of the innocent group all of them bound to each other by criminal understanding is any one of them left of the people who were involved in the foreign domestic crimes of the year we're delighted to have such a large turnout tonight for what I know will be an informative and perhaps provocative evening with our guest dr. Henry advisor and Secretary of State and the reason i mention that it's because never before and never since have relations between the White House and the State
Department penis ceremony 'as that's a ver good notes days
Kissinger has written three best-selling books about his life but in the deed of his government papers to the library of congress he has not allowed anyone else to access them until five years after his death out was the deed of the paper the right thing to do I was it that it further our understanding of how they operated you know I mean by putting those papers away know of course that it simply was real documents of his administration become known as Secretary of State under smallest corners of the world in east timor a small island and the Indonesian archipelago Henry Kissinger saw a communist threat to the global balance the Indonesian detection thought it would be better if Indonesia occupied and our next the people and territory of his team or so they evolve the plan whereby they took the land and they subjected the people to the campaign of genocide but what is it is widely known as it could be or should be is that on the day they took that decision
Henry Kissinger was sitting in the room with the introduced in general stuff good evening from jakarta indonesia the latest stop on President Ford's agent or on the sum of the fifth nineteen seventy-five President Gerald Ford and president day and Indonesia will be taken up mostly by ceremony for and
Kissinger wanted to strengthen diplomatic ties with Indonesia a non-communist a lie between Australia and Vietnam that controlled crucial ceiling there's more to this trip in China politics and security for Southeast Asia the islands reasons enough of the United
States to want to maintain good dr. Kissinger met with along with
President forward with President Suharto and i was present at that meeting many have interpreted that meeting as dr. Kissinger is giving a green light to the subsequent indonesian invasion of timor east timor was seeking its independence from portugal Kissinger had long been aware of the growing popularity in east timor of a left-wing independence movement called Fretilin the Indonesian military throughout this period was concerned that they're not be a separate independent entity develop on one half of one of their islands with strong chinese communist influence when dr.
Kissinger came
I think the decision had already been made by the indonesian that the efforts to negotiate with the Portuguese and not come to fruition and therefore they needed to take direct military action but any military action would involve us weapons which had been sold solely for self-defense on december six as forward and Kissinger concluded their visit preparations were underway for an invasion why they asked the Indonesian is invading us why they asked if the
Indonesian believe that Fretilin his communist to the not send a delegation to dilly to find out why they asked the strain is not helping us when the
Japanese invaded they did help us why they asked the Portuguese not helping us we're still a portuguese colony who they asked will pay for the terrible damage to our homes one day after this report Greg
Shackleton was killed in east timor what we saw was the massive wave of thousands of people as a result of the air from see land that's happened a lot of people having with no cameras to witness the invasion a radio transmission from the Red Cross is the only live record of the horror of the event what I saw was my own government was very much involved in what was going on support food uniforms ammunition all the expendables of the Indonesians needed to conduct this war you can be one hundred percent certain that Suharto was explicitly given the green light to do what he did yeah lives of over a hundred thousand two
Marines in interviews Kissinger has long denied that he discussed the invasion in the meeting with sahaja we were told at the airport as we left jakarta that either that day or the next day they intended to take these two more well I don't want to take issue as the accuracy of dr. Kissinger's memoirs but it was mentioned in the meeting with sorrow as I recalled sorrow was quite candid said that after several months of trying to resolve this through negotiation indonesian felt they had to take direct action one week after this interview the transcript of the meeting with suharto's released so harder I would like to speak to mr. president about another problem team or we want your understanding if we deem it necessary to take rapid or drastic action ford we will understand and will not press you on this issue we understand the problem you have and the intention to have Kissinger you appreciate that the use of us made arms could create problems it depends on how we construe it whether it is in self-defense or is a foreign operation it is important whatever you do succeeds quickly we would be able to influence the reaction in America if whatever happens happens after we return the US government knew exactly what was happening in those first days of the invasion december seven eight nine thousands of memories were killed reports of people being herded into school buildings by indonesian soldiers with the building set on fire and anyone trying to get out being shot most of people being burned alive people being hurt in the fields and machine gun and people being hunted down in the mountains so anyone out there was in what amounted to a free-fire zone the Indian agent did not handle it very well from the standpoint of the global community but again our our leverage was limited and it was seen in 1975-76 and the light of the post Vietnam era as a very important country to us and it happened in in a year and southeast asia and into training ahead collapsed it was the question of approval it with a question of not being able to do anything about it knowing full well how many people were killed they were so concerned at the US State
Department that they cabled Henry
Kissinger twice saying that the US
Congress would cut off military aid in the butt and bilateral weapons sales to
Indonesia because clearly indonesia was using these weapons for offensive purposes and it would be hard to make a case that Indonesia was threatened by an invasion from his to walk so while kissing is in the air flying home the
State Department has to issue these statements it's a matter of law and they have to say Congress may indeed cut off aid as a result of this as a legal matter when he returns from his trip to Indonesia to the State Department he comes back to a bureaucratic rao of his office because it is furious
Kissinger I want to raise a little bit of hell about the department's conduct in my absence take this cable on east timor it will leak and it will go to Congress to and then we will have hearings on it and it will come out that Kissinger overruled his pristine bureaucrats and violated the law the arms Export Control Act and the foreign assistance i passed by Congress that limit the ways in which American weaponry can be used and they can find these uses to external self-defense
Kissinger and we can't construe a communist government in the middle of
Indonesia is self-defense
Lee well Kissinger then you're saying that arms can't be used for defense no they can be used for the defense of
Indonesia Kissinger
I know what the law is but how can it be in the u.s. national interest for us to kick the Indonesian xin the teeth about arm sales which did continue after a brief hiatus in a later meeting one of Kissinger zaid's confirmed that normal relations with Indonesia had resumed not very willingly said Kissinger illegally and beautifully today Henry Kissinger is a successful businessman he runs a firm called Kissinger associates in which he uses his diplomatic experience to help businesses around the world but while Kissinger he is also haunted by them last year issue was Operation Condor a campaign of murder and torture conducted by the regime of augusto pinochet the rest of our gusto peanut che in london in
October of 1998 directly led to pressure on the clinton ministration to declassify hundreds of thousands of documents secret documents from the CIA from the State Department and elsewhere blacked out as they are these documents are really rather extraordinary there's a paper trail right up to Kissinger is office that help us revisit this history and understand our efforts to overthrow covertly democratically elected government in Chile
I really think chili was probably the basis in the most corrupt of all the actions because it had nothing to do with national security properties used all over the world but the right of known reserve a copper ore in south america and the Republic actually in the nineteen sixties chili was fertile soil for American corporate interests including I tnt which controlled the copper industry and pepsi cola early
1970s see and I TNT are concerned about political developments in Chile as the country's democratic presidential elections approach a left-wing candidate name in Salvador ind was gaining popular support his ties to feed hell Castro platform
Soviet Union was a democracy ind promise to nationalize chilis copper industry a direct threat to I tnt and concern to other US corporations
Kissinger his office to tell them that we had grave concern of the outlook for ittt invest as I TNT called on Kissinger to take action against ind pepsi
President Donald Kendall echoed the same concern to an old friend richard nixon if he does it right in Chile he's can ensure a good flow of campaign money and
71 and 72 he's got a lot of big money people that want him to do something about chili so chilly became the most important national security item they had what brought about the changes in Chile where the facts that it was being communist yeah in September for and1 a plurality of the vote it appeared certain that his victory would be confirmed by the Chilean
Congress the election in Chile has been one but the president has not been confirmed the new presidents of your and actually has like the united states that transition period of about 60 days the CIA declared that chili on the ind would not be a threat to the United
States but Nixon found the prospect of an IND presidency unacceptable as advisor to Richard Nixon Kissinger followed Machiavelli's rule of flattering add relating and serving the powerful to be a success in a September meeting Kissinger shared his views on
Chili's democratic election
I don't see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the responsibility of its people in
September 15 Nixon met in the Oval
Office with Kissinger and richard helms director of the CIA Helms handwritten notes reveal a plan to prevent a ND from coming to power not concerned risks involved no involvement of the embassy 10 million available more if necessary an internal CIA memo dated September 16 outlines the official but secret policy asked Helms to report directly to him on the details of cooperations concealed plan for covert action became known as track
- of course I was a broad policy
I make no excuses that should have it another Marxist regime in the hemisphere know in a meeting with Hague and others
Kissinger emphasize that drastic action was called for shocked that your lens Kissinger really became the general manager of this covert operation representing the
President of the United States he ignored the advice his own staff that a coup was not possible
I decided to start sending these increasingly worrying the alarms to Kissinger that anything that might be tried would be an utter failure the Chilean military was not going to engage in anything
Kissinger swept aside these objections and press the CIA to go forward to foment a military coup but the third cable was the one that really excited
Kissinger because it said unequivocally that if any adventure were undertaken it would boomerang against the United
States and personally against the president worse than the Bay of Pigs that was the cable like they got me a summons home right away because they thought i had stumbled on their plot
I find it so i flew to washington president greeted me he then launched into a denunciation of ind he kept hitting his hand like that he was going to smash ind economically kept referring to him as that bastard that sob he was going to
Smashing I want that and then with the inauguration approaching word of possible covert action against ind which general rena schneider head of the
Chilean military Snyder announce you would uphold my end is confirmation for the Chilean Congress he was unaware that men from within his own ranks were being recruited by the CIA anybody remember sana et al masih me on
Arizona a phenomenal idea okay look at this here and we're going to clear a little lazy forgot gee guys soon begin a percent 18yo my congregation it to orient aspect or another with Joe be going sat on a cat on the scene over there is a general rené schneider is thought of as the principal obstacle to a military coup constitution in santiago the CIA helped design a plan to kidnap schneider they thought they would provoke the military into declaring Martial Law suspending the CIA is Santiago station chief cabled
Washington general snyder is the main barrier to all plans for the military to take over Washington cabled back constant pressure from the White House more important than ever to remove him it's therefore decided schneider must go and for this task men of a proven record of criminal violence are recruited they're given sophisticated assassination weaponry through the
United States diplomatic bag a track to see I a community confirms this the cable reports that plans against Neider we're moving along requesting eight to ten tear gas grenades 345 caliber machine guns with
500 rounds ammo yeah and bounds over a CI h challenge back no one sat on a lot after hatching hey too hard to all in late-september why not then US military attaché II had been secretly assigned to work directly with the CIA in santiago an avid equestrian while its love of horses and made him a close associate of officers in the
Chilean military an ideal go between the
CIA station gave why matter war chest of cash to pay out anti ND groups I should include in my office safe so I took it was giant long rubber band shirt future shouted and i put it more and Butch and no one else boots boots but me I had his best places to achieve it in October the 15th kissing to receive word that track to coup plotters had made a failed attempt to kidnap general schneider in a meeting with the CIA he expressed his concern that plans for a cool at this time cannot succeed in his memoirs Kissinger would later write that he had turned off track to at this meeting but the very next day the CIA sent a cable to Chile it is firm and continuing policy that ind be overthrown by a cool it is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the United States government and
American hand be well hidden if you Henry Kissinger everybody knows what you want and does he know that they know what he wants sure does he know what they're going to do or how they gonna do it are you kidding anybody that would tell them what's going to happen is never going to get do a briefing again do you really think somebody would take a piece of paper into the White House that say a consequence of this may be a death of somebody do you really think so no immediate
Santiago submachine guns and ammo being sent by regular Korea leaving Washington
Oh 700 hours 19 October derive Santiago late evening twenty october or early morning 21
October preferred use regular courier to avoid bringing undue attention to operation yeah maybe it's a little tricky to bow to a minion and he now talk to your semantically to fail the garlic inna a a young Gandolfini my teens emoticon a family go to co allowed to follow yahoo autos e it appeared pass you don't keep the key out of town today
A Fella hinted romping video on muscle peeling apart at the end totally private vika when they moved to stop sign that morning and he show for didn't pay much attention to me for driver he went the same way all the time and then here one morning he goes to go there and it blocked off as over here and then it stopped following the shouting was an American mischief you know that was investigated a nauseam by an opposition senator church and if you read the church here is its all there and nobody was invited nobody was was charged with illegal acts mr. Kissinger his presence here should not be interpreted as meaning that he himself was ever involved in any plot to assassinate any foreign figure in the
Church Committee the CIA testified that
Kissinger had been kept fully informed of the Schneider situation every step of the way even after October 15 Kissinger maintained that he turned off all coo plotting on october 15th for Kissinger to be correct this would go down in history as one of the greatest misunderstandings between the
White House and the CIA but when you read the documents Kissinger was very clear he said let us keep pressure on every I end a weak spot in sight now and into the future until such time as new marching orders are given the sea i walked away from its meeting with
Henry Kissinger believing it had been mandated to continue trying to foment a coup in chile on october 19 according to the CIA kisses aid alexander haig was briefed by the CIA on continuing coup attempts one can only presume that Alexander Haig whose Duty it was to report to Kissinger on this type of information fully briefed Kissinger on what the CI told him according to the CIA on october twenty five days after Kissinger claimed he had turned off track - he demanded an update on the Schneider situation there was no policy since to assassin into it's a 10-8 any foreign official listen just said there was no plot I and family hours
I was not involved you are they like it's part of people concerned in the
White House this thing ended in October
15 then i think around october twenty service so they
I don't remember the exact date they kidnapped an ID and in the process is killed him it may be impossible to know precisely what happened yet it is hard to understand how on october 19 the CIA could have shipped unmarked guns to chill a without authorization you see therefore it's okay that's the way it works not a fascination and not murder that that the hearing was very clear about that it was a accident old and in terms of the
United States but isn't kidnapping a crime of kidnapping is it depends on what your what your objectives are I'm not gonna justify they were not my policy if you were found standing over a dead man in the street with a smoking only trying to kidnap him a murder committed in the course of the kidnap any action which is because of getting that aggravates the offense chilean police investigation did not find any evidence to support a kidnapping after the murder the CIA commanded the
Chilean station for doing an excellent job
CIA internal inquiry revealed that 35 thousand dollars was paid to one of the perhaps only a legal inquiry will reveal the truth if you could develop a scenario if you develop a factual basis to find that Henry Kissinger was compressive then you could sue him in the courts the United States you might face some statute of limitations problems which you have to try to overcome by saying that the duplicity with which henry kissinger has dealt with these issues saying one thing for the official record and another thing in private and hitherto unreleased records that kind of concealment you be so he can be thinking in LA and he fit the attack on follow soon be anybody come out of tackle say i attended basically they insect or guitar I II didn't get on with it and 0 to figure yes in sector eight anybody in eclectic but that possible political compass under after Schneider's death I end it was elected but the efforts of Kissinger and
Nixon to overthrow Andy Andy would ultimately succeed in 1973 military forces launched a coup in santiago killing
I n augusta finishing would assume power and begin a reign of terror that would last 17 years the date was September 1128 years later to the day
The Washington Post announced a lawsuit brought against Henry Kissinger by rena schneider junior to the death of his father the news would be overshadowed by the events of later that morning the one hand in testimony to what evil can do in the world but the mayor and his associates have done here
State surveyed the wreckage the campaign had already begun to see that those responsible for the loss of innocent life be captured and brought to justice
I don't think you could have it metaphorically more perfect than that democracy for short term or fanatical aims of their own is now hunting which the whole world takes part and they can't be any exceptions we're not Kissinger is guilty of crimes against humanity his case raises issues about the accountability of public figures the way the past haunts the present and the movement for universal justice all revolutions are impossible till they happen then they become inevitable is that this movement has acquired an air of inevitability hundred and thirty nine nations have become signatories to the International Criminal Court a know
America is not signed up to the
International Criminal Tribunal for fear of this in his latest book and international affairs
Henry Kissinger argue strongly against what he calls the pitfalls of universal jurisdiction it's a facet of American exceptionalism to think that international law is a very fine thing for other countries that international law applies to everyone except Americans the average person things that
- human relation that is not always the case because sometimes statesman have to choose among us
I to think that somewhere down deep he knows what he was doing he knows it was against a lot of first principles which is why so much his masked and hidden there's so much distrust it's a very very sad way to go to your life whatever he did whatever he accomplished i'm not sure it's worth it because he had to live a lot more years and it's been out of power for a long time you know 25 years now in his own way the reason I don't worry about war crimes anything else he's got his own sentence he's gotta live with himself yeah yeah
As long as I can remember,
I think he was talking about doing Quixote.
He believes in Quixote.
It's Terry's sort of film.
It mixes all his humor, his fun, his joy and his darkness.
It's the best sort of
Terry Gilliam.
Every film Terry makes, Terry somehow manifests himself as the characters.
And yeah, Quixote, there he is, a man charging against windmills.
This has been bugging me for a long time,
Quixote has been dogging me.
The first time we started this, trying to get Quixote on the page was around 91.
I had been fantasizing this for a very long time.
I made the film in my head.
The pictures were there.
It's been played out many, many times.
Quixote has obsesses me for years, because all my stuff has has been about reality, fantasy, madness, sanity.
Quixote encompasses all of those.
Exterior. Spanish hilltop. Day.
In black and white.
An ancient stone windmill.
Okay, cut.
You know what I mean?
- Sorry.
- Back to the top.
- It's always hard...
- Back to the top.
- Terry, Tony?
- ...the first scene. This tension.
OK, you guys ready?
- We're going back?
- From the top.
I'm gonna go and roll now.
Scene 1, take 2.
Exterior. Spanish hilltop. Day.
An ancient stone windmill spins slowly in the breeze.
Don Quixote appears, gaunt, aged, a madly fierce gleam in his eyes.
Stand your ground, foul and fearsome giant!
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha!
Next to him is his fat partner,
Sancho Panza.
- It's just a windmill!
- Stand aside, Sancho!
Don Quixote lowers his lance and charges the windmill.
The lance impales the sail and
Don Quixote is wrenched from Rocinante and spins high in the air hooked on the revolving sail.
It's starting to look...
See it's like out that way.
Terry Gilliam the maverick director behind such films as
Brazil, The Fischer King and 12 Monkeys, has been trying to mount a film production of Don Quixote for more than a decade.
It's interesting down there.
So the military map has loads of old windmills back there.
That's good. If we can get in there, that'll be interesting to see.
After several false starts and financial mishaps with the project,
Gilliam has finally arrived in Spain to begin production.
Don Quixote seems to be at the back of Terry's work for a long time.
In the broadest sense, he's a hero that would appeal to Terry, because the notion of someone gleefully battling in the face of all odds, and logic and reality, is one that appeals to him.
What happens in
Cervantes' Don Quixote is that you meet a man, an old man, a man who surrounds himself with romantic novels, tales of the deeds of great knights.
He then decides that he will go forth and actually live out these romantic tales himself.
And so he puts together a suit of armor out of bits and pieces he finds around the house.
The famous helmet is a shaving basin with the piece cut out for the neck.
He saddles his horse Rocinante, who is an old nag, is falling to pieces.
All he's missing is his faithful squire.
And Sancho Panza is a short, fat guy with a donkey, a peasant.
So they set off and they start to look for daring deeds to do.
Quixote is so deluded that where other people see a windmill, he sees a giant. where other people see a windmill's sails, he sees the flailing arms of those giants.
Quixote's delusions are a major part of his appeal for us.
We want to see the world through Quixote's eyes.
Because the way he sees the world, I think, connects with the way that we saw the world as children.
A world where objects did have a magical significance.
Gilliam has fought many battles to bring his vision of Quixote to the screen.
After several unsuccessful attempts to develop the project in Hollywood he decided to produce the film in Europe.
Quixote will be among the most expensive films ever produced solely with European funds.
Ladies and gentlemen, we just, basically just called this meeting because we haven't had a sort of open forum.
At least, that is, until now.
We're missing a few people of course, but this is, you represent the main bodies of the film that are under work at the moment.
This is the first time that we have
Senor Gilliam in Spain and he's here to stay. So there's no excuses for any of us now.
If we have any questions, if we have any doubts or there's something we want to know, this is the place to come to.
I've said this to a few different people,
I don't know if I said it to everybody, but I think it's going to be great.
I think everyone's got a good sense of humor,
Everybody's smart, everybody's good at their job
And you, with any luck, will protect me from making an utter fool of myself.
One thing to say is, you know I'll keep demanding all sorts of things.
And you've got to scream, earlier than later. Say "no, can't, can't do it."
Because we all know that we are working on a budget that is way below what we normally need to make a film like this.
We gotta do it for what we've got and find ways of doing it.
Basically, let's get on with it.
He's here now, he's a resource, let's use him, let's drain him.
He knows the film.
He's been with it for... 2 years?
Let's give it 10.
Let's give it the whole decade.
Let's go with 10 years.
He knows it for 10 years.
So he should know what he's doing.
Gilliam is not the first filmmaker to have struggled to bring
Quixote to the screen.
In 1957, Orson Welles began production on his own adaptation of Don Quixote.
The project would become Welles's creative obsession for the next two decades.
In a village in La Mancha, whose name I prefer not to recall...
Welles took on various acting and directing projects to help finance the film.
He would gather bits and pieces of footage whenever he could, even after the project outlived
Francisco Reiguera...
Welles's Quixote.
But by the time of Welles's death in 1985
Quixote remained incomplete.
The struggle to launch Quixote began just a year ago when Gilliam actually started pre-production on the film only to have a major financier back out at the last minute.
In order to get the film going this time,
Gilliam and his producer have had to scale back the budget, from 40 to 32 million dollars.
The budget of this thing is about $32.1 million.
Which by European standards without American investment is a big chunk of change.
For what we're trying to do, it's half the money we need.
In Gilliam's adaptation, he has taken the fantastic story of Don Quixote and embellished it with another layer of fantasy.
He's created the story of
Toby Grosini, a modern day advertising executive who travels back into the 17th century where Quixote mistakes him for Sancho Panza.
Johnny Depp stars as Toby,
Vanessa Paradis plays Toby's
"love interest" Altisidora, and the veteran French actor
Jean Rochefort plays Don Quixote.
The script is as ambitious as anything Gilliam has ever attempted.
Stand your ground, foul and fearsome giant,
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha!
It's not a giant, it is a windmill!
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha!
It's not a giant, it is a windmill!
More intense.
"It's not a giant..."
It's not a giant, it is a windmill!
I must say, there are very few scenes that are simple.
Terry as we all well know, has the tendency of overloading everything.
I mean there is nothing ever simple and plain.
They'll be on things so they can walk down.
Yes, that's what you're saying.
I know.
So he ends up like a kid holding on to it.
We rig this thing so the camera can get like that.
Because looking down will be amazing.
Terry came to make a Hollywood movie without Hollywood, it's almost impossible.
The difficulty is making a film the best possible way with the money we have.
I think that's the better face.
Now, the sheep can go here very nicely.
They come around that curve, tons of sheep.
This will be very tumultuous.
This film will not be easy.
Making a film with Terry, is like riding a bareback pony.
Just grab on to the mane, dig in the heels and the knees and hang on.
Because you're in for the ride of your life.
Distant thunder.
- What's that?
- Don't look.
Toby goes to twist around in his saddle.
- Something's coming.
- There's nothing there.
Please don't look.
Giant shadows rise across Toby.
He turns, he looks back.
Three giants loom up over the brow of the hill.
In their hands are great cudgels.
One plays castanets.
The third is fantastic.
Come to me.
You've got to see the giants.
What is terrifying and what is extraordinary about it, it's suddenly you're seeing what Quixote sees.
And it's like nothing you've seen in film.
Altisidora and Toby charge down a corridor.
She wheels her horse.
They set off down a dark tunnel.
Sounds echo behind them - their pursuers.
They emerge into an utterly dark space.
Altisidora reigns in her horse.
- What's wrong?
- I thought this was the way, but...
- Halt!
- They turn and are confronted by...
- ...Don Quixote.
- Traitor! Judas!
As Don Quixote moves forward, we see he is a giant puppet.
Toby and Altisidora are suddenly surrounded by a dozen armored guards.
The guards are puppets too.
When this thing splits apart, Toby has got to have his arm getting caught in it.
There is no way to get his arm caught when it comes back together.
- Absolutely.
- Have his arm caught?
Yes, this is like whole a key bit.
Could the whole thing become... just chop and pull it, push it, make it thinner so that when get gets his arm in there.
- So really that his...
- No, no...
We have to touch the molds again.
I know you're going to have to touch the molds.
That's what I'm assuming, yeah. Unless...
No, I'm just thinking about the time again.
I understand, I know,
I know, yes.
I like taking on very complex and difficult challenges.
If it's easy, I don't do it. If it is almost impossible to do, I have a go at it.
It seems that's what gets my adrenaline going.
Maybe it's what fires what creativity I have.
Without battle, maybe I don't know exactly how to approach it.
The action is very simple, except that there's horses.
So the action of the horses is complicated, but with the puppets it's very simple.
Toby has got to lash out at the puppet.
It's gotta go "poof" in the air.
He gets tangled and "whoof" off his horse.
I can do all that.
All that. In the studio,
I paint black the floor.
No, but you still have to do the wooden floor like that.
I have to cut part of the...
No, no.
Why is it so difficult to have each of the structures on a plate?
Terry Gilliam has a history of hugely ambitious projects visually rich films that explore the fantasy worlds of his protagonists, all of them dreamers like himself.
But turning his dreams into reality has not been an easy thing for Gilliam in the Hollywood studio system.
Beset with visions too elaborate for low budget financing but often too eccentric for Hollywood taste, all his productions have been a battle.
His wild visions are always accomplished on limited budgets and have consistently met with both critical and box office success.
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen was a painful exception.
Teamed with a producer who spun tales of extravagant resources that didn't exist,
Gilliam found himself at the reigns of a production that was already $10 million over budget by the end of its 6th week.
Despite Gilliam's repeated efforts to scale back complex scenes, the budget more than doubled by the completion of filming.
Munchausen became one of the textbook cases of a film fiasco and Gilliam acquired a reputation as a director out of control.
That reputation has often made it extremely difficult for Gilliam to launch his own projects.
There is a mismatch I think between the industry's perception of Terry and how Terry has actually worked in the past.
And I know it used to drive Terry crazy.
He kept saying if someone mentioned
Baron Munchausen again, he wouldn't be answerable for his actions.
Because he felt, that was a film that happened I think ten years before, and people just thought about that and didn't think of the actual work he had done in the film since then.
He's a responsible filmmaker.
He understands the responsibility of filmmaking.
I mean he's, I think, enjoyed sometimes fencing under the cloak of enfant terrible.
But he's... a responsible enfant terrible.
If there is such a thing.
Just reaching that point now, the actors are going to have to start turning up soon.
And we've only got what, seven weeks?
It's got lot of potential for chaos here.
Due to the production's tight budget, many of the actors are taking less than their usual fees and squeezing the film into their already busy schedules.
The situation has made it more difficult for Gilliam to assemble the principal actors for script readings and rehearsals.
I'm still trying joining Johnny directly.
But I think we just plan to go over there and we wait him out.
A flight from London for Tony, a flight from Paris for Jean, and we'll surround him.
But find out all the possibilities.
We have to march forward.
But I still want to try to reach him.
So when do you see Vanessa again?
I mean here.
Vanessa, maybe...
Jean-Yves tell me, maybe 4, 5, 6...
No. The 7th.
- When Johnny get...
- When Johnny come here.
Well this is what they're trying to organize.
It would be better to see Johnny,
I mean, you know just also for one day.
- I know.
- Or two days. Just so...
Everything is separated.
The costumes are in Rome the cast is in England or in France, or in Prague.
Special effects... everything is everywhere.
Until we all get together, that's when it's going to be the hard work.
What we have to achieve on this, is putting all these people that have been working in separate places together.
The sets are being made in Spain, make-up is working from England.
Actors are here, there.
But they haven't been together at all.
We gotta put everybody together.
Everything has to be centralized in Madrid.
It's one more reason to have mess, to have one person in London.
But all the pickups are not in the same place.
The driver, we don't know where the driver is coming from, because we are using this company...
I tell you what, with an actor, we know that suddenly the actor is... we don't know where.
If we have to deliver a script change...
I mean I don't know.
So many things can happen. So many things.
Because maybe...
Camera left.
More, more, more. Yes.
That's good, right.
Raul, look into the camera.
Lean over. It's perfect.
Get violent.
Filmed has turned.
Film has finally turned on this film.
That's the trailer for the film right there.
"Coming Soon."
So do I. So do I.
We're on the same page here.
My goal, by September 25th, is to try and find some actor who will come to Spain and do pre-production.
Because I'm a great believer in rehearsal.
And being prepared before you shoot.
My problem still isn't with training.
I know all of these guys know horses.
My problem is this fucking organization because it's a fucking nightmare.
Traditionally on film productions, it's the responsibility of the first assistant director to set a schedule which complements the film's budget.
In this particular case, Phil Patterson has inherited a budget and schedule which leave no margin for error, no safety net.
Every film is different.
It's very hard to compare a Terry Gilliam film to anybody else's films.
It's very hard to say what's right or wrong, but this film is in,
I like to say, complete disarray.
Absolute and emphatic disarray.
But it is absolutely the correct way it should be, given that it's Terry, given that it's a Gilliam film.
Because Captain Chaos... is completely in his element at the moment.
Now, you walk this way.
Come to me, lead on.
Down this way. Turn a bit.
It isn't a disaster.
It just has a lot of elements that seem to be a little different.
Rocinante.
You can't eat.
You're not allowed to eat.
Look at those ribs. I thought we were going to need make-up - look.
The pelvic bones are fantastic.
- You are there.
- I'm here, you're here, we're here!
Jean Rochefort is the first of the principal actors to be able to schedule a short trip to Madrid for the necessary costume and make-up tests.
This is the ride for the theme park.
Rochefort has been learning English for the last 7 months in order to play the part of Don Quixote.
This is Toby Grosini.
This is the Duchess.
- Little, little it comes together.
- Spanish actors?
Yes, the majority are Spanish.
They do not speak English.
Nobody speaks English on this film.
Jean Rochefort is just so beyond perfect.
The spirit of the man is absolutely right, and his comic timing is perfect, his dignity,
All of those things are all there.
What I'd like to try is, an experiment to make your nose a little bit more Spanish.
Something very small.
Because Jean has a great nose, but when I look at these Spanish noses...
It's just a tiny bit more to make it a little bit more Spanish.
It's something, if you think about it, it's bad.
Thank you. Because, perhaps if I have this,
I feel that I play Don Quixote.
I want to be Quixote.
- I understand.
- I want to think I am Quixote.
Perfectly.
This is a marvelous day for me.
Not only is he perfect for the part, he's a great horseman.
That is always my biggest problem, finding a guy old enough, 70 years old, who looks right, can act well, and can ride a horse.
So the question is... the three of us, where...
I just want to know
I want to get down so
I understand everything.
Where we are with Vanessa at the moment?
- So where are we contractually?
- The contract is not signed.
The agent says no! Each time we are asking something, availability for your meeting, availability for the test, the agent says "no, she is not available".
"We need Vanessa on the 11th."
"No, she is not available."
So we are more or less a little bit... trapped. If we have weather condition problems, we have to have her agreement to change any dates.
That's crazy.
We have very set pieces for the second-string actors.
Miranda, Bill Patterson,
Peter Vaughan, etc...
The only thing we have in our favor is the notion of some flexibility to move around the rest of the work we're doing by having Vanessa on a picture deal,
Johnny Depp on a picture deal,
Jean Rochefort on a picture deal.
If we take Vanessa: "It can only be this, this, this", we're in deep shit.
It's not possible. We did the deal.
I don't understand how it slides.
Because, and this is what kind of makes me crazy, the fact that contracts are allowed to run this long.
To be this close to shooting and not have a contract... is crazy. We are so fragile.
Hanging on strings.
And if we don't have any flexibility with her, we're dead.
Quixote struck me more powerfully when I reached middle age because that's what I though
Quixote was very much about.
He's an older man, he's been through life, it's kind of like a last "Hurrah"
He has one last chance to make the world as interesting as he dreams it to be.
I'll be 61 years in another couple months.
Just an old man!
I've only done X number of films.
Wish I would have done more, the amount of ideas floating around in my head.
All of the film's interior scenes must be shot on a sound stage.
Gilliam's producers have been able to secure the last available sound stage in Madrid.
And it's important for Gilliam and his team to inspect the site before sets construction can begin.
So we're supposed to put all our sets in here?
- The acoustics are appalling.
- Si.
We've got air-conditioning.
Is that air conditioning?
Or just stuff to make noise so we get bad sound.
The sound is terrible here.
It's closed and it still echoes.
That was the first thing we said when we got here.
This is a warehouse.
So I don't know how we do this.
Because the sets have got to be... not that.
There's no other studios?
Properly done, properly, everything...
I mean sound is critical.
I mean I thought we were coming to a studio.
A studio.
This isn't a studio.
I don't want to be doing a film like this.
I'm really getting a bit, getting very nervous.
I think all versions of Quixote have always been plagued by bad things. It's kind of like the Scottish play, I think.
It is a jinxed project.
The biggest threat of this whole thing is that, I fear, it could be Munchausen II.
There's so many echoes of Munchausen that just keep happening.
And that's what scares me.
Luckily, those who weren't on
Munchausen, aren't scared.
And actually interesting, Jose Luis, who was on Munchausen, isn't scared.
We are on the edge, yes,
We are on the edge, that's for sure.
We are not well covered, that's for sure.
But I don't think that means that we are repeating Munchausen.
Everyone knew on Munchausen, from the beginning, from the beginning that nothing was realistic.
No, I don't think we are in the same... the same things are happening at all, no.
We fill that in so it's solid.
You can't go wrong.
It goes in there, another arm starts flailing and that arm's caught.
OK, Giant test.
What more do you want?
It's OK.
He was asking if you knew...
Who he was going to... He was just telling you, he's going to take Johnny Depp.
- Carnivorous.
- Si.
Jean Rochefort was getting on a plane yesterday, so I get a call yesterday afternoon from Rene Cleitman... saying "Guess what...
Jean, as he was about to board the plane, started feeling pain, and decided he might have a prostate problem.
And canceled the flight, didn't get on the flight, and is now seeing a doctor this morning."
If he hesitates about getting on a plane, I'll call him.
As soon as he sees the doctor,
I will tell you.
You have to say "I need you."
We've got to at least get a few hours with him today, or we're in big trouble.
But what's interesting is how powerful his mind is.
It's destroying his body right now.
It's a metamorphosis.
He suffers, like Don Quixote.
I'm going to kill him.
It's ridiculous.
Jean has become totally psychosomatic. Everything is like...
On Munchausen, we didn't have costumes or sets in the beginning.
And now this one, we don't have actors.
We've got costumes and sets, but no actors.
Jean Rochefort panicked on Sunday.
I am very calm.
Nothing like a false sense of security.
There's none of that around here, is there?
I don't think there's any sense of security, false or real.
How would you describe the state of things?
Sheer panic.
Like total panic. Chickens with no heads running around.
I mean it is real panic now.
It's one week before production, what's worrying you the most?
- Pre-production.
- Tell the truth.
The first location that we shoot in is adjacent to a
NATO bombing ground, so I was told it only operated a maximum of one hour per day.
We don't really have any horses.
We don't really have any actors.
I have a phone.
Hello?
How are you?
I got an actor.
I have an actor. He's sitting here.
Yeah, last time, I know, he didn't have an actor last time, now we got an actor.
You're the new boy in town.
- This is called our film.
- What's the name of it?
It's not Chocolat.
Oh, did I finished that one?
This is the inn. But there's gonna be a herd of sheep in the inn.
For the lonely people.
This is Antonio Gil.
You know him, he was on Chocolat.
Yeah, that's a good guy.
- That's Bob Hoskins and...
- Danny DeVito.
- Ian Holm's...
- All put together.
- bastard child.
- And he's a dwarf.
- And he sings opera.
- Makes sense.
You spin around and Quixote is already charging you.
It's not that he's standing there saying "stand aside".
He's in full charge right at you.
I do not know what else
Toby should be doing.
You know what, I was thinking...
Toby's initial thing would be like... maybe he's on a set of commercial.
What I was thinking maybe the first thing he would do is want Bob to yell "Cut".
- "Bob! Cut, Bob!"
- That's great.
That's really great.
- Just to bring it back to that.
- That's really good.
There's got to be an explanation for it.
And obviously here's Don Quixote and there's the windmills and all that shit...
"Cut this."
Then it's clear that...
No, it's great. It's really nice.
While Gilliam and Depp discuss the script,
Vanessa Paradis arrives for screen tests of her many make-up and costume changes.
The production however is still missing it's his Don Quixote.
Have you heard any more about Jean?
Yes, because my assistant, Corinne, went with him at the airport, to be sure this time.
And he was in very good shape.
Is it really a prostate infection?
So it's nothing more than a small infection?
Ha can sit? The problem is, can he sit on a horse?
It was panic.
There's always panic.
I like it uneven, more irregular.
He made it. Don Quixote made the armor.
One piece here, one piece there, sewing and...
"Ah, a knight!"
Even if you take this for the moment, just to look... that piece on there...
Suddenly, immediately... it's good.
We need...
So he just got a piece tied on there.
That isn't much elegant.
He's got to be sad, pathetic.
And he's wonderful.
Because it's all in his mind.
We'll design this for you, Gabriella.
You'll get another Oscar.
Another Oscar for this.
It's getting there.
I think Don Quixote slowly becomes real.
I'm here to save you, Sancho.
Stand aside!
Suddenly, we are in the fields of Montiel.
Destiny guides our fortunes more favorably than we could have wished ourselves.
Look, Sancho, my friend!
A beautiful princess!
She's in great danger!
We must save her.
Those giants are almost upon her.
Don't you see them?
Giants! Giants with arms six miles long!
Just face it,
Dulcinea del Toboso does not exist.
Now I understand.
You have a plan, Sancho.
You are very clever for a peasant.
Fantastic!
It's going to be an extraordinary film.
Your face is so wondrous, your eyes...
There's all this stuff and the costumes, the sets, the location.
It's going to be an extraordinary film.
It's going to be beautiful and terrible at the same time.
The shoot begins in Las Bardenas, a natural preserve
4 hours north of Madrid.
Due to the distance, all the cast and crew must be lodged nearby.
The extra expense makes it all the more critical that the production remains on schedule.
The first scene to be shot, is one in which Quixote rescues Toby, from an inquisition chain gang.
D.O.S., D.O.S.,
Director On Set.
Let's clear please.
Everyone behind there.
Everybody hidden behind please.
We're shooting now.
You good, Carlos?
Alright, here we go.
Roll camera!
And action, Richard.
Action crane!
OK, cut it.
Excellent.
With the first shot of the day in the can, the crew prepares for a choreographed portion of the scene.
In this part of the scene, one of the guards drops the key to the chain and the twelve prisoners must scramble to retrieve it.
Cause he's the only one with the free hand, everyone else has got two hands...
The guy in the front front has got a free hand.
So it's a domino effect.
OK now, while that's going on, what's happening here?
We got the key somewhere?
Who's got the key?
Did we manage to get the key to the lock?
How are we doing for time?
- Badly.
- Good.
On your feet. What happened to you guys? No one's getting up?!
Don't make me start!
Wakey, wakey, folks!
People have to start getting up!
I thought this was rehearsed.
This is not rehearsed!
Fuck!
We didn't have the extras.
So we need to tell the extras what we do. You see what I mean?
On Saturday we didn't have the extras to rehearse?
No we didn't have the extras.
Since when? What was the point of having a rehearsal without them?
We couldn't get the extras.
You need extras to do the rehearsals.
If you don't get them, you'd better tell us so that we know in advance that we're fucked!
We are fucked!
And we didn't know it.
I want to know when we're fucked in advance not in the middle of a shoot.
To try to get the most out of the day,
Gilliam and Phil Patterson decide to move on to another part of the scene.
- It's Jean Rochefort, not a double.
- Walking in.
Walking in, basically doing the dialogue, doing the scene.
I mean it's a wide shot.
We go through all the action.
- And it is a master?
- This is a master.
Whatever we can get is good.
Lock it up everyone.
We're shooting now.
Background action!
Action, Jean!
Cut! What's going on?
We're fucked. We have now spent all this time and we got fighters.
But we're doing the scene anyway.
I don't give a fuck about sound.
We will use the glazed-up sound.
We shoot through everything.
And we need people who can work horses.
I got a feeling nobody can work horses here.
Action, Jean!
Move the horse.
Move the fucking horse!
Somebody push his horse.
Fuck, push his horse.
Tell me sir, why do you lead these poor wretches in chains?
They are convicted criminals, condemned to serve the king in his galleys.
I am Don Quixote de la Mancha, dedicated to chivalry and the protection of the weak!
No one make any sudden moves.
You have nothing to fear from me, provided your intentions are honorable.
Thank God for that.
Cut! That's good. That's in there.
The F-16 gets the Academy Award!
Well done for putting up your voice.
That was good. I want to do one more and then I think we have this.
Alright let's stand by, let's just check this opening position.
Everybody lean down.
Ow! Fucker, that hurt!
Why am I being put through this god-awful...?
Hi.
This isn't real.
It's just a dream.
Doesn't hurt.
Doesn't hurt.
Ow, Jesus Christ!
Don't blaspheme!
Cut! Let's go to lunch.
Very strange weather today.
Strange weather, strange horses.
This is going flat.
Slowly coming in?
Very hard to understand what the boundaries are.
So what we're going to do is, we start with you and Rocinante.
Two sizes.
One like this, and one like that.
Joe, you'll just be off-camera. We won't have to worry about the other horse.
Got the same weather report at lunchtime that I got yesterday...
- And the day before.
- Oh, it's always the same. Each day?
Well that's good. It's consistent.
We know what we're doing here.
Nice sound.
If it isn't the F-16s, it's thunder.
You're right, Phil.
In another half hour, it'll be clear, once this cloud comes over.
Lock it up everyone!
We're shooting now!
You good, Carlos?
Alright, here we go.
Rehearsal.
You have nothing to fear from me provided your intentions are honorable.
Thank God for that.
We wouldn't stand a chance... would we, boys?
It doesn't seem right that honorable men like yourselves should be the executioners of your fellow men when they have not wronged you.
According to the duty of my profession,
I have no choice but to take these men under my protection.
Yield to Heaven's command!
Ladies and gentlemen, just listen up for a second.
I suspect there's a large bunch of lightning and a storm about to hit us.
What I would like everybody to do right now is to make all the gear completely safe.
Cover up. We're going to wait for this lightning to pass, see what the weather on the other side of the front is, whether or not we can reconstitute, but at the moment, what I need everybody to do is to make safe and get under cover.
Which is it,
King Lear or The Wizard of Oz?
I don't know what we got out of this.
How much money we get insurance-wise?
We got to clear...
I mean all that gear is going to take... a day? I have no idea.
We have to clean up everything and it has to dry up.
Are we covered with insurance for things like that?
Now look, we have to come here in the morning and see what we can do.
This could be dry. It may not.
Weather might be shitty.
It's going to be a mud hole.
It's not going to dry overnight.
No. It's... no.
Interesting situation.
Almost checkmate, but not quite.
We'll wriggle out of this somehow.
A call to the insurance company has revealed, that although the production is covered for any damage to equipment, they won't necessarily be covered for the shooting time lost due to acts of God.
In an attempt to salvage something from the day the producers have suggested that they try to resume shooting parts of the chain gang scene.
If we go ahead and try to shoot today, we won't get that done.
We'll shoot half a day today, we'll shoot half a day tomorrow. and we'll probably not get Friday.
The correct way to ensure that you continue on in a fully and the most operational way you can, is to take this day to put the unit back together.
But don't you see, would it not have been possible to go with a small unit?
No.
That's my answer: no.
And you can say that, that you talked to me and I said no.
I agree that most of the crew will have to reconcile everything, but why didn't you risk 10 people to shoot inside the taxi...
We need 10 people or 15 people.
This film unit is not able to function today, in any capacity except for maintenance and putting ourselves back together.
Although the sets have finally dried out, the heavy rains have entirely changed the color of the desert.
The landscape that Gilliam chose for its starkness, is now tinged with brown and green and won't match what's already been shot.
To make matters worse, the first part of the chain gang scene was shot in bright sunlight and now there's no sun at all.
It's wasted time to be honest, because there is no light.
And I don't know if there ever will.
Do you think it would be possible, just to anticipate, to come back to the base camp, and if the weather is keeping like that, to try to re-shoot the sequence?
I know that the sequence is with sunny weather, but I don't think we have other options.
If we want to do something...
I know, I know.
Here's a thought.
Taxi is bullshit.
We don't want to do taxi.
But we could do Johnny, tighter shots, and light him, even in this light.
- For which scene?
- Continuing the scene back there.
The crew decides to move camp in order to shoot a different scene which doesn't require bright sunlight.
The move will take several hours out of their day.
We wait them out.
I don't want to waste time, shooting dialogue while that's going on.
No, we can't.
There's going to be something else soon.
There'll be something else,
I do not know what it is, but...
Set there, ready to go.
These guys arrive.
And then we just started to move into Munchausen.
Why don't we try to shoot this?
No, we were setting up for that shot.
There's a plan, there's a very clear plan what we're doing and we're the victims of that.
If we keep running for each thing, all we do is run in circles.
I don't know what else to do.
All of us have done a lot of stuff, but none of us know the answer right now.
Everybody is just like...
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we're a minute away. Let's do final checks.
Be steady, Sancho.
Trust me...
It may happen that before we pass six days together,
I shall conquer a number of kingdoms.
Fuck you! We had a deal!
And your loyalty shall be rewarded.
Cut!
We're fucked!
Did you see him sit on the horse?
- Fucking crazy!
- The pain when he sat down...
He can't do it.
It ain't gonna happen.
I was watching his face very carefully as he got on that horse and it was just...
Oh, fuck.
He can't ride like that, he certainly can't act like that and he certainly can't jiggle hand props with that.
Honestly I want to go to the French and say,
"I'm going to refuse to shoot with Jean Rochefort on a horse until he is medically fit. "
The producers want to put him on the horse.
Terry wanted to put him on the horse.
Rochefort himself came out of the trailer and they put it to him and he wanted to get on the horse.
And I just overruled Phil, I said
"OK, he's got to do it.
He's got to put somebody on film.
He's been working 7 months.
He hasn't a chance to do anything.
Let's do it."
Lock it up everyone!
We're shooting now!
Action.
It may happen that before we spend six days together,
I shall conquer a number of kingdoms.
I will crown you king of one of them.
King!
Cut.
That was nice.
- One more, okay?
- Yes, one more.
When it was time for him to get off, it took two men to carry him off the horse and put him in a chair.
Took him 40 minutes from there to be able to walk to his car.
We're checking the gate, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.
I know it hasn't been the best week for everybody.
I know it's been really, really difficult.
And I know we've had a lot of calamity. but I'd like to thank you all very much for hanging in and doing your bit.
And all I can tell you is
I'll endeavor to make it better next week.
And I hope you'll join me at Monasterio de Piedra and we'll start making the film.
Thank you very much.
That's a warp. Let's pack it up.
Do we get snow next week?
Never, never, never, in 22 years I've been in this business,
I've never seen such a sum of "sfiga", we say in Italian... bad luck.
Sfiga is actually the better word than bad luck.
Because sfiga is the negation of the pussy.
La figa is the pussy, la sfiga is the negation of it.
Everything that can go wrong, goes wrong.
I mean everything.
Everything, everything, everything.
If you write a script and you think of the worst possible situation, you can't make it up.
I think storyboards is the only way to get my brain together.
The producers are looking for a solution to the film's problems.
And it's often the case on film productions, that the first solution is to replace the assistant director.
In this case, Gilliam's right-hand man,
Phil Patterson.
I think that actually if you fire him, he would be very happy, the first reaction then he probably would, because he...
It's basically he's taking all the responsibility on his shoulders.
And he's feeling it's a complete failure and it's his fault.
And that's ridiculous.
That's where that's coming from.
That kind of sense of responsibility and dedication is really rare.
Because Phil has been one of the few people holding this thing together.
His strength is that he just won't let go, he'll keep going.
And if he can regain some sense of being able to control the mess...
I don't know...
Later that day, Jean Rochefort flies back Paris, to see his doctor.
Although Rochefort will be returning in a few days, his departure leave the production in a quandary, about what to do with the next week's shoot.
I stated my opinion quite strongly that we should pack up, and we should take the unit back to Madrid and reconstitute ourselves and make a decision about where we were going.
Any form of shooting was wasteful.
There's a lot of argument to say
"Cut and run now. Stop."
But I would rather keep shooting because at least we're putting stuff on film, and we got people who just gave us
$16 million, coming down, 60 of them.
Yeah, we gotta shoot on Monday.
We have to shoot no matter what.
Welcome to Spain, to the set of the movie.
With Rochefort scheduled to return in two days,
Gilliam and the producers have decided to forge ahead and shoot the scenes that don't require him.
They're especially concerned that the location will be unusable in a few weeks when leaves begin to fall from the trees.
They also have their principal investors visiting the set.
You fiddle with the fish.
He springs up and the horse comes up and nudges you over that way.
So is that me?
I hope so. Or the horse.
He's very good. He's a professional.
Lock it up everyone.
We're shooting now.
I've loaded the fish.
The fish is loaded.
Here we go.
Roll camera!
Action.
Horse come on.
Come on horse, come on horse.
Cut it, cut it.
Let's do it again, straight away.
Action.
Horse come on.
We're moving in.
Is the horse about to move?
Good, good, good idea.
Cut.
Turn the camera on this.
Turn the camera on Johnny...
...looks in.
Let's just get on with it.
Johnny gets in a close-up. We don't have to be anywhere. Johnny can do it from here.
Leave the camera, he turns in the camera and walks out.
Get some shots.
This is fucking stupid. Jesus!
As Gilliam troubleshoots the scene, news arrives from Paris that it will be at least a week before
Jean Rochefort is well enough to return.
You now what they're going to ask us to do?
Then we got to cancel the film.
They're going to say, let's start him off without...
It's a funnier look from there.
But that was really good though.
Everything sort of fit.
Lock it up everyone.
We're shooting now.
You want to fuck with me, huh?
Fucker!
What were you thinking?
What were you thinking?
And cut it!
- Cut it. Just cut it out.
- Ladies and gentlemen, that's a wrap.
I'm the football.
The team! Excellent.
I'll be down here, like this.
OK, we give you one, two, three.
At three, I will be shooting, alright?
As the investors leave the set, the insurance adjusters arrive.
They've come to investigate last week's claims and to decide how to proceed in Rochefort's absence.
Just so you know, we're not going to shoot tomorrow.
So we're going to travel back to Madrid.
Just check in with production before you go.
8 o'clock, we meet at the base camp, have breakfast together and decide what to do.
Alright?
Meeting at 8 o'clock at the base camp, have breakfast together.
We'll see.
We're not shooting, but we'll see.
We don't known the state of
Jean Rochefort's health.
We don't know whether he's going to come back whole, or come back.
Or what. We don't know.
I mean, he's been tested, prodded, probed, poked.
And I suppose we'll know in a couple more days what his state is.
In the book, Cervantes does something very strange and very cruel.
At every turn
Cervantes mocks Quixote.
At every turn, Cervantes goes out of his way to show how foolish the old man is.
And the crueler he is, the more we love Quixote.
So that when this man becomes sane at the end, as the reader, we can't stand it.
We don't want him to be sane, we want him to remain mad. because we know full well, that when he is sane, he can die.
We're waiting to hear what the doctor says.
What test he wants to do.
Or does he just say
"Jean, you need to rest"?
We're just waiting to hear.
Literally there's nothing to do.
On film productions, a completion guarantor assumes financial responsibility for ensuring that a film will be completed and delivered on schedule.
Fred Millstein has come to Madrid to protect his assets and to help the production team cope with the recent setbacks.
I think there is no worse situation than not knowing anything.
So everyone is keeping asking every day
"What do we have to do?"
"When are we going to restart?"
And nobody is able to give an answer.
We don't know. We don't know.
No, that's all the news we have.
Fantastic. Brilliant.
Absolutely fantastic.
They're wonderful.
I mean, I keep working.
I keep marching ahead.
It's the one thing I've always been pretty good at, is just to keep marching ahead and doing it and saying "Yeah, we can do it, let's keep going, let's keep going."
We're not shooting Monday, Tuesday.
So you can have a holiday til then.
The production team has been working to arrange a new schedule based on Rochefort's return, but the news comes in from Rochefort's doctors that he will not be returning for at least 10 more days.
And while the production continues to spend money to keep the crew working, the insurance company seems to be claiming that Rochefort's illness may be a "force majeure" event, an act of God, not covered by the policy.
His opinions is more that, there's an insured event.
It's not "force majeure".
It needs to be defined.
But clearly, it's for acts of God.
And he doesn't think the illness of another actor is a force majeure event.
The "force majeure", it's necessary to have a definition for the force majeure to be applicable.
He was looking at the contract and he said there is no definition, no real definition of the force majeure. In that case, for him, it's not applicable at all.
My feeling, or my wish more than my feeling, is that we should at least stop for a few weeks or months and reorganize everything, because, of course the location now is a big mess cast is a big mess, crew is a big mess,
The best thing for everybody, and for the film, would to be able to stop, but I know that financially, that's a lot of money.
The insurance company was saying
"Hold on, you have to be very careful.
Keep everybody on track, but on the other hand, don't spend money."
The question is whether they would re-insure Jean.
That's the problem.
Then the pressure would be to re-cast and that's what
I don't want to do.
And I don't even know who can do the job.
We spent a long time coming to Jean Rochefort.
He spent a year and a half thinking about it and 7 months learning English and he's magnificent.
Another problem with recasting the film, is that Gilliam, Depp and Rochefort are what are contractually known as essential elements.
If any one of them leaves the project, the film must be entirely refinanced.
The idea is to reschedule the film as soon as possible.
Check with everybody, actors, all the departments and locations about their availability of the new schedule based on starting on the 16th.
What's happening if Jean is not back on the 16th?
There are many possibilities.
The film is going to be done.
It doesn't matter how.
The film is going to be done.
I'd just like to know, for the record, where is the director of this film?
This is no way to make a film, even a small film.
To make one like this, it's impossible.
The fact is, nothing is pushing us right now. There's no motor anymore in this.
We're just waiting for the insurance to tell us what to do.
Nobody seems to be in control, of anything.
I like shooting things, even if it's completely fucked up and totally useless.
At least, there's images.
Something to pay... to justify the several years of work.
So much denial going on.
You know, the fact, the 27th of November,
Jean Rochefort is going to be back, dancing, jumping on the horse.
Forget about it!
I mean, accept the idea this man won't be fit to make the movie.
No, but see, the problem is, we had force majeure last weekend and we should have used that in order to straighten house.
And when I say to Bernard, like I did today, "Bernard,
"tell me now, tell me straight to my face that if Rochefort comes back,
"and we have him on the set, and I turn to you
"as the first AD, on the set,
"and say 'this man is incapable of working',
"are you going to sail me down the tube again?
"Are you going to vote against my decision?"
- And I'm trying to remain...
- You're not fully succeeding.
- somewhat rational...
- Somewhat is good enough.
Here's what's making me crazy.
Okay, we've stopped shooting and now we're reorganizing ourselves.
Well, are we reorganizing ourselves?
- No.
- No.
That's what pisses me off, this is the whole point of the time, is to go through and get ourselves in fighting, fit shape to actually do the film. and nothing is happening.
We're running around in circles.
And the days are just floating past.
And we're getting in worse shape than we were when we stopped.
I don't know how one gets out.
Not having been in this stuff before.
I plowed on. And I don't have any energy to plow on at the moment.
- This isn't a plowable...
- Yeah, I know. I know that.
So I don't know how a plug gets pulled on a thing like this.
Look, I'm going to go back to Algete and I'm going to tell the French producers that I'm not going to continue in the project the way it is.
And explain to them the reason that I'm leaving the film is that I don't have confidence in the producers to support me in the decisions that need to be made in terms of making the film.
We can't make the film.
Not the film you want to make.
You know, I'm sorry to be, as always, the bearer of bad tidings.
Whatever, but...
I don't know anymore.
I've lost it completely.
I can't imagine the film anymore.
That's my problem.
Yeah. Exactly.
And now everyone's limping off to other jobs already.
Have you heard any more since the fact that doctors are just doing more tests today?
Yeah, for the insurers all going to Paris tomorrow.
It's almost like
I've forgotten about this film.
It's like it doesn't exist, it can't exist.
Because if it does exist, it's too painful.
I'll just hang around here.
Okay. Alright, thanks. Bye.
Well, the insurers are all meeting in Paris tomorrow.
Rene's going up there to decide what to do.
But there's been a little complication -
Fred Millstein, the completion bond... guy has been down here the last few days, trying to... sort things out.
He was saying something to Jose about the fact that the paperwork isn't quite correct between him and the insurance company.
And it could mean that he's going to get stuck with the bill.
Which would be disastrous for him, because he's not protected in the way insurance companies are.
And Jose is saying of course he will fight it and it may end up in court, with them fighting over who picks up the pieces, or picks up the pieces of paper that need paying.
It's like there's this curse of Quixote.
Going on around us.
Interesting.
Listen to that wind.
It started with the deluge, and now the great wind is sweeping it clean, blowing Quixote out of Spain, forever.
It's howling out there "It's over."
By the end of October, it's clear that Rochefort will not return.
He's been diagnosed with a double herniated disc.
And it requires at least another month of recovery.
What is the state of the film now?
Often, when you have problems in prep and when you have a shaky film production the usual catch cry of the film is
"Let's start shooting and straighten it out."
Always in the belief that to begin filming will help you get on track and send you down one path.
The old "train theory".
It didn't work this time.
Jean Rochefort was the sort of tragic end to it.
A series of problems that beset the film quite early on.
Maybe the only real responsibility of Terry is about all this mess, that is in order to make it happen,
I believe he lowered too much his targets.
And he gave an impression of being about to do a more simple movie than it is.
Because again, it's been going on for so long for him.
I mean that's what we don't consider, for him, this is not the first time.
Terry is very good at being proud of how impossible something might be, but no director is going to start a picture thinking "we may not ever get through this".
It was very painful to see it all coming horribly true.
Like I say, it was... the most painful thing was seeing reality win over Don Quixote in the end.
Because it did.
I honestly don't know what I'd like to see happen
I suppose on one hand,
I'd like Jean to get better and us to be able to make the film
And that would be... on the other hand,
I don't know. I mean I just like...
I've done the film too often in my head, too many times.
I've seen it, I've been through it,
I know how it goes.
Is it better, you know, to just leave it there? I really don't know.

Doctor.
No!
Doctor.
I thought I wouIdn't make it.
Your briefcase.
You Ieft it on your desk.
-Are RenoI's papers here?
-Yes.
Don't forget tonight's dinner party.
The cIass at the University is tomorrow at 1 1 .
The Iecture's in the afternoon.
PIease keep warm, and rest.
If there's anything you need...
I'm okay.
Doctor!
I wanted to teII you that... you have nothing to worry about.
I know you don't Iike to
Ieave your office unattended.
It's not unattended.
Can I heIp you?
-Do I know you?
-I don't think so.
AII oId passengers Iook aIike.
Are you going to the convention?
You too?
I'm going to a party!
Where were you?
In the cafeteria.
Were you drinking?
You stink!
WouId you hoId this?
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'II be right back.
Are you sure there's no one eIse?
I'm sure.
She couIdn't Ieave without her case.
I've checked each and every car.
And the washrooms?
-Maybe something happened to her.
-Check the cafeteria.
Your mother may be waiting for you there.
-No, she's not my mother.
-Then why worry so much?
I'm sorry.
Doctor?
Dr. Fausto?
Do I know you?
Dr. Fausto, it's you.
What a pIeasure!
You don't remember?
You don't remember me?
WeII, you shouId.
You removed my stomach.
Santos.
Santos VeIIa.
At EI ProvinciaI, 8 years ago.
Pancreatic cancer.
A mixed tumor, with compIications.
No?
Without the oxygen mask...
-Did I attend to you?
-You said I was terminaI.
We had a rather intense reIationship.
But you operated 5 times first.
The Iast time, to show some students an irreversibIe process.
-It seems I was wrong.
-It seems.
You said 3 months, and it's been 8 years.
Don't apoIogize.
These things happen.
-I'm not.
-As I said, these things happen.
My stomach?
-What?
-My stomach.
-Your stomach?
-Yes. Did you keep it?
-What for?
-What became of it?
They threw it away, I guess.
In the garbage?
That's not too cooI.
You want us to keep it after 8 years?
Of course not.
I'd Iike to have seen it.
I'm sure it didn't Iook too good.
How'd you do it?
-What?
-This.
Live.
Staying away from hospitaIs.
When I see one,
I cross the street.
I forgot my card.
Santos, Santos VeIIa.
-It's pronounced with one ''I''.
-VeI-Ia.
No, VeIIa, Iike mozzareIIa.
-VeIIa.
-VeIIa.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Where are you staying?
Don't teII me.
At the NationaI.
-You're here for the convention.
-Of course.
-I'II drive you.
-No, I'II take a cab.
No probIem.
I have to go somewhere eIse first.
I'II drive you.
It's nice to see you, doctor.
-My stomach...
-Fuck, no!
I'd rather go aIone.
Great.
Great.
When I get to a new city,
I Iike to discover it aIone too.
We're grown-ups.
Anything you need, you've got my card.
You got a probIem, you caII me. Okay?
Sure.
You swear?
No, I beIieve you.
It's a pIeasure to see you, doctor.
And thanks for everything.
He's a great guy, Iady.
No sweat!
Fuck!
-To the NationaI HoteI, pIease.
-Right away.
Doesn't that sound strange?
What?
The car.
Not at aII.
It's as strong as a buII.
Over 20 years without a breakdown.
Son of a bitch!
Damn son of a bitch!
Got a probIem?
A buII?
It's more Iike a cow!
What's it about?
The convention.
-TerminaI medicine.
-TerminaI medicine?
That's going to be fun.
I'm gonna fuck your father, and I'm Iate!
WeII, what then?
You have to go somewhere first?
-I'II go Iater.
-You sure?
Yes.
It was a Iie, right?
You say that to get rid of me.
Admit it.
Admit it.
-AII right, I admit it.
-Great.
Great.
I catch on to everything.
I've gotten smart.
ReaIIy, I've studied.
I pay attention to the things I shouId.
You see...
If someone teIIs you you're going to die... you change.
You think: What do I do with the IittIe time I got Ieft?
You do 4 important things.
This, this and this.
The rest is just shit, man.
It's not worth it.
-That's why I owe you.
-Forget it.
No, no, no. I owe you one.
So... teII me what you want.
I'II take care of it.
-Don't bother.
-It's no bother.
It's no bother.
Doctor...
I want to make you happy.
-What have you got there?
-I don't know. It's not mine.
Did you steaI it?
Me? PIease.
Someone Ieft it on the train...
-You haven't opened it?
-No.
Fuck! That is admirabIe.
Fausto, Fausto...
WeII, here we are.
I'II take that case to the station.
No, thanks, someone at the hoteI can...
I'II take care of it.
No probIem.
Besides, someone there owes me a favor.
Fausto, how nice to see you.
How are you?
We were betting on whether you'd come or not.
-Has Quiroga arrived?
-He shouId have this morning.
Hi, good evening.
Santos VeIIa. It's a pIeasure.
My pIeasure.
VeIIa, pronounced with one ''I''.
Like mozzareIIa.
You know the doctor?
Of course.
Me too.
He removed my stomach.
That was a Iong time ago.
Forget it, man.
You're here for the convention?
Yes.
To taIk about your
IittIe tumors and things.
Thank you very much.
He's getting rid of me.
It's a pIeasure.
Anything you need, caII.
You want a girI?
-I don't understand.
-Man, what a joker!
I don't know him.
He's a patient.
My brother-in-Iaw went to a speciaIist and asked:
''Doctor, how Iong have
I get Ieft to Iive?''
And you know what the guy toId him?
''That depends.
When wiII you pay my biII?''
Why must we wash?
Do butchers wash?
Who says they haven't jerked off before cutting up a sirIoin steak?
AIthough they're butchers... they jerk off, don't they?
What do you say, Fausto?
''Sagittarius, Capricorn?''
''No, son, what I said was Cancer.''
Cancer, cancer.''
You don't need to be a butcher to know if they jerk off.
She's Daisy, my assistant.
I've heard that before.
Me too, and I saw it.
The Frenchman, for exampIe, at the ProvinciaI.
Before each operation.
-ReaIIy?
-I swear.
And if he operated 3 times,
3 times.
They caII the doctor
''the gardener''.
-You know why?
-No.
Because he works with pIants.
TerminaI cases.
When we don't know what to do with someone... we send them to him to see what he invents.
You've aII ordered mushrooms.
You don't understand him.
What he'd Iike is to see aII his patients aIive.
Who wouIdn't?
We shouId cIose the greenhouse.
It's useIess.
I don't even know if it's
IegaI to have aII those... peopIe there.
It's a research center.
We research medicine to be used in the first phases.
That's fine.
But I wouIdn't Iike to be in your shoes.
How many patients die a year?
How many this year?
When you get to a thousand, you'II win a prize!
Never trust a dermatoIogist.
They skin peopIe aIive.
There'II be broads too.
Shit, BieIsa.
They're in coma.
And, so what?
You shouId see them at the morgue, with the femaIe corpses.
That's different.
They're dead.
Like Daisy.
20 years in practice and stiII thinks... a practitioner is a churchgoer.
Excuse me.
Is there a doctor in the house?
PIease!
Continue administering Codeine... onIy untiI Thursday... and then give him antibiotics.
His temperature's down to 37.8.
Continue with Naproxen.
RenoI.
Very good.
I have the file in front of me.
RenoI.
Let's withdraw his breather.
-Withdraw it?
-CompIeteIy.
The corticoids as weII.
And watch his apnea.
Watch his evoIution.
-Is his mother stiII with him?
-She hasn't moved.
Who is it?
Doctor?
-Who is it?
-Doctor?
Dr., are you still there?
JuIia, my dinner's here.
I'II caII you tomorrow.
Is this for reaI?
Great.
I Iove Iuxury hoteIs.
When I get rich,
I'II Iive in one Iike this.
Who are you?
I hear you're eminent.
I asked you something.
I study medicine.
This heIps me pay my registration fees.
I toId Santos
I didn't want anything.
I have no idea.
What do you have to do to be eminent?
Study a Iot... or drink a Iot of miIk?
I toId Santos...
HoId this.
Who is it?
Room service.
Your breakfast.
Come in and Ieave it next to the bed.
Okay.
Which one of the two?
The one that was sIept in.
Do you want orange or strawberry marmaIade?
-Strawberry.
-Great, me too.
Good book.
A IittIe sIow though.
But that's okay.
They never make fuckin' toast properIy.
What a pain!
What are you doing here?
-How'd you get in?
-That's easy.
A friend in maintenance owed me a IittIe favor.
And taIking about favors, now you owe me one.
The suitcase.
The oId Iady went to pick it up.
We'II never know what was in it.
-How'd you sIeep?
-Fine.
-PIease Ieave.
-Sure.
I toId reception no caIIs.
You need to rest up a bit.
WeII, what can I do for you?
Get out.
You have to go.
Sure, and so do you.
It's aImost eIeven... and from here to the
University we've got...
You're the one who's Ieaving.
Just a moment.
It's for you.
-For me?
-Yes, for you.
I said I'd be here.
Excuse me. Yes?
Hey, man, what's up?
I'm with a friend.
What is it?
Yeah.
Okay, five minutes.
I can't go with you.
I'm so sorry.
Did I give you my card?
Yesterday.
WeII, here,
I get a good price on them.
If you need any, or anything eIse, just caII.
At any time.
WiII you?
Don't worry.
Yes?
-Julia.
-Doctor.
I caIIed this morning but couIdn't get through.
They made a mistake.
Listen.
Do me a favor.
Find a Santos Vella's medical record.
-With a double ''l''.
-Like in mozzareIIa.
Send it to me at the University.
Right away.
For your Iecture?
Of course.
Find the origin of the illness in the body. Surround it... in an attempt to establish the progress of the metastasis.
Determining what organs were infected first.
Who infected who?
Differentiating the focaI point from the sateIIites.
A sick body is Iike a freeway, fuII of signs.
Of indicators.
Some are cIear, Iuminous.
Others are conceaIed.
IIIness is a cIumsy criminaI.
It Ieaves cIues.
Many times, the body itseIf is the origin of the iIIness.
It creates it and encourages it aIong the way.
From where?
Is there an evil gland?
Ancient people spent their lives searching for it.
They thought that removing it, they wouId eradicate the iIIness.
Today, in certain Asian countries...
Iive rats are inserted in the sick patients' bodies.... to track down putrefaction amongst the healthy organs.
We now know that gland is not in the human body.
It's in the soul.
In those occasions, the iIIness... is a seIf-destructive process.
Trying to check it is Iike... trying to stop a suicidaI person.
Death... aIways finds its way.
It is an end that... cannot be refused.
It's there from the very beginning.
It's part of the deaI ever since we're born.
AII births... carry an impIicit death.
It is not enough to teach students... how to eradicate the iIIness.
We must aIso Iearn... to accept it.
Doctor!
Do me the honor.
You know each other, right?
Listen to me.
I don't know how you do this... nor why, but I don't care!
I don't want to see you again!
I want you to go, to disappear from my Iife!
Watch what you're asking for.
It couId come true.
Sir.
I thought you couId use it.
Why are you so surprised?
I toId you yesterday, in the car.
I'm here to make you happy.
I don't want your heIp... and I'm not interested in your ghost stories.
You're not the first terminaI case to get better.
You say you're my patient, but I'm not sure.
I think you're a charIatan... and you bore me to no end!
-I don't beIieve a word you say.
-Ask.
What?
Make a wish.
Whatever you want.
I wish... to go.
Granted.
If someone...
If you couId make a wish...
-what wouId you wish?
-Everything.
More money, to fuck more,... an orgy with five broads... and one of them bIack.
And you?
At 1 3:46 we register the first cortical activity.
Sweating, motivity and spasms.
Voluntary medullary movements... and cornea, labial and trachea reflexes... that continue until 1 3:52.
Oculocephalic reactions after... lateralization and heave movements of the head.
Blood pressure stabilized, and behavioral response... to nociceptive stimuli.
At 1 3:59, the oxygen mask and endotrachea catheter were removed without symptoms of apnea.
Three minutes later, he hugs his mother.
1 7 minutes in total.
Isn't that incredible?
IncredibIe, yes.
I called the University, but you had already left.
-Aren't you pleased?
-Of course.
I'll give you the report tomorrow.
I'II take the first train.
Doctor.
It's the most amazing recovery
I've ever seen.
Congratulations.
What are you Iooking for?
Fausto, have you Iost your speech?
What are you doing?
PIease, sir!
God, I just picked it up!
...dying has become so indecent that it is disguised and sterilized... between clean and opaque hospital walls.
Death exists.
It forms part of Iife.
It may be the non-Iife.
Santos VeIIa.
AIthough it's been repressed, exiIed... from the sociaI awareness it had beIonged to... the greatest deceit for the dying...
Have we met before?
I don't think so.
It is not charity for those who are to die...
Are you sure?
I think we have.
At a hospitaI, maybe?
I doubt it.
I visit my patients at home.
Then at some brotheI.
...a causaI iIIness of progressive evoIution... with a prognosis of one month to Iive,... a treatment of proved inefficiency... and a Ioss of hope for recovery.
The cIinicaI reports... indicate the degree of damage... or organic insufficiency, and aIIow estabIishing deadIines.
TerminaI processes.
Excuse me.
What did you say your name is?
I didn't say.
Doctor Fierro.
Which impIies an oId acquaintance... who I'd rather not see...
-Doctor Fierro.
-Yes.
-CardioIogist?
-No, dermatoIogist.
What a coincidence!
You too?
No. I've got some spots.
What do you think?
It's the first time.
...of a piIgrimage that begins... with the birth of said protocoI.
These images beIong to research... work and surgicaI revitaIization of tissues... carried out over a two-year period... which we caII the bIue phase of the project.
They were taken... during the operations carried out by... the professionaI team coordinated by...
I gave the tape to her.
Shit, it's not my fauIt!
Your research is very interesting.
We've Iearned a Iot.
Did you fiIm that?
It was you!
What?
Quiroga, I ought to...
You ought to what?
I'II teII you.
You ought to shut up.
And make sure of thing before accusing anyone.
And show a IittIe more respect for your coIIeagues.
But, above aII, you ought to...
Iend us that tape for tonight.
Fierro.
That means ''iron''.
DermatoIogist.
He prescribed a cream, DisantiI.
I don't know him.
Is she nice?
What?
Your assistant, JuIia.
What do you know about JuIia?
You never teII me anything.
You want to know things about me, but never teII me anything.
''Dr. Fausto, the report you asked me for.
JuIia.''
If you want to know anything about me, just ask.
Who are you?
Your best wish.
Why?
Because you aIone aren't capabIe.
For how Iong?
UntiI they come true.
AII of them.
You're getting oId, Fausto.
How oId do you think I am?
The same as you.
Do I Iook it?
I take care of myseIf.
But you don't take care of yourseIf.
Look how you dress.
You earn money and can buy yourseIf a better suit.
We're fucked.
I've got something you couId use.
There was a Chinese proverb.
How'd it go?
I forgot.
Oh, yes!
Dress you body with eIegant cIothes and your souI wiII smiIe.
What the fuck do they know, they wear robes?
My house.
You Iike it?
How many hours a day do you work?
You're so surrounded by corpses... that you Iook Iike them more and more.
Come in.
Make yourseIf at home.
Doctor, right this way.
Have you ever tried...
Ieaving a restaurant without paying?
Or crossing the street against the Iight?
No, right?
Have you tried Iiving?
-Certain things can't change.
-That's not you taIking.
-It wasn't you who said that.
-No?
-Who did then?
-Your dissatisfaction.
And dissatisfaction is an iIIness.
Of the souI, but an iIIness.
Is she nice or not?
What?
Your assistant.
What's her name...? JuIia.
Don't teII me it never crossed your mind.
-How do I know?
-''How do I know?''
Have you taken a good Iook at her?
Did you ever kiss her?
Yes, once.
On her birthday.
BIessed Christ of the HoIy Power, doctor.
You two have an unheaIthy reIationship.
Your gIass.
That wouIdn't be bad.
What?
Someone to Iook after her and...
Not ''someone''.
Who is ''someone''?
BeIieve me, Iet yourseIf go.
For exampIe:
Haven't you ever wanted to break something reaIIy expensive?
No, don't do it.
Have you wanted to or not?
Sometimes.
Let's see.
Number seven.
WeII, weII.
That's why you're aIive.
Because you wished it.
CouId be.
Come on, it's very reIaxing.
Every wanted to rob a store?
Go to the movies without paying?
Or drink your neighbor's whiskey... and put your feet on the tabIe
Iike a gentIeman?
Doctor!
Have music bIasting?
Fuck the neighbors!
To yeII and dance... and jump on the sofa... and just go crazy?
Come on!
-Ever wanted to kiII someone?
-What?
KiII.
Doctor!
-Try it on.
-For me?
Okay?
What?
How is it?
-Why are you taking so Iong?
-Just a moment!
I'm aImost done.
To me that's not funny.
I think it's very funny.
I had to write them a check.
A check?
How much?
Six hundred.
I'm sorry.
Six hundred thousand?
You at Ieast kept the suit.
It doesn't matter.
It's going to bounce.
Fuckin' cooI!
There's no money!
Look at you!
-What day is today?
-How do I know?
My daughter's throwing a party.
Let's go.
No, I shouId go to the hoteI.
Doctor, your wishes.
Don't you remember?
Besides, she has some nice girIfriends.
ReaIIy, he has a young friend, doctor...
-Don't tempt me.
-Don't tempt me!
Sure I tempt you.
That's what we're here for.
I Iove young peopIe.
Doctor Fausto!
Thank you so much!
My case.
I don't know what I'd have done without it.
You want her?
I can get her for you.
Where's your daughter?
I don't know.
Around somewhere.
What's the matter?
JuIia must be worried something happened to me.
She's worried you're fucking someone eIse.
Santos, Iook at this!
They're RoIex.
Doctor!
I'm so happy to see you!
Do I know you?
A bIow job in your hoteI.
Remember?
-That's right.
-What are you doing here?
Roaming around.
You Iook better.
-Than when I bIew you off.
-Thanks.
Thanks a Iot.
Martita!
Daddy!
HeIIo, darIing!
-Where were you?
-Right here.
A IittIe present!
Look.
My daughter.
You had met, right?
Can I make a wish for someone eIse?
-For who?
-For JuIia.
Go ahead.
I toId you before.
I'd Iike for someone to take care of her.
Don't worry.
What do you mean ''don't worry''?
What is ''don't worry''?
Someone'II take care of her.
''Granted''.
ReaI genies... say ''granted''.
Not ''don't worry''.
-Granted.
-That's better.
''Don't worry''.
What a shitty genie you are.
Where are you going?
Take a fuckin' guess.
Aren't you a genie?
Genies never guess.
Those are magicians.
He's an asshoIe.
ManoIo, another drink.
HeIIo.
HeIIo.
Your hands are bIue.
I know.
Yeah?
And you don't care?
-It doesn't wash away.
-That's how they are.
I dye things bIue.
Things?
What things?
I don't know, everything.
You Iive here?
-In the bathroom?
-No, I mean in the city.
For now.
I Iove to move around.
-Don't you?
-Moving? I Iove it.
Today here, tomorrow there.
Adventures.
-What do you do?
-Nothing.
I operate tumors, necrosis, those IittIe things.
ReaIIy?
Or are you putting me on?
''Putting me on''?
What does that mean?
It's something Iike teasing me, making fun of me.
''Putting me on''.
I Iike that.
-What's your name?
-Margarita.
For now.
For now?
You Iike to change names?
Of course. Don't you?
You're ''putting me on''.
No I'm not.
Yes, I can teII you are ''putting me on''.
You're ''putting me on''.
-She's ''putting me on''.
-Let's go!
At your service, Fausto.
Why did he say that?
No reason.
It's a very Iong story.
He spends his time granting me my wishes.
AII of them?
What do you mean?
AII your wishes?
The eviI ones too?
I'm sure you have eviI wishes too.
Maybe.
Doctor... is this going to hurt?
Fausto.
Fausto, wake up.
You're going to miss this.
Look.
It's not very straight.
But it's not bad, for being my first time.
Santos, get it off me!
Get it off me!
Get out of there.
He hadn't eaten anything, you know?
Let's see what we've got here.
What was that you said?
PIease, Santos!
Is there an eviI gIand?
It exists, Fausto.
Do you have it?
WeII, I do.
It's an enormous gIand.
As Iarge as me.
Not you.
You're good. Yes.
You just have a very IittIe gIand... that is annoying and makes you doubt,... makes you be a IittIe eviI... but onIy at times.
WeII, Iet's rip it out before it grows.
Let's see.
Here it is!
CouId this be it?
I don't think so.
Fuck, couId I be Iooking in the wrong pIace?
Maybe it's down here.
An atrocity. They've given him a terribIe beating.
OccipitaI trauma with Ioss, possibIe cIot, evaIuate.
Respiratory apnea with Ioss of tone.
OccipitaI trauma with Ioss,
Ieft vestibuIar tearing.
Stop, stop!
-Isn't that Quiroga?
-I think so.
Give me the Mayo tube, fast.
That's it.
Come on, come on, fast.
Doctor Fausto!
Doctor Fausto, pIease!
Doctor!
Doctor Fausto!
QUIROGA, SON OF A BITCH!
For God's sake, what have you done?
No, man, no. PIease.
I didn't do anything.
I just got here.
He did it.
I'm sure it was him.
He gets in anywhere.
Friends owe him favors, and here too.
Who?
I don't know who you mean.
The room is in your name.
Everything is broken.
There were many things.
Expensive things, broken.
You must pay.
Why aII this?
Because I removed his stomach, his fuckin' stomach!
Yes.
Doctor?
I'm at the station.
I just got in.
I've brought it all.
The doctor said
I'd see you at lunch.
Doctor?
What doctor?
Fierro. He's very kind.
You shouldn't have bothered.
Fierro. I didn't... Julia!
Fausto, did you sIeep weII?
Very IittIe, of course.
Let me taIk to JuIia!
She had a good trip.
Excuse me.
-I was right, she's a piece.
-Leave her alone!
Stay away from her!
Don't touch her!
JuIia!
Don't be so possessive, you never Iooked twice at her.
Son of a bitch, don't touch her!
If you touch her, I'II kiII you!
Why worry?
You wished this, remember?
''Someone to take care of her.''
No, don't thank me.
That's what I'm here for.
I owe it to you.
I wiII.
Regards.
That man worries a Iot about you.
-He sounded a bit strange.
-His voice.
Yesterday we went dancing untiI Iate.
ReaIIy?
What are you doing, have you gone crazy?
You can't go.
-You ruined the room...
-The fuckin' room seems yours!
Listen, wait!
Hey, caIm down.
It's Ioaded.
-Easy.
-Don't move!
Freeze!
Fuckin' freeze!
Don't foIIow me!
-Don't foIIow me!
-Take it easy.
Attention, security, armed man. Second fIoor.
Move it!
Move it!
He's armed. He's Ieaving the hoteI. CaII the poIice.
I hope they show up.
I hope they show up.
I hope they fuckin' show up!
I hope they show up.
Where is he?
Where is Santos, you son of a bitch?
TaIk!
TaIk or I'II kiII you!
TaIk!
It's okay, he's a patient of mine.
Where is Santos?
Where is he?
TaIk or I'II kiII you!
You bastard!
Let's have a drink whiIe we wait for the doctor.
I don't know if I shouId.
I'm a bit tired from the trip.
I promised the doctor
I'd take care of you.
A drink?
-WeII, if you insist.
-I insist.
You heard me.
You can check it.
I'm a surgeon.
I'm here for a convention.
He's crazy.
Fuck, you don't understand!
He'II kiII her!
He'll kill my assistant!
Finish your drink.
It'II do you good.
I'm a doctor.
Fausto wiII be here any minute now.
-You're very kind.
-Thank you.
Are you two invoIved?
I'm sorry if I've said anything
I shouIdn't have.
No.
It's not that.
Our reIationship is... professionaI.
Ten years working together, and with a woman...
Iike you, next to him every day... there's been... nothing?
Nothing at aII?
You're a very speciaI woman, JuIia.
-Charge it to 21 3.
-Okay.
Yeah.
Where'd you say you visit your patients?
I didn't say.
In private cIinics.
I can't stand Iarge hospitaIs.
AII that bureaucracy was making me dizzy.
I think Dr. Fausto is going to be Iate.
Yes.
-Anything pIanned for tonight?
-No, nothing.
I can't beIieve that.
-How Iong has it been?
-Ages.
The uniform Iooks good.
You're quite a dandy, AIfonsito.
Your wife takes good care of you. You don't deserve her.
That's the way it goes.
How are the kids?
The eIder is eight now.
Eight years?
Time sure does fuckin' fIy.
-She was in the cradIe.
-This is the baby.
Shit!
-She starts schooI next week.
-You are drooIing, my man!
The hoteI has dropped the charges.
Fausto, for God's sake, what is this?
Have you seen yourseIf?
Have you caImed down?
Promise him you won't do it again.
Listen!
I operated him many years ago.
He shouId be dead, but he isn't.
I removed his entire stomach.
Now he say he want to make me happy.
That fucked him so much, now he's after me.
What about my assistant?
Maybe he kiIIed her.
-PIease, arrest him!
-Here we go again.
Fausto, don't be siIIy or this gentIeman won't Iet you out.
Come on.
Were you reaIIy carrying a gun?
You had me fooIed.
JuIia's an extraordinary woman.
And very attractive.
You shouId Iearn to Iook at her differentIy.
I'm sure she'd Iove that.
She has toId me a few things... about you.
She Iikes you a Iot, you know?
What did you do to her?
What you wanted.
Take care of her.
Shit, stop that, you're gonna make me fuckin' cry!
PIease.
Is there any way... to stop aII this?
Yes.
Of course.
One.
I'm going to miss you.
Okay, okay, there's no need to say it, doctor.
I know what you're thinking.
The biII for 209, pIease.
I'm checking out.
AII right.
-Dr. Fausto, right?
-Yes.
Someone is waiting in the bar, sir.
Who?
She didn't Ieave a name.
JuIia?
JuIia!
-Are you aII right?
-Just fine.
And you?
You had me worried.
We waited aII afternoon.
My day has been a IittIe... weird.
Dr. Fierro couIdn't wait.
He toId me to teII you.
I've brought RenoI's report.
Everything.
I got a research committee together.... and they want you in it.
They want you there soon.
Today, if possibIe.
The records you wanted.
The compIete originaIs.
How strange.
It's not signed.
I must have overIooked that.
The next train out today is at 7:1 5.
That's in 20 minutes.
The next one's at 9... and the Iast one at 1 1 :30.
JuIia... we work too much.
We shouId take the day off.
A day to reIax, and go back tomorrow. Okay?
Have you visited the city?
-No.
-Great!
You'II Iove it.
Pour me a whiskey, and...
The same.
Have you had fun?
TruthfuIIy... yes.
Want anything eIse?
What's wrong?
Nothing. You see... for a moment... before seeing you...
I wanted... to be dead.
- [Voiceover] I
was born in 1968, the day before Martin Luther
 King Junior was assassinated.
My mom raised me to
believe in freedom, justice, and equality for all.
I dreamed of fighting
 the good fight.
But I never dreamed
that my first attempt at labor activism would be as a stripper.
[seductive music]
- When I was 27, I
moved to San Francisco to be a writer and
 stand up comic.
So I finally, you
 know, came out.
I was the second to last
 person to know I was a dyke.
Can you guess who the last was?
- [Voiceover] Your mother.
- My mother.
Then finally my mother
 turned to me and she said,
"Julia, can we talk?"
"Julia, every
 Friday night you go
"to that lesbian night club.
"What is it called?
"The Clit Club.
"Julia, all of you
 friends are lesbians.
"Julia, do they think
 you're a lesbian?"
[audience laughing]
- Doing comedy wasn't
 paying the bills.
I needed a job with
 flexible hours and good pay.
A friend suggested I work at the Lusty Lady, because it had a
reputation as the hip, feminist peep show with good working conditions.
I was comfortable
showing my body, especially since there was
 no cigar chomping boss.
Most of the managers were women.
So what's the object
 of putting on makeup?
- [Voiceover] It's like a mask.
- [Voiceover] A mask?
- [Voiceover] Yeah. Like
 getting ready for the circus.
[laughter]
- [Voiceover] You're
 a big ol' clown.
- [Voiceover] It's kind of
 fun to be a little disguised.
- This makeup I've got right
here belonged to my mother, in the early 80's and I, when I was 13 just like fell in love with it.
I mean what 13 year old girl would not like this like sparkly purple powder.
But it's still good,
 because it's quality shit.
- [Voiceover] It's not like she's heterosexual.
[laughter]
[hip hop music]
- [Voiceover]
Unlike strip clubs, where dancers have physical
contact with customers, we dance in a small
 mirrored room.
The men stand in booths
the size of broom closest and watch us through windows at about 15 seconds per quarter.
- I never been inside
 of a peep show.
And I remember the
 first time on stage,
I couldn't get over how much
 it looked like a fish tank.
Like I was under water, like the mermaid.
And I loved dancing in a
 little room with other women.
It was like a
 weird pajama party.
Um, I liked the
music, the lights, and I like the fact
that the customers look like little things in
 boxes, like jack-n-the box.
What we all have
in common is that, ya know we're all
 in it for the money.
Ya know, I wouldn't
be standing, ya know, in heels for a bunch
 of strangers if I
 wasn't getting paid.
- But I love working at the peep show because
I've never worked with so many
 women with college degrees.
[laughter]
- Mostly in women's studies and philosophy.
It's like the figured out
 what to do about patriarchy.
Take their money.
[laughing and cheering]
- So what's your name?
- Walter.
- Walter.
How you doin' Walter?
- Pretty good,
 how are you doing?
- Pretty good, have
 you been here before?
- A couple times.
- [Voiceover] I was working
full time in social services, but then on my off
 day I would strip.
So, yeah, social
 work and sex work.
It's kind of odd.
I loved it actually.
I felt that it was
 a very strong thing.
Use my sexuality,
my feminine power, in a way that made me feel good and a way that profited me.
That I was finally being paid what I was worth, which I was not
 in my job before.
And the women that I met dancing were some of the strongest women I've met in my whole life.
- Sex work is a form of work.
The sex industry is an industry that pays many peoples' bills, pays people through school, raises children.
It helps people start
 small businesses.
But, at the same time, I view
 sex work as a sacred act.
Even in the most base context, like this pornographic
peep show, there's life force in
 it and it is healthy.
And I considered myself to be
 providing a spiritual service.
A sexual spiritual service.
[simple guitar music playing]
- I was so naiïve.
I really worried that
they wouldn't hire me because I couldn't
 dance well enough.
[laughter]
Gee, mom, thanks for the six years of ballet.
[laughter]
- My mom had taught me
 that I could be anything.
My mom was a nice Jewish girl and her parents expected her to marry a doctor.
She rebelled, she
 became a doctor.
I went to medical school too, tucked under my mom's lab coat.
She was a divorced
mother in the 1970's who told me not to be
 ashamed of my body.
To feel entitled to pleasure.
To be independent and strong.
In graduate school
I wrote a paper analyzing the feminist debates
 about the sex industry.
Even though I
argue that sex work should be understood
 as just that, work.
I didn't tell my classmates or my mother about my job in the industry.
In San Francisco, I found out that I could make the most money at the strip clubs with
 stage shows and lap dancing.
But the idea of dancing alone
 on a stage was terrifying.
Despite six years of
 ballet, I can't dance.
Unlike strip clubs,
 at a peep show,
I wouldn't be alone on a stage and there are poles
 I can hang on too.
Now that I could do.
One day I was late to work
 by a couple of minutes.
The managers told me I wouldn't get my scheduled raise.
That's when I started
 seeing the problems.
- You could be working
there for two years and be making 20 dollars an hour, top wage.
And let's say you forgot to go to a meeting, you would be knocked back
 down to the starting wage.
And when you get to like 18 dollars an hour, you suddenly look different.
You were told that
you were unattractive, over weight suddenly,
cut down on shifts, or written off the
 schedule all together.
So basically everyone
 operated up under this fear.
It's this unspoken thing of what we're trying to get rid of you before you reach top wage.
So it saves them money.
- [Voiceover] I
had never had a job that didn't allow
 you to call in sick.
But here if you
couldn't fine someone to replace your
shift, you had to work or risk loosing your job.
So we came to work sick, coughing and sneezing, in that tiny little
 incubator of a room.
You'd think finding
one women out of 70 to take your shift would be a
 snap, but there was a catch.
Your replacement had
to have skin and hair as light as yours or lighter.
Her breasts had to be as big as yours or bigger.
We were all classified by race, hair color, and breast size.
- At a certain point
 at the lusty lady,
I started wearing a blonde wig.
Which they barely were
 gonna allow me to do
'cause they had me so pegged as oh dark, dark
 exotic, dark exotic.
Dark and exotic which meant they'd give me very few shifts.
[seductive music]
- I look absurd in
 this blonde wig.
It doesn't really
 look right on me.
It's just the symbol.
And then that's when I started getting shifts.
Getting enough shifts.
Making enough money
 in the sex industry.
- [Voiceover] The club
would only schedule one dancer of color per shift.
Thus they had fewer
 available shifts.
And in the higher
paid, one on one fantasy talk booth,
called Private Pleasures, management wouldn't schedule
 black dancers at all.
- At first I felt it was me.
And I started to
look at the schedule and I noticed that
 it was not just me.
I noticed that the other three black girls were never in booth.
- Manager back then said, um, black dancers were not as marketable
 as white dancers.
Therefore it would not
be, it would not be profitable to
 schedule them here.
- Well at the Lusty Lady,
we do have an interest in expanding the customers idea of what is sexually attractive.
If you looked at the sales
and rental charts of videos, you would see that
probably all of the top 10, are busty blonde women.
Well, there actually
are women of color, there are brunettes
 and red heads,
Asian women, and other
 ethnic women in the world.
And um, some people actually
 find them attractive.
And too expand their
audience, we, we schedule based on a diversity principle.
Where we try to
have women of color represented as much as possible throughout the day and
 throughout the week.
- It doesn't matter
if a specific race is more or less marketable
than another race because, you know, it's illegal.
You can't classify workers
 on the bases of race.
- The theater has
a no camera policy and that's to protect the
 privacy of the dancers.
It's one of the issues that probably bother support staff the most.
Because it's a security issue and we care about the
 people we work with.
And we know that they don't like being photographed
 against their will.
- [Voiceover] Three
of the 13 windows facing the stage
 had one way glass.
So the customers could see
 us but we couldn't see them.
Frequently, customers would
 secretly videotape us.
We heard rumors
about images of us showing up on the internet
 and in porno tapes.
We complained to management,
 but they did nothing.
- We were not being
 paid to be filmed.
We were just being
paid to dance there and you don't know where these
 images are going to turn up.
You're just being
 taken advantage of on
 a number of levels.
It had to do with our safety.
It had to do with ethics.
It had to do with
 our legal rights.
This had a lot of people upset.
But Star is just somebody
whose a real hot head. and she was on stage dancing
 in front of a one way.
- There had been a newer dancer, like dancing for him
 for quite a while.
And she thought he had like a funny toy or
 watch or something.
And she push...
She's all, "Star, Star oh
 come on you have to see this,
I've been dancing for him for
 like 45 minutes or something.
He's got some sort of weird toy.
It keeps blinking on and off.
- I was working with, another
 support staff member, Elise.
We got a camera call.
Opened the door, saw that the
 customer had a video camera.
Um, we asked him to
step out of the booth and he passed off the
camera to his friends and they made a
 b-line for the door.
One of them turned around
to throw a punch at me and I ducked.
And Elise took the
 blow in the face.
- Manager was downstairs the whole time.
And I went down there
 and was really mad.
And they were just like
"Star, if you can't live with
 it, you shouldn't work here."
I went crazy.
I basically had a big fit.
And I was just like "No,
 that's not the way it works.
"I'm working here and
 I can't live with it."
- And then it was almost like a snowball.
More and more people
 feeling that way.
- Everyone was just as amazed, like individually amazed, like
 "Oh you're as angry as I am?"
- [Voiceover] Enough was enough, we decided to unionize.
Here amid the neon lights,
the fake hair, the high heels was the good fight I had dreamed of fighting.
[shouting chant]
- [Voiceover] The service
employees union, S C I U, local 790, agreed
 to represent us.
[shouting chant]
- [Voiceover] The
 owners were shocked.
To buy us off, they
removed the one way windows and started scheduling
black dancers in the Private Pleasures both.
We knew we were on to something.
- Well in a move sure
to send shock waves through the industry,
nude dancers, at San Francisco's Lusty Lady
 Club have voted to unionize.
- [Voiceover] Media attention helped keep the
 heat on management.
But I worried that my mother
would recognize my voice and find out that
 I was stripping.
I was used to seeing my mother on television.
My mother is Doctor
 Joyce Wallace.
- We need safe houses
 for ex-prostitutes.
They get beat up.
They get killed.
There's nobody who
 cares for them.
There's nobody who loves them.
There's nobody who wants them.
- [Voiceover] This
 woman wants them.
She is Doctor Joyce Wallace.
In her private practice, she's an internist.
But she spent the last decade here in New York.
Trying to study and
help the thousands of prostitutes who live here.
She's developed programs that use mobile units.
Vans that cruise the city streets looking for prostitutes in need of help.
- There's a lady over there.
See her.
- And I see down here there's
 a whole box of condoms.
So they'll come to the window and you'll just give these out.
- Yes.
- It says "Kiss of mint."
- That's the oral sex.
- I see.
- [Voiceover] I
thought we had won when we voted in the union, but the real battle is at the bargaining table.
We had to negotiate
 for a contract.
Management hired
 Littler Mendelssohn.
A renowned anti-union law firm.
- [digital voice] Littler
Mendelssohn is representation of employers includes
advising employers on lawfully maintaining a union-free workplace.
- [Voiceover] We
represented ourselves at the bargaining table.
After all, our union didn't
 have a peep show specialist.
I volunteered to be on
the bargaining committee, along with Jane, Tara,
Decadence, Naomi, Velvet, and two members of the support
 staff, Elise and Scott.
Often others among
the 85 of us workers participated as well.
We didn't have a
lawyer, but our union provided us with a
 negotiator, Stephanie Batey.
Who had experience fighting
 anti-union lawyers.
- Public pressure and other
internal pressure on them to get a contract.
This isn't about anything else, but forcing them to
negotiate with you, to get a collective bargaining
 agreement that protects you.
- [Voiceover] Stephanie told us that owners don't want a contract at all.
And they don't
agree to a contract in 70 percent of first
 time negotiations.
But we were optimistic.
We wanted sick pay
 and health insurance.
We wanted to stop management from firing us
 without just cause.
We wanted an end to
scheduling practices based on race and breast size.
Stephanie emphasized that we needed a union security clause, otherwise management
 could bust the union.
We proposed agency shop.
Under an agency shop
contract, all workers pay union dues and
 receive union protection.
Under an open shop contract,
management has more power, because workers don't have to
 join the union or pay dues.
We found it sobering that
the only other strip club to unionize before us,
 had accepted an open shop.
The owners hired workers who wouldn't join and they swiftly
 lost their union.
I walked into negotiations
 expecting to negotiate.
But for the first two
months we just kept sending proposals
 back and forth.
So at the place I'm working now, we're fighting to unionize
and we voted to unionize and we're negotiating
 with the lawyers.
And the lawyers say things like,
"Well we want to put the
 word fun in the preamble.
"Your job will be described
 as a temporary, part time,
"fun, employment."
And I'm thinking, do they do
 that to the steel workers?
- Alan's exact words were we're not expected to work hard.
He said this is a part
time temporary job where you don't have
 to work very hard.
- I guess I just asked
him if he was trying to piss us off by saying that.
I mean, like, why would
you say something like that to somebody who's,
who's spending up to 12 hours a day
 at a bargaining table.
Ya know, at a job that
they didn't care about or they thought they were
 doing it just for fun.
It's insulting.
- [Voiceover] It is.
- Just making money off my ass.
- So this guy, I'm
in the little booth, and he says to me,
 "So what's your job?"
I said, "I'm a stripper."
He said, "No.
"What do you do for money?"
I said, "Oh, well, I'm a corporate union busting lawyer.
"I just do this for fun."
[laughter]
- We printed up flyers
 every day after bargaining.
Um, we kept the
rest of the workers really informed about
what was going on at the bargaining table.
And the lawyer took an issue with the language we used to communicate
 amongst ourselves.
- Specifically the word pussy they didn't want us to
 ever put in writing.
We've asked 'em to
defend why he thought that the company had the right to put those kind of
 limits on our free speech.
And he said, "Well I don't
 let my kids talk that way.
[laughs] "Why should I let you?"
- He talked about
 how offended he was.
"I don't even wanna
say that word pussy" and pussy, pussy, pussy he kept saying it over and over again.
- He was the one who accused us of sexually harassing
ourselves, [laughs] by using the word
 pussy. [laughs]
- It's funny you
can show your pussy, but you can't say
 the word pussy.
- [Voiceover] What are
 you thinking about?
- My knee is killing me.
- [Voiceover] Well what do you think about when you're on stage?
- Mmm, most anything.
Um, what I'm going
to do that evening, other appointments I
have, my body a lot, and a lot of the time I look at the other girls.
- The customers come in and they don't shut their door.
So all their friends can
 watch you on the same quarter.
And so all the hall is
 getting a free show.
So often, especially on rowdy weekend nights we are finding ourselves to close the door.
Please close the door,
 close the door now.
Some guy came into the live show and did not close his door.
A dancer told him to close his
 door and he didn't like this.
So he went into the
Private Pleasures booth down the hall and
pulled out a gun and pointed it at the
 dancer in that booth.
- What happens during
violent events, is that we usually call the
cops, they arrive, either A, just in time to not get the violent perpetrators or B, several hours later.
At which point,
 the point is moot.
- We were all very
concerned, we thought, ya know, let's put in
 bullet proof glass.
And management's
 response was to blame us.
You know, if our tone of
voice had been different, then we wouldn't have
 guns pulled on us.
- Here's the directive straight from management's mouth.
"And remember that
 yelling at a customer
"is not nearly as effective as
"coyly coaxing them
 into good behavior."
Being direct with them, they don't like that.
They want coy coaxing.
The problem with coyly
coaxing is is that it just, they think, the customers
 think you're playing.
And they think it's a game
 and they don't listen to you.
You need to like get into
 your real world voice.
There's usually two
 voices we use at work.
They're like two to three
octaves above your real voice that you use with the customers.
It's about the same kind of
 voice you use with a toddler.
And um, then there's
the real world voice when you're getting serious
 like "Close the door."
They want us to go [sweetly]
 "Can you close the door?"
- [Voiceover] A lot
of Lusty Lady dancers worked at more than one club.
From the world famous Mitchell
brothers, O'Farrell Theater to the notorious, low
 brow Market Street cinema.
I wondered why dancers
at other clubs in town weren't unionizing too.
My friends told me that dancers were organizing.
But that in the last 10 years, working conditions
 had only gotten worse.
- I worked in the
lap dancing clubs because I made a lot
 more money there.
I made in one
night what I'd make in one or two
 weeks at the Lusty.
But you know, we made more money because it was a lot
 more intense work.
- When I first started working out, I thought, oh, okay I'm gonna
 get paid to dance.
And when I walked in I saw lap
 dancing for the first time.
And I was like,
 what are they doing?
Are they having sex in here?
I mean these women are like
 gyrating on the customers.
I was just totally
 overwhelmed by it.
- Now the stage
show, which use to be the central thing of a
strip tease, right now it's just the part of your job you have to do so you can lap dance and make your real money.
- When I started stripping,
which is seven years ago, we did stage shows.
I did very flamboyant ones.
I appreciated the teasing aspect of the stripping industry.
There weren't girls up
in the dressing room talking about "Oh yeah I'm
 getting this customer off."
That was not your goal.
- I noticed over time that what we had to do to make
 our money changed.
- [Voiceover] At
clubs across the city, dancers were getting paid less
 and less to do more and more.
- The conditions got paid
when the Mitchell brothers took the glass out
 of a peep show room.
At the Century,
where I was working, they took the windows
 out of there too.
They started to build
rooms in the back where we could go
 alone with customers.
- Someone was working at Deja Vu and the manager told
 her, "Well it's okay
"if the customers
 touch your tits."
And she said, "Well, I
 thought that was illegal."
And he said, "No, it's okay."
- Suddenly they wanted to charge us a stage fee of five dollars and then within a few months it was ten.
- In recent years,
club owners nationwide have started imposing stage fees which is essentially charging
 the dancers to come to work.
Five or seven years ago it
 was like five, 10, 15 dollars.
20 dollars.
Now it's upwards at
 150 at some places.
- You're relying on your tips.
You're turning in a
 percent to management.
If you don't meet your quota, you're fired or
 you're suspended.
- I mean it, I saw, this
 is why I left New Century.
Because dancers would cry
 or they would get fired.
They didn't make the quota
 they would be thinking,
"Oh my god, ya know, I
 can't afford to lose my job.
"How am I going to feed my kid?"
But yet, so they'd bring in their own money.
It really, like,
I felt the stress, because you have a
 four hour shift there.
- [Voiceover] You have
to pay 250 dollars in a four hour shift?
- In a four hour shift.
Yes.
And of that you get
 to keep 90 something.
- There are women who they have one understanding
 of what the job is.
And now once they're
working in the club, finding that their, all
this pressure and coercion to do, um, pressuring them
 into doing illegal things.
To make enough money
 to pay the quota.
- On several occasions there
was one manager in particular, that would ask me to go out
with the owner's friends when they came to town.
So, Ya know, definitely trying to pimp me out.
It was just this
continual behavior that you would
definitely question if you were working at Macy's.
Finally I was just
 like that's enough.
- [Voiceover] At the Lusty
 Lady, we are employees.
Most strip clubs illegally
classify their workers as independent contractors
to avoid paying wages, unemployment, and payroll taxes.
Also, independent
 contractors can't unionize.
In the early 1990's before we
 even thought of unionizing,
San Francisco strippers formed
the Exotic Dancers Alliance and started organizing
 for basic workers rights.
- [Voiceover] Hi, dancer's
 meeting, please take one.
Thanks.
We from the Market Streets,
 I use to work here.
- I'm just telling ya don't pass this stuff out to the girls.
We're good here.
We're not hiding nothing.
- [Voiceover] Then why
 you have to chase us away.
- Because you're loitering
in front of my building, ya know, it doesn't look good for business.
- This is our business, it don't look good.
- We're trying to run
 a clean business here.
Don't need her shit and I
 don't need your shit either.
How about we shove
 it up your ass.
- [Voiceover] Dancers
at clubs across town began to sue for recognition
of their employee status, for restoration of wages, and
 to stop sexual harassment.
- And that process
 was very interesting.
In that we were told by the
head of the labor commission that if he were dealing with agricultural or um, factory workers, garment factory workers, then he would be
more inclined to use the resources that he had.
But he did not choose to
waste the tax payers resources on this, quote on quote, class of workers.
- [Voiceover] We want
 prostitutes off our streets.
We want prostitutes
 off our streets.
- [Voiceover] I knew that
 all sex workers are scorned.
Even my mother was subject
to protests and hate mail just for trying to help street prostitutes.
Once she came home to a bomb threat on her door.
Because of my mothers work,
I had known since
I was a teenager about the struggle for
 prostitutes rights.
By activist such
 as Margo St. James.
And Carol Lee, aka,
 Scarlet Harlot.
They paved the way by arguing
 that sex work isn't shameful.
Now they were supporting our organizing efforts.
I was thrilled to meet
 and work with them.
They said our union was a win
 for sex workers everywhere.
- [Voiceover] You
 never call me back.
It's your mother.
I would like to know
 what's happening with you.
I do care, okay?
And I really want
to talk to you, because I don't
know what's going on and uh, that
 everything's alright.
Okay, it's been a long time
 and I haven't heard from you.
Bye.
- [Voiceover] Hi mama.
Oh, I'm fine.
Um, no, nothing's going on.
I'm writing.
Okay.
Negotiations were crawling.
Management was still pushing to have the job formally declared "fun."
We decided to do an
 action, a work slow down.
We decided to have
 a no pink day.
A day when we danced
 with our legs closed.
Management responded by making
 an example of one dancer.
They fired Summer for
 participating in the action.
We went to them and asked
 for Summer's job back.
And when they wouldn't
give back her job, we hit the streets in a picket.
- This is our reality, honey.
We trying to make
 a living, honey.
Don't, don't try
 and keep us down.
Don't try and keep us down.
[women chant]
- [Voiceover] No contract.
- [Voiceover] No pussy.
- [Voiceover] No contract.
- [Voiceover] No pussy.
- No contract.
- [Voiceover] No pussy.
- No contract.
- No pussy.
- [Voiceover] No contract.
- [Voiceover] No pussy.
- [Voiceover] Excuse me,
 would you like a flyer sir?
- [Voiceover] [chant] We want
 Summer, not misuse of power.
We want summer, not
 misuse of power.
- They have wives,
 they don't honk.
They by themselves, they honk.
- I wish the male
could do it, but ya know, personally I don't
 think I have the body for it.
I'm sure their
supporting themselves, their family, their kids,
their significant other, however you wanna go, supporting themselves through school.
I have no problem with it
myself, but then I'm a man, and this is a women's' issue.
- Are you gonna call the number and tell the Lusty you support our union and..
- Sure, what would
 you like me to say?
- I'd like you to say that
 you go to the Lusty Lady.
But that, that you won't go there until they rehire Summer.
The women they fired
for union activity, who is right here with her son.
- Hey what's up tiger?
- [Voiceover] While we were
picketing outside the theater, some of the dancers
on stage were trying to encourage the
 customers to leave.
- [Voiceover] Well because I
didn't want my bosses to know that I was doing this, but I also wanted the customers to know what had happened.
I wrote "Please don't spend
money here, unfair labor" on my hands and showed them
 when I was doing my show.
So that the customers would go.
- [Voiceover] And how did the customers react?
- [Voiceover] They
nodded their heads, waiting for their
money to spend out what was already
 in and went home.
- The last customer just
 left and the theater's empty.
So maybe, uh, Summer's
job will be restored, by this evening.
- I need a shop story.
- [Voiceover] Why?
- Because they're closing
 the show until Tuesday.
- I mean, we closed
down their business and made them lose money,
 for like what, a few hours.
And they're now gonna close down their business for three days.
To say to you, "We're going
 to lose way more money,
"to keep control over you."
- They can just close
 it for no reason?
- [Voiceover] They kept the video booths open, but closed the live show.
It was a lock out.
They were trying to scare us.
- [Voiceover] Do you want to
 tell me why your going there?
Do you really want
 to break a union?
- [Voiceover] Two,
four, six, eight, don't go in to masturbate.
Two, four, six, eight,
 don't go in to masturbate.
Two, four, six, eight,
 don't go in to masturbate.
Two, four, six, eight,
 don't go in to masturbate.
Two, four, six, eight,
 don't go in to master bate.
- I just got off the phone
with the management here and after telling them my name and phone number they still refused to even tell me their name they claim that there's
 another side to the story.
That Summer was fired
 for reasons other
 than union activity.
But they wouldn't confirm that it was because
she missed shifts, it wasn't, they wouldn't confirm it was because of bad work.
All they wanted to say was that there's two sides
 to every story.
I advise them, as I'm sure their lawyers have advised them, there is severe civil penalties for lock outs and
 for union busting.
And I as a, um, very
dedicated and loyal customer um, and patron of the
Lusty Lady for years have become more enthusiastic
about my patronage since the establishment of this union.
And if management continues in this vein,
I'll never step
 foot in here again.
- He's going to get a great show if we are allowed
 to organize it.
- We'll, you know, we
will always be happy about our loyal customers,
 that's all I can say.
Thank you very much
 for being here.
- Well it's, it's
my pleasure ya know and just like any other workers here in America.
Workers in the sex industry
need to have the same rights and need to have the right
 to organize and unionize.
- [Voiceover] The president of the company is right here at the door.
She is the one we talked to in bargaining.
Tell her what you think.
- [Voiceover] You suck!
[loud shout] Rehire Summer.
Rehire Summer.
Rehire Summer.
Rehire Summer.
Rehire Summer.
Rehire Summer.
Rehire Summer.
- They're saying we did two illegal things.
And we're saying they did two illegal things.
They are saying we closed reps, for economic reasons were saying that's an illegal lock out.
They're saying, "We fired
 Summer for breaking a rule."
We're saying
- [Voiceover] No rules' broken.
- She didn't break a rule, and you made up the rule after you fired her.
- Okay, so who's going?
- [Voiceover] Decadence.
- Decadence.
Okay?
- [Voiceover] You sure
 you okay with that?
- [Decadence] Yeah, I
 feel okay with that.
I just want to,
um, like how do we the building goes up
 to, where are you?
- Okay.
You tell me it's your building.
I have no idea.
- [Voiceover] After hours
of brute-less arguing about who broke the law, management finally agreed to an off the
 record discussion.
- Woohoo!
- [Voiceover] What
 just happened?
- We got her job back.
- [Voiceover] You
 just got her job back?
[women cheering]
- [Voiceover] Oh
 thank you so much.
Oh thank you so much.
- [Voiceover] In the midst
 of bargaining, my mom calls.
Well, she said, "Julia, this
 is your mother calling."
Like I don't know her voice.
She said, "I'm coming
 to San Francisco
"I'm gonna stay with
 you for five days."
Five days.
And I looked around my house and
I thought oh my god,
everything in my house is like, stripper.
I clean out the house,
 it felt like Passover.
Ya know, you have to get rid of all the bread.
Ya know?
Got rid of all
 the stripper gear.
And then she's here and it's going pretty well, until we went outside.
It was the one time in my life
I ran into everyone from
 the peep show who I knew.
But wasn't really
 good friends with.
Because if you're really good friends with them, you know their real name.
Instead, we're running
into three girls and I'm just about to say it.
And I hear it in my
 head before I say it.
I'm like, "Mom,
 these are my friends
Cayenne, Coco,
Cinnamon, and Octopussy.
[laughter]
Thankfully there was like instant stripper, you know, ESP.
I'm like, "Hi, this is my mom.
"Mom..."
And they go, "Hi I'm Jane.
"And I'm Mary.
"I'm Peggy Sue."
My mom's like, "They're such lovely girls."
One day my mom walks in with Scarlet Harlot.
Saying, "Julia, I want
you to meet the famous prostitutes' rights
 activist, Scarlet Harlot."
Scarlet says, "You're
 Joyce's daughter?"
I say, "Yes, you know
me from a benefit where we both performed."
I look at her with big
 pleading eyes and whisper
"Scarlet, please
 don't tell my mother."
Scarlet says, "Your out to
 everyone except your mother?"
I wondered why I can
tell my mom I was gay, but not a stripper.
My mom and I were both
 fighting for sex workers.
I wanted her to see us as
 allies, as on the same side.
We were both feminists.
But feminists have disagreed about the sex
 industry for years.
Some people say the sex industry is oppressive to all women.
And some people say
that working in the sex industry can be empowering.
But after hours of dancing
and watching hundreds of men come and go, I just
 found it boring.
- I was active in
the women's movement, you know, in the 60's.
And one of the founders of
 Berkeley women's liberation.
And so the women
that I talk to now who are in the union movement
have lots of questions about all of you.
And what's fascinating to me, is these are women
in their late 40's who've been very
 politically active.
Like for 20, 30 years.
And they feel, you know, why
 would women do this work?
They can't relate to it.
And they're very
curious when I explain how I feel very privileged
that I'm getting to represent you
 in this bargaining.
And how much I fell
that I've grown and that you've taught me
And how much I admire
you for your courage because you really are
 pioneers in lots of ways.
And it saddens me
 'cause these are women
I've been close to
for years and years and sort of felt are my sisters.
And I can see on this issue, that we're on very
 different paths.
- It seems like a very
 simple issue to me.
This is my body and these
are my reproductive organs, and I'm gonna do with
 them as I please.
And it seems strange
to me that like another women would
 say, "Well yeah,
"actually ya know what
 somebody can tell me whether,
"what I can do with my
 body and what I can't do."
That, it just, it doesn't fit.
Because it's mine.
It's not yours.
- People assume, oh
well see you guys are being exploited, you deserve it almost like.
Don't you know exotic
dancers are exploited whether not you want
 to believe it or not.
And it's like, it's like yeah, but they're not
exploited just because they're exotic dancers.
It has to do with like
 the club's fucked up.
The management fucked up.
They're not getting their tips.
If all that was
 in place, then no
I don't think they
 would be exploited.
Just because their job is like, selling pussy.
- It was always my
understanding that feminist perspective was about enabling women to have a choice.
- [Voiceover] After we picketed, management suddenly started
 bargaining in earnest.
They offered a raise and excepted a grievance procedure.
We made some
 concessions as well.
- Wages, we are
 willing to go down.
We're gonna start
at 14 for dancers, eight for [indiscernible]
- [Voiceover] By month
five we'd given up on getting health
 insurance and holiday pay.
But we didn't want to
 give in on everything.
Well wait sonority and laid off.
- Union security is our number one priority.
We want agency shop.
- Agency shop is a big big issue.
I mean the lawyer says they
 don't want to do agency shop.
Period.
It's like, they want
to do a contract but they want open shop.
- It was like reverse
therapy or something, like [laughs] spending 12 hours in this horrible beige room.
And just getting hammered for
hours and hours and hours, that you're not
gonna get this thing that you thought was
 so important to you.
And that all these people are counting on you to get for them.
- [Voiceover]
 That's what we want.
- We said..
- Understand they can do that.
They can come in
 and say this is it.
We don't want to
talk about it anymore we moved to our
 last best and final.
- [Voiceover] Stephanie told us that we were
 running out of time.
As we headed for the
 final days of bargaining,
Decadence and I were invited to a conference to give a talk about
 unionizing exotic dancers.
And I was asked
to do some comedy, but when I got the program
I saw that my mother was also giving a
 talk at the same
International Conference on Prostitution.
I asked the others if
 they had told their moms.
- [Voiceover] What do
 they think you do now?
- Ha ha, cocktail waitress.
- The weekend that I was prepared to tell them they freaked out because
I got a piercing.
The thought I didn't raise
 you to mutilate yourself.
You know, and I'm like, whoa they can't handle a
 belly button ring.
They'll never handle me
 being a stripper, ya know.
- I plan on telling
my mom mainly because I think
 she's gonna find out.
And also i think it's a plot
 device for the documentary.
But...
[laughter]
- And you think is screwy huh?
- She's just this
incredible, incredible woman but throughout my youth, I mean, we just fought all the time.
And I'm much closer
with my mother now than I've ever been
 in my entire life.
And I really love her.
And I really care about her.
And she calls me when
 she's upset about things.
I'm worried about
that she's gonna take it as a slap in the face.
And I don't want
to have to give up the good relationship that
 I've developed with her.
But there's no way that everyone who's there is gonna keep it a secret for me.
Ya know, what
 would I have to do?
Distribute flyers?
Please don't tell my mama.
- [Voiceover] Decadence and I left negotiations for the conference.
We met my mother in Santa Monica.
She agreed to a
video taped interview about our relationship
 and her work.
But she kept putting
 the interview off.
Insisting that we
 go sight seeing.
- Oh look at the
 Hollywood sign, Julie.
- [Voiceover] I figured
 she knew something was up.
You'll comfort my mother after
I come out to her about being a sex worker.
- You're coming out to
 your mother finally.
The very famous Joyce
 Wallace, I love that.
I am waiting.
She, here's this woman,
she's like the most famous in the country for doing out
 reach to women on the streets.
Your her daughter,
she doesn't know, it's just so interesting.
- I know that your worried that
I'm gonna make a revelation
 to you that your gonna hate.
- Yeah.
- It's not that bad.
- You better make it now.
- Okay, I'm not only
making a documentary about the LL dancers,
 I'm one of them.
And all of my
 creative work that...
- And this is only strip tease?
- Yeah, it's no contact with customers.
- I'm not upset about
 this as a revelation.
Okay?
- Okay.
- I would be really upset with prostitution.
I really feel that's,
that for a woman to allow a man into her
body, who she has not chosen and she has not cared
 about is demeaning.
- Well
- And i know that's not a popular thing to say at a prostitution conference.
And I have to
qualify it by saying that's the way I feel for myself. and that's certainly the way
 I would feel for my daughter.
- I think your work is wonderful and I'm so proud of you and I love you so much.
And I didn't want to have any lies with you.
But I was quite willing to keep this a lie,
I didn't really need
 to tell you this.
But we're both at the conference and I'm presenting
and I'm doing comedy about other work that I
 use to do in the industry.
Which is, I was a professional
 dominatrix for a while.
- Oh god.
Well I'm not kind, you know,
 real feeling good about this.
I came to this conference as
somebody who is gonna present and I don't want
to have attention for anything else
 other than my work.
- Well I don't present, I don't do comedy under your name.
I do comedy [indiscernible]
- So let's keep it that way and um, maybe not.
Now as you see, you put
me in an awkward position because I don't
want to tell people that your not my daughter.
You are my daughter.
And I don't want it
known that Doctor Wallace from New York, who is an expert has a, uh um, a daughter
 who's in the smut business.
- But I'm, what you
 did is help women
- No I think it takes away
from my professional message and my professional is
- Your professional message
is that women on the streets didn't have to be...
- I think you should not
 have come to this meeting.
- No.
- I think you should not present at this meeting.
- Mama, I present about being a union worker, you're proud of that.
- No I'm not proud of you being at this meeting presenting.
- You're proud of Christina
holding the camera, who should be closer by the way.
- It's good your telling me now.
- I needed to tell you before
 the conference happened.
- It would've been nice to
 tell me a long time before.
- But you didn't want to know.
You came and visited me.
You saw all my shoes.
Why didn't you notice?
- Just a lot of boots.
- And we have to swallow pride
 in almost every kind of work.
But it is much better
to work with your mind than with your body.
- I agree.
- So why aren't you doing that?
You have a first class mind.
And it bothers me
that you have never put yourself into a position
where you could earn a living except now by taking off
 your clothes for odd men.
- Well that's not true.
I went to graduate school and was a very good
graduate student and could've been
 decent at that.
- You left it.
- I left it because it was
 not what I wanted to do.
We weren't talking just about sex work anymore.
- You don't rewrite history.
- It was the fight.
The same old fight.
The same old dance.
Don't tell me that I
never ever put myself in a position of being
 someone you could be proud of.
- It's not...
- [Voiceover] Each
of us wondering, am I a good mother?
Am I a good daughter?
[violin music]
My mom said that I
shouldn't tell people that I was her daughter.
She started wearing dark glasses to cover her swollen eyes.
Despite feeling shell shocked, we still had our work to do.
- I'm telling ya, that I'm
talking about a population that is very different
from almost everything you have seen at this meeting.
I do not work with
beautiful glamorous women who wear push up bras.
- I had to come out
to my mother today about being in the industry.
And I just told her I do work for social justice.
I'm a professional dominatrix.
- I work with women
who are wearing everything they
 own on their back.
Who have not eaten
 in a long time.
- Maybe you've seen my ads?
I'm Mistress Yente.
There's an ad.
I'm in full, you know,
 thigh high leather boots.
And I'm holding a
 crop and it says
"Call me, or I'll just
 sit here in the dark."
- And when we examined the data, we were shocked to
find that those women who perform more
fallacio than vaginal sex were more likely to be infected.
- After getting paid to give golden showers, now, every time I
 pee, I feel jipped.
- We gave out half a
 million condoms last year.
So I like to think
that we're responsible for one half a million safe
 sex acts in New York City.
- Strippers are a really
 interesting group to organize.
They're very kind of classy, they really got a, a
 real cowboy mentality.
- [Voiceover] On the last
 day of the conference,
Decadence and I gave our talk.
I was happy that my mother, still in her dark
 glasses, attended.
- [Voiceover] So where we are now in the negotiating process, we've been in bargaining for five months.
We have won many things
 that we didn't have before.
And we also have a
written guarantee that the one way windows will
 remain out of the theater.
- [Voiceover] At the
end of the conference, my mother stood in the
 parking lot with me.
I wanted her to be proud of my union work.
She started to cry.
She said she wasn't proud of me.
She drove away and didn't return my calls for three months.
- We've come to a
point at the table at which we are at in pass.
They're not gonna move anymore.
- [Voiceover] We met with
the rank and file to find out what they would be willing to strike over.
- We need to be able to say without bluffing
"If we don't get
 this, we'll walk."
- I wouldn't want to strike over a sick day.
That's the only thing
that, if we were to strike, is that agency shop.
- I personally,
 there's points like
I would give in on
 the paid holiday.
But if it were to
come down to striking on any of the points that
 anybody felt strongly about
I'd be behind them and
 I'd be striking it.
- [Voiceover] All of us
agreed that we had to have agency shop and a sick day.
But when we returned
to negotiations management presented us with
a last best and final offer, that included a sick day but not agency shop.
- Yeah, they've got to accept our agency shop.
- If we don't get agency shop,
 I think we should strike.
- [Voiceover] Normally a
last best and final offer is non-negotiable.
You accept it or strike.
But we didn't give up.
We made a counter offer.
- I just wanted to like shake them, you know.
Do you want a strike?
We don't want to strike.
You don't have to
 let this happen.
- [Voiceover] All day long and into the night offers and counter offers
 went back and forth.
- [Voiceover] So it's,
 um, 20 to midnight.
- It's never gonna end.
- [Voiceover] And we
 thought we had a deal.
- [Voiceover] Oh yeah.
- And now they're
 changing the deal.
So who knows what's
 gonna happen.
- [Voiceover] Okay, here
I am in the room again.
- [Voiceover] Finally,
management brought us their final last and
 best and final offer.
- All I wanna go away from
 here is with a contract.
And I'm not happy
 with it either.
But it's gonna give us more
 to work with in the future.
- [Voiceover] I agree.
- I think we've fought too long to risk losing everything.
- We're all kind of
coming to a consensus but really not feeling good
 about you not being here.
- [Voiceover] Someone
 else explain it.
- Here.
- It's called Maintenance
 of Membership.
- [Voiceover] There final
offer was a compromise, between agency
shop and open shop, called Maintenance
 of Membership.
New employees wouldn't
have to join the union but we would meet
with each new worker to explain why he or she should.
And once the did
they were protected from management bullying or bribing them into quitting the union.
- We do know if we agree
 to this we get a contract.
If we strike, we may get something much better or we may get something worse.
Okay?
Alright, bye.
Okay?
Consensus?
- It's gonna make
us work and that and I think that, maybe in the back of my mind
I wanted to believe that when this was all over
I could rest.
[laughing]
I know it's a ridiculous thing.
But in a sense this
keeps us honest because we do have to
keep doing the work to create a better
work environment for people in the sex industry.
- [Voiceover] All
that remained was for the workers to
 vote on the contract.
- We ready?
- [Voiceover] Yup.
- Okay.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
 yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- No.
- [Voiceover] Oh.
- Wow.
- And a yes.
- 71 yeses and one no.
[cheering]
- [Voiceover] We became
the only union strip club in the United States.
[upbeat music]
As word of our success spread,
we got calls from dancers in almost every
 state in the union.
Dancers who wanted to
 organize their clubs too.
I flew to Philadelphia
to meet the dancers who were organizing there.
- We heard like, drips and drables of you know, there was a union
for exotic dancers and isn't that funny.
Well you know what?
No, it's not funny.
- What they did
was decided, okay we're gonna give the
girls a weeks notice or a week and a half
notice and that's it, and they no longer get a salary.
Well that's what got us going.
- So we called the labor department, fair wage and hour, the department of
 justice, and the IRS.
And we got all these
forms and information and then we got the thing going.
You know, we have
all the other girls signing a petitions right now.
- We already have
the customers who say they won't cross
 that they'll walk.
- [Voiceover] Yeah, 90 percent
 of our costumers are union.
- [Voiceover] Really?
- Yeah, they're
 all union people.
They will not cross
 a picket line.
- I wanna go to work
with a teamsters bumper sticker on my uh
- [Voiceover] Cooch.
- Yeah, wear it across my chest.
That's my new work uniform.
- Yeah slap that
 right across here.
How you like these?
- [Voiceover] Jane
and I flew to Alaska to work on a campaign
 in Anchorage.
What the did was fire the
first five main activist then blocked everyone
 else out the next day.
They fired the people before
they talked to their lawyer and really fucked up.
Pretty much said it was
 because of union activity.
Said something like.
- [Voiceover] I'm gonna shut this place down before I let a union
 control my money.
- We've been financing
these two men's' extremely posh room
 with food too long.
I can't pay for my
son's hospital bills when he broke his arm.
But the owner can have a
20,000 dollar birthday party for his six year old.
And I've never seen
him do a table dance or deal with the
 smelly old drunk.
- Did it heal?
- [Voiceover] Say
 thank you boys.
- [Voiceover] Thank you.
- [Voiceover] Thank you.
- [Voiceover] Bye Jonathon.
- See you next time when
I break my other arm.
- [Voiceover] Okay [laughs].
- [Voiceover] The National
Labor Relations Board is investigating our charges of unfair labor practices
 against the Showboat.
- Do you have an intent to organize letter in our case file?
Okay so that, so
- [Voiceover] The Lusty Lady
inspired the Showboat girls to unionize, hopefully the
 Showboat girls will inspire.
The New York girls to unionize, the New York girls will inspire.
Indiana girls to
 unionize and so forth.
And hopefully it'll
 be a nationwide thing.
- When they were trying to fight unemployment
- What did unemployment say?
- Some kind of legal shit.
- I didn't even try.
I figured that
- [Voiceover] Excuse me Mom.
- [Voiceover] What?
- Um, why every day
 do you get fired?
- 'Cause mom's a super hero.
And I'm fighting the bad guys.
- So I sit on the corner here handing out flyers for the EDA benefit.
And the guys in
big suits came out and informed us that we
 weren't allowed to be here.
And they were all
 like glaring at us.
And it was very clear
that I will never get a job on Broadway,
 but that's okay.
'Cause now my mama
knows what I do and I'm not allowed
 to do it anymore.
She told me that.
She called me up the
 other day, she said,
"You're not allowed
 to do that anymore."
So thank you mama.
- Well I don't know
 that I'm proud of.
I mean, I'm proud of her because she's smart, and witty, and with it,
 and uh, very independent.
And she looks good and you never know what to expect next.
Um, I'm not proud of her
 because she's a stripper.
She was always independent,
 strong, stubborn, difficult.
You know, so I'm glad
that she empowered or helped to empower these women to make their working
 conditions better.
I like to see it as a
 civil liberties issue.
- You know I've always
been strong and feisty and uh, aggressive.
If I hadn't been part
 of a union effort
I wouldn't have as much control over my working conditions.
And it didn't matter how aggressive, or Jewish, or smart, or witty, or,
 or, you know, strong I was.
Personality didn't provide me
 with good working conditions.
Being part of a group, organizing successful
 union effort did.
- Now I think you should go out and unionize other industries.
[laughs]
Do you remember the
time with Grandma when you were five years old?
No.
Well you were running around the house naked.
And uh, my mother said to you,
"You have to put something on.
"You should be ashamed."
And I really, I just
took her by the shoulders and I said, "Never,
ever tell my child she should have shame."
I was so upset with that.
And um, I think ya over did it.
[laughing]
It's okay.
Hi. It's me.
Oh, we're not ready yet?
Hi.
It's me, Jesse.
Are we there?
Good. We're there.
Well, this afternoon, after a very lousy sketch about yo-yoing,
I figure we'll, for lack of anything better to do, we'll take it towards a more serious side right about now.
And we're going to conduct an interview with
Arnold Friedman, my father.
I still feel like I knew my father very well.
I don't think that just because there were things in his life that were private and secret and shameful that that means that the father who I knew and the things I knew about him were in any way not real.
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I got to do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm a- gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can't never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you come to see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that's ever hit the big time
And all I got to do is act naturally
Arnold liked pictures.
I mean, that's, let's face it.
He liked pictures.
Well, we're here.
This is it, the whole family assembled.
Everybody in
Great Neck, New York.
We had three sons.
David, being the oldest had a lot of responsibility when he was young.
Seth was an outright rebel.
And somehow, Jesse was just like the the one that keeps trying to catch up and doesn't quite make it.
I have very good memories of the, of my, well,
I have very good memories of my childhood.
I had a great time growing up.
I had a great time because of my friends.
And my father was great.
I mean, he may not have been the best father, but he went to
Columbia University.
And then when he graduated, he went to the Catskills to play in his band.
The Jazzbo Mambo
With a boogie beat
Is the newest dance on 52nd Street
The band was called Arnito Rey and his Orchestra.
My father's name was Arnold Friedman.
This was in the late
40's and early '50s.
So he played Latin music.
It was very big at the time, and so he changed his name to Arnito Rey.
We'll do a Jazzbo Mambo
8 to the bar
I don't know.
My dad was a cool guy, you know?
He was a schoolteacher.
And I think that the other kids liked him, and he liked kids.
But he didn't like spending a lot of time with his wife, so he would teach high school during the day and then after school, he would come home and teach piano lessons and later computer lessons in the house.
And that was, of course, more time he didn't have to spend with his wife.
I'm not that anxious to talk about his father, because, you know, we were divorced, and
But his father, he would,
I don't really want to talk about it.
In case anybody didn't know,
I'm the father of this family.
I'm never in the movies.
Never see me in any of the pictures, but I really am the father.
And we're all gathered together while David is messing up the camera here.
Now he's taking a good movie and zooming in and out.
When you see me on this, you're gonna say
Okay, shut it.
He died of a surprise heart attack about 5 years ago.
And it was very, very sad.
He was, you know, selfless, altruistic.
But in the end, he wasn't together with your mom?
He wasn't together with my mother at the end.
And when did they make the decision not to be together?
Long before he died?
Couple years before his death.
There's a lot I, well, whatever.
There's some things I don't want to talk about.
Well, this is private, so if you don't, if you're not me, then you really shouldn't be watching this, because this is supposed to be a private situation between me and me.
This is between me now and me in the future.
So turn it off.
Don't watch this.
This is private.
If you're the fucking, oh, God, the cops.
And if you're the fucking cops, go fuck yourselves, because you're full of shit.
Back in 1984, US Customs had seized some child pornography, addressed from the Netherlands, in the mail to Arnold Friedman.
Now, he never got that piece of mail, but his name was forwarded on to us.
So what we would do then would be to initiate a correspondence with
Arnold in the hopes that we can determine if he is in fact willing to violate the statute again about mailing or receiving child pornography.
"Dear Stan, the book is
Joe, 14, and his uncle.
I think I'd like you to send me something, sort of good faith, and I will forward this rather precious book to you.
Thanks, Arnie. "
See, it's very hard to believe that this so-called "good marriage" was so disturbed.
He sent him these pictures, and he sent him a note that I remember, because the lawyer got the note.
And then he wrote, "Enjoy. "
Since he had sent the magazine, he was always asking for it back.
So I asked the prosecutors,
"Let's grant him his wish.
He wants his magazine back. "
I dressed up as a mail carrier, knocked on his door, asked him if he was
Arnold Friedman.
He replied he was.
And I said, "I have a package for you.
Sign right here. "
He did.
About an hour later, we went back.
We would give him some time with the magazine.
I'm dressed now.
I just put a blue suit jacket over the carrier's uniform.
And I told him, "I have a search warrant for child pornography. "
He says, "There's nothin' like that here. "
And I said,
"You don't recognize me?"
I'd just been at his door an hour ago.
He goes, "No. "
And I took off my jacket, and I said, "Now do you recognize me?"
"Oh, yeah. Oh, okay.
The magazine is upstairs. "
So we went up to his bedroom.
In the top dresser door was the open magazine.
Well, he thought we would take the magazine and leave, and I said, "No, we have a search warrant.
We're gonna search the whole house for child pornography. "
And around that time his wife showed up.
I thought they were searching, like, for marijuana or something.
I didn't know what they were searching for, to tell you the truth.
And I thought it was a big mistake.
One of the first things we went to was his office.
And I remember just as I was about to pull out a drawer,
Mr. Friedman came rushing in and said,
"Wait. I'll get that for you. "
And said, "Here.
This is all that's there. "
And it was one piece of mail from the Netherlands, but it was child pornography.
And he said, "That's it.
That's all there is. "
And I said, "Well, that's great, Mr. Friedman, but we're still gonna search. "
And he goes, "I don't understand why you don't go when I tell you that's all there is?"
And I said, "Well, we don't believe you. "
Well, it's not something he sort of left lying around on the kitchen table.
He wasn't proud of it, and he kept it hidden.
He had his office downstairs.
It wasn't, like, right there.
You had to go downstairs and around the corner to get to his office.
We used to have someone that cleaned.
He says, "Don't let her clean in here.
It's okay. I don't want my things disturbed. "
So all right.
I never went in there.
Then one of our inspectors moved the piano that was in that office.
And that's where his stash of magazines were held, behind the piano.
And this was Arnold's secret.
He liked to look at pictures of boys.
And it's not that he acted on these things.
He just wanted to look at these pictures and meditate or
And these are listings of the magazines that were found behind the piano.
"Young Boys & Sodomy. "
"Incest Case Histories. "
Something called
"Chicken Pickin's Magazine. "
And in addition to that, we found evidence of a computer class being taught there by Mr. Friedman.
And we did seize some list of names that we thought could be students.
I remember walking in there saying,
"Goddamn. We could have a problem here. "
Just when you think everything is going to be dull, something gets dropped on your lap, you know, and it turns out to be something bigger than you ever thought.
What happened was one of the detectives from the vice squad came in to see me.
And he had a list.
And it was at that point that we were able to learn that these were computer classes that went on literally every day of the week and Saturday.
And we drew a big map of the whole village of Great Neck sectioned it off, and started sending detectives out to do interviews.
She set us up in teams, male/female teams.
And we got a list of alleged victims.
Soon as we went into the house, we were usually approached by the mothers.
And we explained why we're there, what we're doing there, and we'd really like to talk to their children, preferably alone.
The parents were becoming impatient.
They wanted something done immediately.
But you always want to be very careful about how you proceed, because the one thing that you worry about
I know I worried about it all the time, is just charging somebody with this kind of a crime is enough to ruin their lives.
So you want to make sure that you have enough evidence and that you're convinced that you're making a good charge.
And how much time was there between the time the postal inspector searched the house and the time that you went in for the second search?
Well, it would have been less than a month, because we did that the day before Thanksgiving.
A prominent middle-aged teacher in a prosperous
Long Island town is charged with sodomizing young boys who were his students.
Police are charging that sexual abuse went on behind the doors of
17 Picadilly Road in Great Neck.
We rang the doorbell.
As soon as he realized who it was, he wasn't gonna let us in.
So one of the detectives broke the door down.
And we went into the premises at that point.
Arnold was by himself.
His wife was out shopping.
I was out to the store to buy a Thanksgiving turkey.
And I go up the front walk to the house, and there're people all over the house.
And my husband is sitting, looking very sheepishly in the dining room, handcuffed.
By this time, just about every news organization you could name had arrived on the scene.
I went home for Thanksgiving.
Got to the house, and there's cops and news trucks all over the place.
And
I got worried, of course.
When David came to the house, we were able to ascertain eventually the type of business he was in.
And we heard that he was involved in children's entertainment in the form of some sort of clown activities.
I was there when the clown came in.
He was ranting and raving.
We had words.
And I was going through the folders.
We told him to take a hike.
And he kept trying to come into the house, and I kept telling him that he couldn't, that he had to leave.
He wasn't allowed while we were searching.
And finally, he came in for the last time.
He bent down.
I really thought he had a weapon in that duffle bag.
Everybody kind of, you know, reached for a gun at one point.
What he came out with was a pair of Fruit of the Loom underwear.
And he started prancing around, flailing his arms in the air, saying, "Look at me.
I'm an asshole. "
They're harassing my father for no reason at all.
If I had had some kind of
Arabian sand scarf
I would have wrapped that around my face and been Lawrence of Arabia.
Maybe that would have been better.
But I took out underwear, and I put it on my head because I didn't want to be on camera.
The first arrested was Arnold Friedman, a retired schoolteacher who was charged with sodomizing boys aged 8 to 11.
The charges are that, while running a computer school,
Arnold Friedman and his son engaged in various forms of sexual abuse against minor children.
Jesse pulls up coming home from school.
His friends dump him out of the car.
David sort of grabbed me, and we were sitting a couple of houses down, sort of on the sidewalk.
And he was saying something to me.
And then one of the TV cameras came over, so we kind of ran to the backyard.
And we went behind the house.
And we were in the backyard of our house.
And the cops came back, and they said, "What's going on here?"
And I said, "Don't worry about it. It's just me and Jesse. "
And they said,
"Well, we want Jesse.
We need Jesse in the house now. "
Of course, we thought, you know, we didn't know why that was.
As we conducted more interviews of the children,
Jesse's name started to pop up.
And Jesse was there.
What did Jesse do?
And then eventually we were able to ascertain that Jesse's role was not one of, you know, helping his dad conduct the computer class, but basically abusing the children himself.
We didn't have children telling us that Arnold had slapped them around.
But quite a number of the kids reported incidents of being slapped and having their hair pulled or their arms twisted by Jesse.
He was, by far, the more violent one.
All these policemen said that Jesse was some kind of aggressor.
That even his father was cowering, and Jesse was this sexual, molesting tyrant.
I challenge anyone to find anyone who Jesse had even teased as a child or called a name.
Jesse was not an angry person.
He was not an upset person.
So we ended up spending a lot of time together.
I was over his house 3 days a week, 4 days a week.
And as far as I know him, none of this ever happened, not on my watch.
Eighteen-year-old Jesse Friedman also stands accused of sex abuse and using a child in a sexual performance.
The only thought that I just kept having the whole night was, "We're gonna get bailed out and then we'll go home and we'll figure out what's going on, and the lawyers will take care of this, and they'll straighten this out. "
Because it was still just a matter of,
"This is a big misunderstanding. "
But when the bail was set at a million dollars, instead of going out with Mom and David like we were supposed to, we went back the other way.
And that was the moment when there was this whole new sense that the problem was much worse than I originally thought.
The investigation didn't end at that point.
That really was the arrest and the search of the house.
And then we went on, because we had literally, at that point dozens more interviews to do.
Somewhere along the way, I think it was the Nassau County cops, they showed me this magazine, and they said,
"You see?
Look at this magazine. "
And they showed me the magazine.
They were embarrassed to show it to me because of what the pictures were.
And you know, I didn't see it.
My eyes were in the right direction, but my brain saw nothing.
Because when it was all over, the lawyer showed me the magazine, and then I saw it.
For the first time,
I really saw it.
I couldn't believe what I saw.
I mean, I had no concept that this thing even exists in the world, that this magazine would even be in the world.
I mean, we had a middle-class home, educated.
I had a good family, right?
Where did this come from?
Mr. And Mrs. Friedman's house on this most beautiful
Thanksgiving dinner.
For my daughter, for my son-in-law, and for my 3 grandsons.
I'm thankful that both my brothers are home, and
I'm most thankful to my husband, to Arnie.
Anything you want to say, Mr. Friedman?
Are you guilty?
Did you do all they say you did?
No comment.
I was the first to visit my brother in prison.
And that was a moment in my life I'll never forget.
He came into the room.
I was sitting at this table, a lot of tables, and they were crowded.
Just awful surroundings.
And he didn't have his glasses on.
Without his glasses, he was blind as a bat.
They'd taken them off and broken them, stepped on them.
He had a smell of urine.
They were throwing urine at him.
They were threatening to throw him down the stairs.
They knew what he was in there for.
It was all over the media.
And he was half-blind and hadn't shaved in two days and shivering and cold and scared out of his wits.
The first words out of his mouth were,
"Howie, they're gonna kill me.
Get me out of here. "
The People versus Arnold
Friedman and Jesse Friedman.
Indictment 67430.
Step up, please.
So began the very first time cameras were permitted in a Nassau County courtroom.
Fifty-six-year-old
Arnold Friedman and his 18-year-old son Jesse heard the court clerk read off a 91-count indictment charging them with sodomy and sexual abuse.
Arnold Friedman, how do you plead to this indictment?
Guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
And Jesse Friedman, how do you plead to this indictment?
Not guilty.
My brother and Jesse kept saying they're innocent.
"This is trumped up charges. "
And they got a McMartin's, you know?
They somehow got one kid to, they got the police to be able to convince the kids,
"Well, all of your friends said something happened.
Didn't something happen?
Something must have happened," et cetera, et cetera.
And they were convinced.
They kept saying they were innocent.
And I just kept thinking,
"I have to believe them. "
It's very hard for people to accept him as a pedophile.
Arnold Friedman was an award-winning teacher.
All over the house were plaques and newspaper articles written about him.
He had been given an award,
"Computer Teacher of the Year. "
He also taught piano.
David plays beautifully.
And his father taught him how to play the piano.
It was when he died that I realized how much of an impact he had on my life.
Take a bow.
He was very supportive of my magic when I was a kid.
When I was about 6, my father took me to a magic show.
And it's probably my earliest memory.
You know when your son goes to college and you say,
"Go to college," and
"What are you going to be?
"Be a doctor. Be a lawyer. "
I tried to make him into a doctor or a lawyer.
You know, my mom would always say, you know,
"Get a job. Get a job. "
But my dad would say to me,
"You know, David,
I can't tell you what to do, because you know what I did when I got out of college. "
He blew off his chemical engineering degree, which he could have worked for an oil company and made tons of money.
Instead, he played in the mountains, which is a total blow-off, follow your dream, artistic thing.
And I totally love him for that.
Trust your children to somebody who was a schoolteacher for over 20, 30 years, a member of your community.
All you heard were accolades about this person, and now all of a sudden, he's a monster.
And things that were being said, you know, upset the community, because you don't expect that here.
Great Neck is a peninsula.
It's a very insulated community.
This was a certain kind of person that lived in Great Neck.
It's on the North Shore of Long Island, which is usually a predominately wealthy area.
These are wealthy, professional people that have garnered a great deal of income in their lives, and they live accordingly.
Nice community.
Tight.
Affluent.
Well-kept homes.
They get dressed up to go shopping.
They want to be sure they get seen by the people they want to see, and cars are important, clothes are important.
There's a lot of competition in Great Neck.
Everybody's kid's a genius and the best, and everybody's the best in this and that, and you just want your kid to be happy and to get an array of experiences.
And this computer class was one of those experiences.
You thought you were doing right.
Most of the children started out explaining how Mr. Friedman would try to test them, I think, in my opinion, as to whether they'd be receptive to some of his advances.
There'd be certain showings on the computer during computer class of certain material that was inappropriate for children.
If you were going to be the first one abused on a particular day, he would pull up a chair and sit next to you.
Maybe it would start with his arm around your shoulder or on your leg and gradually move it up, touching private parts.
And then over the course of time we developed a situation where we found out that there was not only sexual touching of the genitals, but there were acts of sodomy, oral and anal sodomy, that took place during the course of the class.
So were the kids abused in the computer room in view of everyone else?
From what I saw in my sessions, none were raped out on the floor.
The kids were raped in Jesse's room or the bathroom.
Just to change the subject for a second, there were these sexual computer games that were discussed during the course of the case.
We'd basically do the games where there would be naked girls and everything in the computer class.
But I remember one time I slipped one of the games out, and I brought it home and everything, and I copied it, and Arnold found out.
Because of that, I was raped by him and Jesse at the same time, as punishment to that.
I never did it again.
He made me format it.
I formatted it.
I had to bring my computer in and show him that I hadn't brought it home.
So he was absolutely positive,
100%, that it was not touched at all in any way, form, shape whatsoever.
And how did he know that you brought it home?
He accounted for all the disks that were there.
And since he flipped through, he's like,
"Who the fuck took this? Tell me now, or I'm gonna kill you all!"
And he had a knife, and he was waving a knife around.
I was like, "I did it!"
My general recollection of the classes is basically a positive one, is a pleasant one.
The types of behaviors which were described, which were, well, just downright satanic in nature.
I mean, they make him sound like some kind of brutal sadist, whereas, you know, I had just always thought of him as being kind of a nebbish.
I think, as someone who took the classes, it was just hard to picture even that going on, because I did have a good experience.
And I didn't, you know, see anything, you know, remotely like, you know, like child molestation or child abuse or any child anything going on.
What took place in
Arnold's classes was pretty much just straight computer lessons.
I mean, as ordinary and as boring as you could possibly imagine it.
It was just generally a free-for-all.
Everybody could see what was going on, and very often they would participate in these sort of mass games in the classroom.
There was a game there that was called "Leapfrog. "
And this one really got to me.
They would play leapfrog in the class.
They'd actually have their clothes off.
And we associate leapfrog like you do when you were a kid, one guy jumping over another guy, but the fact is it means everybody's butt's up in the air, so to speak.
The very nature of these charges is so absurd.
It seems almost like some kind of grotesque fantasy.
Yeah. Leapfrog.
I remember about that.
It's kind of like Twister, where we would have to sit down.
Our asses would be in the air.
Arnold and Jesse would leap from one person to another, sticking their dick each in our ass.
But then I was confused, because you said that no kids were raped in the computer room.
The leapfrog game, which was not molestation, was a leapfrog game, was not considered molestation, was done outside.
But that was a group game.
The actual molestation, one-on-one contact, happened in the bathroom.
The game happened out on the floor.
One of the things, you sit down there, and I know I, you know, think about this, and you know,
"How could this go on in this home for so long and not be, you know, come out?"
But, you know, that wasn't my province.
That wasn't what I had to decide or the judge had to decide.
You know, that's up to someone else to decide that.
But if I recall, you know, the children were pretty vivid in their recollections as to what Arnold and/or Jesse did to them.
And Judge Boklan, she's you know, a pretty strong-willed judge.
And she's pretty unmovable when she makes her decision.
There was never a doubt in my mind as to their guilt.
And remember, I'd been around for a while.
This wasn't, you know, the first sex case that I had ever seen.
In fact, my previous law secretary used to tease me that we were the pervert part.
And having been, you know, head of the Sex Crimes Unit myself, where, you know, I had young boys who were sodomized, in fact, one who killed himself you know, after the sentence of the abuser.
I mean, some horrible experiences.
So for me to be so outraged,
I mean, this was really very, very bad what was going on there.
It was like someone's worst nightmare.
Who would even think of doing these things?
And to do them in a group and with so many witnesses.
The scenario, as posted by the media and the police was so incredibly way out, it was hard for me to believe that it was true.
We now welcome, also in
Los Angeles, Debbie Nathan.
Debbie is an investigative freelance journalist, who has been covering the McMartin and other abuse trials around the country.
All these parents are bizarro, huh?
They're all whacked?
Well, it's not really fair,
I don't think to deal simply with these parents or with this particular case.
You have to understand that all over the country there is a hysteria.
And I don't think that it's a question with most of these kids of lying.
I think that they have been brainwashed, if you will.
I was one of the first writers for the mass media to look at those cases critically and question them.
So as a result of that, having done a lot of that work,
I got a lot of letters from people.
And my father wrote to Debbie and said, I don't know, said, "Help me. "
And she has been the only person outside the family that said, "I believe you. "
In the Friedman case, the basic charges were completely implausible.
First of all, you'd have to believe that blood is coming out of these children's orifices, that they're screaming, that they're crying, that their clothes are soiled from semen and from blood.
And yet their parents show up.
Sometimes they show up unannounced.
Everything looks fine.
Was there any physical evidence in the case that was relevant?
Or it was the case really strictly based on the statements of the kids?
It was more testimony.
There was a dearth of physical evidence.
I don't even recall whether there was any physical evidence that would have indicated one way or another that these events took place.
I don't think that they're sitting around with any kind of diabolical or conspiratorial agenda to go out and falsely accuse Arnold Friedman or railroad Jesse Friedman.
But nobody's critiquing them.
Nobody's telling them that there's a right way and a wrong way to do this.
Nobody's saying that we've got a problem in this culture with hysteria around this issue.
And so they're really free to let their fantasies fly.
I think the most overwhelming thing was the enormous amount of child pornography.
You would just have to walk into the living room, and it'd be piled around the piano.
There were literally foot-high stacks of pornography, in plain view, all around the house.
But photos taken during the search showed nothing of the kind.
But as far as the families were concerned, I don't want to use the word that they were competitive with each other.
I don't know if it's to that extent.
You know, sometimes it'd be some idle conversation about, you know, another boy, you know,
"He was sodomized 5 times, but my son was sodomized
6 times," you know, as if that meant something in the overall scheme of things.
There's a whole community atmosphere that gets created in a mass-abuse case like this, where the families are talking to each other, they're going to community meetings, or they're calling on the phone all the time.
They're seeing each other in group therapy.
And there is definitely an element when a community defines itself as a victimized community, that if you're not victimized you don't fit into that community.
The families that had their child molested or allegedly molested became very involved and took a greater part of their life at that point.
I appreciated their call in the beginning telling me what happened.
And then when I told them that we looked into it and my wife and I both felt that nothing happened to our son, it got to be a little pushy situation where they told us that we were in denial, and it absolutely happened to our son.
You fucking bitch!
I'm gonna kill you!
When Jesse gets out of jail, he's a dead motherfucker.
When Arnold gets out of jail, he's a dead motherfucker.
Fuck you! I'll fuck your whole family!
Is there any one word or phrase that you could use to describe that experience overall?
Chaos. Hysteria.
It was really crazy.
Am I dreaming?
Is this a nightmare?
This can't be happening to my family.
My brother?
And a day doesn't go by that I don't think of it.
It destroyed my family.
It tore us apart.
I don't know.
I can't say too much about it.
We were a family.
Mommy believes you did it and she believes you should go to jail, and she believes that she deserves everything that's left and you shouldn't have any part of it.
You have to hire another lawyer?
All this woman does is hire lawyers.
I honestly have to tell you, anything that she decides
I can't trust.
She runs around, "Arnie, they don't trust me. "
Well, we don't trust her.
We lived with her for 3, for 2 months while you were in jail, and we learned not to trust her.
David had just gotten a video camera when this case broke, and so he just started recording the family falling apart.
And Mommy believes them, and I don't.
I tell them to get lost, and Mommy says, "You're right. "
And "I've lived with him for all my life. "
And "Look at all these horrible things he's done for me over 30 years," which amounts to nothing, except this.
At some point, David making the videotapes kind of springboarded to my thoughts about audiotape.
And I began to make audio recordings of these family arguments.
Don't scream.
The family was screaming at each other.
And everyone wanted me to say, "He didn't do it. "
Well, I wouldn't do that.
I said, "I don't know. "
They wanted me just to lie, you know, and say, "He didn't do it," whether I believed it or not.
And I was so angry at Arnold and what he'd done that I wouldn't do it, and I said, "Well, I don't know. "
And I wanted just to tell the truth.
That is the truth.
I didn't know.
My mother abandoned him, pretty much, wouldn't talk to him, fought with him constantly, made him sleep on the sofa.
And after 33 years of marriage, when your wife, when you've been accused of a crime you didn't commit, you spend 6 weeks in jail for it, you're trying to build a defense, and your wife leaves you, essentially, my father fell apart.
You yelled and screamed about what, that you ruined her life.
She's brainwashed you.
You didn't do anything.
The police have done it to you.
It's not your fault.
The police are railroading you.
But it's not your fault.
Mommy doesn't believe you.
The police picked on you, and that's who they're going after.
It's not because you deserved it.
You're taking the blame, and you don't deserve the blame.
She's brainwashing you into thinking that it's your fault, and it's not your fault.
She thinks he did it.
And if he did it, then she thinks he's going to be convicted of it.
And if he's convicted of it, he's going to go away.
Yeah, but if, let's say he goes away for 10 years.
He's still gonna come out.
No, I'm talking about 50 years.
I'm talking about 100 years.
She doesn't think he's getting 50 years.
I don't think she thinks that he's going to get 50 years.
OK, so what is he gonna get?
Twenty years?
That's 50 years.
What's the difference, well,
If he goes to a state institution on state charges, you know he's not coming back.
In this case, there was consultations between both sides, the District
Attorney's Office, the families, the defense attorneys, as to what to do with
Arnold Friedman.
We were trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in terms of having dinner and paying the bills, but it was almost surreal.
I mean, I don't think any of us had any notion of what was going on or what we were doing or where any of this was leading.
Sir, would you like to comment on the situation?
Yes, I think this is a kitchen.
I thought it was only going to last a year and that we would look back and laugh about how crazy we were and how we didn't know what we were doing and just sort of laugh.
What do you want?
My nose? My teeth?
Wait a minute. There it is.
- There's your nose.
- Oh that's great.
I feel like I'm being dissected here.
And here's Mommy and Daddy in a rare moment of affection.
What's the matter?
- Why?
- Why?
Why not?
That's not all.
You've gotten other things.
Lately but not all.
You're the one
Who's stolen my heart, dear
I think I was the first woman that he ever really dated.
And he was very reluctant to get married.
I sort of said, "We've got to do this," you know.
I could be very
So he says, "Well, all right. "
Big mistake.
We were delighted.
She was effervescent, pretty.
They seemed to be very much in love.
They seemed to be very compatible.
It had been a long time in coming.
My mother, "You're my oldest!
Get married! I want a grandchild," you know.
My mother is sexually ignorant.
As far as I'm concerned, she had sex, I mean everyone thinks their parents only had sex 3 times, you know for each of their siblings.
But with my mother,
I think it was true.
And it was like, you know, you read in a book how do you have sex, and you start here, and then you do step 1, step 2, step 3.
And that's somewhat like what sex was like with Arnold,
Because I used to say to him,
"It's called foreplay.
It's supposed to be play.
It's supposed to be fun. "
And he treated it like work.
Like this is what you're supposed to do when you do it, like washing the dishes.
If he was so much in the closet and not living with her and not attracted, where was she for 30 years?
Why didn't she say, "Honey, you're not having sex with me.
I think I want a divorce. "
Where was she?
I don't think that's the case.
Either they're both crazy, which is a possibility, or or he was perfectly normal, based according to, you know, by her standards.
You're the one for me
It was a difficult marriage because of Elaine.
She had her problems, and it took a monumental amount of patience and love and caring to handle it.
It wasn't easy for him.
It wasn't easy for the kids.
But they were able to live with it.
She was the best mother she knew how.
She loved her kids, and she loved her husband.
She wasn't the warmest, most outgoing human being in the world.
When I had the first child,
I was just ecstatic, but I didn't know how to do it.
And I wasn't the most well-balanced person myself.
You know, we all have hang-ups, and that's my hang-up.
Good things can never happen to me, only bad.
That's all the snapshots.
I know.
This whole thing is all the snapshots.
Did they go and they looked through each one?
They must have.
This is ancient film.
Holy shit.
- Dad, what is it?
- Oh, my God, it's amazing.
How did you get this?
This is great.
- This is my Dad's.
- Who took it?
My father.
Dad, what's that a film of?
This is a film of my sister.
I had a sister.
She died a year before I was born.
My brother knew her when he was young, of course.
And she died of blood poisoning.
It was a horrible, terrible, sudden death.
And it destroyed the family.
Arnold's parents divorced.
So Arnold's mother had these two boys, and they were really on welfare. I don't know.
They lived in a basement apartment.
Evidently, there was one bedroom, and the boys slept in the bedroom with the mother.
We shared, all 3 of us, not in the same bed, but we all shared the same room, big rooms.
And rather than put a, apparently the living room was the living room, and then there was the kitchen, so we put all the beds in the one room.
And that she dated a lot of men and would bring the men into the apartment, and they would have sex in the bed while Arnold was there listening.
And Arnold said that, because he saw his mother in bed with a man, that when he was adolescent, he was experimenting, as all children do, and he had sex with his brother in bed or something like that.
And to me, that's not what all children do.
Arnold sent me this right around when he started writing me, and it's called "My Story," and it was written in 1988.
And I think it was his attempt to talk about the case but also talk about the case in the context of his life.
And it starts out, it says,
"This story goes back 50 years to when I was a child. "
He says, "When I reached adolescence
I sought out partners for my emerging sexuality.
My first partner, when I was
13, was my 8-year-old brother.
I had overt sexual relations with him over a period of a few years. "
I know that my brother has said that he messed around with me when I was a kid.
And I don't remember any of it.
I don't remember anything.
I have nothing up here that has me yelling or screaming or crying or trying to get away or unhappy or I there's nothing there that.
Maybe someday a door will open, but it better hurry up, because I'm 65.
And at this point in time,
I could care less.
Then he goes on and says,
"My next partners were boys my own age, all of which sexual relations, probably being within norms for my age.
However, the emotional impact of these relations was very pronounced and lasted through my adult life.
A more normal situation, as probably happened with my partners, would have been to outgrow and forget these episodes.
However, I literally fell in love with these boys, and the relations were far more significant to me than they were to my partners. "
And then he told me that when he got to be an older teenager, like maybe in his late teens, he started worrying that he was still attracted to kids that were the same age as his brother had been when Arnold was 13, and that really started bothering him.
And then after he had his own children, he was worried.
He started worrying that maybe he would molest his own children.
And at that point, he went to therapy, and the therapist told him,
"No, don't worry.
You've got everything under control. "

You could see that this wasn't exactly
Fred MacMurray and
"My Three Sons," right?
It always struck us as being a very dysfunctional family, obviously.
And we'd have to, you would have to wonder, wouldn't you, what kind of a family situation you would have that could produce this kind of crime.
What might it be like to grow up in a household like this?
I don't know.
I can't even imagine.
Today is September 14, 1975.
We just concluded a tour of Jungle Safari.
Jungle Habitat.
Jungle Habitat in
West Milford, New Jersey.
Here are my 3 brothers.
Two brothers, you dummy.
All right, there are 3 children.
What happened was the 3 sons were like a gang.
Like, "This is our gang and Mom. "
"She's not part of our gang. "
And we have, of course,
A pterodactyl.
A Jewish pterodactyl.
Shmuck, shmuck, schmuck.
The 4 of us got along so well.
We had a very similar kind of sense of humor.
You know, one guy would say something, and then it would, then the next person would add to the joke.
And my mother, who has no sense of humor, and she just didn't get that part of us.
And she resented that.
When this whole thing blew apart, the men got together, and Arnold confided in them.
And me?
And I was a loyal wife.
People told me, "Oh, why don't you leave him?
He's a horrible person.
Just walk out and leave him. "
And I didn't.
I went all over town.
I raised money for bail.
I called every relative I knew.
I begged.
And I did all this for him, right?
He was my husband. I loved him.
And no one said,
"What do you want?" to me.
OK.
OK, I think we can eat now.
So you're saying what we have is the people who we thought would testify and say that nothing happened.
And we are afraid to put them on the witness stand, even though we know that nothing happened.
We think they will say something happened.
The Friedmans suggested that we speak to various people who may have been present at the time.
And some of those people weren't alleged victims at all.
And that the hope was that one or more of these people would say,
"This is just not true. "
But that just didn't happen.
As far as I'm concerned he's being, he's
So then nothing happened.
We begged him to tell us that something happened, to explain how this whole mess could have happened.
That's the only way to explain how it could have happened other then the fact that the police are out of their minds.
We begged him.
He told us nothing happened.
That's good enough for me.
Nothing happened.
If my father had the ability to confess to me, yeah, he had done something one time, and that's how this whole crazy mess got started, it would make a lot more sense.
Not that I wanted that to be the case, but you have to find a way to explain the unexplainable.
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, look at that.
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Is that a real ice cream?
That's what's so odd about it.
They had this idealized image of this father as being this saint-like person this Santa Claus,
Messiah, you know.
And professionals in the field say that oh, they have this idea that children identify with the abusive parent.
When I was about a year or two, my parents separated.
And what did I do?
"My father is wonderful.
My mother is terrible. "
The truth is my father was a rat just like David's father.
My father walked out.
This is not wonderful.
This is being a rat.
My mother was a nag.
Well, I mean, this is true but look, she stayed with me, she took care of me.
So people's visions are distorted.
I never felt angry at my dad.
My dad had nothing to do with this.
Someone knocks on the door and accuses you for a crime you didn't commit you gotta attack attack your attackers and do what you can.
And that's all it was.
It had nothing to do with there was nothing else that was involved at all.
We were talking about honoring and respecting.
Yeah, but, yeah, talk about honor and do you honor and respect your husband?
That's why
I don't talk to you.
I said I did honor and respect my husband.
Oh, Okay.
But you don't like that answer.
No I don't.
I don't believe it, no.
Ask your father.
Do I honor and respect you?
Do you object to my handling do you have any objection in my relationship with you?
Do you like it when she calls you slime?
She did.
Did you like it when she did?
OK.
Did you like it when
The other cases that
I've written about those families have been much stronger.
First of all, they've started from a monolithic feeling of innocence which didn't exist in this family because of Arnold's pedophilia.
And they just buckled down and everybody gets behind the defendant the accused family member.
People quit their jobs.
And, you know people were all sitting around the kitchen table for the next 3 years with staplers and Xerox machines and they're working on the defense.
And then when the defendant is convicted they're working on the appeal and all family conflict is submerged.
Why don't you try once to be supportive of me?
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because we all started at the beginning of this thing and I
Well let's start from right now.
OK, let's start from right now.
All right, let's start from right now.
We'll all start brand new.
We have a decision making process on the table.
Great.
All the past mistakes, they were mistakes.
We're not gonna hold them against anyone.
Great, great.
Now we're starting afresh.
Stop. Lower your voice, and talk nicely to your sons.
Alright, now we're gonna do it, starting now.
Seth, why don't you call me?
Do I bawl you out?
Seth is
...against me and she can't hold it against me.
Well, now it's time to call it
'cause Mommy's sad and stuff.
I think there was a recognition that Arnold's case was becoming increasingly hopeless because of the child pornography problem because of other people coming out of the woodwork.
So the strategy evolved to
"What can we do to save Jesse?"
Jesse's lawyer very eloquently said to us
"If there's a rowboat and it's sinking and the rowboat is tied to a rock you have to disconnect the rowboat from the rock and save the rowboat even though the rock is sinking"
Meaning you had to separate
Arnold from Jesse.
And Arnold was going to plead and Jesse would in some way benefit.
I was sitting there potentially going to trial with no pornographic magazines admitted into evidence without an adult pedophile as a co-defendant and I understood that sort of reasoning but it makes no sense if my father pleads guilty and then I go to trial and say,
"I didn't do it" when all the jurors have already read in the newspaper that my father plead guilty.
And I did not want my father to plead guilty.
I arranged for Mr. Friedman and his family to get a jury room where they could sit and they could discuss these plea options.
And while I didn't go inside the room except to knock on the door and say where we're at in terms of what Mr. Friedman wanted to do there was a lot of yelling and crying and screaming going on, coming out of that room.
God damn it!
When I screamed at Arnold,
I screamed
"You must do it because it'll help Jesse.
Do it for Jesse. "
And my brothers were just furious at this notion that my father would go to court and plead guilty.
And at one point in all of the chaos my father just started screaming.
And there's uncontrollable tears and he picked up a chair.
I remember he threw a chair.
He was just screaming about how he wasn't gonna plead guilty.
He didn't do anything, he's not gonna plead guilty.
And he was furious at my mother and he was just freaking out.
And I remember very clearly sitting down with my father in the corner.
My mother's over there, brothers are over here.
I'm talking to my father privately and he asked me what he should do.
And I could have said to my father
"I want you just to walk out of here and go to trial and not plead guilty. "
Instead, I remember very clearly saying to him
I wanted him to make the decision.
And I remember feeling like a really young kid.
Kind of looking up to my Dad and saying
"Dad, I," you know
"I want you to be my Daddy. "
And I would have been really, really proud of him if he had just stood up and said
"Elaine,
I'm not pleading guilty.
We're going to trial. "
But that's not what happened.
Former New York City schoolteacher Arnold Friedman had nothing to say when he left the Nassau County Courthouse in Mineola but inside he pleaded guilty to more then 40 counts of sodomy sexual abuse, and endangering the welfare of a child.
Attempted sexual abuse in the first degree an "E" felony, two counts and endangering the welfare of a child a class "A" misdemeanor, one count in full satisfaction of this indictment?
Yes.
My mother manipulated him.
My mother is crazy and my mother has control over my father.
Some relationships have that where the woman controls the man.
It's called being pussy whipped.
My father and my mother are not the only two people in the world who have that relationship.
My father and mother had that relationship.
My mother and the lawyers said,
"Take the plea. "
They took the plea.
I sat there in disbelief.
Is this my brother?
My brother?
This isn't my brother, he's not a monster.
He's a good loving brother and husband, and son, and citizen, and teacher and this isn't happening.
This is a mistake.
Something as horrendous as child molestation you have to live with yourself.
If you didn't do it, you don't plead guilty.
I never understood it.
We have Elaine.
- Hi.
- We have Teddy, Arnie.
Number 4753206.
Don't.
Please don't film me.
David, I told you
I don't want to be on tape.
Why are you so
When we stop talking to her
She doesn't want
She doesn't want any record, any record at all
As if they were
Can you believe these kids, that they have to persecute me?
David, if your mother doesn't want to be filmed don't film her.
- OK.
- Come on.
When it was all over, they said it was all my fault because I wanted them to take a plea and it had been arranged before.
Arnold agreed to take a plea but they were very hurt.
I'm still here.
Yeah.
I may not be here very much longer but I'm still here.
That's disturbed.
The sentence:
10 to 30 years.
The crime:
Sodomizing young boys.
Defendant Arnold Friedman had pleaded guilty to sexually abusing more than a dozen youngsters, but this does not end the Friedman case.
There are still numerous sodomy and sex abuse charges pending against Arnold's son,
Jesse Friedman.
I mean we could try this case in the media.
Who's gonna, who's gonna buy that I sodomized boys?
Yeah, I agree with you.
I agree with you.
No, I really
Well, I don't think we have to try well, all I want to do
We didn't make a deal with Arnold Friedman to spare his son.
So his son is facing a multiple count indictment he's facing a considerable amount of jail time and now he's confronted with a situation where Long Island knows that his father admitted his guilt and there's a reasonable human expectation of some people that, you know where there's smoke, there's fire.
And if he did it, maybe his son did it.
We know he was in the same class and he was helping his father.
So I think that was a difficult thing for Jesse to have to overcome.
I always believed Jesse.
How could this possibly go on for 4 years children repeatedly sodomized and sexually abused with brutality if you believe the police.
And then their parents come to pick them up right after computer class and not one kid is crying not one kid tells his mother or father what happened in class not one kid says anything?
I find that so incredible that Jesse's story that nothing happened to me was more believable than the police version of these horrific acts.
Jesse and I went we flew in August of 1988 all the way to Madison, Wisconsin where we rented a car and drove 90 miles to some town that I couldn't possibly give you the name of to a federal prison.
Who knew more about this case then Arnold Friedman?
He knew more about it than Jesse.
I had to wait 40 minutes because Arnie was either playing tennis or golf
I don't remember what it was.
I was outraged.
It was a visiting room.
Jesse was out in the waiting room at this point and this man had this little boy in there who was his son or his stepson,
I don't know but the child was about
4 or 5 years old and they were in the table right next to us.
And I was interviewing Arnie and all of a sudden he leaned over and asked me if I could ask the corrections officer or whoever was in charge in the room if we could get another table.
And I asked him why, and he said
"That little boy over there bouncing on his father's lap is getting me very excited. "
It took me about 15 minutes to regain my composure.
I remember that like it was yesterday.
I was shocked
'cause even though I was involved in the case now for two months and even though
I had studied pedophilia and I knew what these men did to little boys
I had never heard somebody actually say it.
And I was absolutely disgusted.
We did change our table and I spoke to Arnie.
I interviewed him for a very long time.
He was telling me that the only reason he pled guilty and went to jail was because he wanted to save his son, Jesse.
He told me that he was a pedophile.
He told me that he had had activity with boys but not in Great Neck.
He told me that he had a house in Wading River a beach resort and that the family enjoyed vacations there.
And he told me that there were certain boys he took liberties with and I don't want to go into it while he was in that area.
"In my early 40s, during the summer
I did go 'over the line' and did have sexually arousing contact with two boys short of sodomy.
One of the boys was the son of a close friend and I feared exposure and loss of this friendship.
The boy might have told his parents but they said nothing so I assumed that he really had not told them. "
That's what? It's one sentence.
What does that mean?
Do you fucking know what that sentence means?
I don't even fucking know what that sentence means.
I "sexually aroused?"
What the fuck is he talking about?
Maybe he put his arm around the kid.
Maybe he took him in a sailboat and he found that sexually arousing?
Maybe he was leaning against a tree.
That's called sexually arousing contact if you're sexually aroused while you lean against a tree.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that sentence means.
When Arnold was first arrested, he said
"I'm arrested because of this magazine.
I sent one magazine in the mail and that's why I'm arrested, and it's nothing.
It's just nothing.
It doesn't count, it doesn't matter it's nothing. "
And you know, you live as husband and wife you share certain intimacies.
I said to him,
"Tell me the truth.
What happened?"
He says, "That's it.
That's the truth. "
So it came out that he had in fact molested a young man.
And we were sitting in the therapist's office and he said,
"Oh, I just molested two boys. "
And I said, "Two? Two?"
I said, "I thought you told me only one. "
"Well," you know, and he
"It didn't matter.
It's nothing," you know.
And then I went berserk.
And I felt betrayed.
Yeah, my father had the magazines and yes, my father admitted that he was a pedophile and had these fantasies and yes, my father admitted that he was no saint and that there were times that he slipped but I was arrested, too and I'm not a child molester.
And I don't think it's appropriate for me to have to answer for the sins of my father.
This is what I walk around with.
It's just, every day.
It's just ridiculous.
All I think about is the case and my career and they're completely, it's like oil and water.
With the case, it's a question of research.
My brother's been in the law library researching his current plan and I'm supposed to go out and make people laugh.
It's unbelievably difficult to deal with the case and then go out and entertain people.
Hey!
Hi, everyone!
We carefully investigated this case for trial.
Really get into the case, examine, investigate and try to build a defense.
While I was out on bail
I put all the charges into a database so that they could be sorted by complainant by time period, by nature of charge.
For example, there was one complainant
10-year-old boy says he came to class in the spring of 1986 and during this 10-week session where he was only over my house for an hour and a half once a week he says that there were
31 instances of sexual contact.
That's 3 times a week every single week... for 10 straight weeks and then the course ends.
In the fall, he re-enrolled for the advanced course and says that he was subjected to 41 more instances of anal and oral sodomy in the next 10-week session and nobody said anything.
Week after week, month after month year after year until after the police came knocking on doors and asking questions.
I went to the doorbell.
There were two
Nassau County detectives and they said they'd like to speak to our son with regard to the Friedman matter.
They came in and said, "We know something happened to him. "
They didn't say, "We believe. "
They said, "We know. "
And they wanted to speak to him.
I remember it was actually kind of a frightening experience because I remember they're talking to my parents about this within earshot of me.
I remember actually eavesdropping on what they said and what they said made my heart race because they were saying that actually quite a few horrible things had happened to a lot of children and I was one of them.
And quite honestly,
I didn't believe it and I was very confused and very angry about this, thinking, well, why are these people going around telling my parents that all kinds of things have happened when I have simply no recollection of anything?
Children want to please very often.
They want to give you the answers that you want.
Adults do that as well.
So you have to be very mindful of the fact that when you're interviewing a child if the child starts to answer questions your responses should be somewhat in the framework of
"And then what happened?"
Or, "What happened next?"
Or, "What do you remember then?"
As opposed to
"He did this to you, didn't he?"
Or "She did this to you, didn't she?"
That's a very, very dangerous type of interview process to use.
If you talk to a lot of children you don't give them an option, really.
You just, you be pretty honest with them.
You have to tell them pretty honestly that
"We know you went to Mr. Friedman's class.
We know how many times you've been to the class. "
You know, we go through the whole routine.
"We know that there was a good chance that he touched you or Jesse touched you or somebody in that family touched you in a very inappropriate way. "
And I listened to them talking to him and it got to a point where it wasn't asking him what happened.
It was more of them telling him what happened and that when they didn't like what he said they kept repeating to him that they know what happened and that he should tell.
I believe that I remember saying that I saw Jesse, like chase after a kid or hit a kid or something like that and that's what I testified to to the grand jury.
And I remember saying that because I felt and I feel like when I said that that ended the questioning.
And so that might have meant that you could infer maybe that they were asking me a lot of questions, trying to get something and I just wanted to give them something.
I mean I don't want to be say I'm a perjurer or anything but I did not observe anything like that happening.
What I do remember is the detectives putting me under a lot of pressure to speak up.
And at some point,
I kind of broke down.
I started crying.
And when I started to tell them things
I was telling myself that it's not true.
I was telling myself,
"Just say this to them in order to get them off your back. "
I came across a document regarding a group of children from the Friedman case who were in therapy and it stated that many of them had absolutely no recollection of the abuse and there was some discussion about whether hypnosis would be a good idea now, exactly what you're not supposed to do.
It was the kind of therapy that had a really good chance of messing up kids' memories and implanting false memories.
My parents put me in therapy right away.
They put me in hypnosis and tried to recall facts that I had buried.
And that's how I first came out, started talking about it, just through being hypnotized and everything
I recalled things that I would bury.
I was able to talk about them.
For example, what would be something that you recall?
The actual first time
I actually recalled that I was actually molested.
Wow, I was actually molested.
I can deal with it now.
That was the first time.
And you recalled through hypnosis the first episode?
Yes.
So tell me about that, if you remember.
I don't remember much about it.
It was so long ago.
I just remember that
I went through hypnosis came out, and it was in my mind.
19-year-old Jesse Friedman was arraigned on more than
198 additional counts of child sexual abuse.
This brings the total number of sexual abuse charges to 245.
Jesse was grossly overcharged and you're basically terrorizing the defendant.
You're telling the defendant
"Look, if you plead guilty you know, we'll give you a good deal and, on, you know, 2 charges.
But if you insist on going to trial we're going to put
1,003 charges on you.
And if you're convicted of all those charges you're gonna rot in jail the rest of your life. "
I was told that if he went to trial the judge would give
3 consecutive sentences.
Instead of concurrent the sentencing would be consecutive.
I said, "Oh, my god. "
She just kept telling me over and over
"The only thing to do is to plead guilty and to get the best deal you can.
You can't go to trial.
It doesn't matter if you're guilty or innocent.
You can't go to trial, because if you go to trial you're gonna go to prison for the rest of your life. "
I said, "But Ma,
I didn't do it. "
She said,
"That doesn't matter.
You have to plead guilty. "
You have to understand, this is a 19-year-old kid and he is now facing the most heinous charge known to man and everyone in the world slowly but surely, was turning against him.
I don't care about my parents.
I wish it was just my brothers.
Oh, fuck.
I don't care about my mother, that's for sure.
If my brothers were OK then my mother could go to fucking hell.
My father is not going to survive if my brother gets incarcerated.
So so when the guilty verdict comes in on Jesse my father's gonna kill himself.
Jesse's gonna go to jail for the rest of his life.
Seth is gonna move west.
Fuck fuck.
I received a telephone call from Jesse asking to see me and Jesse told me that he wanted to plead guilty.
In 1988, there was no way that a jury in Nassau County who had been reading the newspaper headlines in "Newsday" for over a year those people were never going to listen to anything the defense had to say and I was absolutely terrified of going to prison for 100 years.
Jesse had always maintained his innocence.
I don't work out deals for people who are innocent.
And my first reaction was,
"I'm not gonna do it.
You're not guilty, you're not pleading guilty. "
And at that point, he told me that
"I have something to tell you. "
And with tears rolling down his eyes, literally he told me that he was abused by his father growing up and that while he never enjoyed the sexual part of that he did enjoy the attention his father gave him and being with his father and that not everything he had said about nothing happened was true.
Peter Panaro was personally convinced that my father had sexually abused me and nothing I could say could dissuade Peter from this notion.
Jesse felt that if Judge Boklan knew that he also was a victim of his father that she might consider the plea negotiations in a more favorable way.
He came up with this strategy.
It was Peter Panaro's fictionalized story that he fed to me and said, "If you say this, it's gonna look good for you. "
I told him
I wouldn't do it.
I told him, "Jesse, when you plead guilty in open court you're gonna have to admit to this type of anal sodomy 14 times.
And I'm not gonna let you do that unless you can admit it. "
He looked me right in the eye always liked to call me by my name before he made a statement and said,
"Peter, I can admit it. "
The only concern that Peter Panaro had was that ethically as a lawyer he couldn't let his client go into court and say something happened that he knew his client had told him was a lie.
The private investigator wasn't coming up with anything helpful.
There was not gonna be any defense witnesses.
There wasn't any money to hire experts.
Mom was insistent upon there not being a trial.
Peter Panaro wasn't believing me no matter how many times
I told him nothing happened.
I just ran out of options.
Jesse was a very good baby.
I remember when we brought him home from the hospital and Arnie looked at that baby and he said
"That child is marvelous.
He's wonderful" and he was so thrilled.
And David was the big brother and he used to take care of Jesse.
We used to let
David watch him and he was very protective of his baby brother.
It's amazing.
Six months from now
I already don't have a father or a mother.
Six months from now
I'm not gonna have my brother.
If I ever watch this
I don't know when it's gonna be.
I don't know where I'm gonna be.
I don't know what's gonna happen to my family.
I'm so scared.
I don't want to have to spend the next 8 hours screaming with my sons and fighting with them.
Then don't.
I want them out of this house tomorrow morning.
Mom
I don't give a shit.
I want you out of this house tomorrow morning.
You may not give a shit about Jesse but we are here for Jesse.
What are you all talking about here?
Can't you put your anger aside for one minute?
I cannot put my anger aside about you.
You have been nothing but hateful, hostile, and angry ever since this began.
OK, Jess, we're on.
Ta da. I feel like shit.
What's today's date?
Today's the day before I went to jail.
"Went" to jail?
- I'm going to jail.
- Because we're watching it.
We're gonna be watching this after I'm already out of jail.
After 4, 41/2 years because the case gets reopened.
At this point in time, my life is as good as over.
It is terminated at this point only to resume at a later date.
This one'll go, this one'll shatter.
The night before Jesse's plea we stayed up all night.
Maybe I shot the videotape so that I wouldn't have to remember it myself.
It's a possibility because I don't really remember it outside of the tape.
Like when your parents take pictures of you do you remember being there or do you remember just the photograph hanging on the wall?
Even if I'm facing the worst scenario possible tomorrow and for every day following it
I have to think tonight that it's not gonna be that bad.
Goodness knows
I don't want to look like my father.
Goodness knows,
I want to separate myself from Arnold Friedman as much as possible and I'm not throwing chairs tomorrow.
Good.
And if this trial were postponed for 3 years in 3 years, I would win.
But here today, at this point trying to start a trial in two weeks
I would lose this trial.
We feel this way and that is what would happen.
So what are you thinking, Jess?
I'm not.
You're avoiding?
Well, I gotta eat something.
I'm proud to say
I've managed to leave barely any gas in the car.
See, just our luck we'll be trapped at the house.
We'll run out of gas at the house.
- You a child molester, Jess?
- Nope.
Did you ever do it?
Never touched a kid.
Did you do what they said you did?
I never touched a kid.
I never saw my father touch a kid.
Good.
Yeah, but still, you must have done it.
Yeah, but surely something has happened.
It must, something.
Because the police say it's true.
OK, you never touched a kid, right?
Well, if something happened it didn't happen while I was there.
And it was a minimal incident because the kid didn't say anything about it.
But the police, how could they be lying?
Shut up, Seth.
The children the 14 children in this case are clearly victims.
No one could ever argue that.
The real culprit here is Arnold Friedman.
The man is a monster.
He abused him and he molested him.
This can't be overlooked.
I can't believe we live in such a cold society that no one could look at this man and understand that.
My father raised me confused about what was right and what was wrong and I realize now how terribly wrong it all was.
I wish I could have done something to stop it sooner.
I wish there was something
I could have done.
I'm very, I'm
I'm just so sorry it happened.
Judge Boklan sternly looked down and said that she recommended to the parole board that he serve the maximum period of time permitted by law a statement which I felt was harsh and unnecessary to a 19-year-old under these circumstances.
Jesse was a victim.
There's no question,
Jesse was a victim but even when he was caught
Jesse never expressed any kind of sympathy for these kids and as a matter of fact on the day that the plea was taken
Jesse was dancing and singing on the courthouse steps while being videotaped by his two brothers.
My brain hurts!
It'll have to come out.
My brain, but I'm using it!
But I'm using it!
Nurse!
Nurse!
They were taking pictures.
I remember someone brought that to my attention.
We looked out the window.
Because I'm saying to myself
"This is very bizarre. "
I mean he's about to go to jail for the next 6 to 18 years and he's out on the courtroom steps in some sort of theatrical performance.
That is so funny, when they're all
I think it was about distracting ourselves not necessarily distracting Jesse.
Jesse was
I think he was the most comfortable about the whole situation.
You know
I don't know how he has always been the most comfortable about it, but he has.
OK, right about now we've been waiting for a good two hours or so now because evidently the parents stormed Denis Dillon's office this morning when they received the news last night that I was to plead guilty and they were not aware of this fact.
They were not even aware that negotiations were underway.
They did not want me to have less than 10 to 30 and there are a lot of people probably making all sorts of angry statements at this point in time.
I can imagine what they're discussing.
The meeting must have, just like our family.
Well, there wasn't really much of them anyway but that means the meeting's over.
That means the meeting's over.
Go ask them, Jess.
You hold it.
I'm not holding it.
Should I do it, Jess?
Oh, my god.
I can't believe this.
Oh, my god.
He raped my son!
Get them away from me!
They're animals.
Oh, my god,
I don't believe it.
Wow.
After Jesse went to jail
I know my friends said to me
"Don't you feel, like, terrible being alone in such a big house?"
I said, "No, I feel calm. "
That's when I really started becoming a person and started to live.
Elaine divorced him while he was in prison.
He settled into life there
You can't say it was good in prison but it was as good as it could get for him.
But of course, the torment continued and got worse because of Jesse.
My brother never got over the guilt.
He had talked about taking his life because he had this insurance policy he had taken out.
I think it was $250,000,
1/4 million and Jesse was the beneficiary.
He said, "This is the only thing
I have left to give Jesse
So he has money when he gets out and he can make some kind of life for himself because I've screwed it up otherwise for him. "
By that time, that clause in the insurance policy where suicide was payable had come into effect.
And this is the coroner's report.
It describes the cause of death as doxepin intoxication which basically means that Arnold took a massive overdose of antidepressants.
I took a deep breath and I said
"It's over, David.
He's out of his misery.
It's over. "
I thought it was a blessing because the guilt he was carrying he was so unhappy.
He was out of his misery.
The rest of the family wasn't but he was.
I found it a blessing.
Let me entertain you
Let me make you smile.
It's unbelievably difficult.
I have to read these horrible letters about my brother being almost killed in prison.
My friends call me,
I'm crying.
"Why are you crying?"
I can't tell them.
None of the people that do what I do know about this story.
Just the intimation of something like this can ruin someone's career.
And I'm always afraid that's going to happen.
So let me entertain you
And we'll have a real good time
I feel I will never really know the truth.
But the one truthful thing or the honest thing we know
Howard loved his brother.
Howard loved his family.
Loves his family.
And I believed him when he said he didn't do those terrible things.
I believed him.
Arnold had a need to confess and he had a need to go to jail.
And the sad thing is that he took his son with him.
What's the term about families?
Dysfunctional?
Numero uno.
It was not the way it was supposed to end.
People were supposed to realize that all of this was nonsense and we'd try to go back to living our normal lives.
Hey! Hi, everyone!
I would have to stare at Arnold across the dinner table and it was just the two of us.
There was really nothing between us except these children that we yelled at.
We named the cottage
"Peaceful Pond Cottage" because we were looking for a place of healing and peace.
Any comment on your personal life, sir?
It's personal.
Oh, my god.
Hey, how you doing?
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Yes! Finally.
- Is that him?
- That could be he.
Shit.
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
Room service.
Oh, god.
You order a son?
You looking for me?
Surprise.
Hi. Look at me.
Look.
To the students of the Whitwell Middle School: l recently learned from a friend about your paper clip project. l was so moved by the story that l found myself in tears.
You've embarked on a journey that begins in the brain but ends in the heart.
Six million Jews will never again dance, love, sing or learn, but the souls of six million
Jews will be honored, remembered and treasured because of your little school in Whitwell, Tennessee, and the tolerance and love that live there.
My name is Linda Hooper. l've lived here, in Whitwell, Tennessee, all my life, and l've been the Principal of the middle school for nine years.
A lot of people have said that our little town is an unlikely place for what happened. l guess l can understand that.
Probably most people, if they drove into Whitwell, would not be terribly impressed. lt's a very rural town, about
24 miles northwest of
Chattanooga. lt's got just two traffic lights...
...several gas stations, and a couple of restaurants.
Whitwell used to be a coal mining community, and then about 30 years ago, we had a really bad accident, and the coal mining industry just went bust.
So now we're what's called a depressed community.
But let me tell you something, we're not depressed; we're poor, we're extremely poor.
But let me tell you about our children.
We have wonderful children.
They're respectful, they are thoughtful, they are caring... but they are pretty much homogenous.
We are a community of 1600 people; however, we really have no diversity.
There are no Jewish people, no Catholics, and in our school, we have only five black kids and one Hispanic child.
We are all alike.
And when we come up to someone who is not like us, we don't have a clue.
So, in 1998, we began an adventure. lt was no great mission. lt was a need, our need.
We were looking to do a project that would involve tolerance and diversity.
So Miss Hooper sent me to a conference in Chattanooga, and l went to this conference and went to many, many classes to try to find a project that would fit our need.
So he came back to me, and he said,
''You know, if we studied about the Holocaust, think about all of the things we could learn.''
We could surely learn about evil.
And we would definitely learn about a culture that was totally different from our own.
And so l went and asked Sandra Roberts, who is the 8th grade
Language Arts teacher, if she would like to help.
When l heard about the project, l was so excited. l couldn't say yes quick enough.
We sat down and we decided that our goal was to teach children what happens when intolerance reigns and when prejudice goes unchecked.
So that's what we set out to do-- to teach our children that not everybody is white and Protestant and doesn't live in a rural community where they are very protected and loved and cared for.
That's all we wanted to do, just a nice, simple thing.
The important thing is the lessons that you're going to learn from this project.
How important it is to treat everybody exactly like you want to be treated.
Let's talk a little bit about what's going to happen today.
The first year, which was in '98, l believe, there was just the Holocaust project.
The teachers didn't know a lot, but they were trying to teach the kids what they did know.
They read books, and they watched video clips, saw pictures.
And they just tried their best to do what they can.
But l want to remind you before we start that what we're going to cover in this project is very, very graphic...
Of course, one of the first things that the kids had to learn and one of the hardest things for them to comprehend was that Hitler murdered
6 million Jewish people.
The idea for the paper clips came when a student said,
''What is 6 million? l've never seen 6 million.''
Miss Hooper's like,
''Well, neither have l. lf you can find something to collect, we'll try it.''
So the students began doing some research on the lnternet... and they discovered that the paper clip was invented in Norway. l never knew that.
And they also learned that the
Norwegians used the paper clip as a symbol during the
Holocaust.
Back in the 1940s, Norwegians wore paper clips on their collar to represent the people who were in the Holocaust at that time.
The Jews had to wear stars telling people that they were
Jews, so the Norwegians wore the paper clip to represent what the wrongdoing was.
Because if they spoke out about it, they would probably get killed or put in a concentration camp.
And they came, and they said,
''Can we write some letters to some people we know
''and to some other schools and to some famous people, and see if they'll send us some paper clips?''
Miss Hooper said, ''Sure.''
So, we began sending letters out.
We have some from Tom Hanks and from Bill Cosby and from former President Bush and former President Clinton and President Bush.
''Dear Students: Celebrities don't always read their fan mail,
''as they think it's time-consuming.
''And though l, too, am guilty of not reading everything that crosses my desk,
''l was certainly glad that l read yours.
''l have a very difficult time explaining to any of my seven grandchildren
''what the Holocaust was all about.
''l am a Jew.
''The whole depravity of what happened in the concentration camps
''really struck home when l saw pictures
''of the atrocities perpetrated on the Jewish people.
''Those pictures are still very much alive in my memories.
''l'm sending you one paper clip.
''lt is my paper clip.
''ln the future, l will remember your project
''with every paper clip l come in contact with,
''as it will be a symbol of what you students are trying to accomplish.
''l am moved by your endeavors.
Bless You.
Tom Bosley.'' l mean, if this is a middle school, we're talking about 8th graders, l guess.
''Propaganda has absolutely nothing to do with the truth.''
And the stimulation that they're getting from their teachers is really-- everyone there should be commended for what they've done.
When l came in here, l didn't really know a lot about it, so it just felt good to be a part of something big and learn more about the
Holocaust.
Every year, the incoming 8th graders pick up where last year's left off.
One of the really motivating things for David and me is seeing the thoughtfulness each new group brings to the project.
Terri Lynn, sitting there all nice and still.
Why did you want to be a part of this?
Because l know that your afternoons are very full with cheerleading and other things that you do in your life, and this is going to take a huge commitment. l wanted to do this because l think that this would help everybody stop and make sure that they know somebody before they start thinking and saying, and l know that l do that, and l think this group would really help me.
Very good...
When l started this project, the person l was is not the person l am now. lt's what you do with that charisma. l was a new teacher, still trying to further her career and figure out my teaching styles and what worked best for me, not necessarily what worked best for the children. l think you get so engrossed in what can you do to further your career, and it becomes about you.
Rumors. We all know what they are.
We all probably have been subject to one or two in our life.
Does that make a difference in they way people think about you and think about me?
Oh, yeah, it does.
When the project first began, l was very prejudiced in many areas and was very quick to judge all races. l was the typical Southern person, quick to judge and quick to stereotype.
As a teacher, l guess l'd listened to what everyone had said about kids that age and pretty much had stereotyped children, you know, in my classes. l wouldn't take input from them. l would tell them what l wanted them to know, and that was it.
You're going to come up with some really cool posters.
These children really wanted to understand the magnitude of the
Holocaust.
That's why the second group in the Fall of 1999 added the Paper Clip project to their weekly meetings.
And with letters and paper clips coming in, it seemed to be catching on.
We first got a shipment of 100,000 paper clips.
They were very excited, and they thought they were off to a booming start.
We received that in one large shipment from a gentleman in California, a jewelry designer.
And he called and he was all excited, so, for a couple of weeks there we were real excited: ''Oh, we got 100,000, this is going very quickly.''
And then we got into a huge lull where we would go weeks and receive two letters.
And it's really hard to keep your optimism up, your enthusiasm up, and to keep up the enthusiasm of 27 kids.
And we were just fiddling with some numbers, trying to determine how long it was going to take us to get to 6 million at the current rate.
And it was gonna take us 10 years, and we just both shook our heads.
We knew we didn't have that much in us.
Sandy and l sat and looked at each other, and we said, ''Well, if we can collect
''1 .5 million for the children that were killed, that,'' you know,
''we'll probably be doing pretty good.''
Towards the end of 1999, l guess the project could have gone either way.
But no one was ready to give up on it just yet.
Fortunately, that's when
Peter and Dagmar Schroeder came in.
Alcohol, how is it called?
Oh, moonshining.
Moonshining. Yeah.
Oh, gosh. How do you describe
Peter and Dagmar Schroeder? lt's only a beginning now.
They contacted us in October of
And the letter read, their friend, who was a 94-year-old Holocaust survivor named Lena Gitter, had found our project on the lnternet, and she said,
''This is your assignment.''
We both are journalists, and we are here in the United States for 20 years.
We are White House correspondents.
Yes, Whitwell High.
And on the side we try to get a feel for this country. ls this where they have the football game?
Yeah, there.
''Go, Tigers.'' ''Go, Tigers.''
As journalists, you always have this negative stuff you write about.
And then if you're getting older, like us, then it's the danger that you get cynical.
And that you don't believe in good stuff anymore. ln the beginning, there was not much of paper clips.
They just have started to collect them.
We saw then, OK, we have to help the kids, and that we can do that.
And the Germans should be involved.
And we were talking to some people at the school, and we asked, ''Can we come over?
Can we visit you?''
So, and they said, ''Sure.''
Maybe it was not only an experience for us, it was an experience for the children, too.
Because the children obviously had no idea what Germans looked like.
They asked their teacher,
''How do Germans look like?
Are they different from us?''
And then we came over, and later they told us,
''You look quite normal.''
We lost our professionality right away when we saw the kids.
How can you be-- be professional, when strange kids of 13 or 14 or 15 years old, you have never seen in your life, hug you and greet you like an old friend?
You can't.
Little Tiger.
You are number one. Give me five.
Could you do that?
That's a little bit hard.
They came... they saw... they wrote.
They went back to Washington.
They sent Dita Smith with theiWashington Post[/l] to our school. l did a little research on the town and the area and realized that Dayton,
Tennessee is only about 30 or 40 miles to the north, where the famous Monkey Trial took place, otherwise known as the Scopes Trial, where a teacher was tried for teaching Darwinian theories rather than Christian theory of Creationism.
The other historical fact that l discovered when l was in
Whitwell was that the Ku Klux Klan was founded only about 100 miles away, in Pulaski.
Maybe when l got to Whitwell, l was a little bit prejudiced myself. l expected a town that was close-minded, very Christian, very fundamentalist, but l realized that, that in itself was my prejudice, not their prejudice.
After l went to Whitwell, l wrote my story... and it appeared on Passover Day.
From NBC News World Headquarters in New York, this is NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw.
The Holocaust.
The cold, calculated extermination of millions of Jews.
A great evil that must never be forgotten.
From a corner of Tennessee tonight, perhaps this generation is teaching us.
Well, it really started getting big whenever, like, theiWashington iPost came down, and then NBC came, and then people just started-- the paper clips just started coming in by the millions.
Before theiWashington Post[/l] came, we probably had 150,000 paper clips.
Thirty.
Thirty-one.
Thirty-two.
Over a period of six weeks, we ended up with 24 million paper clips.
And we counted them all.
The grannies counted them.
The aunts counted them. lt's heavy, so be careful.
Everybody was counting.
We checked in over 24 million paper clips... and about 25,000 pieces of mail.
At first, when it went from maybe a tub or so, which our regular mail carrier would take in his car every day, it got to the point where we had hampers full, and he couldn't load those hampers with the rest of his mail.
So, we had to call the middle school and inform them,
''Something's going on over here. lnstead of us delivering your mail, you have to come to us to pick it up.''
Got something for you here from
Germany, this suitcase right here.
That came in this morning.
- Looks old, too.
- Yeah, it does looks vintage, doesn't it? l see a paper clip hanging out the back.
There it is, right there.
That's wonderful, l can't wait to get in that.
Thanks. l appreciate it.
Alright, man, we'll see you later.
Have a good day.
- You, too.
- OK. lt's sorted in two different crates:
Alabama through Montana and then Nebraska through
Wyoming.
Foreign mail is all held in a separate crate.
They take every letter out.
They empty the paper clips out.
Once you get it sorted, then you sort it again by individual states.
And then they will grab a bundle, go pull the log where they hand-record every address.
And they love the stamps.
They'll scrape the stamps off the envelopes and keep them, because they come from Spain and
Germany and New Zealand and
England.
Every piece of paper, regardless of size, is kept. lt is put in a plastic sleeve and stored in a notebook.
We are averaging filling up a three-inch binder every two days.
There was a time when we were just flooded with paper clips, and l began l to think, ''My word, what have l unleashed here?'' You know? lt's like you're in a flood and you're trying to stop it, and yet you don't want it to stop, because coming with the flood are all these important lessons. lt's in German.
They're all addressed to ''Anne.''
This is Anne Frank.
This is awesome.
They've written little things to Anne Frank.
Somebody is interested enough in what we're doing to take this kind of time. l think it's amazing enough that they even know about it.
You know?
There are people in Chattanooga, Tennessee who don't know where Whitwell, Tennessee is.
- That's absolutely true.
- That's true!
Most people are good, you know, like Anne Frank said in her diary.
You know, people at heart are good.
And when they see something like this happening that is good, they want to be a part of it.
You know, the majority of people want to see things get better and they want to see children in a good light instead of in a bad light.
This class in Germany has gotten a suitcase, and they have packed it with messages.
Basically, they're all kind of asking for forgiveness from Anne Frank.
Now, l think everybody in here has either seen or readiThe iDiary of Anne Frank.
The gist of most of the messages is what this translation says:
''Dear Anne: You were brave and courageous.
''l think it is not good what Hitler did to the Jews.
Regardless of who we are or what we are, people are people.'' l believe people from the North and the West, l believe when they look at children in the South, they think,
''Dumb little redneck children.''
They're stereotyped, and that's what we're trying to teach in this project.
You can't stereotype anyone, because you yourself are stereotyped. l am stereotyped, because l live in the South.
And, you know, l look at people that live in the North, and l have a bad habit of doing it, l stereotype them... and that's what we're trying to do, is break those stereotypes.
Listen to this letter.
''Shalom. l read on the lnternet about your assignment
''and was very moved by the idea of collecting 6 million paper clips
''in the memory of the 6 million.
''l look forward to seeing pictures of the completed project.
''The attached paper clip is in memory of a friend of my grandfather whose name is forgotten and grave unknown.'' l think that it's beautiful that they don't know his name and they don't know where his grave is, and--but l think it's good that they're sending a paper clip in remembrance of him.
Reading the letters, it's like you get to know people that aren't here anymore.
And l'm thinking about all the people, one by one, that they each had families and they each were brothers or sisters, and they were daughters and sons. l think for our children it was like an ice water bath when the letters began to come.
As one of the kids said to me,
''Do you realize that there are people in this world who never knew their grandparents?'' l don't think it had ever occurred to them that there were people in this world who had nobody to care about them and who didn't have families.
''Dear Students: l am a daughter of two Holocaust survivors.
''l am so proud of what you're doing
''in memory of all who perished during the Holocaust.
''My parents, Kalmon and Louisa
Gluck, survived many horrors
''during their internment under the Nazi regime.
''Many members of both my mother's and father's families died at the camps.
''l have enclosed 14 paper clips for four grandparents, a brother,
''seven aunts and uncles, and two cousins.
''l wish you the best of luck on your wonderful project.
Sincerely, Mrs. Sheila Gluck
Levine.'' l grew up a child who had no grandparents when others had them.
All l wanted was people. l wanted them, and l never had them. ln front of me, l have a prayer book that my father took through the camps with him. lt was given to him by a man who was being gassed, and the man asked him, if he survived the camps, that he should take it with him.
And this is something that has survived since my father was liberated in 1945 and has been in our family.
When my father passed away, everyone got to feel where my father held this prayer book and how tightly it must have been held. l thank you so much for giving another way to say,
''l remember him, l remember my mother,
''the times in the camps, and l also remember those we lost.''
Thank you.
Comes along the Spring of 2001 , the ''Greater Five Towns''
Holocaust
Survivor Group in New York called us and it seems that somehow they'd heard about the project.
And they wanted to know if they could come to Whitwell and share their survivor stories with our children.
And the evening before they spoke to the children at the school, they were invited to the First United Methodist
Church for the whole town to meet them.
They don't know what Whitwell is, and, you know, they're coming from this huge urban area and they're a little self-conscious or nervous about it.
You don't need to be nervous here.
We're just home folk.
And we're just glad to have them here.
My name is Joe. l'm a survivor. l was in Auschwitz for three years. l've got a number, the number is 1 -24-105.
And l'm glad that l can come and talk to you nice people.
Thank you. l want to remind our members here that our guests should be the first ones to go through the line tonight, and let's have a moment of blessing together.
Our Father, we thank you especially for our guests this evening.
We ask your special special blessings on this food...
Good evening.
Wherever hatred and prejudice will, it will find a wedge and a way into our lives.
But because of what these young people are doing, we are understanding that there is another way, and that is the way of love, and we can reach out and embrace all people.
First thing l want to say, l wish the whole world was like you are. l was born in Poland.
My name is Bernard lgielski.
When the first survivor came, l think, is when it really hit home what we were teaching.
We as Jews were singled out, put in a ghetto, had to wear a star...
And they spoke and gave us a real-life face to a story. l said when l stood in Auschwitz and l've seen that big chimney smoking day and night...
And we didn't really understand until that point that what we were teaching, you know, wasn't just book learning. lt was-- this had actually happened, and this person lived through it.
And instead of being afraid, shielding your children, prepare, prepare them for the real world.
Yes, there are not nice things out there, but if they will be prepared, they will be able to do the right thing.
Thank you.
Future generations will have to learn about the Holocaust from the textbooks.
We are the eye witnesses that can, to a certain degree, tell you what took place. l was born in a small town in
Poland.
The one who stood out for me was Sam.
He was like a grandfather, a great-grandfather.
He just, when he-- he'd look at you, and he'd just make you feel all warm and loving inside toward him. l was with my brother.
My brother was three years older than l am.
But l had no idea...
When they first arrived to
Auschwitz,
Sam and his brother and his mother and his little brother met up with the Doctor Mengele.
He was the one who chose left or right.
And he sent his mother and little brother left, and he sent Sam and his brother right.
And so Sam did not know what had happened.
And after they had went through the showers,
Sam found a guard and asked him.
And l asked him, l said, ''Please tell me. We arrived last night,
''and l arrived with my mother and my brother.
''Where are they?
What happened to them?''
And that man shows me smoke coming out from a chimney. l did not understand what that means... until l found out that that chimney's from a crematorium. l was thinking what it would have been like if that was me in his place and my family and my brothers and my mom, and l was just thinking how horrible that would have been.
And l'll never know what he went through.
And l only pray to God that my brother should not have been sent to such a place, because he would not survive.
To actually see someone who had been through the things that l read about, that was really hard.
But-- l just, as a mother, l kept trying to imagine what that would be like, to have my kids taken away from me like that or, l mean, just not to know where they were. l think that struck me about as hard as anything. l will tell you one thing.
Everyone survivor got a story.
There's not enough paper in the whole world, and not enough pens to write down what these survivors went through.
Thank you.
This is a loving community.
And l look at it as, l mean, there's no place in the world that this would have been any more appropriate to start... because this Holocaust project is a project about love... and tolerance... and what better place to start than Whitwell, Tennessee?
Please stand for the National
Anthem. l pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
This is our monument of shoes. lt commemorates the Jews that are in some of the death camps.
The morning after the survivors spoke at the First United Methodist
Church, they came to our school because they wanted to see first-hand what the children were doing with this project and have a special time with these students. lt is important to me to tell these stories, because there are people in the world which are denying that it ever took place. ln order to annihilate us and erase any trace of whatever happened, at least that was their intentions, we were put on a dead march and usually we marched during the night, mostly, so we wouldn't be visible to the general public.
Most of us didn't make it.
The Americans, they showed themselves on the horizon, and l ran out of camp, and l was hiding, so l spent the night over there and l wouldn't dare go out, and l waited until the next day. l had to risk it, and l went out.
The Americans were there.
And l was a free person to do what l...
But l'm still here.
That's the main thing. l want you all to know, l came here to the United States in 1948, and l've been the happiest ever. l want you to know happiness makes me cry more than anything else. l never have thought about it this way before, but after l heard his speech and how emotional he got, it really touched me. l just can't imagine just one day being at home and the next day being shipped off to a concentration camp and being tortured like that. lt just makes no sense why people in the world let that happen. lt made me realize, the next time l say the Pledge of Allegiance, l'm going to think of how glad l am that it's a free country and l had the right to do what l feel and say what l say and l just-- being much more respectful to it.
When l was finished, l was-- they embraced me and hugged me and kissed me.
They couldn't-- and they never heard these, so some of them cried, even.
Because they never heard stories like this here, and they were never in contact with people that experienced it.
To me, they're my heroes, because they've been through everything. l'm going to take what they've told me and pass it down with my kids to their grandchildren and so on, and to my friends and my family, where they will always remember that this horrible thing happened, and hopefully they can prevent it from ever happening again.
They're learning from what we're teaching, and they're teaching others.
And that's the whole point of this project, to teach their children and their grandchildren and their great-grandchildren.
Growing up in the South, growing up in rural Tennessee, as l have, l've been exposed to a lot of racial remarks.
You know, my dad is the greatest man on earth.
And l have no doubt of that.
But he has a bias, and he can make racial slurs, and it's not anything against him.
Going into college, l had an African-American roommate and loved him like a brother and still do.
But it was nothing for me to-- even sometimes in his presence, say racial slurs or-- and l look back now, and l-- l hope that it didn't, l guess-- l hope it didn't hurt him.
This is one of your favorites, isn't it, Cody? lt's your favorite, too.
Yeah, it is, and it was one of my favorites when l was little.
And now, this project, l see things like that.
''Hit the ball,'' said Danny.
''Hit a homerun,'' said the dinosaur. lt makes me, you know, very aware.
And l make sure, with two small sons, that l don't say it. l don't want them to grow up and say that, and say, ''Well, my father said this,'' because that would... that would be the worst thing they could say.
Good night.
See you boys in the morning, OK?
Say your prayers before you go to sleep.
By the time the survivors visited us, we had more than four times the number of paper clips that we originally set out to collect.
There was not a place in this school, not even the broom closet, that wasn't just flooded with paper clips.
And we were at dinner one night with the Schroeders, and conversation was just flowing, and Linda, just in between bites, said...
''You know what l really wish we could have?
''l wish that we could have an authentic German railcar of the period to house our paper clips as a permanent memorial.''
And conversation just stopped.
And we all kind of looked at each other and thought, ''Oh, a railcar.
Oh, we have to have a railcar.''
And the Schroeders were like, ''This is the idea.
''We will find a railcar.
We promise you, we will find a railcar.'' l think when the decision was made to get the railcar and the Schroeders jumped in and volunteered to find one, l really don't think they knew what they were getting into.
Oh my God, we wrote to everyone and his brother and asked him,
''Do you know where a cattle car like this is?''
And everyone and his brother wrote us back,
''There are no such things.''
And then we decided to look for it ourselves.
And we went on a detective tour.
We drove 3,000 miles criss-cross through Germany and went to every railyard we can imagine.
And, kaboom, we found one.
This car has a long history. lt was built in 191 7... then, in 1933, Nazism came... and then it transported victims to concentration camps... and then it went on another journey... and the journey was from north of Berlin, from the railroad museum, to the German port of Cuxhaven.
Well, the Schroeders called us one day at school and said that they were successful in finding a car.
And they said it would be a short time that they would ship the car from Germany to the United
States, to the port of Baltimore.
Come on in, we've got chairs.
At 10:00 a.m. on November the
9th, we hope to dedicate this railcar.
When we got to a certain point in establishing this memorial, we realized we needed lots and lots of help, so we said, ''OK, we're going to have a community meeting.''
Right now we have on this property
27 plus million paper clips.
We've got to have help.
We've got to have a parking committee.
We have to have a landscaping committee. lt's got to look pretty around it now.
We also have to figure out how to get the paper clips in there.
You know, you're talking about
22 metric tons, you know. l have a hard time visualizing my fat self, much less 22 metric tons. OK.
Now, we'll type these committees up.
We'll send all of you darlings a copy, so don't you leave here until we get your address. lf you want to see where it's going, come out here and l'll show you.
We had children from all the previous groups show up and they brought their parents with them, and they saw that other people in the community came, people they knew would be working to get this thing going.
This community is going to have a piece of living history like no other communities have.
No large urban areas, nobody else has a piece of history like we're going to have here.
The car will sit approximately halfway between this point...
Sometimes when l think about this project, l think, ''Who is really in charge of this project?''
...cannot be closer than 20 feet to that wall.
People who are interested in this project will call me up and say,
''What's your plan?''
Well, l've never had a plan.
What do we know about building a memorial?
What do l know about getting a railcar from Germany? l think that there's a far greater power than the people at Whitwell
Middle School in charge of this project.
And, if not, you tell me how we got this far. l said, ''God created the world in less than seven days,'' and someone said, ''Yes, and he didn't have Linda Hooper helping him.''
You have certain feelings when you see a car like this, and you can't help but remember what happened in this car
Our work is done, l think.
We brought the car over, and that's it.
You think so? l don't think so.
- l hope so.
- l don't think so. lt will stay with us forever.
That's possible.
We thought, ''We have seen this cattle car now numerous times.
''We know this cattle car. lt can't do anything to us.''
Then you realize what this car actually means.
This car transported people to concentration camps.
They put in 80, 90, 1 10 people.
They suffocated in these cattle cars, and one quarter of every victim-- of all the victims were children.
Now it is here in Baltimore, and then it goes down to
Chattanooga and to Whitwell... but this will be the end of this car's journey.
This car will not transport people anymore.
This car will be a symbol.
Symbols make us think.
Symbols can change the world.
And sometimes symbols are all we have to help us maintain our resolve... even on our darkest and our most tragic days.
The sun came up on Monday morn
The world was all in flames lt's all a mortal man can do
To make it right again
Swing and turn, Jubilee
Live and learn, Jubilee
The time has come to travel on l made my way alone
Souls will mend at journey's end
This road will take me home
Swing and turn, Jubilee
Live and learn, Jubilee
Swing and turn, Jubilee
Live and learn, Jubilee
When l first saw the car, it moved me almost to tears.
That's the reason l went up and laid my hands on the car to start with.
To sort of, you know, in my mind go over what's happened with this car and what it's meant to history, and what it means to me personally.
And then when it came here and l got to look inside it, it just-- you know, it killed me. lt's unbelievable the thoughts that go through your head. l was one of the first to actually stand in the railcar.
The floor was sort of rotten, and you had to watch where you stepped.
But just the thought of 100 people fitting in that small area is just, it's heartbreaking.
And Miss Hooper got up there with me, and she just burst into tears.
When people began to climb into the railcar, l just-- l couldn't handle that... because to me it had a life of its own, and l have never been in that car yet that l don't hear those voices... and feel that pain. lt survived in the face of overwhelming odds, and now it's come home.
Cassie and l were standing in the car today, and we kind of had our hands on the car.
And she said, ''What would it tell us if it could talk?'' l said, ''Cassie, it would tell us you're paying homage to people
''who suffered simply because of the way they believed, and because of hatred and ignorance.''
This is all about not only mourning their loss, but celebrating their life.
What l did think that day is,
''From now on, you will not be an instrument of pain.
''Your history as a death car is erased...
''and now you are a car of new life...
''and you're going to stand here, and you're going to say,
'Thereiis[/l] good in this world.'''
From now until November 9th, it will be a work in progress. lt's hard for me to understand the enormity of this project, of how many people know about it, you know, how far this project has reached.
Behind each side there will be
5 ½ million paper clips.
And l look at these people that are right here today, and they're as excited about this as l am.
We're doing it on a volunteer basis and... just for the town and for the people.
The whole community is involved in it, and what little bit we can contribute, why, l'm glad to do so.
The idea for the butterfly came when Miss Hooper told me that a young person from Poland had written a poem and he lived in a ghetto.
And he said in the poem, ''l may never live to see another butterfly.''
Butterflies are a symbol of freedom... and they are a symbol of this project.
When you think about all the people that died, l'm honoring those people with these butterflies... more or less honoring them with wings... so they can fly.
Once we received all of the paper clips or the paper clips slowed to a very manageable amount, we were well over
29 million paper clips.
So, when it came time to load the railcar with the paper clips, the children were extremely selective.
We'll just start here.
Alison, 4500...
They wanted to be sure that gifts from as many people as possible would go into the memorial.
So they took paper clips from lots of different donations.
We decided that we should put a total of
1 1 million paper clips into the car...
That's good.
...six million to represent the Jewish people who were murdered and five million representing the homosexuals, the gypsies, and the Jehovah's Witnesses and all the other people known to have been killed by Hitler's regime.
This project had been the focus of my life for four years. l was Miss Roberts, the Paper Clip Lady.
But l can look at this child or this child, and if that one child's life was changed, then it was worth it. l think when you look at these paper clips, the purpose of it is to remember those lives that were exterminated during the Holocaust. lt just overwhelms you.
What if those people had not been exterminated?
Who was destroyed there?
Was it another wonderful teacher?
Was it an artist?
And l think of all the grandchildren that never came to be, all the children that never came to be.
''What a wonderful way to remember the 6 million souls that perished
''in Nazi death camps during World War ll.
''This especially touches me, because 51 years ago,
''about two weeks after the war in Europe ended,
''l flew in as part of a rescue team
''to bring food, medicine, medical assistance to the then recently-liberated
Mauthausen death camp near
Lintz, Austria.''
As we went by the medical center, l believe that this young lady saw the mezuzah l was wearing.
She was very emaciated. l would say she was probably
20 years old, my age at the time, but l do remember to this day her very, very large, beautiful brown eyes who looked probably more beautiful because her face was so thin, and she said to me in Yiddish...
...which means 'Are you Jewish?' which l am, and she took my hands, clasped them and kissed them.
As weak as she was holding my hand, l felt that it became weaker, and then we had to move on.
And then it was time to leave.
And l went by the medical building, and l asked how the young lady was.
That's when they told me her name was Malka, and they said,
''She died shortly after you left.''
And l had not mentioned this to anyone, even my wife and my children didn't know that story. l had great difficulty. l actually broke down and cried, and l don't cry easily, but that was the first time since it happened that l let it out of me.
The letter was so much of a closure for me.
Because Malka has found a resting place, a final resting place, not in Austria, not in Germany, not in Poland, but Appalachia Tennessee.
And l can't get over that. lt's giving her a resting place among young people who love her and have compassion for her... and you couldn't ask for a better resting place than that.
And... this one represents Malka, the lady at Mauthausen.
And we're going to treat these paper clips like the children have said-- one of them said to me,
''Ms. Hooper, when you touch these...
...can you feel the souls?''
Well, yes, you can feel the souls, because most of them came with a letter that told you about the soul that paper clip represented.
And, you know, if we accomplish nothing else, we have helped these people find a resting place for something that was important to them.
So she had never displayed, never done any sculpture before.
They're great.
They are great.
Oh, my God.
My God. lt's good. lt's really good. lt's really good.
Now that l've had these kids and spent all these hours with them, l see that they have a lot of input to give, and that l was very, very quick to judge. l listen to what they say, and l value their input. lt's a gift to me. lt's a gift to my children.
Because it's made me a better dad, better father, better teacher, better man.
Good morning. l am so grateful to live in the United States of America. l have such joy for all the love and the work that has gone into this project, and l have such pride that l live in a community where a group of very ordinary people could bring to reality such an extraordinary event.
My heart is absolutely filled and overflowing with joy and pride. l love this community, and l love these children in this school.
There are so many people here today that deserve a hug.
To each one of you, we say thank you for giving your time and your talents. l also would like to recognize
David Smith and Sandra Roberts.
Get up, guys. l have learned more from this project than l ever could have taught. lt has very slowly become not about me.
And our Holocaust students.
Stand up. lt's about, what will the students gain from this, what will they learn, and what will they take from this into their future lives?
You will come at one time in your life, and believe me, this point will come.
You come to a point where you think everything goes wrong, nothing-- nobody loves you, you are lost or you might be a failure, and then please come back to your memorial.
This is what you did and accomplished.
Come to this place, and it will uplift you, and l hope then you will try again.
And l'm pretty sure that you will succeed again.
Whitwell is a place that brings out the best of all of us.
Thank you for that, and we love you.
''When the living say this prayer, they remember the dead.
''ln remembering the dead,
''we remember the values that they have taught us.
''The students from the Davis
Academy in Atlanta, Georgia, will now lead us in the
Kaddish.''
We will not forget you
Don't let the memory disappear
Don't let the memory disappear
The job of collecting paper clips is over, but the job of educating others will never be over.
And l think our job now is to give tours of the railcar and to branch off into other schools and teach our lessons of the Holocaust.
They would stand at roll call between 5 and 6 hours to count how many people were there.
When we have field trips and the teachers say, ''What do we need to do?'' and l say, ''Nothing.''
You might want to take your group out to the railcar and walk them out there.
And l say, ''You're not a teacher today, you're just an observer.
These children will teach.''
And they teach.
How many people was actually here during the Holocaust?
80 to 100 people.
The Norwegians wore paper clips like we're doing now?
On their collars.
''My dear friends from Whitwell: words can only inadequately describe
''what your extraordinary project means to me,
''a Holocaust survivor and teacher.
''l witnessed what intolerance and indifference can lead to.
''ln a short while, l will be 95 years of age.
''l am thankful that late in life
''l can see and hear that the teaching of tolerance
''is still alive and well and bears fruit.
''When l heard about your project, l cried.
''l cried because you are the testament that a new age has dawned,
''the age of responsibility
''and the age of kindness of the heart.
''You are living proof that each and every one of us
''can make a difference and do his part to shape a better world.
''When you ask the young and innocent, they will do the right thing.
''With tears in my eyes, l bow my head before you.
''Shalom.
Lena L. Gitter.'' l just can't wait until l get to college and they ask me if you've ever had a life-changing moment.
The first thing that's going to come out of my mouth is going to be the Whitwell Middle School
Holocaust project. l just cannot wait until that moment happens. ln the future, when l do come back and see it, knowing that l was here to do this, it will be like, not just a memory, but kind of in your heart to know that you've changed the way people think about other people.
To think that us, people from Whitwell, Tennessee, if we have made such a big difference, think what the rest of the world could do if they tried.
Not only did we educate other people about the Holocaust, but we educated ourselves.
We'll never look at a paper clip the same way again.

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Eveyday that I stepped on the basketball court,
   <SYNC START=116909>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=116909>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>even though I was on top of the world,
   <SYNC START=120106>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=120106>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I felt like I had something to prove.
   <SYNC START=124439>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=138422>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I wanna be like Mike<br>/ I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike

   <SYNC START=146214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=146214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Yes, I do<br>/ I wanna be I wanna be like Mike
   <SYNC START=150443>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=150443>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Oh, oh-oh, ohh, yeah<br>/ I wanna be I wanna be like Mike
   <SYNC START=154473>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=154473>

   <SYNC START=159335>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=159335>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You got to be like Mike
   <SYNC START=161732>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=161732>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Be like Mike

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=163730>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You gotta be like Mike

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=167927>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You gotta be like Mike

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=169958>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Be like Mike
   <SYNC START=172547>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=188141>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>After Michael Jordan's final season,
   <SYNC START=190672>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=190672>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the N.B.A. gave him yet another<br>Most Valuable Player Award,
   <SYNC START=194334>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=194334>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and said the reason is simple.
   <SYNC START=196133>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=196133>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"After 13 seasons,<br>you still go out evey night...
   <SYNC START=200263>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=200263>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and play like Michael Jordan.
   <SYNC START=202193>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=208587>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When Jordan would go out<br>for the spotlight introduction,
   <SYNC START=211218>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=211218>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>he would look up into the stands<br>and he would realize...
   <SYNC START=213816>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=213816>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that there was at least<br>someone up there that night...
   <SYNC START=216547>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=216547>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>who had never seen him before,<br>who would never see him again.
   <SYNC START=219377>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=219377>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And this would be the one<br>Michael Jordan moment...
   <SYNC START=223473>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=223473>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>they ever had.
   <SYNC START=225105>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=225105>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he would say he was playing<br>for those people there.
   <SYNC START=228091>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=230434>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>We had a six-game road trip,<br>three cities in four nights.
   <SYNC START=231832>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=231832>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michae I had had some spasms<br>in this lower back.
   <SYNC START=234929>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=234929>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And we literally had to, you know...
   <SYNC START=236461>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=236461>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>carr him off the bus,<br>off the plane to the bus...
   <SYNC START=239824>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=239824>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>from the bus to the hotel.
   <SYNC START=243621>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=243621>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You know, it amazed me...
   <SYNC START=245818>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=245818>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He went out<br>and got 40 points that night.
   <SYNC START=247916>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=247916>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>This is the kind of player he was.<br>He wanted eveybody...
   <SYNC START=250148>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=250148>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to see his special skill.
   <SYNC START=251946>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=251946>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he didn't want people<br>that loved basketball...
   <SYNC START=254177>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=254177>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>not to have that opporunity.
   <SYNC START=256142>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=256142>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When the playoffs began,
   <SYNC START=257841>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=257841>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>in his hear Michael already knew...
   <SYNC START=259972>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=259972>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that these would be his last games.
   <SYNC START=262037>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=262037>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But this would be<br>no nostalgic farewell tour.
   <SYNC START=265134>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=265134>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He was determined to go out<br>on his own terms...
   <SYNC START=268697>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=268697>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>as a champion.
   <SYNC START=270059>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=276455>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The Bulls' first-round opponents<br>were the New Jersey Nets...
   <SYNC START=279886>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=279886>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>young and full of hope.
   <SYNC START=282450>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=282450>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michae I was dominant.
   <SYNC START=285311>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=296403>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It was a three-game sweep,
   <SYNC START=298035>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=298035>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>built on mental toughness<br>as much as physical talent.
   <SYNC START=301498>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=301498>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And for Michael,<br>the way to develop the mind...
   <SYNC START=304329>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=304329>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>had always been through the hear.
   <SYNC START=306225>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=308225>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>A lot of parents ask me,
   <SYNC START=310524>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=310524>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"Well, what advice<br>would you give my kids?"
   <SYNC START=313154>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=313154>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And my advice would be<br>let them just enjoy the game.
   <SYNC START=316413>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=325076>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think what they have to learn<br>more about at that young age...
   <SYNC START=329205>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=329205>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>is their love for the game.
   <SYNC START=331137>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=331137>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And once they've developed that,<br>then the mental par is easy.
   <SYNC START=337287>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=346322>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I didn't really get instruction...
   <SYNC START=347954>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=347954>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>until I was a junior in high school.
   <SYNC START=351184>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=351184>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>First, I just loved the game<br>and I let my skills develop.
   <SYNC START=354510>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=359809>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>So I believe in learning late...
   <SYNC START=362973>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=362973>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>playing early, but learning late.
   <SYNC START=365028>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=367402>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael's love of the game was born...
   <SYNC START=369667>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=369667>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>in his hometown of Wilmington, North Carolina.
   <SYNC START=372031>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=372031>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>during long afternoons on the play grounds.
   <SYNC START=374494>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=377093>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>His older brother, Lary,<br>helped Michael hone his game...
   <SYNC START=379557>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=379557>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>in their epic battles of one-on-one<br>at their backyard hoop.
   <SYNC START=382654>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=382654>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But Michael's first hard lesson would come...
   <SYNC START=384919>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=384919>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>when he tried out for the<br>varsity team at Laney High.
   <SYNC START=387849>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=387849>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When I was a sophomore in high school...
   <SYNC START=390547>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=390547>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>like most high school kids...
   <SYNC START=393510>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=393510>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>you get all the energy and all<br>the motivation and excitement...
   <SYNC START=397707>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=397707>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>of making your varsity team,<br>which is a big thing.
   <SYNC START=401203>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=401203>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Status is a lot when you're in high school.
   <SYNC START=404866>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=404866>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>So you can imagine<br>the disappointment that I got...
   <SYNC START=407530>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=407530>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>when I felt like<br>I should have made the team.
   <SYNC START=410028>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=410028>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but then didn't make the team.
   <SYNC START=412060>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=412060>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I'm cying,<br>I lost my emotions totally.
   <SYNC START=414856>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=414856>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>My mother came to me<br>and said,"Use that energy...
   <SYNC START=418253>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=418253>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"to prove to the coach and to your peers<br>and your classmates...
   <SYNC START=424148>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=424148>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that they made a mistake."
   <SYNC START=425680>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=425680>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You give it your best.
   <SYNC START=427844>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=427844>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You try so hard and you get to the point,
   <SYNC START=430175>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=430175>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"I know I can do it"
   <SYNC START=431640>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=431640>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And if you try one more time,<br>you are able to achieve it.
   <SYNC START=434737>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=434737>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It's going<br>one step farther.
   <SYNC START=436835>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=436835>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>That's not giving up,<br>it's giving your best.
   <SYNC START=439166>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=439166>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>lonly will walk away...
   <SYNC START=441398>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=441398>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>when I know I do not have<br>anything else to give.
   <SYNC START=444794>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=444794>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The disappointment<br>was so deep, like a cut,
   <SYNC START=448457>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=448457>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>it struck the fire in me.
   <SYNC START=450023>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=450023>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to make sure that I never endure<br>that type of pain again.
   <SYNC START=453753>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=453753>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>In these condround<br>of the playoffs...
   <SYNC START=457715>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=457715>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael returned home<br>with a vengeance.
   <SYNC START=460144>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=461579>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Playing the Charlotte Hornets,
   <SYNC START=463443>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=463443>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It would be Michael's last professional appearance<br>in North Carolina.
   <SYNC START=466735>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=468206>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It's always been a treat to come back home...
   <SYNC START=470204>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=470204>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>when you've grown up here and you go out<br>and become a man on your own.
   <SYNC START=473966>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=473966>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And then come back home to show<br>what's evolved of that person.
   <SYNC START=477157>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=490317>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>For fans who had watched him since his days<br>as a Carolina schoolboy,
   <SYNC START=494480>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=494480>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>what emerged now was not just<br>the skill but the will power.
   <SYNC START=499408>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=499408>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Those who remembered his raw potential...
   <SYNC START=502806>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=502806>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>now saw the results<br>of a lifetime of hard work.
   <SYNC START=507101>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=507101>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He would go to J.V. practice and practice,
   <SYNC START=509232>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=509232>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and then he'd go to varsity practice.
   <SYNC START=511031>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=511031>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>We'd play<br>ball games, and after<br>the games were over,
   <SYNC START=514028>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=514028>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>he'd run what we called "suicides"<br>or line drills...
   <SYNC START=515826>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=515826>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>he'd run those by himself.
   <SYNC START=519289>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=519289>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I just maveled<br>at his work habits even then.
   <SYNC START=522287>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=522287>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>With his competitiveness<br>to go with all that dedication,
   <SYNC START=527415>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=527415>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>you know, it was something to see.
   <SYNC START=531445>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=531445>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The weakest par of Michael's game on the offensive end...<br>was his shooting.
   <SYNC START=536373>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=536373>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>So he obviously mastered something...
   <SYNC START=538471>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=538471>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that eveybody said he couldn't<br>do when he came out of college.
   <SYNC START=542001>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=542001>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he didn't by shooting<br>and shooting and shooting...

   <SYNC START=546530>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=546530>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The other thing that people told him...
   <SYNC START=548296>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=548296>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that he wasn't a really good defensive player.
   <SYNC START=550560>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=550560>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he founda way...
   <SYNC START=552158>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=552158>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>not only to become a great defensive player...
   <SYNC START=554822>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=554822>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but the best defensive player in the N.B.A.
   <SYNC START=557487>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=557487>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>This guy said, "Those are my weaknesses.
   <SYNC START=560551>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=560551>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I'm going to figure out how to make those my strengths."<br>And he didn't.
   <SYNC START=564445>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=565845>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I got a glimpse,<br>really, of Michael Jordan...
   <SYNC START=568110>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=568110>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and what he was all about the<br>first time lever coached him.
   <SYNC START=571140>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=571140>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>About two minutes to go in<br>the game, I called a time-out.
   <SYNC START=574004>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=574004>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And we were down two... it was<br>right there in the balance.
   <SYNC START=577901>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=577901>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And I had some<br>little powder on my mouth...
   <SYNC START=580531>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=580531>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>from where I chewed some gum<br>and chewed it so hard...
   <SYNC START=582896>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=582896>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that it really had become powder.
   <SYNC START=584394>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=584394>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And Michael grabbed a cup of<br>water and he handed it to me,
   <SYNC START=586958>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=586958>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and he said, "Take a drink of this water.
   <SYNC START=588823>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=588823>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"Clear that stuff off your mouth.
   <SYNC START=590288>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=590288>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I'm not going to let you<br>lose your first game."
   <SYNC START=592419>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=592419>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The level of faith that<br>I have in anything in life...

   <SYNC START=598281>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=598281>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It is a trait<br>that I would never<br>trade anything for.
   <SYNC START=601378>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=601378>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And if I can<br>ever pass anything<br>on to my kids...
   <SYNC START=604908>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=604908>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>it would be<br>to be optimistic<br>about everthing in life.
   <SYNC START=609036>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=609036>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He was only a freshman at the<br>University of North Carolina,
   <SYNC START=613132>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=613132>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but with the 1982 N.C.A.A.<br>Championship at stake,
   <SYNC START=616064>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=616064>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>his team's fate was in his<br>hands, And he never hesitated.
   <SYNC START=619356>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=620992>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Goes back to Michael Jordan,<br>jumper from out on the lef!

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=629817>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>After I hit the shot,<br>my father came to me and said...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=633113>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>this was the start<br>of something big.

   <SYNC START=638175>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=638175>

   <SYNC START=679536>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=679536>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael came along<br>at a time...
   <SYNC START=681834>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=681834>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>when globalization<br>really was occurring...
   <SYNC START=685130>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=685130>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and an explosion<br>in media was occurring.
   <SYNC START=687628>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=687628>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he helped drive<br>that explosion.
   <SYNC START=689859>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=689859>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Yo, Mike,<br>what makes you...
   <SYNC START=690992>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=690992>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the best player<br>in the universe?
   <SYNC START=692457>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=692457>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Is it the haircut?
   <SYNC START=693456>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=693456>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>No, Mars.
   <SYNC START=694455>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=694455>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Is it the shoes?
   <SYNC START=696087>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=696087>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>There have been so many things<br>that he has popularized.
   <SYNC START=698051>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=698051>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the shorts, the shoes...<br>"Must be the shoes."
   <SYNC START=701782>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=701782>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Money, it's got to be<br>the shoes! Shoes! Shoes!
   <SYNC START=704612>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=704612>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think Michael<br>has transcended<br>ever boundar...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=706710>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>of gender and race<br>and age and sport.
   <SYNC START=709940>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=709940>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think he's becomes or of<br>apart of our eveyday culture.
   <SYNC START=712438>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=712438>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Like Mike<br>if I could be like Mike

   <SYNC START=719598>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Oh, be like Mike
   <SYNC START=721062>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=724227>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I've missed more than 9,000<br>shots in my career...
   <SYNC START=727324>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=727324>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think what made him<br>so specialas a marketing icon...
   <SYNC START=729954>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=729954>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>is that he was natural.
   <SYNC START=731985>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=731985>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Today, when eveyone<br>really tries to be like Mike,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=735449>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>they're tying so hard<br>to invent a personal,
   <SYNC START=738080>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=738080>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think that people<br>see through that...
   <SYNC START=739644>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=739644>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and it doesn't stand<br>the test of time.
   <SYNC START=741343>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=741343>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I've failed over and over<br>and over again in my life,
   <SYNC START=745396>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=747404>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and that is why I succeed.

   <SYNC START=755796>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=755796>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>as we move to the<br>Eastern Conference Finals...
   <SYNC START=758027>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=758027>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the Bulls<br>and the Indiana Pacers.
   <SYNC START=759726>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=759726>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>These two teams were two and two<br>in the regular season.
   <SYNC START=762622>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=762622>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But the rival really begins on<br>a Sunday afternoon in Chicago...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=767218>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Miller and Jordan<br>and a cast of characters...

   <SYNC START=772547>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=772547>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>There's Michael, slips and falls<br>down, gets back up into the lane,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The Indiana Pacers...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=782004>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>with their outside shooting<br>and the physical play...
   <SYNC START=785301>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=785301>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>were a team custom-built<br>to defeat Michael and the Bulls.
   <SYNC START=789229>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=797955>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>In the first two games<br>of the series...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=803284>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>it was clear<br>that the Pacers would pose...

   <SYNC START=805648>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>their first real test.

   <SYNC START=845677>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=845677>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>On their home court, the Pacers<br>would win game three...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=849240>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>behind their tireless guard,<br>Reggie Miller.

   <SYNC START=918767>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=921370>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Led by future Hall of Famers<br>Karl Malone and John Stockton,
   <SYNC START=924768>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=924768>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the Jazz dominated<br>the Western Conference playoffs...
   <SYNC START=927997>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=927997>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and would have<br>ten days' rest...
   <SYNC START=929962>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=929962>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>while the Bulls and Pacers<br>continued to battle in the East.
   <SYNC START=933823>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=936056>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The Bulls lost another game,
   <SYNC START=937988>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=937988>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and would have to go<br>the full seven in a series...
   <SYNC START=940919>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=940919>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>for the first time in years.
   <SYNC START=942716>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=942716>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>By the end of game six,<br>doubters were saying...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=945514>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that Michae I was finally<br>running on empty.

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=948212>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Bulls trail by two.
   <SYNC START=950576>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=950576>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Here we go.
   <SYNC START=951742>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=951742>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>M.J. one-on-one with McKey.
   <SYNC START=953673>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=953673>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael a drive,<br>tripped off his feet,
   <SYNC START=955804>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=955804>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and McKey stole the ball,<br>and that's going to do it.
   <SYNC START=958393>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=959867>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>That will do it.
   <SYNC START=960866>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=960866>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Indiana's going to win it.
   <SYNC START=962298>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=962298>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He may have been<br>devastated that night,
   <SYNC START=964329>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=964329>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and I assume he was, but<br>he had the ability to believe...
   <SYNC START=966827>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=966827>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that we were going to win<br>And he was going to do well.
   <SYNC START=969313>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=970756>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Probably one of the<br>most remarkable shots...
   <SYNC START=972488>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=972488>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that eveybody remembers is the<br>shot he made against Cleveland.
   <SYNC START=975951>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=975951>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The in-bounds pass<br>comes in to Jordan.
   <SYNC START=977883>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=977883>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Here's Michael<br>at the foul line.
   <SYNC START=979215>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=979215>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>A shot on Ehlo.
   <SYNC START=980214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=980214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Good!
   <SYNC START=980881>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=980881>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The Bulls win!

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>They win it!
   <SYNC START=983811>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=983811>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But they don't remember...
   <SYNC START=985276>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=985276>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that the night before, he missed<br>three out of six foul shots...
   <SYNC START=986841>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=986841>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that would have sealed<br>the game for us,
   <SYNC START=989472>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=989472>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and we wouldn't have had<br>to go to the fifth game.
   <SYNC START=992969>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=992969>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>A normal player would have said,<br>"Oh, I cost us this opportunity"
   <SYNC START=996298>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=996298>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and probably beat<br>themselves up over it.
   <SYNC START=998330>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=998330>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael, the next<br>day that we played<br>Cleveland...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1000595>

   <SYNC START=1005224>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1005224>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>If we sit here and worry<br>about what people think of us,
   <SYNC START=1008087>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1008087>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>then we don't<br>have a chance.
   <SYNC START=1009220>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1009220>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>They still got to come<br>through Chicago.
   <SYNC START=1010818>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1010818>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Utah, Indiana, they still<br>got to come through Chicago.
   <SYNC START=1014015>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1014015>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I don't care what happens today,
   <SYNC START=1016080>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1016080>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>don't care what happened<br>in the other series.
   <SYNC START=1019010>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1019010>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>They still got to come<br>through Chicago.
   <SYNC START=1020609>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1020609>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>We will win game seven.
   <SYNC START=1023473>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1023473>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and the ball...Michael a steal.
   <SYNC START=1025494>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1026703>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>M.J. on the run,<br>he will dunk the ball.
   <SYNC START=1029999>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1029999>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michae I was facing<br>the ultimate elimination...
   <SYNC START=1033097>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1033097>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>lose, and end his career<br>on a note of defeat.
   <SYNC START=1035694>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1035694>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But despite Michael's promises,
   <SYNC START=1037926>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1037926>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the Pacers led<br>by 13 points early on.
   <SYNC START=1040656>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1040656>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Then Michael led the Bulls<br>on a furious rally.
   <SYNC START=1044486>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1044486>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He's loose, driving...<br>and dunks the ball, and a foul!
   <SYNC START=1049148>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1049148>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It was the kind of run<br>that had led the Bulls...
   <SYNC START=1051512>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1051512>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to their five<br>previous championships.
   <SYNC START=1053910>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1053910>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But there was still<br>a half of basketball to play.
   <SYNC START=1057271>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1058906>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Here we were in the conference finals.
   <SYNC START=1060603>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1060603>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>In the seventh game,<br>we were down...
   <SYNC START=1061969>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1061969>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>going into<br>the fourh quarer.
   <SYNC START=1063634>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1063634>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And I thought maybe... maybe<br>this is it...
   <SYNC START=1066265>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1066265>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>maybe we've had<br>the last hurrah.
   <SYNC START=1068463>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1068463>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But something rose up in<br>these players, led by our hero.
   <SYNC START=1072323>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1075889>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He's the type of man that<br>could get you to jump off a bridge...
   <SYNC START=1079485>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1079485>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>or at least<br>think about it<br>for a few seconds.
   <SYNC START=1081917>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1081917>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He has such a will<br>to accomplish a mission...
   <SYNC START=1086312>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1086312>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that eveyone follows him.
   <SYNC START=1088935>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1098201>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael back to the top...
   <SYNC START=1099767>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1099767>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and now the switch made back by McKey.
   <SYNC START=1101531>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1101531>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael to the lane,<br>jumped out to Luc.
   <SYNC START=1103462>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1103462>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>17-footer... bang!
   <SYNC START=1105194>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1105194>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Down the well it goes.
   <SYNC START=1106893>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1106893>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>M.J. on the run,<br>to Kerr for three...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1109324>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Good!

   <SYNC START=1117216>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1117216>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And a foul!
   <SYNC START=1118147>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1121645>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>They may have had tired legs,
   <SYNC START=1123343>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1123343>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but Michael and the Bulls grew stronger...
   <SYNC START=1125541>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1125541>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>in the game's final minutes.
   <SYNC START=1127970>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1137130>

   <SYNC START=1140194>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1140194>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>They go to the finals again.
   <SYNC START=1146080>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1147487>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael, you're a tired man, aren't you?

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I mean, eveybody had<br>to leave it on the floor...
   <SYNC START=1156445>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1156445>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and there's no tomorrow,<br>it's the last dance,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1158776>

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1256016>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but sometimes,"<br>Jordan will say,
   <SYNC START=1258214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1258214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"I wonder if they have any idea how much<br>I'd like to be them."

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1263109>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Last night<br>we began the show...
   <SYNC START=1265407>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1265407>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>with the disappearance<br>of Michael Jordan's father.
   <SYNC START=1268238>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1268238>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Tonight, the worst fears<br>have come true.
   <SYNC START=1270536>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1270536>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>James Jordan<br>was found dead...
   <SYNC START=1272367>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1272367>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the victim of an apparent murder.
   <SYNC START=1274524>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1277729>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When my father died,<br>I had him for 32 years.
   <SYNC START=1282824>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1282824>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I was very lucky.
   <SYNC START=1284289>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1284289>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I looked at it as being lucky,
   <SYNC START=1286054>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1286054>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>not as being disappointed<br>that he wasn't around anymore.
   <SYNC START=1289418>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1289418>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I was lucky that he was there<br>when I needed him...
   <SYNC START=1291849>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1291849>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that he could infuence<br>my life to look at situations...
   <SYNC START=1295811>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1295811>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that I use to help make<br>my decisions to this day.
   <SYNC START=1298375>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1298375>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Some kids never have that.
   <SYNC START=1301805>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1301805>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Sure, I would love<br>to have him now, but...
   <SYNC START=1303903>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1303903>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>people are put<br>on this earth for a reason,
   <SYNC START=1307167>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1307167>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and you utilize the time<br>that you're here.
   <SYNC START=1309165>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1309165>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You never know when that's<br>going to be taken away from you.
   <SYNC START=1311996>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1311996>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>That's one thing<br>he taught me.
   <SYNC START=1313461>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1313461>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But while he's here,<br>or while they're here,
   <SYNC START=1315992>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1315992>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>they should make an impact<br>on someone's life.
   <SYNC START=1318722>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1318722>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he made an impact<br>on my life.
   <SYNC START=1320655>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1320655>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You're going to get it, man.
   <SYNC START=1324551>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1324551>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>That's for bringing me<br>into this world.
   <SYNC START=1326749>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1326749>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>After the third championship,
   <SYNC START=1328979>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1328979>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>my father kept kind of hinting<br>towards me playing baseball
   <SYNC START=1332743>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1332743>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"Stop playing basketball.
   <SYNC START=1334973>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1334973>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Why don't you give<br>your baseball a shot?"
   <SYNC START=1338471>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1338471>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Because that's what he actually<br>got mestared playing...
   <SYNC START=1340768>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1340768>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>when I was six years old...<br>I played baseball.
   <SYNC START=1342766>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1342766>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he felt that<br>I could play baseball...
   <SYNC START=1345963>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1345963>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and do it with the same<br>conviction and attitude...
   <SYNC START=1349693>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1349693>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that I played basketball.
   <SYNC START=1350816>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1352990>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Eveyday, the first person<br>there before the sun...
   <SYNC START=1355788>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1355788>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>would be Jordan.
   <SYNC START=1357519>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1357519>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And he was there<br>because he wasn't good.
   <SYNC START=1359284>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1359284>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He would work<br>with a batting instructor...
   <SYNC START=1362281>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1362281>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and work all day long...
   <SYNC START=1363913>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1363913>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and be the last<br>person to leave<br>ever night also.
   <SYNC START=1367671>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1369174>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Strike three!
   <SYNC START=1369907>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1369907>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Money's no Stan Musial.
   <SYNC START=1371472>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1371472>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But he's tring.
   <SYNC START=1372402>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1373903>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Say, hey,<br>he's no Willie Mays.
   <SYNC START=1375502>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1375502>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But he's tring, man.
   <SYNC START=1377566>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1377566>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>What it did teach me was,<br>don't be afraid to try.
   <SYNC START=1381962>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1381962>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The worst thing that can happen...
   <SYNC START=1383861>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1383861>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>is it doesn't...<br>it doesn't pan out<br>the way that you envision it.
   <SYNC START=1387757>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1387757>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But at least you know<br>that by giving it a shot.
   <SYNC START=1390914>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1392352>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>People were basically saying...
   <SYNC START=1393984>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1393984>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that I didn't have no reason<br>being in the sport,
   <SYNC START=1396714>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1396714>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and I was degrading the sport.
   <SYNC START=1400011>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1400011>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When those negative things<br>started to happen,
   <SYNC START=1402375>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1402375>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the only thing,<br>I wish my father was there...
   <SYNC START=1404640>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1404640>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to give me the positive<br>reinforcements that I needed.
   <SYNC START=1407537>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1407537>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I asked him what it was like<br>for him in the morning.
   <SYNC START=1410268>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1410268>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And Jordan said,"I get up<br>before the sun comes up,
   <SYNC START=1412899>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1412899>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and I make myself<br>some breakfast by myself"...
   <SYNC START=1415363>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1415363>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>he was down there alone...
   <SYNC START=1416795>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1416795>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"and I get in the car.
   <SYNC START=1418693>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1418693>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"And I'm driving<br>to spring training,
   <SYNC START=1420991>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1420991>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"and there's no one, really,<br>out on the roads yet.
   <SYNC START=1424354>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1424354>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"And I look at the seat<br>next to me and I see my Dad,
   <SYNC START=1430083>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1430083>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"and I talk to him.
   <SYNC START=1431282>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1431282>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"I think to myself,<br>Pops, we're doing this.
   <SYNC START=1434678>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1434678>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>We're doing this together."
   <SYNC START=1437909>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1437909>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And the day would end,
   <SYNC START=1439174>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1439174>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and he would say<br>to the batting instructor,
   <SYNC START=1441539>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1441539>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"Can we do a little more?
   <SYNC START=1442704>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1442704>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"I think I'm getting this.
   <SYNC START=1443969>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1443969>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think I'm learning this,<br>I think I'm getting this."
   <SYNC START=1446034>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1446034>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And that's when<br>Spors Illustrated<br>put him on the cover...
   <SYNC START=1449631>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1449631>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>saying that Michael Jordan<br>has embarrassed baseball.
   <SYNC START=1453360>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1453360>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And as I would watch him<br>there ever night...
   <SYNC START=1455259>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1455259>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>as the sun was going down and<br>the other ball players had left,
   <SYNC START=1458022>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1458022>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and I would see this guy<br>working to get better...
   <SYNC START=1460553>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1460553>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael Jordan working<br>to get better...
   <SYNC START=1462584>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1462584>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I couldn't help thinking that<br>if you ever have children,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1465315>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>you ought to pray<br>that they grow up someday...
   <SYNC START=1467480>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1467480>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to embarrass<br>you like this.
   <SYNC START=1468879>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1468879>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael Jordan...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1470910>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>hits a fly ball.
   <SYNC START=1472670>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1490158>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think that experience itself<br>kind of gave him a blessing...
   <SYNC START=1494055>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1494055>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>of coming back to basketball...
   <SYNC START=1495719>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1495719>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and understanding the gift that<br>he'd been given for this game...
   <SYNC START=1499416>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1499416>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that was so special.
   <SYNC START=1501115>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1501115>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>By the hand of the Almighty
   <SYNC START=1503878>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1503878>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>We fowered<br>in this generation
   <SYNC START=1510072>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1510072>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Triumphantly

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1513535>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Won't you help to sing
   <SYNC START=1516623>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1518565>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>These songs of freedom
   <SYNC START=1521662>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1521662>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>'Cause all I ever had...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1524159>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When Michael came back,
   <SYNC START=1525591>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1525591>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and Jud and I were driving<br>down to the game,
   <SYNC START=1529420>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1529420>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and I said,"Jud, you know,<br>does Phil start Michael?
   <SYNC START=1532851>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1532851>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I mean, he hasn't been here for,<br>you know, 60 games, 65 games."
   <SYNC START=1536914>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1536914>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And Jud looked at me<br>And he said,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1538745>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"Steve, as a general rule,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1541076>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>"when you have your own<br>statue outside the stadium,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>you don't<br>come off the bench."
   <SYNC START=1545905>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1545905>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>There'll be other great players,<br>there's no question about that.
   <SYNC START=1550168>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1558260>

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1560957>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>eveybody wants to be<br>apart of it and witness it.
   <SYNC START=1567784>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1567784>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The Bulls had gone<br>to the finals five times,

   <SYNC START=1573545>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1573545>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The fact that this might be<br>Michael's last chance...

   <SYNC START=1579206>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1579206>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The Jazz had earned<br>the home cour advantage...

   <SYNC START=1587165>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and win one last time.

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1594458>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Right here, right now.
   <SYNC START=1596189>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1596189>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Right here, right now.

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1613740>

   <SYNC START=1617134>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1619667>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>In game one, the Bulls<br>took the Jazz into overime.
   <SYNC START=1624063>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1624063>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But in the end,<br>fresher legs prevailed.
   <SYNC START=1628626>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1628626>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The previous year,<br>although Utah had lost,
   <SYNC START=1631257>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1631257>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>they had proven to themselves...
   <SYNC START=1632855>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1632855>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that they could play with the Bulls.
   <SYNC START=1634053>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1634053>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and then they win game one.
   <SYNC START=1636352>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1636352>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I thought Utah was going<br>to be the N.B.A. champions.
   <SYNC START=1638747>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1641413>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When eveybody, in some ways,<br>didn't expect me to win,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1644776>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and the odds<br>are stacked against you.
   <SYNC START=1647174>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1647174>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And for once in your life,<br>you are the underdog...
   <SYNC START=1651537>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1651537>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You know,<br>that was beautiful for me.
   <SYNC START=1653368>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1653368>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>When he needed it most,<br>Michael didn't find comfor...

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1656865>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>in the championship banners<br>he helped raise.
   <SYNC START=1659829>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1659829>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But rather strength...
   <SYNC START=1661228>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1661228>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>from the seven years<br>of defeat that came before.
   <SYNC START=1664492>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1664492>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>That was a long road.
   <SYNC START=1667489>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1667489>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It kept me in the gym in the<br>summer, working on my skills...
   <SYNC START=1671018>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1671018>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>tying to be<br>the best basketball player<br>I could become.
   <SYNC START=1674715>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1674715>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But at the same time,
   <SYNC START=1676080>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1676080>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to show players who were<br>not on the same level...
   <SYNC START=1679244>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1679244>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>with the same<br>mental toughness...
   <SYNC START=1681374>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1681374>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that,<br>if I'm going to do this,
   <SYNC START=1683373>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1683373>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>then you have<br>to keep up with the pace.
   <SYNC START=1685970>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1685970>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And quietly,<br>it stared to turn.
   <SYNC START=1688302>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1688302>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He was your hardest worker.<br>He competed eveyday.
   <SYNC START=1691932>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1691932>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>That filtered down<br>through your team,<br>so as a coach...
   <SYNC START=1694096>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1694096>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>you never had to talk<br>about the work ethic<br>of your team...
   <SYNC START=1696494>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1696494>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>because your best player<br>always brought that.
   <SYNC START=1698185>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1699458>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael's standards<br>were too high...
   <SYNC START=1701456>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1701456>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>for many<br>of his early team mates...
   <SYNC START=1703021>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1703021>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but then<br>came Scottie Pippen.
   <SYNC START=1705418>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1705418>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The infuence<br>of Michael on Scottie Pippen<br>was almost from day one.
   <SYNC START=1710214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1710214>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael kind of<br>helped him get out there<br>on the basketball court...
   <SYNC START=1714676>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1714676>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and taught him some<br>little things... some of<br>the small tricks that he'd use.
   <SYNC START=1719331>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1723700>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>as a consequence,<br>the two of them<br>really played well together.
   <SYNC START=1727330>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1727330>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>It was<br>the Lone Rangerand Tonto.
   <SYNC START=1729695>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1729695>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>There's no doubt about it.
   <SYNC START=1731926>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1731926>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Pippen became a star<br>in his own right.
   <SYNC START=1734824>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1734824>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and then there was<br>the supporing cast...
   <SYNC START=1737021>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1737021>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that Michael would<br>challenge relentlessly,
   <SYNC START=1740152>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1740152>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>knowing that they too had to be<br>ready when their moment came.
   <SYNC START=1743615>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1743615>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He understood the fact...
   <SYNC START=1745313>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1745313>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that eveybody had<br>to share in the game,
   <SYNC START=1747612>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1747612>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and that he was willing<br>to be part of this...
   <SYNC START=1750176>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1750176>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to sacrifice some<br>of his own game for that...
   <SYNC START=1753106>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1753106>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>was the most<br>important thing.
   <SYNC START=1754933>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1757102>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He comes off,<br>I'll be ready.
   <SYNC START=1758868>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1758868>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I've gotten<br>a chance to play a lot,
   <SYNC START=1762630>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1762630>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and play a lot<br>in big games.
   <SYNC START=1764162>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1764162>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And I felt<br>the pressure, I think,
   <SYNC START=1766327>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1766327>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and didn't<br>perform that well.
   <SYNC START=1768291>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1768291>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And I learned how<br>to play with Michael<br>and how to hit big shots,
   <SYNC START=1772155>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1772155>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and how to relax myself<br>in situations like that.
   <SYNC START=1774985>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1774985>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael, in traffic, to Kerr.
   <SYNC START=1776617>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Fifteen footer...<br>Yes!
   <SYNC START=1781146>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1781146>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>What a great experience,<br>you know, to go through,
   <SYNC START=1783244>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1783244>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>not just for basketball,<br>but for the rest of my life.
   <SYNC START=1785309>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1785309>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>To know that I can<br>face something...
   <SYNC START=1787407>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1787407>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>that's pretty<br>difficult,<br>and deal with it.
   <SYNC START=1790961>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1792701>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Back in Utah...
   <SYNC START=1794433>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1794433>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the buzz was still about the<br>Jazz's series opening victoy.
   <SYNC START=1797796>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1797796>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>But by the time<br>game two had begun,
   <SYNC START=1800095>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1800095>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>game one was histoy<br>to Michael and the Bulls.
   <SYNC START=1803183>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1808187>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>If Michael enjoyed<br>being the underdog,
   <SYNC START=1810651>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1810651>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>he never let his team<br>feel like one,<br>driving them foward...
   <SYNC START=1815013>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1815013>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>with the fair<br>and confidence of a champion.
   <SYNC START=1818306>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1819875>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>The Bulls won game two,
   <SYNC START=1821407>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1821407>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and now the series<br>would move to Chicago,<br>tied at one.
   <SYNC START=1825597>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1827169>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I'd have to see someone beat<br>Michael Jordan four times,
   <SYNC START=1830632>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1830632>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>because, I said,<br>to do that you're going<br>to have to dismember him.
   <SYNC START=1833363>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1833363>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>You're going<br>to have to take<br>an arm and leg,
   <SYNC START=1835361>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1835361>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and you're going<br>to have to drag him<br>off the floor.
   <SYNC START=1836826>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1836826>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>He's not going<br>to go easily.
   <SYNC START=1837916>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1839956>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>These would be Michael's<br>last games in Chicago.
   <SYNC START=1842487>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=1842487>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>And game three played out like<br>a thank-you note to the fans.

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2054017>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and Michael walked out of the<br>United Center for the last time.

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2060878>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Back in Utah for practice<br>the following day,
   <SYNC START=2063942>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2063942>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>the defeat<br>was already forgotten,

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2065940>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>for here was another secret<br>to the spell Michael had held...
   <SYNC START=2068937>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2068937>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>over the rest of the league...
   <SYNC START=2069869>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2069869>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>ever since<br>his first championship.
   <SYNC START=2072333>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2072333>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Even when the Bulls<br>weren't superior physically,
   <SYNC START=2075696>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2075696>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>they had<br>a philosophicaledge.
   <SYNC START=2077794>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2077794>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think Phil had a lot to do<br>with that with his Zen practice.
   <SYNC START=2082323>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2082323>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>His whole emotional approach<br>to a game of basketball.
   <SYNC START=2084421>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2084421>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I've experienced<br>a lot of different coaches,
   <SYNC START=2088918>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2088918>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but he gave me<br>the understanding about life...
   <SYNC START=2092947>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2092947>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>in a whole different frame.
   <SYNC START=2094411>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2097509>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I think his teaching<br>toward the understanding<br>of Zen Buddhism is...
   <SYNC START=2102937>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2102937>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>how you view yourself...
   <SYNC START=2105301>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2105301>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to deal with the realities<br>of life surrounding you,
   <SYNC START=2108398>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2108398>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and somehow be able<br>to correlate that...
   <SYNC START=2111796>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2111796>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>to a simple game<br>as basketball.
   <SYNC START=2113760>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2115725>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>This is something<br>that we talked about a lot<br>as a basketball team,
   <SYNC START=2118889>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2118889>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>is about how to be<br>in the moment.
   <SYNC START=2120953>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2120953>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Being able to visualize what<br>might happen in those times.
   <SYNC START=2124383>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2124383>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Michael so embraced this,
   <SYNC START=2126348>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2126348>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>and I think that was<br>the beauty of his game,
   <SYNC START=2129378>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2129378>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>is that he had all these<br>abilities to adjust,
   <SYNC START=2132809>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2132809>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>not force his own<br>predetermined idea,
   <SYNC START=2135739>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2135739>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>but allow those things<br>to come together for his game.
   <SYNC START=2140099>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2142366>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I tend to be calm,<br>things tend to slowdown.
   <SYNC START=2146195>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2146195>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>As I go into situations that<br>people don't know the out come,
   <SYNC START=2150658>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2150658>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I've already<br>experienced them in my mind...
   <SYNC START=2152723>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2152723>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>just playing<br>tricks with myself.
   <SYNC START=2154954>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2154954>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>So it didn't seem new to me and<br>I wasn't afraid to fail with it.
   <SYNC START=2160382>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2160382>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>Once I began<br>to understand that,
   <SYNC START=2164212>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2164212>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>I became a master<br>of the game of basketball.

      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>&nbsp;
   <SYNC START=2174868>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>For Michael, it would mean<br>the cementing of his legacy.

   <SYNC START=2192151>
      <P CLASS=SUBTTL>as a bad backgrounded<br>Scottie Pippen.

NICK BROOMFIELD: It was here in these woods off Florida's I-75 that in the space of one year the police found the bodies of seven men.
They were killed with this gun, a High Standard double 9.22.
Richard Mallory, Walter Antonio,
Dick Humphreys, David Spears,
Charles Carskaddon, Peter
Siems, and Troy Burress.
REPORTER (ON RADIO): Eight men have been shot to death in cold blood on central
Florida highways, including the busy tourist route of I-75.
But this time, there's an even more chilling twist to the slayings.
Police say for the first time in criminal history, these killers may be murdering with a feminine touch.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
On January 9, 1991,
Aileen Carol
Wuornos was arrested in Daytona Beach, Florida.
She worked as a hitchhiking hooker.
-Oh.
-How are you doing?
NICK BROOMFIELD: This is the original police video of Aileen
Wuornos' confession.
NICK BROOMFIELD: The idea of a woman killing men, a man-hating lesbian prostitute who tarnished the reputation of all her victims, brought Aileen
Wuornos a special kind of hatred.
Terry Humphreys' father was a retired police chief.
-There wasn't any sex involved in my dad's murder.
They cut him-- they did an autopsy on my dad.
They wouldn't release his body for over a week.
They cut him from stem to stern.
There wasn't any semen there anywhere.
-You just cannot imagine the grief, the hurt, the anguish that they have caused this family.
This is a man that I had for--
-I hope she meets up with quote, "Old Sparky."
You know who Old Sparky is.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Politicians and the Christian right campaigned for Aileen
Wuornos' execution.
-Because I'm tired of this reelection jazz.
They're just trying to get promotional ladder climbing, political prestige from this.
And I'm sick and tired of this.
I'll probably get three more Death Row sentences.
And then I got to go to Pasco and Dixon for two more d-- Death Row.
How many times you got to kill me, you know?
I mean, this is-- this is bullshit.
They don't need to be doing this.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Even Ted Bundy was offered life imprisonment.
This was never offered to Aileen Wuornos.
By the time I met
Aileen, she already had four death sentences.
But surprisingly, in an odd way, I found her to be the most honest person involved in the case.
All the others, her lawyers, her born-again Christian mother, the police, had all been involved in trying to sell her story for as much money as possible.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Hi.
How you doing?
NICK BROOMFIELD: This is Aileen when I first interviewed her in 1992 for my original film, "The Selling of a Serial Killer."
-I say it's this.
The principle is self-defense.
They say it's a number.
I say it's a principle.
To heck with what-- it-- it-- it has nothing to do with the number killed.
It's the principle.
But they're saying, there's a number.
No.
Self-defense is self-defense, no matter how many times it is.
I don't care if it's 100 times.
I was very-- I never provoked those guys.
I never provoked them.
I never showed any provocations whatsoever.
I was very nice, very decent, very clean, very lady-like.
I didn't even swear in front of my clients.
And a lot of my clients and I talked about Jesus and I talked political both mixed together and we never argued.
NICK BROOMFIELD: My old film had ended with this announcement of the resignation of
Florida police officers who had illicitly entered into Hollywood movie deals to sell the story of
America's first female serial killer, the Aileen
Wuornos story.
-Major Dan Henry resigned as
Chief of Staff of the Marion
County Sheriff's Office after being notified of an investigation being conducted by the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement.
The investigation being conducted by the Florida
Department of Law
Enforcement centers around taped telephone conversations made by Deputy
Munster between he and Major Henry involving the Aileen Wuornos case.
NICK BROOMFIELD: There was speculation at the time that if police officers did, in fact, receive money, all Aileen Wuornos' death sentences could be overturned.
12 years later, Aileen is still on Death Row.
There was no proper investigation into the police officers and their movie deals.
It all got covered over.
Aileen and I kept in touch over the years.
And then a few weeks ago
I opened my front door, and to my amazement, was served with a subpoena to attend Aileen's final appeal before execution.
I had no idea how things would turn out and that I'll be witnessing an execution in 1 and 1/2 years' time.
This is Ocala, Florida.
All us witnesses were housed together in a motel.
-We're going to win this thing.
I'm telling you, we're going to win.
NICK BROOMFIELD: This is Joe
Hobson, Aileen's attorney.
Lawyers like Joe are kept very busy.
4,000 people are on Death
Row waiting for execution.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): OK.
-OK.
What--
NICK (OFFSCREEN): You're not very good at wheeling this.
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, bro.
-And has this particular case been stressful, the Aileen case?
-Uh, It's so important because this is the legal system in a-- in a phase where it's doing the most important thing it can ever do, and that is taking a human life.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Mm-hm.
-It's more important than a money judgment or an adjudication of guilt, or 30 years in prison.
And we've really got to be careful.
I mean, the whole system's got to be careful.
And my opinion and the whole gist of our motion is that she's been failed by the legal system.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Joe Hobson felt that Aileen had been poorly represented by her previous attorney, Dr. Legal.
-Most of us will probably never worry about spending time in jail.
But if you're ever involved in the criminal justice system, you will need a lawyer who can--
NICK BROOMFIELD: Joe Hobson was hoping to get Aileen a retrial by discrediting Dr. Legal, otherwise known as Steve.
This is the Ocala
Courthouse, where we were going to spend the next week.
Steve the lawyer had made no attempt to investigate the cops.
He plead guilty to all the murders and didn't even try and make a deal for lesser sentence.
Aileen had no money to pay him, so Steve used the money obtained from interview fees.
This man in front of me is the state prosecutor, who wants to execute
Aileen immediately.
This is the first time I've seen Steve for 11 years.
He said my film got him run out of town.
-Fuck you.
-What?
-Fuck you.
Fuck you and the [inaudible].
-I'm like, what are you reading?
-Fuck you and your documentaries.
-Well, nice to see you anyway.
-Don't talk to me.
-What?
-Don't talk to me.
BAILIFF (OFFSCREEN):
All rise, please.
Circuit Court is back in session.
-OK.
You may be seated.
All right.
Let's continue.
-Now, um, you were contacted by Mr. Broomfield in 1992.
Do you recall specifically charging, or attempting to charge Mr. Broomfield
$25,000 for an interview?
-I didn't attempt to charge anybody anything.
If Miss Wuornos asked me,
Steve, I-- or told me,
Steve, I want $25,000 for this interview,
I would have passed that onto the person who was interviewing.
But it's-- it's not my position to, um, um, set fees or we didn't have a fee schedule.
-Will you admit at you're depicted on the movie
"The Selling of a Serial
Killer" doing exactly that?
Trying to get $10,000-- or I think $25,000 for an interview?
-There's-- there's-- I don't think there's any evidence that
I tried to get
$25,000 or anything.
-So the next stage is really to come up with a counteroffer?
-No, the next stage is to come up with $25,000.
-Right.
NICK BROOMFIELD: We're just talking to you about--
-But--OK.
OK.
Well, then--
DIANE WUORNOS (OFFSCREEN):
Well then, do a counteroffer.
-If you're not, then the next thing to do is to really get a counteroffer and let's-- and let's tell her something.
-So we would basically then pay the money to-- well, we pay the money to you, or to, as her legal--
-As her mom, and then Steve gets a percentages as our agent.
-Right.
I see.
DIANE WUORNOS (OFFSCREEN):
Very tiny percentage.
This poor man works for nothing.
-Nick, wait a second.
What's Davy Crockett doing on the $100? bill?
Thank you, very much.
-Have you seen the-- Mr.
Broomfield's production,
"The Selling of a Serial Killer?"
-Yes.
-OK.
And you've seen yourself depicted in that movie?
-Yes, sir.
-Do you recall joking in that movie that your advice to any client facing the electric chair was, to quote Woody Allen, don't sit down?
-I remember making a lot of jokes in that movie.
-Judge, we're talking about the depictions of Mr. Glazer in the movie "The Selling of a Serial Killer," that the defendant submits fairly captures the essence of his approach to a representation, which clearly impeaches his claim that he had taken this as an altruistic pro bono national lawyer's guild [inaudible].
It helps establish the claim that all along his motive in taking this case was the publicity and the money to be made.
NICK BROOMFIELD: I have to say, I always liked Steve.
He was an old hippy from Micanopy who was just way out of his depth.
-The only thing really to do here is to have breakfast and then leave.
[all chuckle]
NICK BROOMFIELD: This is Dawn
Botkins, Aileen's best friend.
-What was that little ditty you had about Ocala?
NICK BROOMFIELD: I really don't believe Steve took the case on for money, but he was so inexperienced he could only plead guilty for Aileen.
He didn't even have a fax machine or law office.
-When I was living in a tepee in Micanopy, I had--
I went through the whole thing, cows, chickens, geese, and--
DAWN BOTKINS (OFFSCREEN):
I got all that.
--pigs.
I had a cow called
Sir Angus McBeef, just so you know what he's going to be.
You know, you try to rationalize that you're going into the refrigerator, you're going-- and that was the last meat I was able to eat.
DAWN BOTKINS
(OFFSCREEN): I guess you can look at it that way.
-Yeah.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Aileen lived in a total fantasy world.
She thought she'd get off the murders and then live with this woman, Arlene Pralle, a born-again Christian who had seen Aileen's picture in the local newspaper and had adopted her.
Together, they planned to run a horse ranch and raise she-wolves
Arlene Pralle, the born-again Christian, hired Steve and persuaded
Aileen to come clean with God and plead guilty.
Steve had been advised that Aileen was paranoid and suffered from borderline personality disorder, but still went along with this cockeyed scheme.
Aileen seemed to think a miracle might happen, and was outraged to receive three more death sentences.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN):
I sentence you to death for the murder of
Charles Humphreys, case number
91-112, Cypress
County case number.
I sentence you to death for the murder of David Spears.
-Thank you.
And, I'll probably see you.
I'll be up in Heaven while ya'll are rotting in hell.
I hope they get whipped in the ass one of these days.
COURT OFFICIAL (OFFSCREEN):
Fifth Circuit to handle that.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): OK.
There will be an automatic appeal.
You have the right to an appeal.
Mr. Glazer is that going to be handled by you or the public defender?
-May your wife and kids get raped--
-I would ask that you appoint the public defenders office.
--right in the ass.
I know I was raped and you ain't nothing but a bunch of scum.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN):
Therefore, these proceedings are now concluded.
-Putting somebody who was raped to death?
-All rise, please.
Court will be adjourned.
-You bunch of motherfuckers!
NICK BROOMFIELD: In many Death
Row cases, a client in despair will say they want to die.
It was a measure of Steve the lawyer's inexperience that he took Aileen's wish on face value.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): Sir, will you come on up here, please?
NICK BROOMFIELD: I like to flatter myself that I was being asked for my legal opinion.
But it turned out
I was there to talk about Steve's marijuana smoking.
The big question was whether
Steve had consumed seven very strong joints before giving
Aileen legal advice in prison.
-You know, I've got a short video clip I want to show, if I may.
It's an excerpt from the film that depicts this alleged six, seven joint ride.
And as a preliminary question, isn't it true that in doing your work, you routinely edit things, correct?
-Well, you always edit afterwards, yeah.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
And editing involves cutting and pasting and putting things together.
-Mm-hm.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): Correct?
-Yeah.
PROSECUTOR
(OFFSCREEN): And that's what you do all the time?
-Well, I don't know about the pasting, but you certainly can't.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Pasting in terms of inserting and connecting and making things fit together.
-Correct.
-OK.
NICK (ON VIDEO): It was 6 AM.
Steve said it was a seven joint ride to the prison and he brought along a tape of his own music with him singing and playing all the instruments, especially for the occasion.
[music playing on video]
-OK.
Let's go back.
You recognize that?
-Yes.
Apol--
-That's your work, isn't it?
-I apologize for the quality.
It's not a very good copy.
-But that's still your work?
-Yes.
-You notice that the shirt that
Mr. Glazer has on is white?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Uh-huh.
PROSECUTOR
(OFFSCREEN): Now, here he's got a blue shirt on, correct?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Maybe he changed his shirt.
I don't know.
I mean--
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
He had a blue shirt on.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And now he's got a white one on.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Now he's got a white shirt.
-Well, it's possible he changed his shirt.
I've-- I've got-- maybe he put a clean white shirt on for the prison visit.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): But isn't it also possible that you just cut and paste and took footage from one episode and cut and paste it into another episode to make it look like something that hadn't, in fact, happened?
-Uh, I remember distinctly the--
I mean, the seven joint ride if that's what you're referring to.
I don't remember him changing his shirt.
But we could-- if you want, we can make all the outtakes available from that particular journey.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): Well--
-Because they're still available.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): -that's not very convenient right now.
And you hadn't made those available before.
-Well, I didn't know you wanted them before.
And I-- you know, I didn't even know that the film was going to be submitted as evidence.
If I was making that trip, I would probably change my shirt at the end of the trip.
I don't know about you.
-But that's not part of my question, is it?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): I don't know.
But I would-- I would probably bring a clean shirt along for my visit.
Wouldn't you?
I would.
-Keep in touch.
-Uh-uh, sir.
No, sir.
-Sorry.
Sorry.
-I got a message that Aileen wanted me to come meet her at the local jail.
She had something to say.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Thank goodness.
-Oh my, God.
-How are you?
-I'm doing good.
Get it out of there, Nick.
-I'm just trying to-- sorry.
-Ah, there.
Shoo!
-It was the microphone, we're adjusting now.
Sorry about that.
-Oh, Lordy.
-All right.
-OK.
I can't believe this microphone, how small it is, you know, and it actually works.
-It actually works.
[aileen laughing]
-OK, Nick.
Nick, this-- this interview, man.
I got to-- I-- I just-- let me do this thing over one more time because I know you guys pre-tape then you clip and stuff.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Right.
-So let me say it one more time, kind of right, OK?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): OK.
-Because I'm really concerned about the family members.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Right.
-I got to get my hair out of my face while I'm doing this.
Because I'm really concerned about family members, man.
So I want to say this again over.
Nick, the reason I'm-- I'm coming forth with you with this interview is because I'd like to come clean about my cases.
And because there's only about a 1% chance that a person can get off Death Row.
And I come to realize that that is actually true.
Very, very true.
There's only, like, about 82 people that got off Death Row af-- in-- in like 30 years out of like about 4,000 or 5,000
Death Row inmates, and those are only DNA people, blood samples.
So the chances of getting off Death Row are 1%.
99.9% you're going to be on it and you're going to die.
OK, I cannot go in the execution chamber and die in the execution chamber as a liar.
And I cannot go in the execution chamber and be executed under the devil.
I have to come clean and clean-- cleanse my spirit in the name of Jesus Christ.
So I have to come clean and tell the world the lies that went on through my mouth.
I mean, now prosecutors and cops--
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And that you killed seven men.
-Huh?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): That you killed those men in cold blood.
-Yeah.
I got to come clean that
I killed those seven men in first-degree murder and robbery.
As they said, they had it right, a serial killer.
Not so much like thrill kill.
I was into the robbing biz.
I mean, you know, serial killers are in this thrill killing jazz.
I was into the robbing just-- and eliminate a witness.
But still, again, I got a number so it's serial killer.
But I'm coming clean before I go in that execution chamber and be executed that I killed them.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And so when you met them from the beginning, did you know that you were going to kill them?
When they picked you up in their cars?
-I pretty much--
I pretty much had them selected that they were going to die.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): But when you're saying that there was no self-defense, so there was no self-defense?
-No.
There was no self-defense.
Uh, I'm being really straight up about everything.
There's no self-defense.
I'm really sorry what happened about everything.
I was in-- in this-- this-- to me, this world is nothing but evil and all of us are full of evil one way or another.
And whatever we do, we have evil in us.
All of us do.
And my evil just happened to come out because of the circumstances of what I was doing.
Hitchhiking, hooking, on the road,
I was a homeless person all my life.
And then the hitchhiking and hooking I learned off the homelessness and cruising all over the United States of America and stuff.
And so, learning how to be a hooker as a hitchhiker eventually got tiring in the end.
I carried the gun for protection, but then I got where I was getting a real problem and our rent was due, $1,200 behind.
Tyria was doing a lot of beer-drinking and stuff.
She wanted to go out all the time, so she was burning up the money I was making.
I was making good, about
$200 to $300 a day sometimes.
Sometimes $150.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
But did she-- and did she know what you were doing?
-Oh, yeah.
Tyria always knew everything I was doing.
-I met her in a bar.
NICK BROOMFIELD: This is
Aileen's great love, Tyria.
One of the reasons I had felt so much sympathy for Aileen was that she was betrayed by those closest to her all her life.
-We were sitting on the floor watching TV and she just come out and said
I have something to tell you.
And I asked her what, and she said that she had shot and killed a man that day.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Tyria know about the murders all along, but didn't come forward to say anything until she was questioned by police.
Tyria, who was never charged with anything, was then made a state's witness.
And, it has been asserted, became part of the movie rights package in the Hollywood police film deal.
It was Tyria who got
Aileen to confess in a series of taped phone calls.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): Hello.
OPERATOR (ON
RECORDING): Miss Ty?
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): Yes.
OPERATOR (ON RECORDING):
Collect call from Aileen.
Do you accept?
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): Yes.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): Yes.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): Hi.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): Hey.
AILEEN (ON RECORDING): Hey,
I had to call you early because I didn't know if you were going to leave today, or what.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): I don't-- what the hell's going on, Lee?
They've called.
They've been up to my parents again.
They've got my sister now asking her questions and I don't know what the hell's going on.
AILEEN (ON RECORDING): Huh.
What are they asking your sister questions for?
TYRIA (ON RECORDING):
I don't know.
AILEEN (ON RECORDING): Hmm.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING):
Lee, Lee, listen.
They're coming after me, I know they are.
AILEEN (ON RECORDING): No, they're not. [inaudible].
TYRIA (ON RECORDING):
They've got to.
Then why are they asking so many questions then?
AILEEN (ON RECORDING):
Honey, listen.
Listen.
Listen.
Do what you gotta do, OK?
AILEEN (ON RECORDING): I'm going to have to because I'm not going to go to jail for something that you did.
This isn't fair.
My family is a nervous wreck up there.
My mom has been calling me all the time.
She doesn't know what the hell's going on.
AILEEN (ON RECORDING): OK.
Do what you gotta do, OK?
All righty?
Tyria?
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): What?
AILEEN (ON RECORDING):
You-- I'm not going to let you go to jail.
You hear me?
TYRIA (ON RECORDING):
I don't know whether I should keep on living or if I should--
AILEEN (ON RECORDING): No, Ty.
Ty, listen to me.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): And what if they don't believe me?
AILEEN (ON RECORDING):
Tyria, listen to me.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): What?
AILEEN (ON RECORDING):
I'm not going to let you go to jail or anything.
Listen, if I have to confess, I will.
TYRIA (ON RECORDING): OK.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So you were very close?
-Yeah, we are.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): All right.
-And I still miss her and I still love her.
And I really-- and I'm really sorry about everything
I've done.
I miss Ty.
I lost Tyria over this.
And then the people that lost their loved ones and everything.
I really think first about the people that lost their loved ones and then Ty second, because I have to put them in first on this whole thing.
I'm really sorry for, you know, them losing their loved ones, man.
I know the feeling.
-And what about with
Richard Mallory?
Because you gave that testimony with Richard Mallory.
-Yeah, Richard Mallory is definitely-- was not self-defense.
Richard Mallory I killed in-- for he had-- uh, I needed his wheels to move the stuff and he had the right amount of money I needed to move into the apartment, so.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): But what about the testimony that you gave in court about--
-Oh, that's just-- like I was saying.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
About the Visine.
-Oh, I just doing a lying biz.
It was just my lying gig to try to beat the system.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Really?
So that was really all-- none of it was true?
-And he said, it doesn't matter to me.
Your bod-- your body will still be warm for my huge cock.
And he said-- he was choking me and I was holding it like this, and he said, do you want to die, slut?
And I just nodded no.
And then he said, are you gon-- you going to listen to everything I've got to say, have you do?
And I'm just nodded yes.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Then what happened?
-Takes the Visine and he lifts up my legs and he puts what turned out to be rubbing alcohol in the Visine bottle and he sticks some up my rectum area.
And that really hurt real bad, because he tore me up for a while.
And he put some in my vagina, which really hurt bad.
And then he walked around back to the driver's seat-- side and he pulled my nose open like this-- pulled them open and then he squirt rubbing alcohol down my nose.
And he said, I'm saving your eyes for the grand finale.
And he put the Visine back on the dash and I spit in his face.
And he said, you're dead, bitch, you're dead, and he was wiping his eyes.
And I laid down real quick and I grabbed my bag.
And he was starting to come for-- for me when I grabbed my bag and turn-- whipped my pistol out toward him.
And he was coming toward me with his right arm, I believe, and I shot immediately.
And I think I shot twice as fast as I could.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Because in court, you gave such a graphic description of what had happened with Richard Mallory.
-Yeah, after sitting around thinking how I could drum up a story.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): That was pretty convincing.
-Was it?
That's sad.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Well, I thought so.
-God, that's sad.
Well--
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And it's not-- and it's not that you just decided that you wanted to die and you wanted to get it over and done with that you changed your story?
-No.
The reason is, it's serious.
You-- there's no way-- nobody should go in that execution chamber dying on a hope for a lie, and even by the second make it out of this thing on a lie.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
But I hear, you know, that you just couldn't stand being on Death Row after 12 years.
-Nick, and that-- this is the last time I'm going to say it.
You have to kill Aileen Wuornos because she'll kill again.
NICK BROOMFIELD: I had always believed that Aileen Wuornos had acted in self-defense, and that Richard Mallory, her first victim, who had a long history of sex crimes and who had spent five years in an institution for sex offenders, had tortured and tormented Aileen, pushing her over the edge into an insanity which led to the other six murders.
This is what Aileen said to Judge Uriel Blount before the sentencing on the Richard Mallory murder.
-What I did was what anybody else would do.
I defended myself, which everybody has the right to defend themselves.
And I had no intentions of killing anyone.
I would not do that.
Not-- I'm not that type of person.
NICK BROOMFIELD: But the jury didn't go for it.
This was Aileen's reaction on receiving her first death sentence.
COURT OFFICIAL (OFF SCREEN):
Count one, the majority of the jury by a vote of
12-0, advise and recommend to the court that it impose the death penalty upon Aileen Carol
Wuornos, also known as
Susan Lynn Blahovec, also known as Lori
Christine Grody, also known as
Cammie Marsh Greene.
Dated at DeLand,
Volusia County Florida, this 30th day of January 1992.
REPORTER (OFFSCREEN): Hi, Lee.
How do you feel about the verdict?
-Innocent.
And I was raped and I was tortured.
And I-- they had a steering wheel.
They took the steering wheel and it had scratches all over it and it was broken.
And it proved that I was tied to that steering wheel.
And I cannot believe-- I cannot believe what happened.
REPORTER (OFF SCREEN): Why did this jury find you guilty?
-I think it's the media coverage.
It's a conspiracy.
NICK BROOMFIELD: I couldn't believe what happened the next day in court, Aileen objecting to her own witnesses.
-Um, and-- and I need to get this on record, if I could.
JUDGE (OFF SCREEN):
She's taking it down.
-OK.
Uh, the-- there's some witnesses that are coming.
JUDGE (OFF SCREEN): Yes, ma'am.
-And I've already told my attorneys on numerous occasions these people did not grow up with me at all.
Um, they lived in the neighborhood, but they didn't really associate with me, my brother, and my sister and everybody else.
-Here's the only thing.
The attorney can call them, but he can't put on anyone he thinks is, uh, committing perjury.
That's unethical for him to do that.
If he thinks they're lying-- if he knows that they're lying, he can't put them on.
-OK.
JUDGE (OFF SCREEN): Thank you.
-Thank you.
-Judge?
JUDGE (OFF SCREEN): Yes ma'am--uh, yes, sir.
-May the defense request a, uh, 10 minute recess?
JUDGE (OFF SCREEN): Yeah, OK.
In view of-- OK, in view of those statements.
-I need to confer with my associates.
JUDGE (OFF SCREEN): Of course.
Yeah.
OK, they want to take
10 minutes and confer on what they want to say, OK?
-Yes, sir.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): All right.
We'll be recessed for 10 minutes.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
Aileen was deliberately sabotaging her own defense.
But the witnesses were called anyway.
[background conversation]
NICK BROOMFIELD: Danny
Caldwell, like many of the boys in the neighborhood, lost his virginity to Aileen.
Aileen was trading blow jobs for cigarettes from the age of nine.
-I was just heading over there to see who was there and got up to the fort and the door was kind of closed, so I, you know, opened it up.
And Keith had-- Keith and
Mark had Aileen in there.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
What do you mean that they had
Aileen in there?
-Well, they had her in there and, you know, she was naked and--
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
And-- and what was happening?
-Well, um, Keith was having sex with her.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Did you stay during that?
-Yes.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): Did you ever have sex with Aileen again afterwards?
-Uh, just that day.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Jerry Moss, who was a lover of Aileen's, pretended in public he didn't even know her.
-She-- she wanted us to be boyfriend-girlfriend in public, and I--
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
When-- when you were in public around other kids, when the rest of the kids were around, how did you treat her?
-Like she was nobody.
Like she was dirt.
Like I had nothing to do with her, you know.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
What would you say to her?
-Tell her, get the fuck out of my face and go some fucking place else.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Would you call her any names?
-Call her ugly, bitch.
[deep sigh]
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): If she were following along behind you, what would you do?
-It would, uh, depend on who was with me or whatever.
But I'd turn around and throw rocks at her and tell her to get the fuck out of there, go home.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Why--why would you do that?
-Because I didn't want to be seen with her.
I didn't want to be associated with her.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): Do you know whether she was having sexual relations with anyone else at this time?
-Yes, I do.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
And who was that?
-Um, her-- her brother, Keith.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Is that her uncle?
Or is that her actual biological--
-That's her actual-- actual brother.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): I just want to make sure that, you know.
-I just wanted to remark that they need to take a polygraph on what their saying because there's too much perjury going on.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): All right.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
Michelle Chauvin recalled an incident with
Aileen's grandfather.
-Raise your right hand.
-I don't know how much you want me to say.
He was a bastard.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
Do you recall an incident when you and Aileen skipped school?
-Yes.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN):
What happened when-- did you go to
Aileen's house with her?
-Um, I walked home with her and we had gotten caught.
And I remember looking through the front-- they had a screen door view.
And the minute she walked in, he had her over a chair.
And I stood there and watched him.
And he beat the hell out of her with a black belt that was around his waist.
He took it off and told her to lean over the chair, and walloped on her for a good five minutes.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): Was this what you would call a spanking?
-Oh, no.
No.
It was like, I was-- it left me hypnotized.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): Did he know you were watching?
-Yeah, he did.
He was aware I was watching.
PROSECUTOR (OFFSCREEN): Is that, uh, just an example as to--
-That's an example, yes.
NICK BROOMFIELD: It had been a long week, all the witnesses stuck together in this motel.
-Do you think we'd all go mad if we were locked up here much longer together?
-Well, I'm getting tired of it.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Dawn insisted that gays hadn't been invented when she and Aileen first became friends.
-They weren't invented or whatever.
There was no gay people.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): Well, what were they all doing?
-They weren't gay.
There was no such thing as gay.
-They were in the closet.
-No they weren't There was no such thing.
I don't remember a person at school gay.
I didn't hear this gay stuff until 10 years ago.
Well, maybe 15.
It's just now starting to be acceptable.
But, no, there was not.
Was there gay people when you went to school?
-I'm sure that there probably were.
I went to a British public school, there were many-- that's where it was invented, us and the Greeks, you know?
-No way.
Really?
-Yeah, of course.
-I just have to do this.
Sorry.
Look!
Come on you guys.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
After all that, Aileen decided to volunteer for execution and we all went home.
Now that Aileen was confessing to being a coldblooded killer,
Aileen found she had a lot of new friends.
-Her appeals have been exhausted.
She wants to meet her Creator.
She's on the list.
Absolutely.
REPORTER (OFFSCREEN):
Governor Jeb Bush is expected to sign
Wuornos' warrant soon.
NICK BROOMFIELD: We had all come to this as witnesses, hoping to get Aileen off Death Row.
But it now felt like we were taking part in an execution.
There was talk of making an appeal on the grounds of Aileen's mental competence.
We traveled to Troy,
Michigan, where
Aileen grew up to find out more.
This is Dawn's house.
-Hi, Joan.
How are you?
I think about you a lot.
My kids just come over with the grandbabies, so you get to see them.
-Her granddaughter and her grandson.
-How are you?
NICK BROOMFIELD: Dawn gets up and writes to Aileen at 5 AM every morning.
-I got looking for one thing today, so I figured while I had Aileen's shit out, you can sit here.
-What, all this?
-Yeah, and I got lots of pictures of her brothers and stuff like that, that you might want to look at.
-Really?
-Well, yeah.
-All this?
-All this.
I was looking for her Will.
I couldn't find her Will.
-Her Will?
-Yeah.
OK, here you just sit down for a while.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Aileen does the most amazing ink drawings that you can only see against the light.
-It's because you can't see them by looking down at them, but it's perfect with the sunlight outside.
See how that does that?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Wow.
Have you got any-- any pictures of when she was quite young?
Ah.
-Isn't that kind of funny?
-That is funny, isn't it?
-Oh, that's her sister.
-That's--
-That's her graduation.
-That's Lori?
-Yeah.
That's what she looks like now.
NICK BROOMFIELD: There were other photos, too.
Aileen aged four.
Her brother Keith, age six.
Aileen's biological mother, Diane, who abandoned Aileen when she was six months old.
Aileen's father Leo, who was convicted of kidnapping and sodomizing an eight-year-old boy.
He committed suicide in prison.
Aileen's grandfather Lowry, who she called dad and is rumored to be Aileen's biological father.
He abused both Aileen and her mother.
Aileen, aged 13, when she got pregnant and had a baby boy that was put up for adoption.
After the baby, Aileen became the local untouchable.
She spent two years living in the woods at the end of her street.
DAWN (OFFSCREEN): Aileen used to have a fort back here, as a matter of fact.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): A fort?
DAWN (OFFSCREEN): A fort.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): With Dennis.
DAWN (OFFSCREEN): Uh, yeah.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So Aileen would just sleep rough?
DAWN (OFFSCREEN): Mm-hm.
She would either sleep in the cars or she would go around prostituting at night to keep warm.
Stuff like that.
And, hopefully, she'd get a hotel.
You know, some of these guys would say we'll go get a hotel and she could get a shower.
That's how she washed and stuff like that.
Or she would go to that gas station up there, which is still there by the way, used to be the Clark.
That's-- we used to go in there and pinch our nose and drink what was it?
MALE (OFFSCREEN): Boone's Farm.
-Peppermint schnapps.
It's disgusting.
It's the only way you could drink it to get the quick buzz.
I know it sounds sickening, it was sickening.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): But it must've been freezing in the winter.
-Well, it was for her.
I didn't come out here in the winter, I'm sure.
I don't think none of us did.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): She was out here in the winter?
-Yeah.
That's why she left.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So did the other kids pick on her at all?
-Yeah.
Do you remember where we're at?
Yeah, they always picked on her or she picked on them, because they always had something terrible to say about her.
But that's because she had a baby, and they naturally assumed that she-- well, she did get-- you know, she slept with people for money and all that.
So I imagine the girls in our days probably thought, well, she sleeps with everybody and they just didn't like that.
They don't think it's funny now, though.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
How do you mean?
DAWN (OFFSCREEN): I think it's terrible how they treated her.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Now--
-And everybody all of a sudden comes out of the woodwork and said, oh, I was nice to her.
I gave her clothes and stuff like that.
No they didn't.
NICK BROOMFIELD: We went to visit Dennis Allen, who lived in the woods with Aileen and now lives in this house.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Hi.
-How are you?
-Hi.
How do you do?
I'm Nick.
-Nick?
Dennis.
-Hi.
How do you do?
-Hi.
JOAN (OFFSCREEN: Hi.
I'm Joan.
-Hi, Joan.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Hello.
-Hi.
-And who-- who are these fine creatures?
-Oh, those are my birds.
That's, uh, Freckles and Freda.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Freckles and Freda.
-Mm-hm.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
This is a picture of Dennis, who used to be a cross dresser.
Dennis looked out his only picture of his time in the woods with Aileen.
-Now, it was kind of a mess around there.
In fact, the police took this picture.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Oh, did they?
-That's how I got it.
Yeah, I don't know if you can see--
NICK (OFFSCREEN): What's it of?
-Let me see.
Well, this was when they were subdividing.
They threw all the stumps over in one section and these were all made with stumps with straw packed in around.
This is where I slept.
It was just long enough to get in there and sleep.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And so,
Aileen would come and visit you.
-Yeah.
Every now and then, she'd find one of my camps and come.
In fact, the last camp I was at when Aileen found me was what we called the little round lake.
It was way down at the bottom of a gully and it was round.
And I had a piece of plywood that somebody had left there and I just made a lean-to with two posts and put that up on it.
And that was the last place, in fact,
Aileen-- the last camp she come that I had was that one.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
This is a picture of Chief, the local pedophile.
He's thought to be the father of Aileen's child.
Chief later committed suicide.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): He was like this bit of a strange old man, wasn't he?
-Kind of, yeah.
A lot of people thought he was.
But they were a gathering place there for kids because they had kids from everywhere that came there all the time.
And I remember when
I was little, see,
Chief would want to pick kids up and put them on his lap and he'd talk and tell them about this and that.
And I never would allow it because I just-- he kind of freaked me a little bit.
I can remember one time he had some chicken eggs because he had chickens and all this kind of thing, and he'd pick them open when they were ready to hatch.
And I couldn't stand it, him doing that.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
He'd pick them open?
-He would pick the shells open as they were trying to come through.
He would pick them open and it would be too early for them still, you know.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
And they'd die?
-A lot of times they would.
They weren't really ready to come out of there yet.
They wouldn't live.
-They're still there.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Michelle drove us to Aileen's old home.
They grew up as
Vietnam was ending and drugs were everywhere.
-Aileen's house is right over there.
You want to go by it?
-Yeah.
-OK.
I'll take you by it.
This was Mark Farron's house.
We are all connected together.
We all used to hang in the neighborhood.
You know, all the kids packed together.
This was Terry Cox' house right here.
Um, she used to do a lot of drugs with [bleep] who lived in this little white one.
This is Aileen's house right here.
This is it.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
That's it there?
-That's it.
This is her house.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And when you saw her being beaten.
DAWN (OFFSCREEN): Ah, that door right there.
I was in front of that door.
See, they've redid the house since then.
But that room in the very back is her bedroom.
Not the first one, but the one in the back.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And that's where she was being--
DAWN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
This one.
The second window.
And see how low they are?
She used-- she used to climb right out of them.
If somebody sees us in there, they will come out and raise hell, because I'm--
Corey was with me when that happened last time.
And [bleep] lived right here.
And they were druggies also.
We used to hang together and go over there and smoke pot and do what not and get in all kinds of shit.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): But lots of different drugs?
-Yes!
Lots of, um, pills actually.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Pills?
-LSD, mescaline, blotter acid.
Um--
NICK BROOMFIELD: Aileen, age 16, left Michigan and traveled down here to Florida looking for sun and friends.
She was young and pretty, earning good money as a hooker, but with a violent temper and soon in trouble.
She knocked one man out with a beer bottle, another with a billiard ball.
She particularly liked it here near Daytona Beach.
This is one of the motels, the Fairview, where she frequently stayed.
It was all so new and exciting.
Just down the road is the Last Resort biker bar, where Aileen liked to hang out.
She was allegedly great friends with the Human Bomb.
[all counting together]
[explosion]
[cheering and applause]
-How do you feel?
-Real dizzy right now.
Real dizzy.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Did you know Lee well?
-Yeah.
Uh, can I talk to ya'll in a few minutes?
I gotta walk this off.
NICK BROOMFIELD: After
Keith, her brother, died of cancer at age 21,
Aileen surprised everyone by marrying this man, Lewis
Fell; who was 76 years old and President of the
Keystone Coal Company.
But after only a month, Lewis filed for restraining charges after Aileen beat Lewis with his own walking stick.
In her late 20s,
Aileen gave up on men and started dating women.
Here's Tyria, who became Aileen's family.
They lived together for over three years.
This was one of the homes they had.
Aileen saw herself as a kind of Bonnie and Clyde character on the run with her lover, Tyria.
Aileen and Tyria's favorite pastime was drinking beer and firing their pistols in the woods.
Aileen got books on being a survivalist.
She wanted Tyria all to herself.
Tyria described
Aileen as a fantasist, who became jealous and possessive, and who could be violent and frightening.
In the end, Tyria ran off as the police were closing in.
In loneliness and desperation, Aileen ended up with this man, Dick Mills.
-This is that paper you're talking about?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
It's-- it's called "My Sex
Romps with Kinky Mankiller."
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Dick had sold his story to the "News of the World."
-All I want to know is, who's the best lawyer out there, man, to sue them for this trash?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Can I quote--
-I never even talked that shit.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Can
I quote you a bit?
And get-- if you said this, right?
We were lying in bed one night when she started talking about her favorite sexual fantasies.
She said she often got turned on by imagining she had a black hood over her head and was tied to a tree in a forest.
Then a guy would come up, rape her, and shoot her in the head.
She said the actual killing would make her climax.
I was real sickened by what she said.
-Wrong.
Wrong.
There's partial truth to that.
But most of that, I don't know where it came from or who got it or nothing about it.
And you can check any film anywhere in the country or anybody that's got it.
I never said that, OK?
It goes along the lines that she told me one time that the idea was that she'd like to lay in bed out in the middle of the forest, the woods or somewhere in the mountains or something.
Have a hood over her head or something, and somebody crawl in through the window.
No-- they had the hood on or something, and would rape or this and that kind of shit and she'd like that.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
I mean, did you--
-As far as all these other things go pertaining to it, there's no reality to it.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Did you get any feeling that she hated men, or?
-No, I just got the feeling she is what she was, a dyke.
Except I didn't know she was a killer.
There's no way I could know that.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
I mean, could you tell that when you made love to her, or?
-Nah, not particularly.
She just probably liked it either way, whatever came along.
Didn't really seem to matter much.
It's just another bad experience,
I'm sure, for both of us.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
This is Aileen when first charged with the murders.
It was just after the phone conversations with Tyria that had led her to confess.
What Aileen didn't know was that
Tyria, herself, was involved in movie discussions involving Florida State
Police and production companies in Hollywood.
They were selling her story, the story of America's first female serial killer.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN):
You understand the nature of the charges?
-Yes, I do, sir.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): Do you wish to be represented by counsel?
-Yes, I do.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): Can you afford to hire an attorney?
-No, sir.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): Do you work?
-No.
I'm in jail.
How can I work?
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): Well, obviously you're not working now, but how long has it been since you've last worked?
-Oh, about, um, '84, possibly.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN): You haven't worked in six or seven years?
How do-- how do you support yourself?
-I was a special call girl.
NICK BROOMFIELD: When Sergeant
Brian Jarvis, who is now police chief in New York
State, objected to these movie discussions, he was taken off the Wuornos case.
-Right, I was actually transferred back into the patrol division.
It had followed a month of continual harassment on the job in the current position I was in, which ultimately started when
Captain Binegar had realized that I found out about their plan to work with Tyria Moore in obtaining a movie rights package.
NICK BROOMFIELD: The state attorney's report found that three of Jarvis' fellow officers, Captain
Binegar, Sergeant Munster, and Major Dan Henry were involved in movie discussions with Tyria Moore after Aileen's arrest.
-Yeah, ultimately when the--when the arrest came,
Lee Wuornos was charged with the murder and Tyria
Moore was not charged with anything.
But she was made a state's witness and she was working with these fellow officers on obtaining movie rights.
NICK BROOMFIELD: This note was them pinned under Sergeant
Jarvis's back door and his home burgled.
-Less than a month later, on November 25, my wife had gone out to the post office and the store during daylight hours, like
10 o'clock in the morning.
When she came home, the house had been broken into.
The doors were ajar.
She went up to my office and all of the files on the Wuornos case, on the investigators, and all the information
I had had been trashed.
Nothing else had been touched in the house.
REPORTER (OFFSCREEN):
How do you feel, Aileen?
-Bust these crooked cops and their conspiracy, please!
REPORTER (OFFSCREEN):
Are you afraid, Aileen?
-I'm innocent.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Aileen was right about the cops and their movie deals.
But in her paranoia, she also believed that the police had known about the first murder but allowed her to become a serial killer, because then they'd get more money for their film deals.
Aileen's lawyers are challenging the execution on the grounds of her mental competence.
Not that executing insane people seems to be a problem.
In 1989, the Supreme
Court ruled it was not unconstitutional to execute the mentally impaired.
Aileen's paranoid delusions have gotten much worse on Death Row.
She now believes her mind is being controlled by radio waves beamed into her cell.
-Aileen Wuornos says her food is being tainted and she's being threatened with rape.
-CBS 4's Joan Murray is live in
Fort Lauderdale with the story.
John Joan.
-Well, now she has written a 25-page letter where she names names, names security-- or rather guards at the prison where she was being held in Pembroke
Pines accusing them of harassing her while she awaits execution.
-And I need some-- an attorney, like a private attorney to oversee my well-being until my execution.
Maybe that would keep things kind of in line because there's a lot of illegalness going on.
NICK BROOMFIELD: It's actually pretty hard to help Aileen, who by now, not surprisingly, doesn't trust anyone.
And she's threatening to fire her lawyer if he continues to try to fight the execution.
Dawn told Aileen about our visit to Troy.
And Aileen asked for the opportunity to put the record straight about her childhood.
-All right.
Yep.
Will-- will you let me know when she is?
OK.
You don't have any secret cameras in your belt, do you?
-Oh, no.
I just have this rather large one right here.
[INDISTINCT YELLING FROM
INMATES]
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Hello.
-Hello!
Hey, how you doing?
Good to see you.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Hi.
It's good to see you.
-Hi, Nick.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Hi, how are you?
-I'm doing all right.
How you doing?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Good.
-Check out the orange shirt.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Wasn't it orange-- wasn't it orange before?
-No, they changed it.
It was-- there-- they got this new thing to wear the orange shirt out for Iraq or wherever-- whenever you get out of your cell, like-- like Death Row has never escaped.
Nobody on Death Row has ever escaped, right?
And they're acting like we're escape risks or something.
-What-- what it's like being here all the time?
-What's it like being in here?
Well, here it's OK.
It's all right.
But, you know, you have your problems with some staff don't like you--
[laughs]
Oh, you're a serial killer, you know, biz and stuff.
And so they-- you know, some staff won't treat you right because of who you are.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Have you got any friends?
-You can't be in control of everybody.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Have you got any friends here at all?
-No, I stick to myself.
I just stick in-- in the cell with myself.
I don't even care about going outdoors.
There's nothing out there.
I don't smoke anymore, so.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So what's you're day like?
How does it start?
-I spend 24/7 in the cell watching TV, reading the Bible, writing letters to Dawn.
Um, sitting around doing a lot of thinking, preparing.
Think-- memory-- going back in time, memory of all-- everything I've been through in my life and then just preparing for my death.
Get all the tears out of me and stuff so I won't cry and that sort of jazz, you know.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
So you won't cry?
-Because it is going to be a little bit tough when I go.
Huh?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Getting all the tears out of you?
-Yeah.
Because I just don't want to be in the execution chamber crying my eyes out, and
I'm not going to.
I'm going to tough it out as tough as I can.
Just lay on the table, give everybody a little smile, and close my eyes and go.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
With Richard Mallory, he was the first that you killed?
-Mm-hm.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Did he abuse you or not?
Because in the court you said that, you know--
-Aw, see, I'm not going to go into the-- wait a minute.
Ow.
No, I won't go in-- I won't go into the murder.
I won't go into the murders if it was self-defense or not.
I'm not going into any of the murders.
Whether or not they died in self-defense or what,
I'm not going to say.
I'm not saying nothing.
My concern-- the only reason
I'm doing interviews for anybody or anything-- my concern is there's-- you've got law enforcement out there allowing people to die.
You got those 50 men in
Canada-- I mean, those 50 women in Canada that died, I'm sure the cops knew who the guy was.
They're letting them kill.
They want to turn them into high-profile cases for books and movies.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Well, what was it-- so what was it--
NICK BROOMFIELD: I wondered how Aileen, herself, viewed her childhood in Troy.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): -quite nice living there?
-Yeah.
Troy's all right.
Oh, and I want to straighten out something, man.
See-- hey, Nick, I've got to get this straightened out.
See, the cops lied about my family, Jackie, Drew, and them.
They all lied about my--
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Well, how did they lie about your family?
-Because see-- OK, now I got-- see,
I got-- if this documentation, I got to square some stuff up here.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): OK, so tell me about your family.
-OK.
The truth about my family is this.
My dad was so straight and so clean he wouldn't even wear-- take his shirt off to mow the lawn.
He did not believe in cussing.
He did not believe in-- in, uh, long hair and mini skirts and stuff.
He was really straight, really decent.
And so was my mom.
My mom hated swearing in the house.
If you swore-- if you said one swear word, you had a whole bar of
Lava soap in your mouth.
So I came from a real clean and decent family.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
But why, then, did you get thrown out after the birth?
-See, after my mom died-- after my mom died, my dad got pissed.
He's like, OK, this is the last straw, you know?
I think you are the cause of mom's death because she had physical problems that-- because of all the stress and the pain and suffering and everything.
And what I'm going through as a wild kid is pissing him off.
I mean, he thinks that that killed her as well, induced her death, and so he's pissed off.
And he doesn't want me home anymore.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And how-- how did it feel, like, having to live in cars and in other people's house?
-It was living hell.
That's why I went to Florida.
[aileen laughs]
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Living hell?
-Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, sleeping in the snow.
I mean, sleeping in snowy weather in a vehicle on cinder blocks at Richie's house.
Sleeping in it with no blank-- I think I had one blanket and one pillow and it's ice cold outside.
That's when I said, well, I got to go.
I got it down to
Florida or something now, because I was sleeping in the snow.
Out in the woods sleeping on the ground in the snow.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): You must have been frozen.
-I was frozen, man.
Yeah.
I still got marks where my toes are blue to this day, and the bottom of my feet are blue.
And this is probably why I even got my hands like this today.
I don't know.
My hands are-- as you can see, they're like they're frostbit looking.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And how were the other kids, though?
-How-- the other kids?
They were all living in their houses.
[aileen laughs]
While I was out on the streets.
But that's all right, man.
Because, see, I lived through it.
I survived.
I went down to Florida.
And then I could-- you know, started trekking all over the United
States of America and stuff.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Aileen, let me ask you one question.
Do you think if you hadn't had to leave your home and sleep in the cars and stuff it would have worked out differently?
-Now, if I could do my life all over again and I came from a background of a family that was right on, where-- I-- I mean, my family was right on.
When I was thinking that I meant as far as my mom not dying, my dad not freaking out, and us-- if I could do it all over again, my family died too young, I had to hit the road.
And I came from a family that was supportive, we didn't have split sister-- half-sister and brother stuff and all that.
It was all true blood, real blood and everything was financially stable and everybody was really tight,
I would have became more than likely an outstanding citizen of America who was-- who would have either been an archaeologist, a paramedic, a police officer, a fire department gal, or an undercover worker for DEA, or arch-- did I say archaeology?
Or-- oh, or a missionary.
Because I believe in God, but
I'm not a Christian freak.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So you think it would've--
-And so scrub missionary, because I'm just-- I'm just thinking what-- you know,
I would've came from a decent,
I would've done it real decent and stuff.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Let me ask you something.
What-- what do you think was the single most happy time in your life?
What-- what do you think you've enjoyed most?
[aileen sighs]
-Nick, I've been through so much hell I can't even think of something there right now.
And I'm so burning fucking mad about how I'm being-- I got to wait for my execution!
I want to get in the fucking chamber tomorrow and leave.
And then they play-- since-- since I waved off,
I've had nothing but psychological and physical fucking problems playing with it because I'm on hold with my execution.
I'm so fucking mad I can't see straight.
And they're just daring me to kill again.
They got me pissed.
United States Supreme Court, you fucking-- I'm telling you, man!
You motherfuckers keep fucking with my goddamn execution, there's going to be bloodshed.
I'm sick of this!
Get that fucking warrant signed.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Aileen waited until she thought we weren't filming to talk about the murders.
AILEEN (OFF CAMERA):
I can't do it.
I would never be able to handle a life sentence or anything.
And then they've said other things that are really crazy.
They do crazy things to people while they're incarcerated.
I'd never be able to handle it, so I'm going for the death.
I have to because they're too evil.
They're too evil to people incarcerated.
And they're too evil on the cases.
They're so corrupt it's not funny, so I've got to go down.
I have to.
That's why I can't say nothing about self-defense on tape or anything.
-But was it self-defense?
AILEEN (OFF CAMERA): Huh?
-Was it self-defense?
AILEEN (OFF CAMERA): What?
-Was it self-defense?
AILEEN (OFF CAMERA): What?
-Was it self-defense.
AILEEN (OFF CAMERA): Yes, but I can't tell anybody.
Never.
I have to go down to the execution.
They're too corrupt.
They-- they-- they stick together.
Hand over fist, hand in glove, man.
-So, it was self--
AILEEN (OFF CAMERA): Let's see.
Hand-- hand over fist, friend in glove.
-So was-- wasn't there any self-defense?
AILEEN (OFF CAMERA): Yeah.
And so was some others.
But there's nothing
I can do about it.
All they'd do is give me an overturned sentence.
They would never do me righteous.
You see what I'm saying?
Never do me right.
They'll only fuck me over some more, so I can only go to the death.
-You know, I'm going to always remember you and love you.
-Yeah, Aileen.
-I love you so much, man.
Take care of yourself.
-All right.
-And nice meeting you.
Take care.
-Nice to meet you.
Take care.
-Goodbye, Aileen.
Bye.
-See you later!
NICK BROOMFIELD:
Six months later, this announcement was made.
REPORTER (OFFSCREEN):
Governor Jeb Bush signs death warrants scheduling executions.
44-year-old Aileen Wuornos is one of the nation's first known female serial killers.
She will be executed October
9 for the murders of six men.
Wuornos has dropped all of her appeals.
-I did it because, uh, I believe in the death penalty and I have a duty to implement the law.
And a great majority of Floridians want their governor to do this.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Jeb Bush is running for reelection on a law and order pro death penalty ticket.
Aileen's execution date for October 9 fits him perfectly, a month before these elections.
Brad Thomas, Jeb Bush's political adviser, is reported as saying, we want to become more like Texas.
Bring in the witnesses, put them on a gurney, and let's rock and roll.
We're driving to meet Diane Wuornos,
Aileen's biological mother.
They haven't laid eyes on each for 25 years.
This is Calumet, a copper mining town on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
The Wuornos family originally came here as immigrants from Oulu in
Finland to work down the mines.
-OK, let me fix my pillow again.
OK, I want to tell you, I'm probably going to cry a little.
I want to tell you something about her birth.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): OK.
-She was a frank breech birth, that means bottom first.
And a breech birth is very dangerous.
And that's feet first, and a frank breech, bottom first, is really very bad.
The doctor even called in other people to watch it because it was so unusual.
But I thought maybe that she got some kind of brain damage during that birth.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
-And that may have cau-- while she's mentally competent, it may have caused her problems.
What does Aileen think about what caused her to act like that?
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Well, originally, she said she did it in self-defense.
And then she said she just needed the money.
And she says that if she'd, you know, come from a home that wasn't split and--
-Oh, because her-- her father and me getting a divorce.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): I-- she didn't say that.
But I think, um, I think she's confused.
Because she, on the one hand, says she-- says it had nothing to do with her childhood.
But then on the other hand, she was sleeping out in the snow for a while and living in the woods.
-She was sleeping in the snow and living in the woods?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Mm-hm.
Immediately after she had the baby.
-I know nothing about that.
I never heard
Barry tell me that.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
After she had the baby, she couldn't-- she couldn't move back into the house with your father.
-Yeah.
-Then she was living in the woods in the snow.
-Didn't agenc-- agency find her and take-- take care of her?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): No.
And then she ended up, you know, hitchhiking around.
-Which she liked.
Do you know the exact date of the execution?
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
I think it's soon.
-OK.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): I think it's very soon.
-I think I'll rest better.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
As we were leaving,
Diane asked for
Aileen's forgiveness.
I heard Aileen just fired her lawyer.
I drove to Stark, Florida, where the execution will happen.
And to meet Dawn, who's doing the funeral arrangements.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
So what does Aileen want to wear, again, for the execution?
-Um, a black Harley
Davidson t-shirt with wings, because she believes she's earned her wings, which she has.
A pair of jeans.
A pair of boots with, um, corner toes.
And a military belt.
I think that's it actually.
She might have something else on that, I don't know.
Probably a leather jacket if I know Aileen.
I know if she can or not, but.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): No other wishes that she make?
-You mean to be-- afterwards?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Mm-hm.
-To be cremated and come home to my house, be around the people that love her.
Why would she want to stay in Florida?
Hmm-mm.
She's coming home to Michigan.
NICK BROOMFIELD:
Aileen's ex-lawyer made a last minute plea to stop the execution.
But Jeb Bush was not going to be stopped.
-Based on his concerns, uh, we're going to, um, ask three psychiatrists to, um, analyze her to make sure that she's fit for the execution, which is a duty that I have.
And I intend to do it.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Jeb ordered a stay of execution, but guess what?
His psychiatrists examined
Aileen for just 15 minutes, and then gave the thumbs up to go ahead.
-Lynn Gordon is in our newsplex now with the latest details.
Lynn.
-Laurie, we have just learned that Governor Jeb Bush has lifted the stay of execution for serial killer Aileen Wuornos.
She has been found to be mentally competent.
That means she will be executed next Wednesday.
NICK BROOMFIELD: Aileen's given up the opportunity to do a mass press conference and has asked me to do her last interview.
I'm sure that's because she wants me to communicate her ideas about what she calls the crooked cops.
The last interview, dumb rules like I've got to stand behind this rope.
There'll be 15 guards, including the warden, in attendance.
And Aileen, for no good reason, will wear shackles throughout the interview.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
She-- is he on her way?
-Pardon?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Is she on her way, or?
-Not yet.
NICK BROOMFIELD: It's been proven that the death penalty is absolutely no deterrent.
States without the death penalty, in fact, have lower murder rates.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Hi, Aileen.
Hi.
-Hi.
You know, I already told you everything, so you know, you just go ahead and ask me questions.
And if I want to answer them, I'll answer them, OK?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): OK.
So-- so I-- I guess, you know,
I was just wondering how you're going to be, you know, at 9:30 tomorrow morning?
Are you prepared?
-I'm prepared.
I'm all right.
I'm all right with it.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And how--
-I'm all right with it.
But, like I said, remember and tell-- let them know that I know that the cops knew who
I was after Richard
Mallory died.
I left prints everywhere and they covered it and let me kill the rest of those guys to turn me into a serial killer.
I know they did because I was no professional serial killer or anything, murderer or whatever you want to call it.
Wasn't specialize, what I was doing.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So,
Aileen, how--how--
-Did some sloppy work, you know, and I left prints.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
-how have you prepared yourself for tomorrow morning?
-How?
I'm all right with it.
Hey, I'm ready to go.
Hey, I was tortured at BCI.
They had-- they had the intercom on in the room and they kept lying that it wasn't on.
And they were using sonic pressure on my head since 1997.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Sonic pressure?
-And every time I was trying to write something, they-- and I think they had some kind of eye in the cell,
I'm not sure.
But every time I started writing something, it went up higher.
So I'm thinking that they probably had the TV rigged.
The TV or the mirror or something was rigged.
They got a huge satellite on the compound.
After they put the huge satellite on the compound, it could have been either rigged to the TV set or the mirror or something, because the electrician, when he put the mirror on the wall, he said, doesn't that look like a computer?
The back of it, and he stuck it to the wall.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And do you-- did that affect your mind, do you think?
-Huh?
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Did that affect your mind in some way, the sonic?
-It was crushing i my head in.
They were using sonic pressure continually.
Then when I had three meetings with Miss Villacorta on it, every meeting I had she increased the pressure of the volume of the com, increased the harassment on the floor, increased the trays being inedible.
Just increased every bit of my complaints and trashed all grievances.
They're trying to make it look like I was crazy at all times, rig up the room with torture.
If I said anything about-- their whole--
I think their whole plan was to try and make it look like I was totally crazy and so nobody wouldn't believe anything
I had to say about anything.
And then drive me there, if they could.
I suffered so bad.
I was really struggling to survive.
Had a lot of trays that were attempted murder and everything.
I had to wash all my food off.
And then one day, I didn't wash my food off and I was sick for three weeks, almost died.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
But you're OK now?
-I'm OK.
I'm OK.
God is going to be there.
Jesus Christ is going to be there.
All the angels and everything.
And, you know, whatever-- whatever's on the beyond.
I think it's going to be more like "Star Trek," beaming me up into a space vehicle, man.
Then I move on, recolonize to another planet or whatever.
But it's-- whatever's beyond,
I know it's going to be good because I didn't do anything as wrong as they said.
I did the right thing.
And I saved a lot of people's butts from getting hurt and raped and killed, too.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So are you saying that you killed in self-defense or in-- in cold blood?
What do-- what do-- because you've changed your story.
I'm just trying to--
-What are you ta-- talking about?
Changed the story on what?
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
No, about whether it was self-defense or not.
-I'm not going to say in-- I'm not going to get into depth about my cases, Nick.
I'm on my way to the chamber.
Nothing's stopping it.
You can believe it or you don't have to believe it.
That's up to you, man.
Put a big question mark on your film.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Just before we came here, we met with your-- with your mother, Diane.
-You met with my brother and Diane?
I could give a--
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
Your--your mother.
-Oh.
My mother, Diane, let me tell you something.
She plopped me out of her belly, left me with my grandparents, and we never knew her.
So tell that damn whore I could give a fuck if she even had me.
She had me and left to Texas.
And my mom, my dad, Barry,
Keith, Lori, all of us never saw her ever again, accept at funerals.
My mom's funeral, my dad's funeral, and my brother's funeral.
And if she's at mine, sp-- I'll probably be spitting on her.
I could care less.
I don't give a damn about that whore.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Well, she-- she ask you--
-I don't know her!
I never even knew her.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): She asked you for your forgiveness.
-She can go to hell.
She doesn't have any of my forgiveness.
I don't know-- I don't even know her, don't even want to know her.
My only interview concerns are about cops letting me kill.
So if you don't ask me about that,
I'm going to cut this interview.
Ask me about the cops.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): What do--
I mean, what more is there to-- what more is there to say about the cops?
What more do you want to say about the cops?
-A lot of stuff.
Did you know that they were surveilling me before I killed, and that I knew it?
And that was covered up.
Did you know there was helicopters dropping down from the sky, deputy sheriff with decoys picking me up four or five months before my arrest?
It was covered up?
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
But nonetheless--
-Nobody ever asked me these questions.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): -whether the cops were following you or not,
Aileen--
-Oh, whether the cops were following me or not,
Aileen, what?
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
OK, let's say-- let's say the cops were following you.
-Yeah.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Let's say they were following you--
-Uh-huh.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): -and they did everything that you're-- you're saying they did.
-Uh-huh.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Nonetheless, you killed seven men.
-Yeah, sure did.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
And I'm asking you what got you to kill the seven men?
-And I'm telling you because the cops let me keep killing them,
Nick.
Don't you get it?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Not everybody is killing seven people, so there must have been something in you that was getting you to do that.
-Oh, you are lost, Nick!
NICK (OFFSCREEN): So explain.
-I was a hitchhiking hooker!
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Right.
-Running into trouble,
I shoot-- shoot the guy if I ran into trouble.
Physical trouble.
The cops knew it.
When the physical trouble came along, let them-- let her clean the streets and then we'll pull her in.
That's why.
JUDGE (OFFSCREEN):
But how come there was so much physical trouble and just-- because it was all in one year.
Seven people in one year.
-Oh, well.
Oh, well.
NICK (OFFSCREEN):
But why not say now?
-Because I'm-- out of retaliation for taking my life like this and getting rich off it all these years and-- and total pathological lying.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
I lost my fucking life because of it.
Couldn't even get a fair trial.
Couldn't even get a fair investigation or nothing.
Couldn't even have my appeals right.
You sabotaged my ass, society, and the cops and the system.
A raped woman got executed and was used for books and movies and shit.
Ladder climbs, re-election, everything else.
I got to flip the finger in all your faces, thanks a lot.
You're inhuman-- you're an inhumane bunch of fucking living bastards and bitches, and you're going to get your asses nuked in the end.
And pretty soon it's coming.
2019, Iraq's supposed to hit you anyhow.
You're all going to get nuked.
You don't take fucking human life like this and just sabotage it and rip it apart like Jesus on the cross and say, thanks a lot for all the fucking money I made off of ya.
And not care about a human being and the truth being told.
Now I know what Jesus was going through.
I've been trying to tell the truth and I keep getting stepped on, concerned about if I was raped, if I-- I'm not giving you m-- book and movie info.
I'm giving you info for investigations and stuff and that's it.
We're going to have cut this interview, Nick.
I'm not going to go into anymore detail.
I'm leaving, I'm glad.
Thanks a lot society for railroading my ass.
OK, let's go.
You dirty son of a bitches.
Took a raped woman and sent her to-- well, you sent her to God.
But you're going to get your nuke someday soon.
NICK (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Aileen?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
-Nice try, Nick.
And thanks a lot.
NICK BROOMFIELD: It was really pretty incredible that Aileen had just sailed through the psychiatric tests the day before.
It makes you wonder what you would have to do to fail.
Later that night, Dawn met
Aileen for her last meal,
Kentucky Fried Chicken and french fries.
She was limited to a $20 budget.
-She's sorry, Nick, that she-- she didn't give you the finger.
She gave the media the finger, and then the attorneys the finger.
She didn't give you the, uh, finger.
And she knew if she said much more that it could make a-- make a difference on her execution tomorrow.
So she just decided not to.
OK?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): They thought-- she thought they might not execute her if she said--
-Yeah.
She's afraid-- she's afraid of something jeopardizing her ex-- you know, execution in the morning.
OFFICER (OFFSCREEN):
Keep going, ma'am!
Don't stop!
[muffled pa announcements]
-At 8 o'clock, time ticking away for serial killer Aileen
Wuornos.
-Her date with death set for about 90 minutes from now,
7's Patrick Fraser is live in Raiford as her sentence is about to be carried out.
Good morning, Patrick.
-Christina, in an hour and a half exactly Aileen Wuornos will be injected with a poison.
Within about two minutes, she will begin to stop breathing.
Now, it's tough to say who will be happier that she is dying, the families of the victims she brutally murdered or Aileen Wuornos.
-We did wake her up at 5:30.
She, uh, um, requested a towel and wash cloth to wash her face and freshen up.
And she is very calm this morning.
Not-- not as talkative as she has been in the past.
NICK BROOMFIELD: It was hoped
Aileen would confess all to a priest before execution, but she remained angry and defiant to the very end.
Aileen sent the priest packing, and then knelt down and prayed for her victims, believing they might be too evil to be accepted by God.
--talk about dying and--
NICK (OFFSCREEN): She did talk about dying at all.
REPORTER (OFFSCREEN):
What about remorse?
NICK (OFFSCREEN): And it was ver-- all she wanted to do was talk about the police.
And I--I-- you know, I just formed the impression that here was somebody who is-- has obviously lost her mind, has totally lost touch with reality, and we're executing a person who's mad.
And I don't really know what kind of message that-- that gives.
I found it very disturbing.
[background conversations]
-We're going to have a briefing.
We're going to have a briefing then the witnesses.
-Is everybody ready?
-Good.
-At 9:47 this morning, the case of "The State of Florida versus Aileen Wuornos" was carried out at Florida State
Prison in a very professional and humane manner.
During Aileen Wuornos' brief one-minute final statement, she alluded to the fact of-- that she would be sailing away with the Rock.
She'll be back with Jesus Christ like on "Independence Day," on June 6, just like the movie, on the big mothership.
I'll be back.
I'll be back.

/SubEdit b. 3946 (http://subedit. prv. pl)/
Is this chart at a reasonable height for you?
Or do you want it lowered?
- Fine.
- All right.
Earlier tonight...
Let me first ask the TV.
Are you ready?
All set?
Let me hear your voice level, so it's the same.
- How's my voice level?
- That's fine.
Terrific.
Now, I remember exactly the sentence I left off on.
I remember how it started, and I was cut off in the middle.
You can fix it up.
I don't want to go back, because
I know exactly what I wanted to say.
- Go ahead!
- Okay.
Any military commander who is honest with himself...
...or with those he's speaking to will admit...
...that he has made mistakes in the application of military power.
He's killed people, unnecessarily.
His own troops or other troops.
Through mistakes, through errors of judgment.
A hundred, or thousands, or tens of thousands, maybe even 100,000.
But he hasn't destroyed nations.
And the conventional wisdom is...
...don't make the same mistake twice.
Learn from your mistakes.
And we all do. Maybe we make the same mistake three times...
...but hopefully not four or five.
There'll be no learning period with nuclear weapons.
Make one mistake and you're gonna destroy nations.
In my life, I've been part of wars.
Three years in the U.S. Army during World War II.
Seven years as secretary of defense during the Vietnam War.
Thirteen years at the World Bank.
Across the world.
At my age, 85...
...I'm at an age where I can look back...
...and derive some conclusions about my actions.
My rule has been, "try to learn. "
Try to understand what happened.
Develop the lessons and pass them on.
This is the secretary of defense of the United States, Robert McNamara.
His department absorbs 10 percent of the income of this country...
...and over half of every tax dollar.
His job has been called the toughest in Washington...
...and he is the most controversial figure that has ever held the job.
Walter Lippmann calls him both the best secretary of defense...
...and the first one to ever assert civilian control over the military.
His critics call him a "con man,"
"an IBM machine with legs"...
..."an arrogant dictator. "
Mr. Secretary, I've noticed in several cabinet offices...
...that little silver calendar thing there.
Can you explain that?
Yes, this was given by President Kennedy.
...24, 25, 26, 27, and finally 28, were the dates...
...when we literally look ed down the gun barrel into nuclear war.
Under a cloak of deceit...
...the Soviet Union introduced nuclear missiles...
...into Cuba...
...targeting 90 million Americans.
The CIA said the warheads had not been delivered yet.
They thought 20 were coming on a ship named the Poltava.
We mobilized 180,000 troops.
The first day's air attack was planned at 1080 sorties...
...a huge air attack.
Kennedy was trying to keep us out of war.
I was trying to help him keep us out of war.
And General Curtis LeMay, whom I served under...
...as a matter of fact, in World War II, was saying:
" Let's go in.
Let's totally destroy Cuba. "
On that critical Saturday,
October 27th...
...we had two Khrushchev messages in front of us.
One had come in Friday night, and it had been dictated...
...by a man who was either drunk, or under tremendous stress.
Basically, he said, " If you'll guarantee you won't invade Cuba...
...we'll take the missiles out. "
Then, before we could respond, we had a second message...
...that had been dictated by a bunch of hard-liners.
And it said, in effect, " If you attack...
...we're prepared...
...to confront you with masses of military power. "
So, what to do? We had the soft message and the hard message.
At the elbow of President Kennedy was Tommy Thompson...
...former U.S. Ambassador to Moscow.
He and Jane, his wife, had lived with
Khrushchev and his wife on occasion.
Tommy Thompson said,
" Mr. President...
...I urge you to respond to the soft message. "
The president said to Tommy,
"We can't. That'll get us nowhere. "
Tommy said,
" Mr. President, you're wrong. "
Now, that takes a lot of guts.
In Thompson's mind was this thought:
" Khrushchev's gotten himself in a hell of a fix. "
He would then think to himself,
" My God...
...if I can get out of this with a deal that I can say to the Russian people:
'Kennedy was going to destroy
Castro and I prevented it. "'
Thompson, knowing Khrushchev as he did, thought:
" Khrushchev will accept that. "
And Thompson was right.
That's what I call empathy.
We must try to put ourselves inside their skin...
...and look at us through their eyes...
...just to understand the thoughts...
...that lie behind their decisions and their actions.
Khrushchev's advisors were saying:
"There can be no deal...
...unless you somewhat reduce the pressure on us...
...when you ask us to reduce the pressure on you. "
Also, we had attempted to invade Cuba.
Well, with the Bay of Pigs. That undoubtedly influenced their thinking.
I think that's correct.
But more importantly, from a Cuban and a Russian point of view...
...they knew what, in a sense,
I really didn't know.
We had attempted to assassinate Castro...
...under Eisenhower and Kennedy, and later, under Johnson.
And in addition to that, major voices in the U.S. Were calling for invasion.
In the first message,
Khrushchev said this:
"We and you ought not pull on the ends of a rope...
...which you have tied the knots of war.
Because the more the two of us pull...
...the tighter the knot will be tied.
And then it will be necessary to cut that knot...
...and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you.
I have participated in two wars and know that war ends...
...when it has rolled through cities and villages...
...everywhere sowing death and destruction.
For such is the logic of war.
If people do not display wisdom...
...they will clash like blind moles...
...and then mutual annihilation will commence. "
I want to say, and this is very important:
At the end, we lucked out.
It was luck that prevented nuclear war.
We came that close to nuclear war at the end.
Rational individuals.
Kennedy was rational.
Khrushchev was rational.
Castro was rational.
Rational individuals came that close to total destruction of their societies.
And that danger exists today.
The major lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis is this:
The indefinite combination of human fallibility...
...and nuclear weapons will destroy nations.
Is it right and proper...
...that today there are 7500 strategic offensive nuclear warheads...
...of which 2500 are on 15-minute alert...
...to be launched by the decision of one human being?
It wasn't until January, 1992...
...in a meeting chaired by Castro in Havana, Cuba...
...that I learned
162 nuclear warheads...
...including 90 tactical warheads...
...were on the island at the time in this critical moment of the crisis.
I couldn't believe what I was hearing...
...and Castro got very angry with me, because I said:
" Mr. President, let's stop this meeting.
This is totally new to me.
I'm not sure I got the translation right. "
Mr. President,
I have three questions.
Number one, did you know the nuclear warheads were there?
Number two, if you did...
...would you have recommended to Khrushchev...
...in the face of a U.S. Attack, that he use them?
Three, if he had used them, what would've happened to Cuba?
He said, "One,
I knew they were there.
Two, I would not have recommended to Khrushchev.
I did recommend to Khrushchev they be used.
Three, what would happen to Cuba?
It would've been totally destroyed. "
That's how close we were.
And he was willing to accept that?
Yes... Oh, and he went on to say:
" Mr. McNamara, if you and President Kennedy...
...had been in a similar situation, that's what you would've done. "
I said, " Mr. President, I hope to God we would not have done it. "
Pull the temple down on our heads?
My God!
In a sense, we'd won.
We got the missiles out without war.
My deputy and I brought the five chiefs over...
...and we sat down with Kennedy.
And he said, "Gentlemen, we won.
I don't want you ever to say it, but you know we won, I know we won. "
And LeMay said,
"Won? Hell, we lost!
We should go in and wipe them out today. "
LeMay believed that ultimately...
...we'd confront these people with nuclear weapons.
And by God, we better do it when we have greater superiority...
...than we will have in the future.
At the time, we had a 17-to-1 strategic advantage in nuclear numbers.
We'd done 10 times as many tests as they had.
We were certain we could retain that advantage...
...if we limited the tests.
The chiefs were all opposed.
They said, "The Soviets will cheat. "
Well, I said, " How will they cheat?"
You won't believe this, but they said:
"They'll test them behind the moon. "
I said, "You're out of your mind. "
That's absurd.
It's almost impossible for our people today...
...to put themselves back into that period.
In my seven years as secretary...
...we came within a hairsbreadth of war with the Soviet Union...
...on three different occasions.
Twenty-four hours a day,
365 days a year...
...for seven years as secretary of defense, I lived the Cold War.
During the Kennedy administration, they designed a 100-megaton bomb.
It was tested in the atmosphere.
I remember this.
Cold War? Hell, it was a hot war.
I think the human race needs to think more about killing...
...about conflict.
Is that what we want in this 21st century?
My earliest memory is of a city exploding with joy.
It was November 11, 1918.
I was 2 years old.
You may not believe that I have the memory, but I do.
I remember the tops of the streetcars...
...being crowded with human beings...
...cheering and kissing and screaming.
End of World War I. We'd won.
But also celebrating the belief...
...of many Americans, particularly Woodrow Wilson...
...we'd fought a war to end all wars.
His dream was...
...that the world could avoid great wars in the future.
Disputes among great nations would be resolved.
I also remember...
...that I wasn't allowed to go outdoors to play with my friends...
...without wearing a mask.
There was an ungodly flu epidemic.
Large numbers of Americans were dying, 600,000.
And millions across the world.
My class in the first grade was housed in a shack, a wooden shack.
But we had an absolutely superb teacher.
And this teacher gave a test to the class every month...
...and she re- seated the class based on the results of that test.
There were vertical rows, and she put the person with the highest grade...
...in the first seat on the left-hand row.
And I worked my tail off to be in that first seat.
Now, the majority of the classmates were whites, Caucasians, so on.
Wasps, if you will.
But my competition for that first seat were Chinese, Japanese and Jews.
On Saturday and Sunday,
I played with my classmates.
They went to their ethnic schools.
They learned their native language.
They learned their culture, history.
And they came back determined on
Monday to beat that damn Irishman.
But they didn't do it very often.
One congressman called you "Mr.
L- Have-All-The-Answers McNamara. "
And there's been suggestion from some congressmen...
...that you come up there, in spite of their experience...
...prepared to give them lessons in things.
Is that your attitude?
No. Perhaps they don't know how much I don't know.
And there is much indeed.
I do make a serious effort...
...to prepare myself properly for these congressional discussions.
I suppose I spend, perhaps,
100 or 120 hours...
...in testifying before
Congress each year.
And each hour of testimony requires three to four hours of preparation.
What about the contention that your attitude is sometimes arrogant?
Have you ever been wrong, sir?
Oh, yes, indeed. My heavens.
I'm not gonna tell you when I've been wrong.
If you don't know,
I'm not going to tell you.
Oh, on countless occasions.
I applied to Stanford University.
I very much wanted to go.
But I couldn't afford it, so I lived at home and I went to Berkeley.
Fifty-two dollars a year tuition.
I started Berkeley at the bottom of the Depression.
Twenty-five million males were unemployed.
Out of that class of 3500...
...three elected to Phi Beta Kappa at the end of sophomore year.
Of those three, one became a Rhodes Scholar, I went to Harvard...
...the third went to work for $65 a month...
...and was damn happy to have the job.
The society was on the verge of...
...I don't want to say revolution...
...although, had Roosevelt not done some of the things he did...
...it could've become far more violent.
In any event, that was what I was thrown into.
I never heard of Plato and Aristotle...
...before I became a freshman at Berkeley.
And I remember the professor,
Lowenberg...
...the freshman philosophy professor...
I couldn't wait to go to another class.
I took more philosophy courses, particularly one in logic...
...and one in ethics.
Stress on values...
...something beyond one's self...
...and a responsibility to society.
After graduating
University of California...
...I went to Harvard Graduate School of Business for two years...
...and then I went back to San Francisco.
I began to court this young lady that
I'd met when we were 17...
...in our first week at Berkeley:
Margaret Craig.
And I was making some progress after eight or nine months.
I proposed and she accepted.
She went with her aunt and her mother on a trip across the country.
She telegraphed me,
" Must order engraved invitations...
...to include your middle name, what is it?"
I wired back,
" My middle name is Strange. "
She said,
" I know it's strange, but what is it?"
Well, I mean, it is Strange.
It's Robert Strange McNamara.
And it was a marriage made in heaven.
At the end of a year, we had our first child.
The delivery costs were $100, and we paid that $10 a month.
Those were some of the happiest days of our lives.
And then the war came.
I'd been promoted to assistant professor.
I was the youngest at Harvard.
And on a salary, by the way, of $4000 a year.
Harvard Business School's market was drying up.
The males were being drafted or volunteering.
So the dean, being farsighted, brought back a government contract...
...to establish an officer candidate school for what was called...
...Statistical Control in the Air Force.
We said, " Look, we're not gonna take anybody you send up here.
We're gonna select the people. "
You have a punch card for every human being...
...brought into the Air Corps.
We're gonna run those punch cards through the IBM sorting machines...
...and we're gonna sort on age, education, accomplishment...
...grades, et cetera.
We were looking for the best and the brightest.
The best brains, the greatest capacity to lead...
...the best judgment.
The U.S. Was just beginning to bomb.
We were bombing by daylight.
The loss rate was very, very high.
So they commissioned a study.
And what did we find?
We found the abort rate was 20 percent.
Twenty percent of the planes leaving England...
...to bomb Germany turned around before they got to the target.
That was a hell of a mess.
We lost 20 percent of our capability.
I think it was called Form 1-A...
...or something like that was a mission report.
And if you aborted a mission, you had to write down why.
So we get all these things and we analyze them...
...and we finally concluded:
It was baloney.
They were aborting out of fear.
Because the loss rate was four percent per sortie.
The combat tour was 25 sorties.
It didn't mean 100 percent would die...
...but a lot of them were gonna be killed. They knew that...
...and they found reasons to not go over the target.
So we reported this.
One of the commanders was Curtis LeMay.
Colonel in command of a B-24 group.
He was the finest combat commander of any service I came across in war.
But he was extraordinarily belligerent, many thought brutal.
He got the report.
He issued an order.
He said, " I will be in the lead plane on every mission.
Any plane that takes off will go over the target...
...or the crew will be court-martialed. "
The abort rate dropped overnight.
Now, that's the kind of a commander he was.
Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States.
My friends, on this Christmas Eve...
...there are over 10 million men...
...in the Armed Forces of the United States alone.
One year ago,
1, 700, 000 were serving overseas.
By next July first, that number will rise to over five million.
Plenty of bad news for the Japs in the not-too-far-distant future.
The U.S. Air Force had a new airplane, named the B-29.
The B-17 s and B-24s in Europe bombed from 15, 16,000 feet.
The problem was that they were subject to antiaircraft fire...
...and to fighter aircraft.
To relieve that, this B-29 was being developed...
...that bombed from high altitude...
...and it was thought we could destroy targets more efficiently and effectively.
I was brought back from the 8th Air Force...
...and assigned to the first B-29s, the 58th Bomb Wing.
We had to fly those planes from the bases in Kansas to India.
Then we had to fly fuel over the hump into China.
The airfields were built with Chinese labor.
It was an insane operation.
I can still remember them hauling these huge rollers...
...to crush the stone and make them flat.
Somebody would slip, the roller would roll over him...
...everybody would laugh and go on.
We were supposed to take these B-29s...
There were no tanker aircraft there.
We were to fill them with fuel...
...fly from India to Chengdu, offload the fuel, fly back to India...
...make enough missions to build up fuel in Chengdu...
...fly to Yawata, Japan, bomb the steel mills and go back to India.
We had so little training on this problem of maximizing efficiency...
...we actually found, to get some of the B-29s back...
...instead of offloading fuel, they had to take it on.
To make a long story short, it wasn't worth a damn.
And it was LeMay who really came to that conclusion and led the chiefs...
...to move the whole thing to the
Marianas, which devastated Japan.
LeMay was focused on only one thing:
Target destruction.
Most Air Force generals can say how many planes they had...
...how many tons of bombs they dropped, or whatever it was.
But he was the only person that I knew...
...in the senior command in the
Air Force who focused solely...
...on the loss of his crews per unit of target destruction.
I was on the island of Guam, in his command, in March of 1945.
In that single night, we burned to death...
...100,000 Japanese civilians in Tokyo.
Men, women and children.
Were you aware this was going to happen?
Well, I was...
...part of a mechanism that, in a sense, recommended it.
I analyzed bombing operations, and how to make them more efficient.
I.e., not more efficient in the sense of killing more...
...but more efficient in weakening the adversary.
I wrote one report analyzing...
...the efficiency of the B-29 operations.
The B-29 could get above the fighter aircraft and above the air defense...
...so the loss rate would be much less.
The problem was, the accuracy was also much less.
Now, I don't want to suggest that it was my report...
...that led to...
I'll call it the firebombing.
It isn't that I'm absolving myself of blame for the firebombing.
I don't want to suggest that it was I...
...that put in LeMay's mind...
...that his operations were totally inefficient...
...and had to be drastically changed.
But, anyhow, that's what he did.
He took the B-29s down to 5000 feet...
...and he decided to bomb with firebombs.
I participated in the interrogation...
...of the B-29 bomber crews that came back that night.
A room full of crewmen and intelligence interrogators.
A captain got up, a young captain said:
"Goddamn it, I'd like to know who the son of a bitch was...
...that took this magnificent airplane, designed to bomb from 23,000 feet...
...and he took it down to 5000 feet, and I lost my wingman.
He was shot and killed. "
LeMay spoke in monosyllables.
I never heard him say...
...more than two words in sequence.
It was basically, "Yes," " No," "Yep"...
..."That's all," or " Hell with it. "
That was all he said.
And LeMay was totally intolerant of criticism.
He never engaged in discussion with anybody.
He stood up.
"Why are we here?
Why are we here?
You lost your wingman.
It hurts me as much as...
...it does you.
I sent him there.
And I've been there,
I know what it is.
But you lost one wingman...
...and we destroyed Tokyo. "
Fifty square miles of Tokyo were burned.
Tokyo was a wooden city, and when we dropped firebombs...
...it just burned it.
The choice of incendiary bombs...
...where did that come from?
I think the issue...
...is not so much incendiary bombs.
I think the issue is...
...in order to win, should you kill
100,000 people in one night?
By firebombing or any other way?
LeMay's answer would be, clearly, "Yes. "
" McNamara, do you mean to say...
...that instead of killing 100,000...
...burning to death 100,000 Japanese civilians in that one night...
...we should have burned to death a lesser number or none?
And then had our soldiers cross the beaches in Tokyo...
...and been slaughtered in tens of thousands?
Is that what you're proposing?
Is that moral? Is that wise?"
Why was it necessary to drop the nuclear bomb...
...if LeMay was burning up Japan?
And he went on from Tokyo to firebomb other cities.
58 percent of Yokohama. Yokohama is roughly the size of Cleveland.
58 percent of Cleveland destroyed.
Tokyo is roughly the size of New York.
51 percent of New York destroyed.
99 percent of the equivalent of Chattanooga, which was Toyama.
40 percent of the equivalent of Los Angeles, which was Nagoya.
This was all done before...
...the dropping of the nuclear bomb.
Which, by the way, was dropped by LeMay's command.
Proportionality should be a guideline in war.
Killing 50 to 90 percent...
...of the people in 67 Japanese cities...
...and then bombing them with two nuclear bombs...
...is not proportional, in the minds of some people...
...to the objectives we were trying to achieve.
I don't fault Truman for dropping the nuclear bomb.
The U.S. -Japanese War was one of the most brutal wars...
...in all of human history.
Kamikaze pilots, suicide, unbelievable.
What one can criticize...
...is that the human race prior to that time and today...
...has not really grappled with what are, I'll call it "the rules of war. "
Was there a rule then that said you shouldn't bomb, shouldn't kill...
...shouldn't burn to death 100,000 civilians in a night?
LeMay said, " If we'd lost the war...
...we'd all have been prosecuted as war criminals. "
And I think he's right.
He, and I'd say I...
...were behaving as war criminals.
LeMay recognized that what he was doing...
...would be thought immoral...
...if his side had lost.
But what makes it immoral if you lose and not immoral if you win?
At some point, we have to approach
Vietnam, and I want to know...
...how you can best set that up for me.
Yeah, well...
...that's a hard, hard question.
I think...
I think we have to approach it in the context of the Cold War.
But first I'll have to talk about Ford.
I've got to go back to the end of the war.
I had a terrible headache...
...so Marg drove me in to the Air Force regional hospital.
A week later, Marg came in...
...many of the same symptoms.
It's hard to believe, and I don't think
I've heard of another case...
...where two individuals, husband and wife...
...came down, essentially, at the same time with polio.
We were both in the hospital on V-J Day.
A friend of mine said:
"We're gonna find a corporation in America that needs...
...the advice and capabilities of this extraordinary group...
...I'm forming and you gotta be in it. "
I said, "To hell with it.
I'm going back to Harvard.
Marg and I wanna do that.
I'm gonna spend my life there. "
He said, " Look, Bob, you can't pay Marg's hospital bills.
You're crazy as hell. "
He said, " By the way...
...the company that most needs our help in all the U.S. Is Ford. "
I said, " How'd you learn that?"
" I read an article in Life magazine. "
Of the top 1000 executives at Ford...
...I don't believe there were
10 college graduates...
...and Henry Ford II needed help.
They were gonna give us tests.
Two full days of testing...
...intelligence tests, achievement tests, personality tests, you name it.
This sounds absurd, but I remember a question on one of the tests was:
"Would you rather be a florist or a coal miner?"
I had been a florist.
I worked as a florist...
...during some of my
Christmas vacations.
I put down coal miner.
I think the reasons are obvious to you.
This group of 10 people had been trained...
...in the officer candidate school at Harvard.
In some tests we had the highest marks that had ever been scored.
In other tests, we were in the upper one percentile.
From 1926 to 1946, including the war years...
...Ford Motor Company just barely broke even.
It was a God-awful mess.
I thought we had a responsibility to the stockholders...
...and God knows you cannot believe how bad the situation had been.
They had no market research organization. I set one up.
Manager said,
"What do you want studied?"
I said, " Find out who's buying Volkswagens.
Everybody says it's a no-good car.
It was only selling about
20,000 a year...
...but I want to know what's gonna happen.
Is it gonna stay the same, go down, or go up?
Find out who buys them. "
He came back six months later, he said:
"Well, they're professors, and they're doctors and they're lawyers...
...and they're obviously people who can afford more. "
Well, that set me to thinking about what we in the industry should do.
Was there a market we were missing?
At this time nobody believed
Americans wanted cheaper cars.
They wanted conspicuous consumption.
Cadillac, with these huge, ostentatious fins...
...set the style for the industry for 10 or 15 years.
And that's what we were up against.
We introduced the Falcon as a more economical car...
...and it was a huge success profit-wise.
We accomplished a lot.
I said, "What about accidents?
I hear a lot about accidents. "
"Oh, yes, we'll get you some data on that. "
There were about 40,000 deaths per year from automobile accidents...
...and about a million, or a million-two injuries.
I said, "What causes it?"
" It's obvious.
It's human error and mechanical failure. "
I said, " If it's mechanical, we might be involved. Find out.
If it's mechanical failure,
I want to stop it. "
Well, he said, "There's really very few statistics available. "
I said, " Damn it, find out what can we learn. "
"The only place we can find that knows anything about it...
...is Cornell Aeronautical Labs. "
They said,
"The major problem is packaging. "
They said, "You buy eggs and you know how eggs come in a carton?"
I said, " I don't buy eggs.
My wife does it. "
They said, "Well, you ask her, when she puts that carton down...
...on the drain board when she gets home, do the eggs break?"
I asked Marg and she said no.
Cornell said, "That's because they're packaged properly.
Now, if we packaged people in cars the same way...
...we could reduce the breakage. "
We lacked lab facilities, so we dropped human skulls...
...in different packages, down the stairwells of the dormitories at Cornell.
Well, that sounds absurd, but that guy was absolutely right.
It was packaging which could make the difference.
In a crash, the driver was often impaled on the steering wheel.
The passenger was often injured because he'd hit the windshield...
...or the header bar, or the instrument panel.
So in the 1956 model Ford we introduced steering wheels...
...that prevented being impaled.
We introduced...
...padded instrument panels, and we introduced seat belts.
We estimated if there would be
100 percent use of the seat belts...
...we could save 20-odd thousand lives a year.
Everybody was opposed to it.
You couldn't get people to use seat belts.
But those who did saved their lives.
Now, let me jump ahead.
It's July, 1960.
John Bugas, vice president, industrial relations...
...clearly had his eyes on becoming president.
I'm the group vice president in charge of all of the car divisions.
Henry was a night owl.
He always wanted to go out.
You know, it's 2 a. m. Or something.
He said, " Come up, have a nightcap. "
" I don't want one, I'm going to bed. "
John said, " I'll come up, Henry. "
" I didn't ask you. I asked Bob. "
He said, " Bob, come on up. "
So I finally went up.
That's when he asked me to be president.
I was the first president in the history of the company...
...that had ever been president other than a member of the Ford family.
And after five weeks, I quit.
The telephone rang...
...a person comes on and says:
" I'm Robert Kennedy.
My brother, Jack Kennedy, would like you...
...to meet our brother- in-law,
Sergeant Shriver. "
Four o'clock, Sarge comes in.
Never met him.
And he said, " I've been authorized by my brother- in-law...
...Jack Kennedy, to offer you the position of secretary of the treasury. "
"You're crazy.
I know a little about finance...
...but I'm not qualified for that position. "
"Anticipating you might say that, the president-elect...
...authorized me to offer you the secretary of defense. "
" I was in World War II for three years...
...but secretary of defense?
I'm not qualified for that. "
He said, "Anticipating that...
...would you do him the courtesy of agreeing to meet with him?"
So I go home. I meet with Marg.
If I could appoint every senior official in the department...
...and if I was guaranteed
I wouldn't have to...
...be part of that damn Washington social world.
She said, "Well, okay, why don't you write a contract with the president...
...and if he'll accept those conditions, do it. "
My total net worth at the time was on the order of $800,000...
...but I had huge unfulfilled stock options worth millions.
And I was one of the highest-paid executives in the world.
And the future was brilliant.
We had called our children in.
Their life would be totally changed.
The salary of a cabinet secretary then was $25,000 a year.
So we explained to the children...
...they'd be giving up a few...
They could care less.
Marg could care less.
It was snowing.
The Secret Service took me in the house by the back way.
I can still see it. There's a loveseat...
...two armchairs with a lamp table in between.
Jack Kennedy is sitting in one...
...and Bobby Kennedy's sitting in the other.
" Mr. President, it's absurd.
I'm not qualified. "
" Look, Bob... "
He said, " I don't think there's any school for presidents either.
Let's announce it now.
I'll write the announcement. "
So he wrote out the announcement, we walk out the front door.
All of these television cameras and press, till hell wouldn't have it.
That's how Marg learned
I had accepted.
It was on television, live.
All right, why don't we do some pictures afterwards.
I've asked Robert McNamara...
...to assume the responsibilities of secretary of defense.
And I'm glad and happy to say that he has accepted this responsibility.
Mr. McNamara leaves the presidency of the Ford company...
...at great personal sacrifice.
That's the way it began.
You know, it was a traumatic period.
My wife probably got ulcers from it...
...may even ultimately have died from the stress. My son got ulcers.
It was very traumatic but...
...they were some of the best years of our life...
...and all members of my family benefited from it.
It was terrific.
October 2nd.
I had returned from Vietnam.
At that time, we had 16,000 military advisors.
I recommended to President Kennedy and to the Security Council...
...that we establish a plan and an objective...
...of removing all of them within two years.
Kennedy announced we were going to pull out all our military advisors...
...by the end of '65, going to take 1000 out at the end of '63, and we did.
But there was a coup in South Vietnam.
Diem was overthrown...
...and he and his brother were killed.
I was present with the President...
...when together we received information of that coup.
I've never seen him...
...more upset.
He totally blanched.
Kennedy and I had tremendous problems with Diem, but my God...
...he was the authority.
He was the head of state.
And he was overthrown by a military coup.
And Kennedy knew and I knew, that to some degree...
...the U.S. Government was responsible for that.
I was in my office in the Pentagon...
...when the telephone rang and it was Bobby.
The President had been shot in Dallas.
Perhaps 45 minutes later,
Bobby called again...
...and said the president was dead.
Jackie would like me to come out to the hospital.
We took the body to the White House about whatever it was, 4 a. M...
...and called the superintendent of Arlington Cemetery.
And he and I...
...walked over those grounds.
They're hauntingly beautiful grounds.
White crosses, row and row.
And finally I thought I'd found the exact spot...
...the most beautiful spot in the cemetery.
I called Jackie at the White House...
...and asked her to come out there.
She immediately accepted.
And that's where the president is buried today.
A park service ranger came up to me and said that he...
He had...
...escorted President Kennedy on a tour of those grounds...
...a few weeks before.
And Kennedy said...
...that was the most beautiful spot in Washington.
That's where he's buried.
I will do my best.
That is all I can do.
I ask for your help...
...and God's.
Make no bones of this.
Don't try to sweep this under the rug.
We are at war in Vietnam.
And yet the president...
...and his secretary of defense continues to mislead...
...and misinform the American people, and enough of it's gone by.
On August 2nd...
...the destroyer Maddox reported it was attacked...
...by a North Vietnamese patrol boat.
It was an act of aggression against us.
We were in international waters.
I sent officials from the Defense
Department out and we recovered...
...pieces of shells that were clearly identified...
...as North Vietnamese from the Maddox's deck.
So there was no question in my mind that it had occurred.
But, in any event, we didn't respond.
And it was very difficult.
It was difficult for the president.
There were very, very senior people, in uniform and out, who said:
" My God, this president is... "
They didn't use the word "coward," but in effect...
..." He's not protecting the national interest. "
Two days later the Maddox and the Turner Joy, two destroyers...
...reported they were attacked.
There were sonar soundings.
Torpedoes had been detected.
Other indications of attack from patrol boats.
We spent 10 hours that day trying to find out what the hell had happened.
At one point the commander said,
"We're not certain of the attack. "
Another point they said,
"We're positive. "
Then finally, late in the day,
Admiral Sharp said:
"Yes, we're certain it happened. "
So I reported this to Johnson, and as a result...
...there were bombing attacks on targets in North Vietnam.
Johnson said,
"We may have to escalate.
I'm not gonna do it without
Congressional authority. "
And he put forward a resolution, the language of which...
...gave complete authority to the president to take the nation to war:
The Tonkin Gulf Resolution.
Now, let me go back to the August 4th attack.
It was just confusion.
And events afterwards showed...
...that our judgment that we'd been attacked that day was wrong.
It didn't happen.
And the judgment that we'd been attacked on August 2nd...
...which we'd made, was right.
We had been.
Although that was disputed at the time.
So we were right once and wrong once.
Ultimately, President Johnson authorized bombing in response...
...to what he thought had been the second attack.
It hadn't occurred, but that's irrelevant to the point I'm making here.
He authorized the attack on the assumption it had occurred.
And his belief that it was a conscious decision...
...by the North Vietnamese political and military leaders...
...to escalate the conflict...
...and an indication they would not stop short of winning.
We were wrong.
But we had in our minds a mindset that led to that action.
And it carried such heavy costs.
We see incorrectly, or we see only half of the story at times.
- We see what we want to believe.
- You're absolutely right.
Belief and seeing.
They're both often wrong.
We Americans know, although others appear to forget...
...the risk of spreading conflict.
We still seek no wider war.
We introduced " Rolling Thunder"...
...which, over the years, became a very, very heavy bombing program.
Two to three times as many bombs as were dropped...
...on Western Europe during all of World War II.
This is not primarily a military problem.
It's a battle for the hearts and minds of the people of South Vietnam.
As a prerequisite, we must be able to guarantee their physical security.
It was announced today that total
American casualties in Vietnam...
...now number 4877 including 748 killed.
Secretary of Defense McNamara, on each of his seven trips to Vietnam...
...has found some positive aspect of the course of the war.
The most vivid impression
I'm bringing back is...
...that we've stopped losing the war.
The North Vietnamese, we believe, have nine regiments of their army...
Some of the men had a little training in a park in Kentucky before coming.
But it didn't prepare them for thick et of trees, spiked vines, thorn bushes...
...almost perpendicular cliffs,
90-degree temperatures, insects...
This has changed from a nasty little war to a nasty middle-sized war.
The Vietnamese are still doing most of the fighting and most of the dying...
...but week after week,
American casualty figures go up.
Now, America wins the wars that she undertakes. Make no mistake about it.
And we have declared war on tyranny and aggression.
If this little nation goes down the drain and can't maintain independence...
...ask yourself what's gonna happen to all the other little nations.
Let me go back one moment.
In the Cuban Missile Crisis, at the end...
...I think we did put ourselves in the skin of the Soviets.
In the case of Vietnam, we didn't know them well enough to empathize.
And there was total misunderstanding as a result.
They believed we had simply replaced the French as a colonial power...
...and we were seeking to subject
South and North Vietnam...
...to our colonial interests, which was absolutely absurd.
And we, we saw Vietnam as an element of the Cold War.
Not what they saw it as, a civil war.
There aren't many examples...
...in which you bring two former enemies together...
...at the highest levels, and discuss what might have been.
I formed the hypothesis that each of us could have...
...achieved our objectives without the terrible loss of life.
And I wanted to test that by going to Vietnam.
The former foreign minister of Vietnam...
...a wonderful man named Thach said, "You're totally wrong.
We were fighting for independence.
You were fighting to enslave us. "
We almost came to blows.
That was noon on the first day.
" Do you mean to say it was not a tragedy for you...
...when you lost 3,400,000
Vietnamese killed...
...which on our population base is the equivalent of 27 million Americans?
What did you accomplish?
You didn't get more than we were willing to give at the start.
You could've had the whole damn thing: Independence, unification. "
" Mr. McNamara, you must never have read a history book.
If you had, you'd know we weren't pawns of the Chinese or the Russians.
Didn't you know that?
Don't you understand that we've been fighting the Chinese for 1000 years?
We were fighting for independence, and we'd fight to the last man.
We were determined to...
...and no amount of bombing or U.S.
Pressure would've ever stopped us. "
What makes us omniscient?
Have we a record of omniscience?
We are the strongest nation in the world today.
I do not believe we should ever...
...apply that economic, political or military power unilaterally.
If we had followed that rule in Vietnam, we wouldn't have been there.
None of our allies supported us.
Not Japan, not Germany, not Britain or France.
If we can't persuade nations with comparable values...
...of the merit of our cause, we'd better re- examine our reasoning.
Americans suffered the heaviest casualties of the war last week.
543 killed in action. Another 1247 were wounded and hospitalized.
The deaths raise the U.S. Total in the war so far to 18, 239.
South Vietnamese put their losses for the week at 522 killed.
Communist losses were not reported.
Contributing to those casualties has been the Communist bombardment...
...of the Marine outpost at Khe Sanh.
There, the North Vietnamese have been tightening their ring around...
The military expects a full-scale assault.
To what extent did you feel that you were the author of stuff...
...or that you were an instrument of things outside of your control?
Well, I don't think I felt either.
I just felt that I was serving at the request of a president...
...who'd been elected by the American people.
And it was my responsibility to try to help him...
...to carry out the office as he believed was in the interest of our people.
What is morally appropriate in a wartime environment?
Let me give you an illustration.
While I was secretary...
...we used what's called
"Agent Orange" in Vietnam.
A chemical that strips leaves off of trees.
After the war, it is claimed that that was a toxic chemical...
...and it killed many individuals...
...soldiers and civilians exposed to it.
Were those who issued the approval to use Agent Orange criminals?
Were they committing a crime against humanity?
Let's look at the law.
Now, what kind of law do we have that says...
...these chemicals are acceptable in war and these chemicals are not.
We don't have clear definitions of that kind.
I never in the world would have authorized an illegal action.
I'm not really sure I authorized
Agent Orange, I don't remember it.
But it certainly occurred, the use of it occurred while I was secretary.
Norman Morrison was a Quaker.
He was opposed to war, the violence of war, the killing.
He came to the Pentagon, doused himself with gasoline.
Burned himself to death below my office.
He held a child in his arms, his daughter.
Passers-by shouted, "Save the child!"
He threw the child...
...out of his arms, and the child lived and is alive today.
His wife issued a very moving statement:
" Human beings must stop killing other human beings. "
And that's a belief that I shared.
I shared it then and I believe it even more strongly today.
How much evil must we do in order to do good?
We have certain ideals, certain responsibilities.
Recognize that at times you will have to engage in evil, but minimize it.
I remember reading that
General Sherman, in the Civil War...
...the mayor of Atlanta pleaded with him to save the city.
And Sherman essentially said to the mayor...
...just before he torched it and burned it down:
"War is cruel. War is cruelty. "
That was the way LeMay felt.
He was trying to save the country.
He was trying to save our nation.
And in the process, he was prepared to do whatever killing was necessary.
It's a very, very difficult position for sensitive human beings to be in.
Morrison was one of those.
I think I was.
50,000 people came to Washington to demonstrate against the war.
About 20,000 of them marched on the Pentagon.
The Pentagon is a very, very difficult building to defend.
We placed troops carrying rifles around it.
U.S. Marshals in front of the soldiers.
But I told the president, not a rifle would be loaded...
...without my personal permission.
And I wasn't gonna grant it.
What effect did all of this dissent have on your thinking?
I mean, Norman Morrison is '65.
This is '67.
Well, it was a very tense period.
Very tense period for my family, which I don't want to discuss.
How was your thinking changing during this period?
I don't think my thinking was changing.
We were in the Cold War.
And this was a Cold War...
...activity.
Some commentators have said the war is turning into a kind of stalemate.
No, no. I think on the contrary...
...as General Westmoreland has pointed out...
...in recent weeks in Saigon, the military operations...
...the large-unit military operations continue to...
...show very substantial progress.
One of the lessons I learned early on:
Never say never.
Never, never, never.
Never say never.
And secondly...
...never answer the question that is asked of you.
Answer the question that you wish had been asked of you.
And quite frankly, I follow that rule.
It's a very good rule.
When you talk about the responsibility for something like the Vietnam War...
...whose responsibility is it?
It's the president's responsibility.
I don't want to fail to recognize...
...the tremendous contribution
I think Johnson made to the country.
I don't want to put the responsibility for Vietnam on his shoulders alone...
...but I do... I am inclined to believe that if Kennedy had lived...
...he would've made a difference. We wouldn't have had 500,000 men there.
Two very telling photographs.
One of them has Johnson like this:
You can just see him thinking,
" My God, I'm in a hell of a mess.
And this guy is trying to tell me to do something...
...that I know is wrong and I'm not gonna do.
But how the hell am I gonna get out of this?"
The other photograph, you can see me saying:
"Jesus Christ. I love this man,
I respect him, but he's totally wrong.
What am I gonna do?"
Johnson couldn't persuade me, and I couldn't persuade him.
I had this enormous respect and affection, loyalty...
...to both Kennedy and Johnson.
But at the end, Johnson and I found ourselves poles apart.
And I said to a very close and dear friend of mine, Kay Graham...
" Even to this day, Kay, I don't know whether I quit or was fired. "
She said, "You're out of your mind.
You were fired. "
November 1, 1967.
I presented a memo to Johnson that said:
"The course we're on is totally wrong.
We've gotta change it.
Cut back at what we're doing in Vietnam.
We gotta reduce the casualties," and so on.
It was an extraordinarily controversial memo.
And I took it to him.
I delivered it myself.
" Mr. President, nobody has seen this.
Not Dean Rusk, not the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Nobody. "
" I know that it may contain recommendations and statements...
...that you do not agree with or support. "
I never heard from him.
Something had to give.
There was a rumor I was facing a mental breakdown...
...I was under such pressure and stress.
I don't think that was the case at all.
But it was a really traumatic departure.
That's the way it ended.
Except for one thing.
He awarded me the Medal of Freedom...
...in a very beautiful ceremony at the White House.
And he was very, very warm in his comments.
And I became so emotional,
I could not...
...respond.
Mr. President...
...I cannot find words...
...to express what lies in my heart today.
And I think I'd better respond on another occasion.
And had I responded,
I would have said:
" I know what many of you are thinking.
You're thinking this man is duplicitous.
You're thinking that he has held things close to his chest.
You're thinking that...
...he did not respond fully...
...to the desires and wishes of the American people.
I wanna tell you you're wrong. "
Of course he had personal idiosyncrasies.
No question about that.
He didn't accept all the advice he was given.
On several occasions, his associates advised him to be more forthcoming.
He wasn't.
People did not understand there were recommendations and pressures...
...that would carry the risk of war with China and of nuclear war.
And he was determined to prevent it.
I'm arguing that he had a reason in his mind for doing what he did.
And, of course, shortly after I left...
...Johnson concluded that he couldn't continue.
At this point, how many Americans had been killed in Vietnam?
About 25,000. Less than half...
...of the number ultimately killed, 58,000.
Historians don't really like to deal with counterfactuals...
...with what might have been.
They want to talk about history.
" How the hell do you know,
McNamara, what might have been?
Who knows?"
Well, I know certain things.
What I'm doing is thinking it through with hindsight.
But you don't have hindsight available at the time.
I'm very proud of my accomplishments.
And I'm very sorry that in the process of accomplishment, I've made errors.
We all make mistakes.
We know we make mistakes.
I don't know any military commander who is honest...
...who would say he has not made a mistake.
There's a wonderful phrase:
"The fog of war. "
What "the fog of war" means is:
War is so complex it's beyond the ability of the human mind...
...to comprehend all the variables.
Our judgment, our understanding, are not adequate.
And we kill people unnecessarily.
Wilson said,
"We won the war to end all wars. "
I'm not so naive or simplistic to believe we can eliminate war.
We're not gonna change human nature any time soon.
It isn't that we aren't rational.
We are rational.
But reason has limits.
There's a quote from T.S. Eliot that I just love:
"We shall not cease from exploring...
...and at the end of our exploration, we will return to where we started...
...and know the place for the first time. "
Now that's, in a sense, where I'm beginning to be.
After you left the Johnson administration...
...why didn't you speak out against the Vietnam War?
I'm not going to say any more than I have.
These are the kinds of questions that get me in trouble.
You don't know what I know about how inflammatory my words can appear.
A lot of people misunderstand the war...
...misunderstand me.
A lot of people think
I'm a son of a bitch.
Do you feel in any way responsible for the war?
Do you feel guilty?
I don't want to go into further discussion.
It just opens up more controversy.
I don't wanna add anything to Vietnam.
It is so complex that anything I say...
...will require additions and qualifications.
Is it the feeling that you're damned if you do...
...and if you don't, no matter what...?
Yeah, that's right.
And I would rather be damned if I don't.

THE GLEANERS AND I
G as in gleaning -
To glean is to gather after the harvest.
A gleaner is one who gleans.
In times past only women gleaned.
Millet's Glaneuses were in all dictionaries.
The original painting is at the Orsay.
Gleaning, that's the old way.
My mother'd say, '' Pick everything up so nothing gets wasted''.
But sadly we no longer do because machines are so efficient nowadays.
But before, I used to glean together with my neighbors, for wheat, and rice too.
I would put my big apron on and we'd go gleaning ears of wheat, lovely ears we would find.
A whole day in the sun, with gnats and mosquitoes biting, it wasn't too nice, but we liked it.
Evenings, we were exhausted. Once home with our bags and our aprons we'd have a good time laughing and drinking coffee together.
I was born in that farmhouse, and I'll die there too.
- But not quite yet!
- OK, thank you very much.
Thanks very much, all of you.
I'm mixed up, you've confused me now.
Yes, I've always gleaned.
I remember, with my grandmother and my brothers and sisters.
Before, during the war, they had to glean, they were starving.
They pounded the grain to make flour, for bread.
We no longer pick these days, we no longer glean to eat.
There are still a few gleaners of corn around.
Gleaning might be extinct but stooping has not vanished from our sated society
Urban and rural gleaners all stoop to pick up
There's no shame,just worries
Yeah, food, grub
It's bad, sad, man
To bend down is not to beg
But when I see them sway
My heart hurts!
Eating that scrap-crap
They've got to live on shit-bits
They've got to frisk for tidbits
Left on the street, leftovers
Rough stuff with no owners
Picking up trash like the streetsweeper
Zero for us, for them much better
They got to roam around to kill the hunger
It's always been the same pain will always be the same game.
In the towns today as in the fields yesterday gleaners still humbly stoop to glean.
But men have now joined with women in gleaning.
What strikes me is that each gleans on his own.
Whereas in paintings they were always in clusters, rarely alone.
But there's a famous one painted byJules Breton at the museum in Arras.
We took the road north.
Lots of big trucks, but I'll come back to that, and we arrived in the town of Arras, we saw its square, we saw its museum, and Breton's Woman Gleaning.
There is another woman gleaning in this film, that's me.
I'm happy to drop the ears of wheat and pick up my camera.
These new small cameras, they are digital, fantastic.
Their effects are stroboscopic narcissistic, and even hyper-realistic.
No, it's not O rage, no, it's not O despair, it's not Old age, my enemy, it might even be Old age, my friend but still, my hair and my hands keep telling me that the end is near.
OK, right now, we are driving towards Beauce, renowned for its wheat.
The harvest being over we'll focus on potato gleaning instead.
Destalking the fields makes furrows and ridges ready for the grubbing machine.
Once the grubbing is over, we can glean the whole field.
- Hello.
- Hello Mrs. Buard.
Since this morning,
I've collected a full 250 lbs alone.
And these are good ones you eat with herring.
Lots of restaurants buy them.
Some people are quite pleased when the machine malfunctions.
There are lots left here.
The tractor ploughs too deep and gets stuck.
They free it by lifting the machine and they miss potatoes there.
So gleaners have a field day?
Oh yes definitely.
The owners don't give a damn so long as there's nothing left.
They won't have to treat.
You still must sort them.
In supermarkets, the firm ones are sold in containers of 5 1 /2 to 1 1 pounds, and these have to be of a specific caliber, of a specific size.
So we dump anything bigger.
The potato harvest averages 4,500 tons per season.
But 25 tons are rejected and dumped.
We reject all the outsized, green ones, and stones, the cut or damaged ones.
Because they're unsellable.
To the trade, we sell potatoes within a range of 2 to 4 inches and anything bigger is automatically thrown away.
Potatoes remain a staple foodstuff for many and because large quantities of potatoes are dumped, the practice of gleaning has reappeared.
In general people wait nearby and follow the trailers.
We followed the trailers but didn't see anyone except a man who might have known, not through a newspaper though for they never announce dumping here tomorrow, there next week.
Potatoes left in the open like that soon become green and dangerous to eat.
Sometimes the children give the signal.
Hey, we found a big one here!
C'mon, catch it!
Monday, potatoes
Tuesday, potatoes
Wednesday, potatoes again
Thursday, potatoes
Friday, potatoes
Saturday, potatoes again
Sunday, potatoes au gratin
Look, I've picked up more or less
200 or 300 pounds.
You find very large ones in the leftovers.
The damaged ones we leave.
Some are too small, we take the large ones rather.
See, misshapen ones, heart-shaped ones.
The heart, I want the heart!
I was glad.
I immediately filmed them up close, and set about filming perilously with one hand my other hand gleaning heart-shaped potatoes.
Then I took a few home with me.
I looked at them again, filmed them again.
Then it dawned upon me: the Good Heart Charity Meals.
Why not organize an expedition on the day the potatoes are to be dumped?
When I think of all the food gone bad that's enough to make me mad
If you've been kicked out and you're down and out
Then you need food for nought
I take a few for me and my kids, and we collect together.
I've joined the Charity Meals because I was unemployed.
I still am but I expect to start on a trial job soon and meanwhile, I'd rather help people than do nothing, help people in dire straits.
I'm a single mother.
I get food from the Red Cross and the Charity Meals.
When I see all this go to waste and that some people have nothing to eat, it's really disgraceful.
On that day they collected almost 7 00 lbs.
At least that's something.
A little later, almost on the same spot, we saw a man approaching.
I went over to him and asked him how much he thought there was.
Almost a ton if you add all the mounds together, a ton of potatoes wasted.
Same thing with cauliflowers, fruit and vegetables in other regions, but here it's potato country, and we take what we find.
We're better off working in the fields than shoplifting.
It's the same for all of us,
I'm not alone.
We get by as best we can.
We do potatoes, we look in trash cans, that keeps me going for now.
It's a hard life, that's all.
The year 2K is upon us, great, heh?
OK, I'm on my way with my 7 0 lbs, and there are several tons left, which could be picked, but people don't know where to come to. There you are.
They are hoboes in caravans.
We are gypsies, we travel around.
They're different from us.
It needs to be cut up for the scrap merchant to come.
We don't have the necessary tools.
No electricity,just candles.
What do you do for water?
What?
Water?
That's all we have. It's over there.
That's our tap.
- What if it freezes?
- If it freezes... we pad around the pipe, or we let it drip to stop it freezing when it gets really cold, like last year, when it got to -7 0F on the ground.
You get used to it.
You seem to like beer?
I'd drink anything.
How many beers is that?
I drink a pack a day.
- What?
- Yeah, a pack of 2 4 a day.
2 4 or even 3 2.
Tell me what happened to you.
Did you have a house before?
Yeah, I had a job.
I worked impossible hours,
21 or 22 hours a day.
- Truck driving?
- Yeah.
- A trucker?
- Yes.
I drove long vehicles.
Then one day the police breathalyzed me and then... that's how I lost my job.
Then my wife left me, she took my three kids with her, and I was in free-fall after that.
Divorce, everything?
Yes, and I haven't seen my kids for almost 2 years.
They're 500 miles away from me.
I can't go and see them.
I don't have a car or a license.
- It's terrible.
- Yes it is.
I think of them every single day.
- Here's Guilene.
- She'll tell you everything.
Did you know that once they're through picking potatoes, you're allowed to take leftovers?
- No.
You didn't know?
- It's not allowed.
- Yes it is!
I have something very important to say:
Why has the Mayor put us here,
I've been here four years, and now he wants us to go.
He says he was fed up with us gypsies, but I want to stay here.
I had an apartment but it cost too much.
Her first trailer cost her $3 50 and the latest one, where I am housed at the moment,
We met when I was working in a cafe as a cleaning woman, that's how we met.
So long as there's welfare money left, OK, but after... we have to get by somehow.
Then we have to beg and forage through the trash.
We find food in the garbage.
Good food?
We're badly off. We do find good food. Which could still be sold in shops. But they have to change their shelves.
We take advantage of that, it's a lucky draw.
But we have to comb all the garbage cans everywhere to recover stuff.
See for yourself.
For the soup!
My bunch of flowers!
- Another cucumber.
- Sure, there's plenty.
That comes from the trash.
The expiry date is 1 1 -29, two days ago.
- One day ago.
- Right.
That's still valid for seven or eight days, a week or so.
I've got fish which I found there.
It's good until 1 2-2 4.
We found it in the trash.
We're not afraid to get our hands dirty. You can wash hands.
Hey, guys, the new appetizer is lamb kidney in a chicory root sauce with a potato fritter and an aniseed and nut soup and mushroom mousse with truffle oil.
As I watched all this cooking,
I asked the chef if there were lots of leftovers, and what he did with them.
Nothing should be wasted.
With the leftover lentils, we make a lentil soup, we mince the greenery into a gratin, the meat bones we use for stock the fish bones for sauce.
We don't throw anything away.
You have to be economical.
If I had to buy all the herbs
I pick daily on the hills...
A small bunch of savory like this is $1 .50 and we use about 20 of them every day.
We'd be spending a fortune on herbs.
Anyway, I love picking them.
That nice inventive and thrifty chef offers a gourmet menu for $1 00.
Edouard Loubet is the youngest French chef to have earned 2 stars in the Michelin guide, now called the Red Guide.
Surprisingly enough,
Edouard is also a born gleaner, or rather a born picker.
With his hat on, in his shirt sleeves, he looks like a Provencal figurine.
Don't tread on the apples!
We take what the farmers leave behind or we pick the ripe fruit on the trees.
This is the best thing you can use to make good spirits or good fruit jelly.
I never miss the chance.
How come you, a chef, also pick?
Firstly because my grandparents taught me to along fields and roads, and also because
I then know what produce I get and where I get it from.
I don't want refrigerated produce from Italy which is sold only when someone feels like saying it is ripe.
As we're talking grapes and wine...
Let's go, Isa!
...we might as well go to a wine area.
We're off to Burgundy.
On the road, there are trucks, lots of trucks, of the kind we loved when we were kids.
We pass them and gaze at them.
Here's a very big one passing us, transporting cars, and here's another one.
And now we are passing him, we struggle a little to pass this one.
It's like a child's game.
We're arriving in Burgundy.
Beaune to me is above all the Hospices and the painting by Van der Weyden,
The LastJudgment.
The Archangel Michael weighs and judges the deeds of the dead.
The ones who are light are to be resurrected, and the heavy ones are to suffer in hell.
The grape harvest is over, and yet nobody is in sight.
Why is that?
If you want your wine to be ranked as vintage, the yearly production is limited.
That means you can only produce a certain quota per plot.
Growing up, I didn't hear much about pickers.
Wine growers have always protected themselves against them, for if you let people pick in your vines, how can you be sure they are not going to pick on a large scale?
These vintage vines have been entirely harvested and the surplus has been deliberately left on the ground.
They're drying out, lost for everybody.
It's a measure to protect our profession and capital.
What you see here, is called second generation grapes, verjuice, or conscripts, depending on the area.
Conscripts.
Like soldiers?
Exactly, like conscripts.
Some people pick them.
It's a second harvest and yields a cheaper wine called wine of the pickings.
- Will it taste of Pommard?
- No, not at all.
It makes a table wine, a really cheap table wine.
The vintage wine region is not a good one for picking.
Gleaning, or picking, is forbidden in Burgundy.
It ended 3 or 4 years ago.
It's sad, but that's the way it is.
Gleaning was lovely.
We would see the gleaner, tramping along,
Gathering the relics
Of that which is falling
Behind the reaper...
- Do you know?
- Du Bellay?
- Right?
- It is.
Impressive, you know it by heart!
I took over my father's estate.
From the grape to the bottle,
I am the only master on board.
I have no cellarman, no head cellarman.
With Nadine, we choose the best blends for our Chateau bottles.
- Do you both choose?
- We both do.
Jean Laplanche, a keen wine grower, has another calling, psychotherapy.
I am a practicing therapist, but above all a theoretician, or rather a philosopher of therapy.
What's your theory?
What distinguishes me, is that I have tried to integrate into man's psyche, the Other above the Ego, i.e.
I developed an anti-ego philosophy, a philosophy which shows how man first originates in the Other.
He copes with his double life?
- Rather well.
- He's good, isn't he?
- Rather well.
- He's intelligent, I think. And modest.
It keeps me going.
- Isn't it daunting for you?
- What is?
That he is a therapist and makes wine too.
I was analyzed so as to learn a little more.
- By him?
- No, by Lacan.
- Ages ago.
- I was very young.
A long time ago.
We'll be married 50 years in the year 2000.
Tell me how you met.
At a village dance, where most people meet.
- The kiss!
- Right...
No one's interested in that!
I must tell you something, something the whole world should know about.
I met him, it was like a lightning bolt.
You see?
The way he was dressed,
I couldn't possibly miss him.
He had a red cap on, honest, he was back from the Riviera.
He looked so...
He had a red cotton cap, a green shirt, mustard yellow pants, rope espadrilles and...
- Yellow ones!
- Right.
And a multicolored belt.
I couldn't miss him,just couldn't.
How was she dressed?
That I can't remember.
Yeah, it's the old story.
But I didn't fall for her right away.
It all came later with me.
How mean of me!
Is it true, Huguette?
- I'm not in his heart.
- It's true.
This is Laurent, my son.
A gleaner or a picker,
I'm not sure.
But I heard Glanum, not gleaning, that's why I talked about Saint-Remy, where Glanum is.
Gleaning, no.
Because gleaning is very different from picking, you see.
But picking, yes.
What's the difference?
The difference is that you pick fruit that hangs, that is hanging, but you glean things that sprout.
Like grain. It's different.
Olives and grain.
Almonds...
Figs too, people make jams out of figs.
The fig, you pick.
Look, nature's wonders!
Overripe and beautiful!
That's fruit from heaven!
I half-feel like interfering, but it is none of my business, it's their fruit.
This one's almost pure alcohol, I'll be tipsy.
Anyway, half the people are stingy.
They won't allow gleaning because they don't feel like being nice.
There's a lot left.
The harvest is over now.
Are these not edible?
Edible, yes, but not good for making candied fruits.
Do you allow people to collect them?
No. I'm not the owner, but up to now, it's never been allowed.
The harvest of the cabbages is over, only a few are left here and there.
These cabbages can be gleaned with absolute impunity by gleaners from Avignon or around.
Here are lovely tomatoes.
The machine couldn't take what's too low.
All these tomatoes, which are just as red as my bible, the penal code, all can be gleaned.
And it's not me, it's the penal code that says so, in article R-26.1 0. Here: gleaning is allowed from sunup until sundown.
First requirement.
The second requirement is that gleaning occurs after the harvest.
And here, we can clearly see the harvest is over.
Paging through an old law commentary
I happened upon a decree, or rather an edict, dated Nov. 2, 1 5 54 which says just the same as the law today.
It allows the poor, the wretched, the deprived, to enter the fields once harvesting is over.
Old documents talk of the poor, the destitute, but how are we to consider those who want for nothing and glean just for fun?
It's as if they needed something too.
If they glean for fun, it's because they have a need for fun.
So if the requirements and the times are adhered to, they can glean as the poor used to.
Thank you.
Sure.
I'll take a walk in the cabbages.
I'll walk my small camera among the colored cabbages and film other vegetables which catch my eye.
On this type of gleaning, of images, impressions, there is no legislation, and gleaning is defined figuratively as a mental activity.
To glean facts, acts and deeds, to glean information.
And for forgetful me, it's what I have gleaned that tells where I've been.
From Japan, I brought back in my case souvenirs I had gleaned.
I am back home, the cats are here, there's mail, one plant's died, the others haven't.
Then I look at the leak in the ceiling and the mold,
I got used to it.
I like it in the end.
It's like a landscape, an abstract painting, a Tapies, a Guo Qiang, a Borderie.
There's water dripping,
I open my suitcase.
Amazing, in a department store in Tokyo, on the top floor, there were Rembrandt paintings, original Rembrandts.
Saskia, up close.
And then my hand up close,
I mean, this is my project: to film with one hand my other hand.
To enter into the horror of it.
I find it extraordinary.
I feel as if I am an animal, worse, I am an animal I don't know.
And here's Rembrandt's self-portrait, but it's just the same in fact, always a self-portrait.
Maurice Utrillo's we saw in a very small museum in the former City Hall of Sannois.
We were going to film nearby, at Herve's, alias VR99.
In the year 2000, his alias will be VR2000.
'Loading up' means retrieving heavy objects people get rid of.
To do so, town councils and city halls provide small maps such as this one.
It shows all the streets, the districts and the days on which one can go and pick them up.
I think the maps show where to dump things rather.
Yes, right, well,
I read the map my own way because that's where I find my raw material.
I am, among other things, a painter and a retriever.
I prefer night time, and because I go by bike,
I can only carry small things home.
It'll be easier if I show you.
I make images from salvaged material, frames from wood,
I use food packages, slates, and then I also recycle my own packets of cigarette paper, and what's good about these objects is that they have a past, they've already had a life, and they're still very much alive.
All you have to do is give them a second chance.
All you need to do is wander around, locate sites, and then simply help yourself, like in a real department store.
On site, you find heaps of heavy objects, it is best to get there quickly, because the competition is fierce.
Objects go quickly.
They're like presents left on the street, it's like Christmas.
When I was a kid, my grandfather used to salvage things as well.
He made piles.
I've always liked the world of dumps and salvage, anything that's been sort of discarded by society.
It's like a cavern here.
My own little cavern, that's right.
A place where I combine objects differently.
I need to accumulate.
It's a shelter as well?
From what?
From emptiness.
Because it's full here.
I'm moving towards emptiness now, or rather, towards lessness.
As much lessness as possible.
- You're still a long way away!
- I am.
Right now, I store up things because I know
I will need to recycle some.
The encounter happens on the street.
The object beckons me, because it belongs here in a way.
The encounter also happens on the road, and it happened to us.
On our left, an abandoned factory.
On the other side, a sign '' Finds''.
''Curios'' is common, but '' Finds'' is more inviting.
Hello, how are you?
Hello.
Turn and face me!
He won't.
I spotted some wheat behind that chap, and behind the robot,
I discovered a painting on gleaning.
It contained both the humble stooping of Millet's Glaneuses and the proud posture of Breton's Gleaner.
The painter had an old dictionary at hand.
Honest, this is no movie trick, we really did find these Glaneuses purely by chance.
The painting had beckoned us because it belonged here in this film.
On the road again, off to the
Ideal Palace of Bodan Litnanski, a much visited, much publicized place.
This retired brickmason came from Russia and started building totem towers made of scraps he found in dumps and brought back in his trailer hooked up to his moped.
It's solid stuff, you know, very solid.
I am a brickmason.
I like dolls, they're my system.
Dolls are characters.
What do you think of all this?
- He's an amateur.
- Sorry?
He's an amateur.
We can't stop him, we let him.
But your husband is an artist.
An artist, well, maybe...
Why not?
There's better than that.
- What?
- Better, much better than that.
Like Louis Pons, for instance, who uses junk as an inspiration.
He draws through objects, he accommodates chance.
All these objects around here are my dictionary, useless things.
People think it's a cluster of junk.
I see it as a cluster of possibilities.
Each object gives a direction, each is a line, picked up here and there, indeed gleaned, and which become my paintings.
The aim of art is to tidy up one's inner and exterior worlds.
These are just crayons, children's crayons.
Here we have tins and spools...
This is the tongue of a small bell.
I make sentences from things.
A cricket on a heap of trash.
Cages are interesting too, a bit like boats, like violins and things whose... shapes at first are very simple and the same, but the possible variations are infinite.
These are skirting boards and frames.
There is a... from cars... a windshield wiper.
But for me they are streaks.
I have to balance the streaks.
That's a statement.
Horizontal statements, nothing else.
Again one hand filming the other hand, and more trucks.
I'd like to capture them.
To retain things passing?
No,just to play.
Noirmoutier is an island renowned for its causeway and its oysters.
People glean there after rough storms and very low tides.
Storms dislodge oysters from their beds and wash them ashore.
But they all know that around Christmas time, we are so busy that we leave it to the gleaners.
They go as soon as the storm has abated.
A high sea over the beds is a pretty sight but to profit from the low tide gleaners need a copy of the Tide Tables.
We come every year for the lowest tide.
They're going to follow the receding sea and anything they find they pick up.
People collect the oysters that have come loose.
In theory, they keep out of the poles around the beds.
They must keep out.
They are too close.
Here the oyster farmers let them carry on, but... it degenerates sometimes.
We don't trespass!
The limit must be here, but... we encroach a little sometimes.
We're not stupid.
We see others and do the same.
If they tell us anything, we scram.
It's tolerated but not really allowed.
It's not downright illegal.
There still exists a right to glean, provided people glean
1 5 yards from the beds.
- 25 yards away.
- Is it 25 yards now?
What are people allowed to do?
To collect up to 7 pounds each, nothing more.
- 1 0 yards away minimum.
- Right.
1 1 pounds per person.
7 pounds of clams and 1 1 pounds of oysters, something like that.
1 1 pounds per person, I think.
Three dozen per person but surely they take more than that.
They pick up small inedible oysters that were churned by the waves and are full of sand.
People from the mainland eat them, and then say they get sick.
TheJura region was flooded.
The river Dard barred our route.
I liked it when animals barred my way, or I just stopped for them.
The Nenon family, in the hills near Apt, present a special case of picking.
The vineyard they found was wholly abandoned.
That's a fully fledged harvest here!
Yes, the entire vineyard was left unpruned last year.
An entire harvest going to waste.
I spotted this place and I was very intrigued by it.
Could anybody say anything?
- Don't the owners care?
- No. After Nov. 1 , we are allowed to pick grapes in the vineyards.
If not, they're eaten by wild boars or birds.
- Do wild boars like grapes?
- They love grapes.
On that day,
I filmed dancing pruning shears.
I forgot to turn my camera off, which is why we get the dance of the lens cap.
The cap has stopped its crazy jig.
We're off to see the only owner who cares for his gleaners.
I warn children about the terrible effects if they eat too much, but I take for granted that the adults know and I leave them alone.
Jerome Noel-Bouton shows us an old photo of his vines which used to be Marey's.
There is a mini-museum in the cellar.
An engineer and erudite physiologist,
Marey invented chronophotography.
He was a visionary.
He analyzed movement before Muybridge and the Lumieres.
He is the ancestor of all movie makers, and we're proud to be family.
Marey was my father's grandfather, which makes him my great-grandfather, and to be more specific, my grandfather was Marey's son-in-law, since... his wife, my grandmother, was Marey's daughter.
She married a man named Bouton and this estate, which used to be in the Bouton family, was bought by Marey, and returned to the Bouton family when his daughter married a Bouton.
Congratulations!
The tower you can see over there, he built with his own two hands to house his still camera equipment.
He set up wires and waited.
Animals or birds went past, triggering the camera.
That's the hut from which, with his chronophotographic rifle, he broke down the flight of birds.
That's Demeny, Marey's assistant, holding the rifle and the film reel.
I wonder who the boy with a bowler hat is.
Marey's experimental pictures and film bits, technical prowess aside, are pure visual delight.
Our train leaves Paris and happens to slows down as we pass
Ivry waste collection center.
The heart of our topic, since we're going to Prades, home of our musician Joanna.
She met youngsters who had had a brush with the law for damaging the trash bins of a supermarket because the contents had been doused in bleach.
I thought I could film them explaining the case if I met all the protagonists - the youngsters gathered on the square, the manager of the shop, and the magistrate from the court, who seemed concerned and polite.
I wanted to know how these homeless coped with the law.
Should squatting be legalized?
I could work on it, if not for this robe.
But your robe is lovely!
It was a simple case of youngsters vandalizing things.
I found them guilty of violence.
Before bleach was sprayed on?
They'd knock over the trash and my staff had to clean up after them.
That led me to apply the law and bleach the trash, which they didn't appreciate.
- We got angry.
- But nothing serious.
We knocked over trash cans, and damaged the wall with graffiti and tomatoes.
They broke the camera.
It was locked, we had to climb a little.
They went over the fence.
They were trespassing on private property.
Appearing in court was itself a penalty for these youths who want to be free of all rules.
We only stole trash.
The aim isn't to fine them but to remind them of the law.
They all played their part, applying their own logic.
The kids said what they were supposed to.
We filmed them with their dogs.
It was picturesque.
I'm not that antisocial.
- May I ask you how old you are?
Their beauty is poignant when you realize that, for whatever reason, they get most of their food from trash cans.
In court, I was told it was a dialogue of the deaf, but not of the dumb.
They seized the chance to have fun.
I said she was mad, she cited me for contempt of court.
We said she was out of her mind, and she would go: Write it down!
Recorder, write down:
Out of her mind!
We felt it was a foregone conclusion. It was sickening.
She opted for trial in closed court.
I shouted and slammed the door.
They're not through talking about this episode, and I'm not through thinking about it in my hotel room.
We filmed and continue to film people who hang around trash cans.
They have various reasons for doing so.
Each experiences it differently.
- Hi!
- Here he is!
How are you?
Sit down, there's coffee for you.
We had been told: '' He wears rubber boots.
He salvages everything''.
Yes, I live almost 1 00% on things from the trash.
Everybody, rich or poor, throws food away. Why?
Because we are so stupid with food!
If we're past the sell-by date of a yogurt, people go:
''Oh my God, I can't eat this!
It'll kill me!''
So stupid.
It's easy to tell from the smell of it if it's OK or not.
It's quite simple, I've eaten
1 00% trash for 1 0 years now... for 1 0 or 1 5 years,
I've never been ill.
- You don't have a job?
- I do.
I have a job, a salary, a social security number.
So you are not forced to do that?
Absolutely not.
Salvaging is a matter of ethics for me, because I find it utterly unacceptable to see all this waste on the streets.
That proves we're heading for disasters, like the Erika oil spill.
Oil Slick
Put the head on the right.
Looser...
Sea birds, guillemots, razorbill penguins, all those who were smashed up real good by Total Fina Oil, those who will get smashed up real good by this over-consuming society...
If they are cleaned, the birds might still get caught in nets, it's for them that I'm an activist.
All the rest can die in their apartments, on their trash,
I don't care. Birds first.
Do you always wear boots?
Yes, rubber boots have 2 advantages, on this hostile ground, they're really good stuff.
There's a psychological aspect too, with my boots,
I'm like the lord of this town.
All these idiots dump away,
I come after them and rake in the chips.
Trash is Beautiful!
An exhibition featuring demonstration trash cans was organized to teach children how to sort out the trash.
At Trash is Beautiful, they like colors, and children play with bits of junk.
This is just plastic from the street.
Gino Rizzi is in charge of the kids' workshop.
He himself transforms pots of yogurt into flowers and plastic bottles into mobiles.
Where does play end and art start?
Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art
The American artist Sze exhibits mobiles made with lots of bits and pieces.
The kitchen trash has made it to the art world, where junk is highly-prized and priced.
In any case, museum trash is small, cute, clean and colorful.
Have those kids ever seen brooms in action, or shaken hands with a garbage collector?
- How are you?
- Fine.
That's neighborhood life.
I live here at Mr. Charlie Plusquellec's, because he's a friend.
More than a friend, a protector, a godfather, he's everything to me.
I am so very very happy, very glad, I am here surrounded by nature.
You see, it's worse than paradise.
Salomon is a little bit like a migrating bird.
He arrives, he moves in, and then one day, he disappears.
And then he comes back again, and then leaves.
So far he's been back 3 times.
Every day, I come out of here,
I wander around, looking here and there for throw-aways.
Don't touch anything!
- You hear me?
- Yes, Ma'am.
Don't you understand what I said?
Every morning, early, you come across a little something.
It's like a lottery.
It's good.
There's lots.
Do you need it?
Wait, he might want some.
Want some bread?
I always come here and help myself.
Sometimes you get good cold meats, sometimes fowl, a bit of everything.
Salomon found chicken legs.
So I'll cook the meat before it goes off.
You're going to eat chicken and rabbit for a month!
No, don't worry.
We always find someone to share with.
We give it to the neighbors, the woman next door especially.
That's good.
Right now, we have 1 , 2, 3,
4 fridges and 2 freezers that we picked up and fixed.
I patch them up, I fix them, and when the machine works
I sell it or...
I give it away to our neighbors.
Fridges are everywhere on the streets.
Sometimes they work, sometimes not.
The Waste Ground artists of Villeneuve sur Lot collects fridges and recycle them as fully furnished, fitted spaces.
Fridge Demo
Free our comrades!
My neighbor the Lion of Denfert is made of bronze.
My friend the Lion in Arles is made of stone.
We got there in the early hours.
The people from the fair were still asleep, and I saw a man looking at the river flow by.
I half-felt like talking to him.
Further on, along the Rhone, in a blissful orchard
I saw gleaners arrive.
You can tell them from their boxes, sacks and plastic bags which don't look anything like the standard containers of the workers.
My name's David,
I'm a foreman at the Cape farm.
We often allow gleaners to come in after our pickers provided they remain
1 0 yards behind.
Look, there's still a lot left in the trees.
We just take advantage of this.
I collect them so that they don't go to waste, and I share them out, we stew them or whatever.
I want to pick them because there're lots left as you can see.
I don't take damaged ones, because my children are very particular.
They're used to getting the best.
This one is damaged so I chuck it away.
We gleaners also discard some fruit.
Here's an apple which has got nothing going for it, it's like an ugly and stupid woman.
It's small and sunburnt.
Commercial value: zero.
We can't prevent people from providing themselves with apples once we have finished harvesting.
So we proclaim an official gleaning period, we take car registrations down, if it's a moped, we ask for a Xerox of the owner's I D and we tell them from when to when they can come and collect.
Isn't it a bit over-regulated?
Well, it's either that or nothing at all.
Once people are registered, they can take 400 pounds, I don't mind, even if it's a whole lot.
Good for them.
In this field of 3 hectares, at least 1 0 tons will be left unpicked.
That gives the gleaners quite a lot of exercise.
You have to find them behind the trees, under the leaves.
It takes a while to fill up a basket.
Picking is not a piece of cake, it's hard work.
Quite a few have fallen here.
You just have to pick them up.
Robert, a gleaner of many crops, let us follow him.
I'm looking for pine nuts.
You're really thorough!
Right, I really don't let anything go by.
In this greenhouse, the tomato harvest is over.
We pick the remains before they clean the place.
Here, see the tomatoes...
That's nature, it shouldn't be wasted.
It's abandoned.
Once the harvest is over, it's not worth hiring people just for those.
They'd rather let us do it.
Can anybody go in the greenhouses?
No, not the greenhouses.
I don't know what the law is.
Greenhouses are a facility to grow vegetables.
Once the harvest is collected, there's some left, a few tomatoes, grapes, carrots or celery.
If gleaners remain within the law farmers can't say anything, can't sue them for anything.
Even on their property?
Even then, precisely, gleaning is always on private property.
Mr. Dessaud, our lawyer in the fields, explained gleaning rights.
Mrs. Espie, our lawyer in the streets, tells us about salvaging rights.
The law on gleaning doesn't apply to these objects.
'' Res derelictae'' are ownerless things, since the owner's intention has been clearly expressed: they have deliberately abandoned them.
Only the penal code deals with their status and says this property can't be stolen since it has no owner.
Those who take the object become its legal owners.
This acquisition is unusual, since it comes from no one.
Once taken, the object belongs to them irrevocably.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Yeah. Sidelined beds on the sidewalk
Washed-out machines, tired-out fridges just bend down and grab your furniture
Yeah. Cookers, cushions, club armchairs
Weary wood chairs and TVsets,
Worn-out couches just bend over,you're made over
Street rehab and TVrap,yeah,yeah!
Broken TVs
I've seen lots ofTVs abandoned, and within a few minutes somebody was taking out the copper.
It's the copper from the deflector coils.
I looked at the magic screen thinking I began this film right after the eclipse shown on TV, continued while the countdown to Y2Kwas shown on TV, and ended the film on the 1 st of May...
Other people take TVs home, hoping to repair them.
I found 2 small chairs on the street and took them home.
One night when the bulky refuse is thrown out,
I drove around with Francois who had done one of my film scores and who also sang.
He has dressed in white for 25 years.
Francois is curious, he likes rummaging, but he didn't find anything that night.
He looked at an empty clock and he turned it down.
I picked it up and took it home.
A clock without hands is my kind of thing.
You don't see time passing.
I like filming rot, leftovers, waste, mold and trash.
But I never forget those who shop in the leftovers and trash when the market is over.
It's past 2 o'clock.
I've done my shopping and I linger on until the market is over.
I notice a man with a large bag eating on the spot.
I would see him now and then, always with his bag, always eating.
The day he was eating parsley
I went over to him.
Do you often eat parsley?
Sometimes yes. Parsley's full of vitamin C and E, beta carotene, zinc, magnesium, it's excellent.
His answer amazed me.
Over the following weeks,
I filmed him repeatedly, with or without sound, and he talked in snatches.
I pick up food at the markets and I save money that way.
I'm mostly a vegetarian, so I find what I need.
I don't make much, but I still have to eat.
You should see what they get rid of...
From the markets, I get fruit, vegetables mostly, sometimes cheese too, but that's rare.
I eat a lot of apples.
And here I can get as many apples as I want.
- How many apples a day do you eat?
- 6 or 7.
Is it your staple diet?
I also eat bread.
I get up at 4, I take the train and I arrive in Paris at 5:45.
Between 6 and 7, they throw away all of the bread from the day before.
If you spot a trash can near a bakery it's likely to contain sandwiches, bread, and all that.
I eat a lot of bread. It's a staple food full of proteins and glucids.
It's strange to be concerned...
- About balanced diets?
- Yes.
Since I studied biology, it's quite normal
I should be concerned.
I used to be a teaching assistant.
When people find out
I have a Master's degree, they don't understand why
I sell papers to make money.
I sell street papers or magazines.
Most times in front of the train station.
I live in a shelter where 50% of the people are illiterate.
Immigrants from Mali and Senegal mostly.
I arrived in that shelter
8 years ago, and I've been teaching them to read and write for 6 years.
I am not part of the school system,
I don't get paid for it.
I teach every evening from 6:30 / 7:00 until 8:30 / 9:00.
He arranged and decorated the classroom himself for the students who may attend whenever they please.
Ac, ec, ic, oc...
And see, for example, a noc-turnal ac-tivity.
Right, a nocturnal activity.
What does ''nocturnal'' mean?
Success? Success is...
Isn't success like a behavior?
It's to succeed in life.
Somebody who has succeeded.
- Like Celine Dion has?
- Right.
Famous?
But it's more like the will to...
Succeed.
Yes, when you've succeeded, that's success.
A use-ful... in-sect.
What's that?
A cockroach.
I don't know if it is useful but... but it is an insect.
Meeting that man is what impressed me the most.
And the time it took to find out about his nocturnal and voluntary activity in a suburban basement.
The other high point is quite different in kind.
I talked the Museum of Villefranche into bringing out from its reserves a painting by Hedouin which I had seen reproduced in black and white.
Brigitte, the curator, and her assistant,Julie had to disturb several sleepy paintings before finding the one
I wanted to reveal:
Gleaners Fleeing Before the Storm.
To see them in broad daylight, with stormy gusts lashing against the canvas, was true delight.

PARTOOK OF THE BREAD
AND THE JUICE,
AND THE WART WAS GONE.
WE HAD BEEN RAISED IN
THE ASSEMBLIES OF GOD.
AND WE ALWAYS
SORT OF FELT
THE ASSEMBLIES OF GOD
PREACHED THAT
GOD WAS LOOKING DOWN
AT YOU FROM HEAVEN
WITH A BIG HUGE
HAMMER IN HIS HAND
AND THAT IF YOU DID
ANYTHING WRONG,
HE WAS GOING TO HIT YOU
OVER THE HEAD WITH
THIS HAMMER
AND SEND YOU
STRAIGHT TO HELL.
Johnny Grover:
SHE WAS ALMOST SCARED
INTO STAYING CLOSE TO GOD.
I STILL SAY ADA DEHREN
IS HER SAVIOR,
BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ONE
THAT BOUGHT THE MAKE-UP
AT THE RUMMAGE SALE.
[LAUGHS] THEY WERE
THE FIRST ONES TO TRY MAKE-UP.
SEE ALL THIS STUFF?
LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF.
THAT'S MY BLUSH.
IT'S ALMOST GONE.
I GOT TO GO
TO THE SWAP MEET
AND GET SOME MORE.
I BUY IT AT
THE SWAP MEET.
MY POWDER THAT
KIND OF--
WHEN I CRY,
IT TAKES AWAY THE TEARS.
THIS IS MY
EYEBROW STUFF,
ALTHOUGH I DON'T
REALLY NEED TO PUT ON
EYEBROW STUFF,
BECAUSE ME EYEBROWS
ARE PERMANENT.
THIS TURNS PINK
WHEN YOU PUT IT ON.
SEE? BUT IT'S WHITE
TO START WITH.
EYELASH GLUE.
OH, HERE'S--
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.
OH, HERE'S MY MASCARA
THAT I'M SO FAMOUS FOR.
AS YOU SEE, IT IS
L'OREAL WATERPROOF
LASH OUT MAKE-UP.
AND, UM, AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT'S MUCH USED.
MUCH LOVED.
THEY ARE PUT ON SINGLY,
AND, UH, WITH LOTS
OF MASCARA.
THEY DON'T COME OFF,
I MEAN, THEY'RE...
THEY HAVE TO,
LITERALLY,
KIND OF WEAR OFF.
AND SO, ONCE IN A WHILE,
ONE WILL DROP OFF,
AND WHEN IT DOES,
I PUT ANOTHER ONE IN.
WITHOUT MY EYELASHES,
I WOULDN'T BE TAMMY FAYE.
I DON'T KNOW WHO I'D BE,
BUT I WOULDN'T BE ME.
RuPaul: IN 1960, AGED 17,
TAMMY WENT TO BIBLE COLLEGE
WHERE SHE MET
AND FELL IN LOVE
WITH A YOUNG, CHARISMATIC
PREACHER NAMED JIM BAKKER.
THE NEXT YEAR,
ON APRIL FOOL'S DAY,
JIM AND TAMMY WERE MARRIED.
THE YOUNG NEWLYWEDS
LIVED ON THE ROAD,
STRUGGLING TO MAKE A LIVING
AS ITINERANT PREACHERS,
JOINING A TRADITION OF
TRAVELING EVANGELISM
PIONEERED BY MINISTERS
LIKE ORAL ROBERTS.
EVERYTHING THAT'S
EVERY BEEN DONE
THAT'S WORTHWHILE
HAS BEEN DONE BY MEN,
BY WOMEN WHO SAID,
"I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE COST IS,
I'M GOING TO DO THIS
FOR THE GLORY OF GOD."
RuPaul: A BLEND
OF CHRISTIANITY
AND SHOWMANSHIP,
IT WAS A GROWING TREND
THAT WOULD CULMINATE
IN THE CREATION
OF TELEVANGELISM...
THE ELECTRIC CHURCH.
TODAY, IT BOASTS OVER
2,500 RADIO AND TV STATIONS,
REACHING AN
ESTIMATED AUDIENCE
OF 20 MILLION PEOPLE.
SATELLITES CIRCLE THE GLOBE,
BEAMING OUT THOUSANDS
OF PROGRAMS
24 HOURS A DAY,
7 DAYS A WEEK,
AND GENERATING MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE.
Announcer: THE CHRISTIAN
SHOPPING NETWORK.
THE ONLY NETWORK WHERE
YOU SOW THE KINGDOM OF GOD,
WHILE YOU PURCHASE
YOUR FAVORITE PRODUCTS
AT LOWER THAN RETAIL PRICE...
RuPaul: BUT IT ALL
STARTED OUT WITH PUPPETS,
JIM AND TAMMY'S PUPPETS.
OH, YEAH, WE PRACTICALLY
STARTED THE ELECTRIC CHURCH.
WE HAD BOUGHT SILKY
BUBBLE BATH, OF ALL THINGS,
AND WE SAW THESE LITTLE
HEADS ON THE BUBBLE BATH,
AND I--I STARTED
TALKING FOR THEM.
YOU KNOW, MAKING
LITTLE VOICES.
[IN A SILLY VOICE]
"HELLO, THERE."
THOSE KINDS OF
LITTLE VOICES.
AND JIM SAID, "TAMMY,
WE COULD MAKE PUPPETS
OUT OF THESE THINGS,
AND WE COULD USE THEM
IN CHURCH FOR THE KIDS."
WE TOOK THE SILKY
BUBBLE BATH, IT WAS PORKY PIG,
WE MELTED THE EARS DOWN
AND MADE A LITTLE GIRL PIGGY.
SHE HAD TO HAVE A FRIEND,
SO WE MADE AN ALLIGATOR
THAT TALKED LIKE THIS,
[LOW-PITCHED VOICE]
"HELLO.
I'M ALLIE THE ALLIGATOR.
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
"AND I'M SUSIE MUPPET."
I WORKED THEM WITH
MY HANDS, LIKE THIS.
THIS WAS THEIR LITTLE HANDS,
AND THIS WAS THEIR HEAD.
♪ JESUS TAKES A FROWN ♪
♪ AND HE TURNS IT
UPSIDE DOWN ♪
♪ AND OOPS! ♪
♪ HERE COMES
A SMILE... ♪
RuPaul: SUSIE MUPPET
AND ALLIE THE ALLIGATOR
ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF
TV MINISTER PAT ROBERTSON.
HE RAN A SMALL LOCAL STATION
AND DREAMT OF
BUILDING A CHRISTIAN
BROADCASTING NETWORK.
Jim Bakker:
WE GOT A CALL
FROM PAT ROBERTSON.
HE WANTED
TO MEET WITH US.
AND HE SAID,
"WOULD YOU CONSIDER
JOINING THE NETWORK?"
WELL, THE NETWORK
WAS ONE STATION,
A ONE-KILOWATT
TELEVISION STATION.
IT HARDLY WENT DOWN
THE BLOCK AT TIMES.
Announcer:
IT'S TIME FOR THE NATIONS
BIGGEST YARD PARTY,
THE JIM & TAMMY SHOW.
HI, EVERYBODY!
All: HI,
JIM AND TAMMY!
Jim Bakker: WE DID NOT
HAVE A SCRIPT,
SO EVERYTHING WAS
REALLY AD-LIBBED.
I THINK JIM, ACTUALLY,
WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS
AROUND THE PUPPETS,
BECAUSE HE NEVER REALLY KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO SAY.
JIM, YOU JUST ATE
MY SHRIMP UP.
[GASPS] OH, I WAS
JUST STANDING HERE--
SHUT UP!
Jim: SUSIE WAS
THE BAD TAMMY FAYE,
AND ALLIE WAS ALWAYS
SOMEHOW--
SHE HAD A SPLIT
PERSONALITY,
'CAUSE ALLIE WAS
ALWAYS NICE TO ME,
BUT SUSIE MUPPET WAS
ALWAYS ARGUING WITH ME.
AND I MEAN, IF THOSE
PEOPLE AT HOME,
I DON'T KNOW
IF THEY KNEW...
WE WERE HAVING
LEGITIMATE FIGHTS,
ONLY WE WERE DOING IT
THROUGH THESE PUPPETS.
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
THE SHOW BECAME
THE NUMBER ONE PROGRAM
ON C.B.N.
♪ I'M GOING
TO LOVE MY ENEMIES ♪
♪ DO GOOD TO THOSE
WHO ARE BAD TO ME ♪
♪ GOING TO LOVE... ♪
I MEAN,

RuPaul: JIM AND TAMMY
HAD AGREED TO WORK
FOR PAT ROBERTSON
ON CONDITION THAT
THEY COULD ALSO START
A LATE-NIGHT TALK SHOW.
HE SAID, "I'LL MAKE
A DEAL WITH YOU.
"IF YOU GET THE KID SHOW
UP AND RUNNING,
THEN YOU CAN DO THIS
LATE-NIGHT SHOW."
AND SO PAT HONORED
HIS WORD ON THAT,
AND JIM STARTED
WHAT WAS CALLED THE 700 CLUB,
THE FIRST CHRISTIAN
TALK SHOW IN HISTORY.
Announcer: SO HERE'S
YOUR HOST ON...
HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO THE 700 CLUB TODAY.
I'M SO VERY,
VERY HAPPY THAT
YOU COULD JOIN US
FOR THIS PROGRAM
OF PRAYER AND PRAISE.
RuPaul: THE INSTANT
SUCCESS OF THE 700 CLUB
AND THE JIM AND TAMMY SHOW,
HELPED TURN THE CHRISTIAN
BROADCAST NETWORK
FROM A LOCAL STATION
INTO A FULL-FLEDGED NETWORK.
BUT THINGS BEGAN TO SOUR.
Tammy: PAT BEGAN TO WANT
TO TAKE OVER SOME OF
THE 700 CLUB,
WHICH WAS FINE,
BECAUSE IT WAS HIS STATION
AND WE HONORED HIM FOR THAT.
AND SO, WE JUST SAID, "PAT,
"YOU'RE ABLE TO DO IT
BY YOURSELF NOW.
YOU DON'T NEED US."
AND SO WE DECIDED TO MOVE ON
AND DO OUR OWN THING.
THE 700 CLUB TODAY
IS PROBABLY
THE MOST POWERFUL
OF THE RELIGIOUS
BROADCASTS.
Announcer: THIS IS...
Reverend White:
AND JIM WAS THE FIRST
HOST ON THE 700 CLUB,
BEFORE
PAT ROBERTSON WAS.
RuPaul: TAMMY WROTE
TO PAT ROBERTSON
ASKING HIM TO BE INTERVIEWED
FOR THIS DOCUMENTARY.
HE DECLINED.
JIM AND TAMMY THEN MOVED
WEST TO CALIFORNIA,
AND IN THE KITCHEN
OF THEIR RENTED HOME
WITH THEIR FRIENDS
JAN AND PAUL CROUCH,
THEY LAUNCHED
A NEW VENTURE:
THE TRINITY BROADCAST
NETWORK.
Tammy: JIM WAS THE HOST,
AND I WAS THE CO-HOST,
AND JAN AND PAUL WERE
IN THE BACKGROUND.
RuPaul: BUT NOT FOR LONG.
JIM AND TAMMY
WERE FORCED OUT
IN A BOARD-ROOM COUP
BY JAN AND PAUL CROUCH.
Announcer: THIS IS THE TRINITY
BROADCASTING NETWORK,
CELEBRATING OUR
25th ANNIVERSARY.
RuPaul: TODAY,
THE CROUCHS STILL PRESIDE
OVER THE MINISTRY JIM
AND TAMMY STARTED WITH THEM,
WHICH HAS SINCE
BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S
LARGEST TV MINISTRIES.
JIM AND TAMMY STARTED
ALMOST EVERYTHING
THAT IS NOW POWERFUL IN
RELIGIOUS TELECASTING.
BUT AS SOON AS
THEY GOT IT BUILT,
LIKE AT TBN,
AS SOON AS THEY GOT
PEOPLE WATCHING,
AS SOON AS THEY GOT
THE AUDIENCE CAPTIVATED,
AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN
TO GET POWER,
THEY WERE,
KIND OF, LET GO.
RuPaul: TAMMY WROTE
TO THE CROUCHS
ASKING THEM
TO BE INTERVIEWED
FOR THIS DOCUMENTARY.
THEY DECLINED.

RuPaul:
PTL EMBRACED THOSE
THAT OTHER CHRISTIAN
FUNDAMENTALISTS
AND TELEVANGELISTS
REJECTED.
STEVE IS A PATIENT
OF AIDS,
AND HE SO GENEROUSLY
ALLOWED US TO TALK
TO HIM TODAY.
WAS IT JUST
A WORD TO YOU?
IS IT SOMETHING
THAT JUST HAPPENS
TO OTHER PEOPLE
AND NOT TO STEVE?
I KNEW THAT IT WAS
A GROWING PROBLEM
IN THE GAY COMMUNITY,
BUT I, AS MANY OTHER PEOPLE
DID BACK IN 1981 AND '82,
DENIED THAT
IT COULD TOUCH ME.
I MEAN,
WE DIDN'T SEE HOW--
I MEAN,
WHY WOULD IT HURT ME?
I WAS A GOOD
CHRISTIAN PASTOR.
DO YOU KNOW HOW
EARLY THAT WAS
FOR ANYBODY IN
THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
TO BE REACHING OUT
AND TO BE EMBRACING
A GAY PERSON,
LET ALONE
A PERSON WITH AIDS?
TAMMY BAKKER DID IT
WHEN NO ONE ELSE
WOULD DO IT.
HOW SAD THAT
WE AS CHRISTIANS,
WHO ARE TO BE
THE SALT OF THE EARTH,
AND WE ARE--WE,
WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
ABLE TO LOVE EVERYONE,
ARE AFRAID SO BADLY
OF AN AIDS PATIENT
THAT WE WILL NOT
GO UP AND PUT OUR
ARM AROUND THEM
AND TELL THEM
THAT WE CARE?
RuPaul: WHETHER
IT WAS AIDS, DRUG ABUSE,
OR MARRIAGE COUNSELING,
PTL, AND IN PARTICULAR
TAMMY,
RUSHED IN WHERE OTHER
CHRISTIAN BROADCASTERS
FEARED TO TREAD.
THE PENILE IMPLANT
OF THE INFLATABLE TYPE,
AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT
WE'RE LOOKING AT--
IT'S THE NEWEST ONE, RIGHT?
THIS IS THE NEWEST ONE
OUT THERE.
WHEN HE WANTS
TO BECOME ERECT,
HE REACHES DOWN,
HE SQUEEZES THAT
SEVERAL TIMES,
AND THE MAN
BECOMES FIRM.
I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC.
NOW GO AHEAD, AUDIENCE,

I PRACTICALLY HAD BOTH
MY CHILDREN ON TV.
BEFORE I WAS BORN,
I WAS ON TELEVISION.
IN MY MOTHER'S STOMACH,
I WAS ON TELEVISION.
SO MY WHOLE LIFE HAS
BEEN IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.

"I REMEMBER YOU FROM WHEN
YOU WERE A LITTLE KID.

THEY GREW UP IN OUR HOUSE,

WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST
4 SATELLITE NETWORKS
IN THE WORLD.
Announcer:
YOU'RE WATCHING...
THAT'S WHY LATER ON,
THE PLUM THAT SO MANY
PEOPLE WANTED
WAS THAT SATELLITE.
RuPaul: BUT JIM WASN'T
SATISFIED WITH JUST
A TELEVISION NETWORK.
Tammy:
JIM FELT THAT IF THE PEOPLE
WERE THERE ON THE GROUNDS
AND COULD COME AND STAY
WHERE PTL WAS AND SEE,
AND GET IN ON THE VISION...
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTED.
HE WANTED ALL THE PEOPLE
TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BE THERE.
RuPaul:
TO REALIZE THIS VISION,
JIM BAKKER CONTACTED HIS
CHURCH BUILDER ROE MESSNER.
Roe: I GOT ON A PLANE
AND WENT DOWN
TO CHARLOTTE,
MET WITH JIM,
AND HE LAID OUT THIS
GRANDIOSE PLAN
THAT HE HAD FOR
2,500 ACRES
AND WANTED TO KNOW
IF I WOULD, UH,
DESIGN HIS BUILDINGS
AND BE HIS CONTRACTOR.
RuPaul:
WHAT JIM ENVISIONED
WAS NOTHING LESS THAN
A CHRISTIAN DISNEYLAND,
A MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR
RESORT
THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY
INCLUDE A 500-ROOM HOTEL,
A STATE-OF-THE-ART
BROADCAST FACILITY,
AND A WATER PARK.

CRISIS RIDDEN FINANCES
ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION
OF A YOUNG REPORTER
AT THE LOCAL PAPER,
THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER.
I HAD BEEN REPORTING ON PTL
FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
AND THERE WAS A HISTORY
OF MISMANAGEMENT,
AND OF QUESTIONABLE
SPENDING OF MONEY.
TAMMY AND I
ARE UNDERGOING
THE MOST VICIOUS ATTACKS
IN THE HISTORY
OF THIS MINISTRY.
BY NOW, PERHAPS,
YOU THINK
THAT WE SHOULD BE
USED TO THESE ATTACKS.
BUT IT'S BEEN GOING ON
FOR A LONG TIME, TAMMY.
YES, JIM.
IT'S BEEN GOING ON
FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS.
USA TODAY CARRIED
THIS BLURB:
"PTL PRESIDENT JIM BAKKER
USED DONATIONS
TO HIS TELEVISION MINISTRY
TO BUY PERSONAL ITEMS,
LIKE A MINK COAT,
A SPORTS CAR,
AND A HOUSE BOAT,
THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
REPORTED SUNDAY."
I HAVE ALL
THE CANCELLED CHECKS.
I'LL HAVE TO PICK 'EM
ALL BACK UP AGAIN.
I THINK THE FACT IS BAKKER
LATCHED ONTO AN IDEA
THAT WAS GONNA HELP
PROPEL HIS MINISTRY FORWARD,
AND IT THEN BECAME
A VERY CONVENIENT WAY
TO DO A LOT
OF OTHER THINGS,
AND HE MADE
SOME STATEMENTS
ABOUT WHAT HE WAS
GONNA DO WITH THIS MONEY,
THAT HE THEN
DID NOT FOLLOW.

OFF SCREEN, THEIR MARRIAGE
WAS FALLING APART.
JIM HAD A SECRET.
JIM BAKKER,
MEET JESSICA HAHN.
Charles: IN 1980, ONE OF HIS
RELIGIOUS ASSOCIATES
HAD ARRANGED
AN ENCOUNTER IN A HOTEL ROOM
WITH A WOMAN
NAMED JESSICA HAHN,
A YOUNG WOMAN,
I THINK, IN HER EARLY 20s.
AND THAT LED TO
A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER
OF SOME KIND OR ANOTHER.
THERE'S A DISPUTE
OVER WHAT EXACTLY
HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM.
THAT DAY ALL MY DREAMS
WERE SHATTERED
AND MY LIFE WOULD NEVER
BE THE SAME.
Charles: IN EARLY 1985...
PTL AGREED TO SETTLE
A THREATENED LAWSUIT
BY JESSICA HAHN
BY PAYING HER
A SUM OF MONEY.
RuPaul: ONCE AGAIN,
THE PTL NETWORK
TURNED TO ROE MESSNER,
APPARENTLY WITHOUT
JIM'S KNOWLEDGE.
Roe: THEY CAME TO ME AND
SAID WE GOT A PROBLEM.
WE'VE MADE AN AGREEMENT
WITH THIS LADY
THAT IF WE
PAY HER $265,000,
SHE'LL GO AWAY.
AND I SAID THAT'S
NOT THE WAY TO DO THAT.
I SAID YOU
SHOULDN'T DO THAT.
I SAID, "I'LL LOAN
YOU THE MONEY,
BUT," I SAYS,
"IT'S A LOAN.
I WANT THE MONEY
PAID BACK."
RuPaul: UNAWARE
OF JIM'S SECRET,
TAMMY FAYE WAS STRUGGLING
WITH HER OWN.
JOIN THE PTL CLUB,
AND TAMMY WANTS TO
SEND YOU A COPY OF HER BOOK
HOW TO OVERCOME FEAR.
Tammy: I BECAME
VERY NERVOUS,
SO I WENT
TO THE DOCTOR
WITH A
HYPERVENTILATION
PROBLEM,
AND THEY KNEW
IT WAS A CASE OF
NERVOUS FRUSTRATION.
AND SO THEY
GAVE ME A LITTLE
PILL CALLED ADAVAN.
AND ADAVAN...
WAS A WONDERFUL DRUG
FOR ME AT THE TIME.
I DIDN'T TAKE
MY MEDICINE TODAY
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO BE BRIGHT.
YESTERDAY,
I ALMOST FELL OFF
MY HIGH HEELS.
I WAS ON MEDICINE,
TAKING MY MEDICINE,
SO I'M NOT SAYING--
THIS WAS HER WAY OF
DEALING WITH THE STRESS
THAT SHE WAS UNDER
IN THE RELATIONSHIP.
AND SHE WOULD
LITERALLY LOSE TRACK
OF THE NUMBER OF ADAVAN
THAT SHE WOULD TAKE.
TAMMY, I THINK YOU OUGHT
TO SING A SONG FOR US.
I'M BACK HERE LOOKING
AT THE BOAT, JIM.
ISN'T THIS
A MAGNIFICENT THING?
YES.
RIGHT HERE
ON OUR BEACH.
IT LOOKS BRAND NEW.
I BET--
I'M GONNA TAKE
MY SHOES OFF AND
WADE IN THE WATER.
I DON'T THINK THAT
BOAT'S EVER SEEN WATER.
[GIGGLING]
I FINALLY GOT
TO THE POINT
WHERE I HAD
TO HAVE ADAVAN
WITH ME AT ALL TIMES.
RuPaul:
THEN TAMMY OVERDOSED.
Tammy: WE HAD JUST
BROKEN GROUND
FOR ONE OF THE BUILDINGS
THAT WE WERE GETTING
READY TO BUILD.
IT WAS GOING TO BE
A FOOTBALL FIELD LONG.
AND WE HAD
BROKEN GROUND.
THE DAY WAS
VERY, VERY COLD,
AND NONE OF US HAD
WORN PROPER CLOTHING.
AND I GOT PNEUMONIA
AS A RESULT OF THAT.
THEY SAID THAT I HAD
ENOUGH ADAVAN IN ME
THAT WOULD'VE KILLED
A HUGE TRUCK DRIVER.
RuPaul: TAMMY WAS RUSHED
ON A FRIEND'S PRIVATE JET
TO EISENHOWER MEDICAL CENTER
IN PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA.
ON THE AIRPLANE I WENT
INTO HALLUCINATIONS.
IT-IT'S PLEASANT.
IT IS PLEASANT
WHEN YOU'RE IN A
DRUG-INDUCED STATE OF MIND.
I MEAN, YOU CAN SIT
AND WATCH WONDERFUL THINGS,
AND I SAW CARTOONS.
BUT THEN
THERE ARE TIMES
WHEN YOU SEE REALLY
HORRIBLE THINGS, TOO.
I SAW THESE MEN WITH
THESE BLACK CAPES ON.
I SAW THEM COMING
AT ME IN DROVES.
RuPaul: ONCE ON THE PLANE,
TAMMY TRIED TO DISEMBARK
AT 30,000 FEET.
Tammy: THEY TOOK ME
FROM THE HOSPITAL
DIRECTLY TO
THE BETTY FORD CENTER.
I THOUGHT I WAS BEING
PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING,
AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS BEING PUNISHED FOR.
IT STILL HURTS ME...
THAT THEY DID NOT
TELL ME THEY WERE
GONNA DO THAT TO ME.
SHE SPENT ONE NIGHT
THERE AND THEN LEFT.
ALL I NEEDED
WAS TO BE EDUCATED,
BECAUSE I'M
AN INTELLIGENT PERSON,
AND THAT'S ALL I NEEDED.
ONCE I WAS EDUCATED
AND REALIZED WHAT I WAS DOING,
I STOPPED IT
AND I HAVE NEVER, EVER
HAVE HAD TO--HAVE--HAVE,
UH...BEEN ADDICTED
TO ANYTHING AGAIN.
JUST DIET COKE.
BUT THE PRESIDENT
LIKES IT, TOO,
SO I'M
IN GOOD COMPANY.
[BLEEP]
Both: HEE HEE HEE HEE.
I WENT AWAY
FOR A WHILE,
AND I HAVE LEARNED
THE BEST LESSON
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.
I LEARNED HOW MUCH
I LOVED MY HUSBAND,
HOW MUCH I CARED
FOR MY HUSBAND.
AND I LEARNED
A LESSON OF LONELINESS
SUCH AS I'VE NEVER
FELT IN MY LIFE.
WHEN I HAD TO
GO OUT ALL OF A SUDDEN
AND GO BY MYSELF
AND DO MY WASHING
TO A PLACE WHERE
I DIDN'T EVEN--
WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH,
WHEN I HAD TO CARRY OUT MY
OWN GARBAGE,
WHEN I HAD TO DO
ALL THE THINGS
THAT I DID WITH
SOMEONE I LOVED BEFORE,
WHEN I HAD TO
DO IT ALL BY MYSELF,
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I REALIZED
THAT THERE WAS
A LOT MORE TO MARRIAGE
THAN JUST THE SPARKLES.
RuPaul: JIM AND TAMMY
DECIDED TO STAY IN THEIR
HOME IN PALM SPRINGS
AND PUT THEIR MARRIAGE
BACK TOGETHER,
BUT THINGS
TURNED OUT DIFFERENTLY.
THE THING I REMEMBER
MOST ABOUT THIS HOUSE,
I BELIEVE,
IS THE WIND.
WE USED TO GO UP
ON TOP OF THE ROOF
OF THE GARAGE
AND LISTEN TO
THE WIND BLOWING THROUGH
THE PALM TREES AT NIGHT.
AND THE MOON WOULD BE OUT.
IT WOULD BE SO BEAUTIFUL
HERE IN THE DESERT.
THIS IS THE HOUSE
WHERE OUR WHOLE LIVES
CAME TUMBLING DOWN ON US.
I WAS STILL VERY WEAK
AND VERY SICK
WHEN I FINISHED
THE BETTY FORD PROGRAM.
AND JIM WAS
REALLY BURNED OUT,
HAVING TO RAISE
$1 MILLION A WEEK
TO KEEP PTL ON THE AIR,
AND TO KEEP ALL
THE BILLS PAID.
Jim: IT WAS BEGINNING
TO CRUSH ME.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I WOULD LITERALLY
HAVE TO THINK TO WALK.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT I'D HAVE TO--
I WAS SO EXHAUSTED,
I'D HAVE TO, YOU KNOW--
USUALLY YOUR BODY WILL
JUST WALK BY ITSELF,
BUT I'M HAVING
TO PICK UP MY FEET
ON PURPOSE TO WALK.
AND SO JERRY FALWELL
KNEW JUST WHEN TO HIT.
RuPaul: ALTHOUGH JIM AND
TAMMY WERE THE MOST POPULAR
EVANGELISTS OF THEIR TIME,
SOUTHERN BAPTIST MINISTER
JERRY FALWELL WAS
THE MOST POWERFUL.
HE WAS THE FOUNDER
OF THE MORAL MAJORITY
AND PLAYED A KEY ROLE
IN REAGAN'S ELECTION.
HE PREACHED A RETURN
TO FAMILY VALUES
AND SINGLED OUT
THE PRO-ABORTION AND
GAY MOVEMENTS FOR ATTACK.
FALWELL'S EMPIRE
INCLUDED A SUCCESSFUL
TELEVISION MINISTRY
AND A UNIVERSITY,
BUT IT DID NOT
INCLUDE A SATELLITE.
HE CALLS JIM UP
AND HE SAYS,
"JIM, I HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING OUT THAT
I AM GOING TO--
"THAT IS GOING TO BE
LEAKED TO THE NEWSPAPERS
"IF YOU DON'T
ALLOW ME TO HELP YOU."
HE SAYS, "LET ME FLY OUT
TO CALIFORNIA,
AND I WANT TO HELP YOU
AND TAMMY THROUGH THIS."
AND THEN HE BROUGHT UP
THE NAME JESSICA HAHN.
THIS IS WHERE
I HEARD JIM TELL ME
THAT HE HAD HAD
A ONE-NIGHT STAND
WITH A YOUNG LADY
BY THE NAME OF JESSICA HAHN.
EVEN THOUGH IT HAD
HAPPENED 9 YEARS BEFORE,
TO ME, IT WAS LIKE
IT HAD HAPPENED YESTERDAY.
I LAID ON THE FLOOR
AND I CRIED FOR 3 DAYS.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT
HAD HAPPENED TO MY LIFE.
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO SOLVE IT.
RuPaul: TAMMY WROTE
TO JESSICA HAHN,
ASKING TO MEET WITH HER.
SHE DECLINED.
SHE DID, HOWEVER,
TELL HER SIDE OF THE STORY
IN A 1993 PLAYBOY VIDEO.
I WOULD REALLY
LIKE PEOPLE TO KNOW
THERE ARE SIDES
OF MY PERSONALITY
THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN.
I WOULD JUST LIKE PEOPLE
TO KNOW THE REAL ME.
Tammy: JERRY FALWELL
FLEW HIS PRIVATE JET OUT.
HE SAID--HE PUT
HIS ARMS AROUND ME--
"I WANT TO HELP YOU."
AND WITH THAT, HE SAID,
"IF YOU WILL GIVE PTL
TO ME FOR 6 WEEKS,"
HE SAID, "WHILE
THIS STORY BREAKS,
WHICH IS BOUND TO BREAK,"
HE SAID,
"WE WILL BE THE CATALYST,
"AND IN 6 WEEKS,
YOU WILL HAVE
YOUR MINISTRY BACK,
AND IT WILL BE LIKE
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED."
AN ATTACK ON
ONE DENOMINATION
IS AN ATTACK ON ALL.
WE MUST SHARE
THE BREAD OF ADVERSITY
AND THE WATER
OF AFFLICTION.
JIM SWALLOWED IT
HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER.
BUT I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG SOMEWHERE,
AND I BEGGED HIM--
I BEGGED HIM
NOT TO GIVE UP HIS PLACE
ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
I TOLD HIM,
"GO BACK AND TALK TO
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
"GO BACK AND
TALK TO YOUR PEOPLE
BEFORE YOU DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS."
AND JIM SAID, "NO.
"DADDY FALWELL'S HERE.
HE'LL TAKE CARE
OF EVERYTHING."
BY EARLY 1987,
I HAD COLLECTED
THE INFORMATION
I NEEDED TO PUBLISH
A STORY ABOUT JESSICA HAHN
AND ABOUT THAT PAYOFF.
ON MARCH 19, 1987,
IN AN INTERVIEW
WITH US ABOUT THE STORY,
INSTEAD OF AN INTERVIEW,
WE HEARD A RESIGNATION
SPEECH OVER THE TELEPHONE.
JIM WAS IN CALIFORNIA.
HE READ THIS RESIGNATION.
HE GOT OFF THE PHONE
AND IMMEDIATELY
A MAN NAMED
JERRY FALWELL COMES ON,
WHICH IS A SHOCK TO ALL
OF US AT THE NEWSPAPER.
AND FALWELL HAS
BEEN GIVEN BY JIM
THE MANTLE OF RUNNING PTL.
HOW CAN WE SAY THANK YOU
FOR YOU GENTLEMEN
WHO HAVE STOOD
BY JIM AND TAMMY'S SIDE,
AND ALL OF OUR SIDE?
IF OUR ARMS
WERE BIG ENOUGH,
WE'D JUST WRAP THEM
ALL AROUND ALL OF YOU.
WE REALLY WOULD.
Charles: THAT STORY
EXPLODED.
IT WAS THE STORY
FOR NEWSPAPERS
AND TELEVISION
AROUND THE COUNTRY.
ARE YOU PLANNING
ON COMING BACK?
I REMEMBER
GOING TO PTL
AND GOING INTO
THIS NEWS CONFERENCE
THAT FALWELL HELD
AT THE HOTEL,
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
FEELING SOME BLUSH OF PRIDE
AT WHAT MY GOOD REPORTING
HAD CREATED HERE.
Tammy: O.J. SIMPSON
WAS NOTHING
COMPARED TO WHAT
WE HAD AROUND US.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
WE JUST WANTED
TO SAY HELLO,
AND THANK ALL
YOU CAMERAMEN
AND ALL YOU
PRESS PEOPLE.
I HATE IT
YOU HAD TO STAND OUT
IN THIS HOT SUN
IN THIS DESERT.
THEY WERE 4,
5 DEEP FOR THE WHOLE BLOCK,
DOWN ALL AROUND OUR HOUSE.
THERE WAS NO PLACE
FOR US TO HIDE AT ALL.
REMEMBER, I WAS
11 YEARS OLD WHEN
THIS WAS HAPPENING,
BUT I COULD TELL
SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG.
SHARE WITH US.
HOW'S JAMIE CHARLES
AND TAMMY SUE DOING?
WE'RE CONCERNED.
I WISH YOU'D
STARTED SOMEWHERE ELSE.
[CRYING]
ONE OF THE LAST THING
JAMIE CHARLES SAID IS,
"WILL I GET A CHANCE
TO GO HOME AND GET MY TOYS?"
Man: AW, BLESS HIM.
AND SUSIE'S DOING WELL.
I RAN AWAY
FROM HOME.
WHAT WOULD
ANY TEENAGER DO?
RUN AWAY.
THAT'S THE ANSWER.
YOU KNOW.
AND THAT'S WHAT I DID.
RuPaul: ON JUNE 11, 1987,
JIM AND TAMMY
WENT ON THE AIR
TO ADDRESS THE PTL AUDIENCE
FOR WHAT WOULD BE
THE LAST TIME.
TAMMY AND I ARE
SO VERY GLAD
THAT WE'VE
BEEN GRANTED
THIS OPPORTUNITY
TO TALK
WITH YOU TODAY.
AND SAY HELLO.
YES. HELLO, EVERYONE.
AND WE WANT
TO SAY TO YOU
THAT WE ARE SO
VERY, VERY SORRY.
I BELIEVE, TAMMY,
'CAUSE THE GOD I
SERVE IS STILL GOD,
I BELIEVE THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN.
OH, I DO, TOO, JIM.
YOU WANT TO SING IT?
I'LL DO IT.
CAN YOU DO IT?
ALL RIGHT,
TAMMY FAYE IS GONNA
SING A SONG FOR YOU
JUST BEFORE
WE LEAVE OUR HOUSE.
MAYBE YOU'RE HURTING
AND YOU NEED THIS
SONG TODAY, TOO,
SO, I'LL SING IT
FOR BOTH OF US, OK?
♪ OH, THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN ♪
♪ THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN ♪
♪ OH, THE SUN
WILL SHINE AGAIN ♪
WE CAME IN HERE FIRST
BECAUSE WE FELT
JIM BAKKER WANTED US HERE.
♪ A NEW DAY
WILL BREAK ♪
WE NOW FEEL
A HIGHER CALLING.
WE FEEL THAT GOD
WANTS US HERE,
AT LEAST FOR
THE TIME BEING.
JERRY FALWELL CAME IN
TO RESCUE THE NETWORK,
BUT, IN FACT, TOOK IT.
RESCUE, TAKE,
THEY'RE OPPOSITES.
I FEEL LIKE GOD HAS
FORGIVEN ME OF SO MUCH,
THAT I WILL
FORGIVE EVERYONE
WHO HAS HURT US.
AND SO WE JUST
WANT EVERYONE
TO BEGIN TO
LOVE ONE ANOTHER,
AND THAT THE CHURCH WORLD
WILL LOVE ONE ANOTHER,
THAT THE PEOPLE OF GOD
WILL NOT FIGHT.
OH, I BELIEVE YOUR
MIDNIGHT'S ALMOST OVER.
AND THANK GOD,
THE SUN IS GOING
TO SHINE AGAIN.
PRAISE THE LORD.
[APPLAUSE]
Man: HALLELUJAH!
PRAISE THE LORD!
Roe: JERRY FALWELL
CALLED ME UP,
AND HE SAID, "ROE,
I WANT YOU TO GO OUT
AND SEE
JIM AND TAMMY FOR ME."
HE SAID, "I WANT YOU
TO GO OUT THERE
"AND TELL THEM
I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM
"300,000 SALARY
THIS YEAR.
"I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF
THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE,
"PAY THE PHONE BILL,
"I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM
ONE SECURITY GUARD,
A MAID," HE SAID,
AND YOU KNOW, JUST HAVE
THEM WRITE IT DOWN
ON A PIECE OF PAPER."
ROE, THINKING
THAT FALWELL WAS
AN HONORABLE MAN,
CAME OUT TO OUR
HOUSE AND TOLD US THIS.
AND SO HE SAID,
"TAMMY, YOU NEED TO
JUST GET A PIECE OF PAPER
"AND YOU NEED TO WRITE
DOWN THE LIST OF BENEFITS
"THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
VOTED FOR YOU TO HAVE,
AND MR. FALWELL WANTS
TO CONTINUE THOSE FOR A YEAR."
AND I GAVE JERRY,
I GAVE HIM THIS--
THIS THING
WITH TAMMY'S
PINK STATIONARY.
HE GOES TO THE CAMERA
RIGHT THEN.
WE WERE IN OUR HOME
AND CNN WAS ON,
AND, OF COURSE,
WE WERE WATCHING IT.
JIM AND TAMMY GAVE ME
THIS LIST OF THINGS
THEY'D LIKE TO RECEIVE.
JIM'S SALARY,
FOR A LIFETIME,
AT $300,000 PER YEAR.
TAMMY'S SALARY,
FOR A LIFETIME,
SECRETARY FOR ONE YEAR...
PHONE BILL..2 CARS...
HOUSE ON THE LAKE...
SECURITY...
AND THE FURNITURE.
THEY WANT A MAID.
I DON'T SEE
ANY REPENTANCE THERE.
I SEE THE GREED.
I SEE
THE SELF-CENTEREDNESS.
I SEE THE AVARICE
THAT BROUGHT THEM DOWN.
AND FROM
THAT DAY ON,
HE STARTED--
HE STARTED HIS
ATTACK ON JIM.
THE HOMOSEXUALITY STUFF,
THE DARK HOLE WHERE
ALL THE MONEY'S GONE,
AND ALL THAT BALONEY
THAT HE CAME UP WITH.
I HAVE SAT ACROSS
THE TABLE FROM MEN
WHO HAVE TOLD ME OF THEIR--
OF YOUR HOMOSEXUAL ADVANCES.
AND SINCE THEN, OF COURSE,
I HAVE LEARNED OF THE
FISCAL IRREGULARITIES.
AND JIM, I MUST TELL YOU
THAT I WOULD BE DOING
A DISSERVICE TO GOD,
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
YOU AND CARE FOR YOU,
AND WILL PRAY FOR YOU,
I WOULD BE DOING
A DISSERVICE TO GOD
AND TO THE CHURCH AT LARGE
TO ALLOW YOU TO COME BACK
HERE NOW OR EVER.
JIM, A LOOK
OF PURE HORROR,
PURE TORTURE
PASSED OVER HIS FACE.
AND HE SAID,
"TAM, IT'S ALL OVER.
I'VE BEEN HAD."
Charles: MY SENSE OF
FALWELL AND OF HIS PEOPLE
AND HOW THEY OPERATED WAS
THEY HAD VERY SHARP KNIVES.
AND THE BAKKERS PROBABLY
WERE A LITTLE NAIVE.
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY
HAD EVER RUN INTO ANYONE
WHO WAS QUITE SO CUNNING.
THEY WERE MANIPULATIVE,
AND SCHEMING,
BUT HE WAS CUNNING,
AND I THINK CUNNING
TRUMPED SCHEMING THERE.
RuPaul: LESS THAN 3 MONTHS
AFTER FALWELL TOOK OVER,
PTL FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY.
THOUSANDS OF
PTL PARTNERS, DONORS,
AND CREDITORS
LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
Roe: THEY SOLD IT
FOR 25 CENTS
ON THE DOLLAR,
AND THERE JUST
WASN'T ANY MONEY
FOR THE CREDITORS.
I THINK MR. FALWELL
WANTED TO
DESTROY PTL,
IS WHAT I THINK.
I WOULD LOVE TO SIT
AND LOOK JERRY FALWELL
IN THE EYES
AND SAY, "JERRY,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GET IT RIGHT WITH GOD
AND SAY YOU'RE SORRY?"
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
MAKE IT RIGHT WITH ME,
BECAUSE I'M NOT IN CHARGE
OF WHETHER JERRY FALWELL'S
GOING TO HEAVEN OR HELL.
THAT'S NOT--I'M NOT
IN CHARGE OF THAT.
BUT I SAY HE HAD BETTER
MAKE IT RIGHT WITH GOD.
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
TO FACE JERRY,
BUT HE WON'T FACE ME.
I KNOW HE WON'T.
RuPaul: FALWELL NEVER
REPLIED TO TAMMY'S LETTER.
HE HAS, HOWEVER,
GONE ON RECORD
CALLING TAMMY A LOONY
WHOSE ELEVATOR NEVER
WENT TO THE TOP FLOOR.
FALWELL ALSO NEVER RESPONDED
TO THE PRODUCER'S REQUEST
FOR AN INTERVIEW.
ELSEWHERE, HOWEVER,
HE HAS DENIED THAT THE LIST
ON TAMMY'S LETTERHEAD
WAS CREATED
AT HIS SUGGESTION.
HE ALSO MAINTAINS
THAT BAKKER ASKED HIM
TO TAKE OVER THE PTL MINISTRY
AND WAS NEVER PROMISED
HE COULD RETURN.
RuPaul: IN 1989, JIM BAKKER
WENT ON TRIAL FOR FRAUD.
Reporter:
THE GOVERNMENT SAID BAKKER
DELIBERATELY SOLD
MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY
PARTNERSHIPS FOR LODGING
AS THERE
WERE ACCOMMODATIONS,
AND POCKETED
NEARLY $4 MILLION
TO KEEP HIM IN
EXPENSIVE HOMES AND CARS.
James Albert: THIS
WAS A FEDERAL TRIAL.
THERE WERE
NO CAMERAS ALLOWED
IN THE COURTROOM.
WE HAD TO RELY ON
THOSE PRINT JOURNALISTS,
AND PARTICULARLY
THE CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
REPORTERS.
THEN, OF COURSE,
REMEMBER, THE
CHARLOTTE OBSERVER
WON THE PULITZER PRIZE
FOR PUBLIC SERVICE
FOR TOPPLING JIM BAKKER
AND EXPOSING HIM
ONE FULL YEAR
BEFORE THIS JURY
EVER GOT A CHANCE
TO CONSIDER
ANY OF THIS EVIDENCE.
RuPaul: JAMES ALBERT
SPENT 5 YEARS STUDYING
THE PTL TRIAL,
AND WROTE A BOOK
THAT RAISED QUESTIONS
ABOUT HOW THE TRIAL
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.
WHEN THE DEFENSE
PLAYED A PTL VIDEO
FOR THE JURY TO SEE,
JUDGE POTTER ACTUALLY
STUCK HIS INDEX FINGERS
IN HIS EARS
AND TURNED AWAY.
HE HAS SAID IN
THE COURT MANY TIMES,
"I MAY NOT BE
RULING THIS CORRECTLY,
BUT YOU CAN TAKE IT UP
ON YOUR APPEAL."
AND I FEEL THAT
ANY JUDGE WHO THINKS
THAT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO APPEAL
HAS ALREADY
MADE UP HIS MIND
THAT WE'RE GUILTY.
THE JUDGE REFUSED
TO ALLOW THE JURORS
TO BOARD A BUS AND TRAVEL
15 MINUTES TO HERITAGE U.S.A.,
TO SEE WHAT
JIM BAKKER HAD BUILT
WITH ALL THE MONEY
THAT HE RAISED.
IT WAS A TRIAL
NOT ABOUT FRAUD
OR CRIMINAL CONDUCT.
IT WAS A TRIAL
ABOUT LIFESTYLE AND WEALTH.
Reporter: PTL's
NEW MANAGEMENT
ACT CONTINUALLY AMAZED
AT THE OPULENCE
UNDER WHICH JIM
AND TAMMY BAKKER LIVED.
IN FACT, A TRIP THROUGH
THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE
AT THE HERITAGE
GRAND HOTEL
SHOWS THE BAKKERS LIVED,
ONE COULD EASILY DEDUCE,
QUITE LUXURIOUSLY.
THEY LIVED WELL,
BUT THEY LIVED
NO BETTER THAN
PAT ROBERTSON,
NO BETTER THAN
JERRY FALWELL,
NO BETTER THAN
JIM DOBSON,
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN
IN THEIR HOMES, TOO.
BUT LOOK,
I THINK THE FACT IS
THE BAKKERS HAD BEEN,
FROM PRETTY MUCH
EVERYBODY'S POINT OF VIEW,
PRETTY GREEDY.
IT'S LUDICROUS TO ARGUE
THAT JIM BAKKER
RAISED $158 MILLION
FROM HIS
TELEVISION VIEWERS
TO KEEP $3 MILLION
FOR HIMSELF.
RuPaul: AFTER A 6-WEEK TRIAL,
JIM BAKKER WAS SENTENCED TO
45 YEARS IN FEDERAL PRISON.
I CAN'T IMAGINE HIM
BEING TAKEN INTO CUSTODY,
BUT THAT'S VERY MUCH
IN THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION,
AND THE JUDGE
HAS PROVEN HIMSELF
HARD TO PREDICT.
WITH TODAY'S VERDICT,
REALITY HAS FINALLY
DAWNED FOR JIM BAKKER.
TODAY WAS CERTAINLY AN EXAMPLE
OF GOD'S AMAZING GRACE.
THEY DID HIM LIKE
THEY DONE JESUS,
WITH LEADING HIM
LIKE HE'S A BIG
DRUG PUSHER,
A BIG ROBBER
OR SOMETHING.
THEY HAD
HANDCUFFS ON HIM,
LEADING HIM,
AND HE IS
THE MAN OF GOD.
I HAVE A SONG FOR YOU.

RuPaul: THIS
IS THE LAST TIME
TAMMY FAYE WOULD SING
IN PUBLIC FOR QUITE SOME TIME.
MEANWHILE CHARLES SHEPARD
WROTE A BOOK CALLED FORGIVEN,
A SEARING ACCOUNT
OF THE SCANDAL.
[TYPING]
SHEPARD WAS ASKED IF HE
WOULD MET WITH TAMMY FAYE.
HE AGREED.
SO 12 YEARS
AFTER THE VERDICT,
TAMMY CONFRONTED CHARLES
FOR THE FIRST TIME.
I WAS THEIR, CHARLIE.
I KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.
I KNOW JIM BAKKER
IS NOT A CROOK.
I KNOW THAT AFTER
25 YEARS IN FRONT OF
THE TELEVISION CAMERAS,
WE DID NOT STEAL MONEY
AND YOU AND I--
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY,
"YOU STOLE MONEY."
I DON'T FEEL I WROTE THINGS
THAT WERE UNTRUE.
HMM.
CERTAINLY NOT KNOWING
THEY WERE,
AND EVEN NOW, I DON'T KNOW
OF ANYTHING I WROTE
THAT WAS UNTRUE.
MM-HMM.
DID YOU WRITE THAT
MILLIONS WERE MISSING?
I DON'T EVER REMEMBER
WRITING THAT.
YOU SAID--WHAT YOU SAID
WAS A BIG, DEEP HOLE...
MILLIONS MISSING.
W-WHY?
ALL I WANT TO KNOW
IS JUST WHY?
WHICH QUESTION
SHOULD I ANSWER FIRST?
ON ALL OF THEM!
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND,
WHAT DID WE DO?
FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T--
I'M NOT HERE TO SAY--
A JUDGE AND JURY.
BECAUSE, LISTEN.
I COULD TURN AROUND
AND--AND--AND--AND
PUT PTL DOWN
IF I WANT TO,
JUST LIKE THE NEWS DID,
BUT I WAS THERE
AND I LIVED IT
AND ONE THING I KNOW
ABOUT JIM BAKKER--
HE WAS AN HONEST MAN.
AND ONE THING I KNOW
ABOUT THE PTL ORGANIZATION,
IT WAS AN HONEST,
TRUTHFUL ORGANIZATION.
RuPaul: TAMMY
WANTED AN APOLOGY.
CHARLES WANTED AN AUTOGRAPH.
OH, YEAH. I--I--I...
I BROUGHT SOME COPIES
OF MY BOOK.
HEY, GREAT.
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU,
BUT I WANTED TO GET YOU
TO AUTOGRAPH SOME...
I WILL.
MY SCHOOL HAS GOT
AN AUCTION
FOR THE GRADUATE WOMEN
IN BUSINESS GROUP.
OH, SURE.
I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE A KICK
IF I GIVE THEM THAT
TO AUCTION OFF.
OK. ALL RIGHT.
DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
GOING TO A SIGNING,
DID YOU, TAMMY?
NO, I DIDN'T.
Man: TAMMY, WHAT
DID YOU WRITE?
HA HA HA!
BUT, HEY, CHARLES,
YOU'RE FORGIVEN.
HA HA HA!

WELL, I WANT TO SAY

STRONG IN THE LORD.
I STILL FEEL THERE'S
NOTHING TOO HARD FOR GOD,
AND I'M STANDING ON CHRIST,
A SOLID ROCK.
RuPaul: WITH A HUSBAND
IN PRISON,
A RUNAWAY DAUGHTER,
AND A TROUBLED SON,
TAMMY STRUGGLED
TO MAKE IT ON HER OWN.
BUT IN 1992, JIM AND TAMMY'S
DREAM ENDED...IN DIVORCE.
I WAS TOTALLY ALONE
AND HAD NOTHING, NO ONE.
EVERYONE HAD TURNED
THEIR BACK AGAINST ME
ONE MORE TIME,
AND I FELT LIKE
A WOMAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY.
IT'S SO OFTEN TRUE
THAT CHRISTIANS ARE
ONE ARMY THAT KILLS
THEIR WOUNDED.
HA HA. WE DON'T--
WE DON'T TRY TO NURSE THEM
BACK TO HEALTH.
AND I DON'T KNOW
OF ANY WOMAN IN OUR TIME
WHO HAS BEEN SO RIDICULED,
PUT DOWN, MALIGNED.
REALLY, I EQUATE HER
WITH HILLARY CLINTON...
BECAUSE THESE 2 WOMEN
HAVE BOTH SUFFERED
TREMENDOUSLY

RuPaul: 18 MONTHS
AFTER HER DIVORCE,
TAMMY SCANDALIZED
THE CHURCH AND THE MEDIA
WHEN SHE REMARRIED.
HER NEW HUSBAND WAS THE MAN
WHO PAID OFF JESSICA HAHN,
THE MAN WHO BUILT
HERITAGE U.S.A.,
AND THE MAN WHO JIM BAKKER
CALLED HIS BEST FRIEND...
ROE MESSNER.
Roe: EVERYBODY
LIKES TO SAY THAT
WAS PLANNED, YOU KNOW,
AND THAT ROE AND TAMMY
HAD THIS BIG DEAL GOING
WHILE HE WAS IN
CHARLOTTE BUILDING PTL.
NONE OF THAT'S TRUE.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I...
LIKED TAMMY, YOU KNOW?
AND WE STARTED
TALKING TOGETHER
A LITTLE BIT.
UM...
AND IT JUST
SORT OF HAPPENED
LIKE THAT, REALLY.
RuPaul:
DIVORCED AND REMARRIED,
TAMMY WAS REJECTED
BY CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING,
SO SHE TURNED
TO SECULAR TELEVISION,
COURTING EVEN MORE
CONTROVERSY
BY HOSTING A TALK SHOW
WITH AN OPENLY GAY COHOST.
Both: ♪ WE'RE NOT
WHAT YOU'D EXPECT ♪
♪ WE'RE A CRAZY,
KOOKY DUET ♪
♪ WE'RE A RECIPE
YOU COULDN'T BAKE UP ♪
♪ 3 TIMES THE LAUGHS ♪

I THINK GAY PEOPLE

TAMMY LIKES GAY PEOPLE.
AND SHE'S ONE

WHO SEEMS TO THESE DAYS.

OH, HI, EVERYONE!
THAT'S YOUR MAKE-UP KIT?
THAT'S MY MAKE-UP.
CHOCOLATE? OF COURSE,
SHE'S GOT CHOCOLATE,
POTATO CHIPS, A--
MY BRA?!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH MY BRA?
I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
OF HIM AS--AS--AS GAY.
I JUST THOUGHT OF HIM
AS ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
THAT I LOVED.
IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS THAT.
OH, MY GOD!
HONEY, HOW ARE YOU?!
I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.
I MISSED YOU, TOO!
Jim J.: SHE HAS BEEN JUDGED
BY OTHER PEOPLE
AND SHE KNOWS
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
SO ALTHOUGH TAMMY'S BELIEFS
ARE NOT IN FAVOR,
I DON'T THINK,
OF HOMOSEXUALITY,
SHE ALLOWED ME THE FREEDOM
TO BE WHO I AM
AND DIDN'T LET THAT
GET IN THE WAY
OF A FRIENDSHIP.
OH, YOU DECORATE
SO AWESOME.
AREN'T THESE FABULOUS?
THESE ARE AWESOME.
I'M GLAD YOU GOT
TO SAVE SOMETHING.
YOU WANT A DIET COKE?
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
RuPaul:
TAMMY HASN'T SEEN JIM J.
SINCE HE LOST HIS
LOVER TO AIDS
AND WAS HIMSELF
DIAGNOSED WITH HIV.
HOW ARE YOU DOING
WITHOUT JOHN?
ARE YOU DOING OK?
IT'S BEEN A LONG,
HARD ROAD, YOU KNOW, BUT--
I KNOW.
IT MUST BE VERY LONELY.
- I'M COMING AROUND.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.
- GOOD.
I'M A SURVIVOR LIKE YOU.
I LOVED JOHN. YOU KNOW,
I LOVED HIM SO MUCH.
I DON'T LABEL PEOPLE.
I REFUSE TO LABEL PEOPLE.
WE'RE ALL JUST PEOPLE
MADE OUT OF THE SAME OLD DIRT.
AND GOD DIDN'T MAKE
ANY JUNK.
RuPaul: BUT IN SPITE OF THEIR
ON-SCREEN CHEMISTRY,
THE SHOW WAS CANCELED.
AND BEFORE SHE COULD
RECOVER FROM THIS BLOW,
SHE WAS DEALT ANOTHER.
Tammy: I HAD BEEN
BLEEDING FOR A YEAR.
THE BLEEDING BECAME
MUCH WORSE.
AND SO MY GYNECOLOGIST SAID,
"TAMMY, I THINK YOU NEED
TO GO SEE A PROCTOLOGIST."
AND BY THAT TIME, OF COURSE,
IT WAS TOO LATE
AND THE CANCER HAD ALREADY
TAKEN PLACE IN MY BODY.
BEING WITH HER...
DURING...
UM, HER CANCER...
IN THE HOSPITAL,
SLEEPING ON THE BED
NEXT TO HER,
IN THE HOSPITAL...
THAT WAS...
I THINK THE CLOSEST--
CLOSEST...
I'VE EVER BEEN
TO MY MOTHER.
AND I WOULDN'T
TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING.
AND IT WAS WORTH
EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD
TO GO THROUGH CANCER
TO GET CLOSE TO MY
PRECIOUS DAUGHTER
AND TO BECOME HER FRIEND,
NOT JUST HER MOM.
RuPaul: BOUNCING BACK
ONE MORE TIME,
TAMMY MADE A DRAMATIC
RECOVERY.
John J.: THE ONE THING
YOU CAN SAY ABOUT TAMMY IS
SHE IS A SURVIVOR.
I MEAN, AFTER THE HOLOCAUST,
THERE WILL BE, LIKE,
ROACHES, TAMMY FAYE AND CHER.
RuPaul: INSPIRED
BY HER SUCCESSFUL
BATTLE WITH CANCER,
TAMMY RECORDED A SELF-HELP
VIDEOTAPE GUIDE
TO SURVIVING LIFE.
IF LIFE HANDS YOU A LEMON...
START MAKING LEMONADE.
BUT BEFORE THE TAPE
COULD BE RELEASED,
THE COMPANY WENT BANKRUPT.
THEN LIFE HANDED TAMMY
YET ANOTHER LEMON.
IN 1996, HER HUSBAND ROE
WAS SENTENCED
TO 2 YEARS IN PRISON
FOR BANKRUPTCY FRAUD.
WE'RE GOING TO A PLACE
CALLED BORON.
BORON IS ACTUALLY WHERE
THEY USED TO MAKE BORAX.
IT'S ABOUT 2 HOURS
AND 15 MINUTES FROM MY HOUSE,
GOING 75, 80 MILES AN HOUR.
WHOO! HA HA HA!
I LIKE TO GO FAST ENOUGH
AND SO YOU LOSE YOUR TUMMY
ON THESE BUMPS.
IF I HADN'T MARRIED TAMMY,
I WOULDN'T BE IN JAIL.
THAT'S TRUE.
THERE WAS MORE SAID
IN MY TRIAL ABOUT MR. BAKKER
THAN THERE WAS ABOUT ME.
YOU KNOW, ANYONE
CAN BE PUT IN PRISON.
IF THE GOVERNMENT DECIDES
THAT THEY DON'T LIKE YOU,
THEY CAN COME UP
WITH ANY REASON
TO PUT YOU IN PRISON
AND YOU CAN'T STOP IT.
Roe:
TAMMY HAS GONE THROUGH
A LOT OF HEARTACHE
IN HER LIFETIME.
AND PRISON IS HARDER
ON THE WIFE THAN IT IS
ON THE PRISONER.
I USED TO TELL MY MOTHER
MANY TIMES, "BUT, MOM,
THAT'S NOT FAIR,
THAT'S NOT FAIR,"
AND MY MOTHER TRAINED ME
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL
AND SHE SAID, "TAMMY, WHO
EVER SAID LIFE WAS FAIR?"
Roe: I PERSONALLY
DON'T LIKE VISITS,
BECAUSE VISITS
FOR ME ARE HARD.
IT'S HARD TO SAY
GOOD-BYE.
SO I'D RATHER NOT
HAVE A VISIT.
RuPaul: INSTEAD OF LANGUISHING
IN THE DESERT,
TAMMY DECIDED TO GET BACK
IN FRONT OF THE CAMERAS,
STARTING WITH AN APPEARANCE
ON THE ROSEANNE SHOW.
I WOULD MUCH RATHER PREFER
TO WORK IN SECULAR TELEVISION.
I THINK CHRISTIAN TELEVISION
IS VERY LIMITED IN WHAT
YOU CAN DO.
Man: SO I WANT TO DO
A QUICK RUN-THROUGH
ON THIS,
JUST SO YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE.
I'M COMFORTABLE.
YOU ARE?
TODAY ON THE ROSEANNE SHOW,
INFAMOUS TELEVANGELIST
TAMMY FAYE, OUTSPOKEN
ACTIVIST CHASTITY BONO,
AND ONE OF THE HOTTEST BANDS
AROUND--BLUES TRAVELERS--
IS HERE.
AND NOW HERE'S ROSEANNE!
THAT'S GREAT.
IT'S GOING TO BE
PANDEMONIUM OUT THERE,
BUT...
OK.
YOU'LL RESPOND TO THAT.
I'LL RESPOND TO THAT.
OK.
I THINK WHAT
THE SECULAR WORLD
DOES NOT REALIZE
IS THAT I AM
A VERY SECULAR PERSON.
UH, CHRIST IS JUST
A PART OF ME. UH...
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY
TALK ABOUT.
IT'S SOMETHING INSIDE ME,
AND IT JUST MAKES ME
WHO I AM.
[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
Tammy:
TODAY ON THE ROSEANNE SHOW,
TELEVANGELIST TAMMY FAYE,
OUTSPOKEN ACTIVIST
CHASTITY BONO,
AND ONE OF THE HOTTEST
BANDS AROUND--
BLUES TRAVELERS--IS HERE.
AND NOW HERE'S ROSEANNE!
NOW, YOU'RE MAKEUP
IS EXTREME.
YOU THINK IT IS?
IT'S VERY EXTREME.
I DON'T MEAN
TO DISRESPECT YOU.
I JUST WANT
TO KNOW YOU.
I THINK I FEEL UGLY
WITHOUT IT.
WELL, IF YOU THINK
YOU LOOK UGLY WITHOUT IT--
I DO.
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING--
THAT'S NOT A RIGHT WAY
TO THINK.
I KNOW, ROSEANNE.

BUT THAT'S
THE WRONG WAY TO FEEL.
HI, GREG.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
YOU'RE TALLER THAN I THOUGHT.
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE SHORTER
THAN I THOUGHT.
RuPaul: DECIDING IT WAS
TIME FOR NEW HEADSHOTS,
TAMMY TURNED TO PHOTOGRAPHER
GREG GORMAN.
HERE.
WHAT I THOUGHT
WE COULD DO
IS START, MAYBE,
SINCE YOU'RE
PROBABLY
NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH
MYSELF AS I AM WITH
YOU,
IS SIT DOWN, LET ME
SHOW YOU SOME OF
MY WORK,
AND LET'S TALK
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO TRY TO DO.
SOUNDS GOOD.
OH, YES!
MY FAVORITE LADY
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
SARAH, THE DUCHESS OF YORK.
I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
HOW WE'VE KIND OF
TAKEN HER OUT OF
THE REALM OF HOW
PEOPLE HAD SEEN HER
AND GIVEN HER
KIND OF A NEW LOOK.
MM-HMM.
WHAT WE DID IS BASICALLY...
MADE HER SOFT,
SOFTENED HER.
SOFTEN, SOFTENED HER.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
SO YOU'VE NEVER DONE PICTURES
WITHOUT THOSE EYELASHES?
NO, AND I NEVER WILL
BECAUSE THAT'S
MY TRADEMARK.
RIGHT.
AND IF I TAKE
MY TRADEMARK AWAY,
THEN IT'S NOT ME.
AND SO I HOLD
ONTO THAT, I THINK--
EVEN IF WE SOFTEN THEM
AND KEPT THEM--
NO, NO. THEY STAY
JUST WHERE THEY ARE.
OK.
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING ELSE,
BUT MY EYELASHES WILL
STAY WHERE THEY ARE.
YOU GOT IT.

TAMMY WENT TO USA NETWORKS
TO PITCH HER IDEAS

OK. WELL, NO, I--
I'VE GOT 3 IDEAS, STEVEN,
AND THEN I WOULD LIKE

BUT ONE OF MY IDEAS
IS A CHILDREN'S SHOW,
WHERE WE TALK TO PUPPETS
AND WE TALK TO THE KIDS,
AND THEN KIDS
TALKING TO PUPPETS
ABOUT THEIR PROBLEMS
AND THEIR CONCERNS
AND THINGS WHICH BOTHER THEM.
IT WOULD BE A FUN SHOW

IT'S A WAY TO GO.
I'M NOT SURE IT'S--
BUT WHAT ABOUT PUPPETS AND...
EVERYBODY LOVES PUPPETS.
EVEN ADULTS...
SURE.
LOVE PUPPETS.
UH-HUH.
I HAVE ANOTHER ONE.
TEENAGERS NEED SOMETHING
REALLY SPECIAL.
THEY NEED A FORMAT
FOR A LOT OF THINGS.
AND THEY HAVE NO WAY--
THE BIGGEST THING
THEY ALWAYS SAY,
"WELL, HOW DO WE GET
ANYONE TO LISTEN TO US?"
AND I WOULD JUST LOVE
TO GIVE THEM THAT CHANCE.
AND GO WHERE THEY GO.

I'D LIKE TO GO TO

The Los Angeles Times once said...
... that never in the history of Hollywood has
such glamour and talent sat under one tree.
Dr. Kissinger is here and
there's no accident.
There's more oil on Bob Evans...
Take him home. Take him home!
Just get him the hell out of here!
These past 10 years as chief of
production at Paramount Pictures...
... I've been lucky, or fortunate enough to
be involved with such unique pictures...
... as Rosemary's Baby, True Grit,
Love Story, The Godfather...
How did you get discovered
for the movies?
Well, I got discovered by jumping
into a swimming pool.
But I was an actor for many years
as a kid before that.
I was at the Beverly Hills Hotel pool.
I was a businessman at the time.
- What was your business?
- I was partners in Evan Picone.
We made women's pants.
In other words, I was in women's pants.
We actually started the fad
of women wearing slacks.
I'll never forget it, because...
It was the fall of 1956.
I flew out to Los Angeles to set up Evan Picone boutiques.
One afternoon, I decided to play hooky...
...sit by the pool and get some sun at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
Suddenly a woman approached. "Excuse me, young man, are you an actor?"
Yeah, I was, a long time ago.
It was Norma Shearer.
Norma Shearer, at the time, was one of the few remaining icons...
...of Hollywood aristocracy.
A petite blond in a striped, short robe.
"Pardon me for being curious, young man, but why are you always on the phone?"
Gotta pay my bills.
"You're not a bookmaker, are you?"
No, I'm not a bookmaker.
Then she changed the entire course of my life.
"Would you like to play my deceased husband, Irving Thalberg, in a film?"
I looked at her. Looked at her again. I didn't know what she was talking about.
"They're making a film at Universal called Man of a Thousand Faces.
My friend Jimmy Cagney is playing Lon Chaney.
Irving discovered him and made him the biggest star in silent film.
He was only 20 at the time. He was even too young to sign the checks.
But not too young to run a studio."
I'm thinking to myself, wow, this can't be happening to me.
Miss Shearer, it would be an honor. Why not?
Cagney is the one guy
I've always wanted to meet.
Two hours later, I'm on a sound stage at Universal.
Here I am, like out of a dream,
I'm testing opposite Jimmy Cagney.
Mind if I come in a minute?
I know I don't look dressed for the barricades, but I've come from a revolution.
The premiere of The Jazz Singer. Lon, you should've seen that audience.
When Jolson's voice came from the screen...
...I could hear the bells tolling for silent pictures.
You haven't heard a word I said.
- I'm sorry, Irving. What were you saying?
- Nothing much.
Just trying to tell you about a modern miracle.
Pictures that not only move,
Lon, but they speak.
Oh, yeah, sure. Talking pictures.
It's the horse and the automobile all over again. No use fighting it.
When it was over, Cagney gave me a quick look, "You did good, kid."
Forty-eight hours later, I made every newspaper around the country.
"Big splash: New York businessman dives into pool and comes out movie star."
Was I lucky? I think so.
If I had stayed just an actor, Norma never would've given me a second look.
What caught her eye was a young go-getter, sure about himself. Persuasive.
A subliminal reminder of the man who was once her mentor and her husband.
It's the old story, though.
Luck doesn't happen by mistake.
Rather, luck is when opportunity meets preparation.
As soon as the picture wrapped,
I flew back to the Big Apple.
Evan Picone was on fire...
...the showroom packed with them leggy ladies prancing in their patrician pants.
It was turn-on plus. My brother Charles had built the top fashion company of its time.
Me? I was lucky to be part of it...
...never having a second thought about returning to La La Land.
Why should I?
In New York, I was a celebrity.
From debutante, to starlet, to model.
There I was on their most-wanted list.
Was I enjoying it? You bet your ass I was.
One night, my brother and I took a few femme fatales to El Morocco.
Me? I didn't feel like conversation, so I hit the dance floor.
Well, that night someone had eyes for me, and it wasn't her.
It was Darryl Zanuck, head honcho of 20th Century Fox.
He had no idea who I was.
But just looking at me, he thought:
That kid's right to play the matador opposite Ava Gardner.
After years and years of knocking on doors, being turned down...
...here I am, discovered to star in two pictures within six months.
That's what you call incident, and that's what's also known as sense of discovery.
Thank God, I was the one discovered.
I was sent down to Mexico to study to be a bullfighter.
Mind you, I have never once seen a bull in my life.
I worked my ass off for three months.
Wearing a rubber girdle each day, so I'd lose weight around my midsection.
There was one big problem.
No one wanted me in the picture.
Ernest Hemingway was furious they'd pick a guy out of a nightclub...
...to play Pedro Romero, who in the true-life story was him.
A telegram goes out to
Darryl Zanuck. It reads:
"With Robert Evans playing Pedro Romero,
The Sun Also Rises will be a disaster.
Signed, Ernest Hemingway,
Tyrone Power...
...Ava Gardner, Eddie Albert."
The only one who refused to sign it was Errol Flynn. He laughed.
I know I'm gonna get fired.
But that gave me the resolve.
I said, fuck them. And, you know, when I knew that telegram went out...
...I became Pedro Romero in one week.
Zanuck arrives in Morelia, Mexico, and I'm summoned to the bullring...
...to do my quites and veronicas in front of him.
I walk into the bullring, take off my hat, throw it to him. For you.
And then I start going through my various things.
I feel like an idiot.
I know I'm gonna get fired.
Suddenly, Zanuck stands up, all
5'3" of him, picks up a bullhorn:
"The kid stays in the picture. And anybody who doesn't like it can quit."
Puts the bullhorn down, and walks out.
Also, it was then that I realized that's what Evans wants to be.
Not some actor shitting in his pants, waiting to get a role.
But the guy who can say,
"The kid stays in the picture."
Bob Evans is a 28-year-old New Yorker who is in the enviable position...
...of pursuing two careers on two coasts.
Here in the East, Bob Evans devotes his time and energy...
...to being a vice president of the
Evan Picone sportswear firm.
On the West Coast, Bob Evans devotes his time and energy to being a movie star.
And, at last reports, he's doing pretty well at both.
- Evening, Bob.
- Good evening, Ed.
- How are you?
- Very fine.
Now you're getting established and recognized as a movie star...
...how long do you think you'll hold out as a bachelor?
Just introduce me to the right girl, Ed, and I can end my bachelorhood right here.
With all the hullabaloo and excitement about the new Valentino...
...I wasn't getting the parts I wanted. There were half a dozen parts offered to me.
I was looking for bigger things.
One day, my agent calls,
George Chasen.
"Bob, I'm calling with good news. Fox is remaking Kiss of Death into a Western...
...and we've got you up for the Widmark part. It made him a star overnight."
Finally, I got my first title role.
- Wow!
- He's a kooky killer.
The most diabolical horror
that ever roamed the earth.
The Fiend Who Walked the West.
He'll cut out your heart or break your
neck, and laugh while he's doing it.
My acting career was over and out.
It was my last appearance on the silver screen.
At decade's end, I was sure of one thing.
I was a half-assed actor, and I knew it.
I knew I'd never become the next
Paul Newman...
...maybe the next Troy Donahue.
But do you know who I really wanted to become? The next Darryl Zanuck.
That was my goal for the '60s.
And I went for it all the way.
Sounds easy, doesn't it?
It ain't.
Next to winning the Olympics, I don't think there's a more difficult thing...
...than a pretty-boy actor transforming himself into producer...
...especially in those days.
I realized that I had to own something that nobody else could get.
I met a guy named George Weiser who worked for Publishers Weekly.
He moonlighted for me for about $ 150 a week.
He comes to me and says, "I just finished a book. It's called The Detective."
This is one hot book. I read it, put $5000 down on it as an option...
...and go see David Brown, a pal from 20th Century Fox...
...who's a top producer there. I say,
David, I think I have the next big book.
He reads it. In 48 hours, he says, "Bob, we're in business." David, not so quick.
I wanna know what kind of business we're in.
Now, these are my conditions.
I want a full spread of offices.
I want a three-picture deal.
To make a very long story short,
I get everything I ask for.
They would've bought me out for half a million.
But I wanted my foot in the door, and I got it in the door, but good.
I learned a lot from that. When you own the property, you're king.
Without it, you're a peon.
If the euphemism, "You live by the press, and die by the press"...
...ever fit anyone, it fit me.
Who would've thought a journalist would change the entire course of my life...
...and also my career?
On reflection, I don't know if
I should love him or hate him.
Peter Bart, West Coast correspondent for The New York Times...
...wanted to write a story about me in the Arts and Leisure section.
Is this a joke, Peter? Come on.
He said, "This is not a joke.
What's interesting about you, and why you're worth writing about...
...is you're beating these big shots at their own game.
You know, you could become the guy you played, the next Thalberg."
That's just what I want the audience to see, Mr. Chaney...
...the soul of a man that
God made different.
If I was smart, I should have retired after Peter's article.
Instead, Greg Bautzer, the power broker of the town, calls.
"Pack. You're going to New York."
I can't, Greg, I got plans.
"Break them. Charlie Bluhdorn bought
Paramount and wants to meet you.
He read the article about you in
Sunday's New York Times.
He's a doer, Bob. Not a talker.
Now pack your bags."
And pack them I did.
Within five minutes after meeting Charlie
Bluhdorn, I know this is no kibitzer.
Before I finished trying to answer one question, he was asking me more.
With him was a guy named Marty Davis.
He was responsible for the conglomerate Gulf and Western.
Buying this aging mountain they call Paramount.
There were eight major studios at the time.
Paramount? It was ninth.
Bluhdorn bought this giant at bargain basement prices, the only way he knew how.
Everybody thought he was nuts to get in a business he knew nothing about...
...much less a business as crazy as show business.
But, guys, I got a deal at 20th.
"Get out of it.
You'll be running Paramount in three months. Is that right, Marty?"
Davis gives me a look.
"If you're gonna run Paramount, you better be tougher than you seem."
Did I get the message? You bet.
Then Bluhdorn blasted my other ear:
"Go by the seat of your pants.
Make pictures people wanna see.
I wanna see tears, laughs. I want pretty girls in the pictures, beautiful girls.
Pictures people in Kansas City want to see.
That's all, Evans.
What else do we have to go over?"
Being the head of production of
a studio such as Paramount...
... and I'm sure you're aware of it,
involves a tremendous responsibility.
You are dealing with millions of dollars.
They had a lot of great names for me.
"Bluhdorn's Folly" by The New York Times.
Another was "Bluhdorn's Blow Job" by
Hollywood Close-up. Good feeling, huh?
There was, to put it mildly...
...a great deal of skepticism from people in the industry.
After all, where does an ex-actor, and a bad one at that, come off running a studio?
From the day I arrived, the rumor mill had me packing my bags.
Time magazine ran a story saying my firing was imminent.
Friends, columnists, agents, all let me know
I wouldn't be there for Christmas.
Then it happened. Front page of Variety:
"Evans tenure over by end of month."
I called Charles Bluhdorn, chairman of
Gulf and Western, who bought Paramount.
He was in Spain. I got him out of a board of directors' meeting in Madrid and said:
Charles, there's a story in Variety that
I'm gonna get fired. If it's true, tell me.
- Tell me if it's true.
- I'll pick up my laundry.
I'm ready to go. He says,
"Let me tell you something.
When you're getting fired, I'll let you know. Stop reading gossip.
As long as I own Paramount, you'll be where you are. Relax and do your job."
And he hung the phone up.
My first move was to hire Peter Bart as my right-hand man.
He's not Hollywood. He doesn't read synopses, he reads the entire text.
He can read six books over a weekend.
I'm hard-pressed to finish one in six.
But even more important, it was his article that got me into this mess.
The two of us caucused in Palm Springs for a full week.
Strategizing how an actor and a journalist could turn a white elephant into a contender.
Patience was not a quality Bluhdorn or
Davis had, and the clock was ticking.
With the little experience we had, we knew one thing: The property is the star.
Let's go back to basics, Peter.
You can have stars up the ass...
...but if it's not on the page, it's not on the screen.
It's no mistake Paramount's been in ninth place for five years.
It's time to pick up new dice.
Now let's try and do it.
Between Peter and myself, we went through dozens of scripts, maybe hundreds.
Nothing clicked. It all felt tired.
There was nothing fresh about it.
And we were looking for the unexpected.
Something that sounded new and what we were gonna be about.
Then one day, Bill Castle, the veteran producer...
...walked into my office with a manuscript he had optioned, tucked under his arm.
It was Rosemary's Baby. And I loved it.
There was one problem:
Castle insisted on directing it.
I only had one director in mind for it.
I saw brilliance in his little films.
It was the little Polack himself,
Roman Polanski.
Not a little Polack. The biggest Polack and one of the biggest men I've ever met.
The films I saw were Knife in the Water,
Repulsion, Cul-de-sac, all offbeat thrillers.
Roman was a big cinema star over in Europe, as well as director...
...and he'd just finished his first
Hollywood film. Get this title:
The Fearless Vampire Killers...
... or: Pardon Me, But Your
Teeth Are in My Neck.
Though no one wanted him in America, he didn't care. He was a star in Europe.
Where do I get him? How do
I get to him? He's an avid skier.
I lured him to America, thinking he was gonna direct Downhill Racer.
Polanski walks in.
This is some character!
Within five minutes, this Polack's acting out crazy stories.
They're somewhere between
Shakespeare and theater of the absurd.
Maybe that's why we clicked so well.
We both come out of the same school of drama, the drama of life.
I didn't wanna bullshit him.
Roman, will you read this?
I shoved the galleys of Rosemary's
Baby across the desk at him.
"Is this about skiing?"
Read it, Polack.
If you don't like it, your next ski trip is on me, anywhere you wanna go in the world.
A gamble? Sure.
It paid off. Roman loved it.
But then the fights began.
You know, fighting is healthy.
If everyone has too much reverence for each other, or the material...
Check it out and think about it.
Invariably, it turns out underwhelming.
By the end of the first week's shooting,
Roman was a week behind schedule.
Everyone from Bluhdorn to Bill Castle wanted me to throw him off the picture.
Roman's dailies were weird. They touched off an ominous sense of fright.
One I'd never seen in film before.
At the same time, Bill Castle was pressing the right buttons...
...getting the New York brass unnerved on our Polish discovery, my Polish discovery.
We're 10 days into shooting, and
Roman was five days behind schedule.
"Fire the Polack," were the words from New York. Fire him? Fuck you.
He goes, I go.
For a moment, I thought I'd have to pay my own plane fare back.
I grabbed Roman aside.
Listen to me carefully, Roman.
My ass ain't on the line.
My ass is out the door, and so are you.
Now pick up the fucking pace or we'll both end up in Warsaw.
Bluhdorn and company weren't the only ones screaming about Roman.
Another power entered the scene.
My secretary comes in with an urgent message:
"Frank Sinatra's on the horn. He must speak with you." I picked the phone up.
"I'm pulling Mia from your picture, Evans, if she ain't finished by November 14.
She's starting in my picture on the 17. Got it straight?"
His picture was The Detective, the project that launched my producing career.
Now it was about to sink it.
Frank, you don't understand. We're not gonna be finished till mid-February.
"Then she's quitting.
Don't fuck around with me.
We go back too far. She's my old lady, she'll do as I tell her."
Before I could say anything, he hangs the phone up.
Well, Frank didn't bark, he bit.
Bit Mia pretty good.
"Stay in Rosemary's Baby, you go back to Mia Farrow. Forget the name Sinatra!"
Suddenly this little girl hysterically runs into my office.
"I love him, Bob. I love him so.
I don't wanna lose Frank.
I'm gonna have to leave the movie."
Mia, if you walk out in the middle of this film, you'll never work again.
"I don't care, I don't care.
I just love Frank."
Well, if ever my experience with dames came in handy, I mean actress dames...
...this was the moment.
I knew what makes the head of an actress tick, and I finally found its purpose.
Come with me, Mia,
I wanna show you something.
We walked into the executive screening room...
...and I showed her a full hour of
Rosemary's Baby cut together.
Dr. Hill? Dr. Hill, there's a plot.
I know that sounds crazy, and you're thinking, "This poor girl has flipped."
But I haven't flipped, Dr. Hill.
I swear by all the saints, I haven't.
Mia, you're brilliant. I never thought you had it in you.
It'll shock them all.
I want you to know something. You're a shoo-in to win the Academy Award.
Suddenly her tears were gone.
Her face lights up.
"Do you think so?" The one thing I'm not is prone to exaggerate. You're a shoo-in.
I mean a shoo-in, kid. "Sinatra who?"
Suddenly, a smile.
She didn't walk off the film. But Frank did serve her divorce papers on the set...
...delivered by Mickey Rudin, his attorney.
Wow, it's strange. Women recover real quick. It may have taken her a full week.
Then the only thing she wanted was that
Rosemary's Baby out-gross The Detective.
You want to know about actresses?
Mia's one satisfaction would be that the pictures would open on the same day.
And I arranged that.
The Detective opened to a real good box office.
But Rosemary's Baby was the smash hit of the summer.
Overnight, Mia was a full-fledged star.
She had one request I couldn't fill:
Take a double-page ad out in the
Daily Variety and Hollywood Reporter.
On one side, in bold numbers, the theater grosses of Rosemary's Baby.
On the other, the theater grosses of The Detective.
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
A decade before, Norma Shearer took me for a short walk.
Within 10 minutes of the Beverly Hills
Hotel, we entered a hidden oasis.
It is a world away from Beverly Hills.
It is protected by 100-foot-tall eucalyptus trees.
Greta Garbo used to hide away there whenever she came into town.
I'd never forgotten the day I was there.
God, it must have been
100 times I thought:
One day, I could own that house.
God, I'd love to live there.
The grounds, the trees, the acreage, the towering eucalyptus...
...thousands of roses. Everything is quiet and secret behind walls.
Was it for sale? No. But in L.A., there's nothing that isn't.
For 290,000 buckaroos, the place of my dreams was now mine.
In the mid-to-late '60s, movie attendance was spiraling south.
Outside of Paramount, a cultural revolution was taking place.
The brass at the studios didn't know who to cater movies to.
The old guard who wanted to see their aging movie stars in lavish productions...
...or the youth, who no one seemed to understand.
In the same year alone,
Paramount released Medium Cool...
...a film catering to the so-called youth market.
And Paint Your Wagon, a film that catered to no one.
We were losing money every year on big, extravagant productions.
The board of directors were nervous.
We needed a picture to unite audiences.
Like all good films, it needed to start with a script.
Well, we found it. Or should I say,
Miss MacGraw found it.
A simple little film about a boy and a girl falling in love.
It was Love Story.
I set up a lunch date with Love Story's mentor and star, Miss MacGraw.
Damn it, by the time dessert was served,
I would've made the phone book with her.
Do you think she got to me? I can tell you this, I sure in hell didn't get to her.
She kept on digging into me.
Oh, and she was loving it.
She keeps on interjecting, all during the lunch, how much in love she was.
Then she gives me her last zinger.
"Peter and I are getting married in the fall.
We plan to spend October in Venice.
Ever been there?" Nope.
"Then wait. Only go there when you're madly in love."
That was it for me. I grabbed her arm.
Never plan, kid. Planning's for the poor.
If anything goes wrong between you and
Blondie between now and post time...
...take my number.
I'm seven digits away.
Hate to admit it, but she never called.
In the spring of 1969, holding Love
Story sure as hell wasn't holding aces.
I couldn't even find a fucking director to do it.
You know what my batting average was?
A thousand. Everyone turned it down.
Suddenly, a minor miracle.
I get a director. Arthur Hiller.
He's willing to direct my angel with a very dirty face.
Well, when you get a first bite, there's no way you're gonna let it go.
It was Wednesday night. Suddenly, Miss
Snotnose remembers my seven digits.
This was one angry broad.
I say angry with a capital A.
"The audacity you have, Mr. Evans, to sign a director I've never heard of...
...without consulting me. It's my property.
I'm doing the picture for slave wages.
I'm living up to my option agreement.
Have you forgotten the word 'courtesy'?"
I thought I was hyperventilating.
Ali, why don't you come out to L.A.
Tomorrow? Take a look at Hiller's film.
If you don't like it, we'll get someone else. Trust me. I think you'll enjoy it.
The next night at 5, I pick up Snotnose
MacGraw in the Beverly Hills Hotel.
Did it bug me? You bet, needing this starlet's nod of approval.
I hoped she wouldn't like Hiller so I could tell her she was a one-way ticket east.
That her flick's over and out. Cancelled.
At least I'd get my nuts off.
I'm saying to myself, Miss Charming ain't gonna get to me tonight.
I walked her through my front doors, out and around my pool...
...towards my projection room. What I was thinking didn't work the way I thought.
She looks up to me, with her crooked tooth and all, and says:
"I feel like I'm walking through my own private park in Paris."
Prepared for her bullshit, it hardly made a ripple.
Arthur Hiller's audition was ready to roll.
It never did. The screen never came down.
Yeah, but Miss Flower Child Snotnose soon got wet, very wet...
...jumping into the egg-shaped pool totally clothed, from her shoes to her headband.
Me? I'm laughing on the inside, but thinking, for a bohemian...
...she sure as hell became comfortable very quickly.
Behind the so-called Beverly Hills gates, with 2000 rose bushes...
...surrounded by gardenias, daisies, you name it.
She called herself a flower child.
And now the flowers were hers.
October 24th, 1969, a Friday morning.
Miss Snotnose is on her way to becoming Mrs. Evans.
Both of us climb into our Mercedes two-seater...
...and head for the town hall in Riverside.
Afterward, we uncorked one magnum of Dom after the other.
Where? On the courthouse lawn.
And did we get loaded!
We had a long two-day honeymoon in Palm Springs.
I held Ali tight in my arms.
"I love you, Evans. I love you.
Forever, Evans. Forever."
I whispered back, forever, darling.
"And promise me, never leave me."
I promise you, baby, I won't.
Not even for two weeks.
Not for one, kid.
"I'm a hot lady, Evans."
I hugged her, I kissed her.
Never change, baby. Never change.
"And never let anything get between us,
Evans. Promise?"
Promise.
I forgot my key.
Jenny, I'm sorry.
Don't.
Love means never having to say you're sorry.
"Cut!" says Hiller.
"That's it. We've got it."
You did a good job, Ali.
You had me in tears.
She runs over to me, smothers me with kisses.
"Evans, did you really like it?
The tears, they were for you."
My eyes start to swell.
I actually start crying.
Crying about happiness, and feeling that
I'm the luckiest guy in the whole world.
Camelot was ours.
Well, at least I thought it was.
"Evans, there's a big problem. The board of directors, they want me out of Paramount.
They can't afford it anymore.
It's turning a cash flow into a cash drought.
They've had it. They want me out too, out of show business.
Get back to what I do best.
Making money, not movies."
Charlie was not prone to making practical jokes, and this was no joke.
Fuck them, Charlie.
Stall them if you can.
With your eyes closed, you can buy another quarter. I know you can.
Give us one more shot at the table.
You can do it.
"The board's already decided.
They called an emergency meeting a week from tomorrow.
The studio will be closed by the end of next week."
Damn it. This couldn't be happening to me.
And we were just on a roll.
Then it hit me.
Give me a half-hour, Charlie, with the board.
Just one half-hour, that's all I need.
"Evans, the one person they don't wanna see is you. Are you crazy, Evans?"
Yeah. But crazy good, Charlie.
I've got one ace in my hand:
Love Story.
And I'm gonna build a hand around it.
"All right, Evans. You got a half-hour.
That's all, just a half-hour.
Be in New York next Monday at the board meeting.
And buy a one-way ticket, and don't be late."
Peter Bart asked Mike Nichols for an afternoon...
...to film a reel for his boss to deliver to the board of directors...
...of Gulf and Western.
Mike directed me in, I'm sure, the best performance of my life.
Where were you, Mike, when I needed you 10 years ago, when I was an actor?
That Sunday at 6 p.m.,
I caught the redeye into New York.
No luggage, but a can of film under my arm.
This was our one and only chance.
If the film didn't play, the board would shut down the studio, effective immediately.
As I walked into the Gulf and Western building...
...Bluhdorn handed me my walking papers.
"Well, Evans, at least we tried."
I pushed him away.
Hold these for another 20 minutes, will you, Charlie?
I walked into the boardroom, a 100-to-1 shot.
Before me sat 16 of America's finest non-smilers.
Gentlemen, I apologize for not being better dressed.
When you've got a one-way ticket and no hotel...
...it ain't that easy to keep up with the style of the room.
No laugh. Not a crack.
Not even a white of a tooth in sight.
Quickly, I stepped out of the room...
...and handed the projectionist
Paramount's future.
Good afternoon.
My name is Robert Evans...
...and I'm senior vice president of Paramount Pictures.
By the way, this is not my office.
We tried to shoot this scene in my office.
We brought the cameras up, but my office is too small to get the cameras in.
I came down to the studio to borrow a set from The Young Lawyers...
...and that's where we are now.
As a matter of fact, I don't even have offices at the studio anymore.
Last year, we packed up our gear, cut down our staff...
...tightened our belts, moved into small quarters at little offices in Beverly Hills.
They're good enough for us.
These past few years have been rough for Hollywood.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
Some people have learned from them and some people haven't. We have.
Money we spend is not gonna be through extravagances.
It's gonna be on the screen.
And speaking of the screen, I think maybe that's the reason we're here today.
I'd like to have the opportunity of showing you some of our product for 1971.
Right now, we're approaching Christmas.
And Paramount's Christmas gift to the world is Love Story.
I think Love Story is gonna start a new trend in movies.
A trend towards the romantic, towards love...
...towards people.
Towards telling a story about how it feels, rather than where it's at.
I think Love Story is going to bring the people back into the theater in droves.
I could go on for an hour...
...and tell you about 20 or 30 projects in various stages...
...and bore you with it, so I won't.
But I wanna bring up one project.
And that's The Godfather.
I bring it up for several reasons.
One, that it's starting production next month.
Two, that it's gonna be our next Christmas' picture.
And three, to bring up the similarity between The Godfather and Love Story...
...which are the two biggest books of the last decade.
Paramount owns them both.
But Paramount has more than just owning them both.
We didn't sit back in our plush chairs and write a check...
...for a million dollars for the books, which happens so often in our industry.
We developed both of these books.
If it weren't for Paramount,
Love Story would never have been written...
...The Godfather would never have been written.
We were in there in the beginning, spurring the writers on...
...working closely with them to make these books the bestsellers they are...
...and the great movies they're going to be.
We at Paramount don't look at ourselves as passive backers of film.
We look at ourselves as a creative force unto ourself.
And that is why Paramount is going to be paramount in the industry in the '70s.
I promise you that.
Ten minutes later, Bluhdorn walked in.
"Well, I'm fired, huh?
You're a bigger fraud than I thought.
You're some showman, Evans.
You really pulled the wool over their eyes."
No kiss on the lips, but a Bluhdorn hug.
And that's more than an engagement ring.
It was the gold band itself.
Then in typical Bluhdorn fashion,
"Go back to work. We need pictures.
And you need plenty of mazel."
On December 16, 1970...
...Love Story had its world premiere at the Loews State Theater in New York.
The lights went down.
Francis Lai's haunting piano strings started up.
Ryan O'Neal, alone and bereft in a snowy
Central Park, said in a voiceover:
What can you say about
a 25-year-old girl who died?
Love Story didn't open. It exploded.
All over the world, boys and girls would walk out of that theater in love for the night.
Why did it do such business?
A guy would take a different girl every night.
I think there were more pregnancies over Love Story than any film ever made.
People went back to see it three, four, five, six times. It was an aphrodisiac.
It even got raves from the critics.
This, I couldn't believe.
Time magazine said it started a new
Hollywood, and Ali ended up on its cover.
Me? I felt like Casanova.
The most extraordinary lady in the world on my arm.
And in her belly, a little Evans-to-be.
Hey, Ali. What's new?
You can say that on television now.
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Well, I'm gonna have a baby.
Isn't that great?
That's beautiful. Are you excited?
- Sure. It's fabulous.
- I know...
We'll talk about your expecting today on Dinah's Place.
I'd have to say no two people in the entire world...
...were happier than Ali and myself.
We had to pinch ourselves each day to believe all this was happening to us.
We had our Joshua, we had ourselves.
Ali and Jackie Kennedy were considered the two most admired women in America.
And me?
I'm sure the luckiest motherfucker.
For the first time since I became head of the studio, I finally had some job security.
Now it's garbage.
We had put together a string of hits, including Rosemary's Baby...
...Harold and Maude, The Odd Couple,
True Grit and Love Story.
In 1970, we finally reached the mountaintop.
That air smelled mighty good up there.
Of all the major studios,
Paramount was now in first place.
It's hard to believe that, just four years earlier, we were in ninth.
It was the beginning of the Golden Era.
Over the next four years, we would collect 144 Oscar nominations...
...stay number one, and go through a streak of hits that, to this day, is unprecedented.
If I had to pick our crowning jewel...
...I'd say it was a 30-page treatment to a novel called Mafia, written by Mario Puzo.
In turning treatment into novel, Mario asked if he could change the name to Godfather.
"Sure, why not?"
I never thought he would finish it anyway.
Well, he finished it.
It became the biggest book of the decade.
And there I was, holding the Hope diamond.
Euphoria? Wrong.
Paramount didn't wanna make the film.
"Sicilian mobster films don't play."
That's what these distribution guys had to say.
And when you bat zero, don't make another sucker bet.
I called up Peter Bart at the studio late that night.
What the fuck do we do?
Peter shook his head, laughed.
"Evans, we got a problem."
No, we don't.
We've gotta find a solution, Peter.
It must have been after 2 in the morning, and we found it.
Outside of red ink, every one of the films shared another thing in common.
They were written, directed and produced and usually starred...
...Jews, not Sicilians.
There's a thin line, Peter, between a Jew and a Sicilian.
We're gonna make a picture that's gonna be Sicilian to the core.
You're gonna smell the spaghetti.
There was one problem.
It's hard to believe, but in 1969...
...there wasn't a single Italian-American director, that's with any credibility.
Bart looks at me and he says,
"What about Coppola?"
Are you nuts?
One thing for sure is, he is.
Bart snaps right back at me,
"Brilliant, though."
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's your esoteric bullshit coming out.
Let's face it, Bart.
This genius has made three pictures:
You're a Big Boy Now, some artsy-fartsy kind of picture, did no business.
Finian's Rainbow, which was a top Broadway musical. He made it into a disaster.
And now he's got The Rain People out there, which everyone's rained on.
There's gotta be someone else, come on.
There wasn't.
But then there was another problem.
Coppola didn't wanna do it.
This guy couldn't get a cartoon made in town.
Yet he didn't wanna make The Godfather.
I gotta give the guy credit.
His convictions were strong.
He didn't want to immortalize the families that blackened his Italian heritage.
After three long days of discussion with this guy, Peter's on the horn.
"Coppola will make the picture.
On one condition.
That it's not a film about organized gangsters."
It's not about organized gangsters?
It ain't a musical, Peter.
I told you the guy's nuts.
"He has an idea, Evans.
It's not bad.
He wants to make it as a family chronicle, a metaphor for capitalism in America."
Fuck him and the horse he rode in on!
He is nuts. Now get him out of here.
"Bob, I will if you want me to, but take 10 steps first.
Let's not forget, he's Italian."
I had less than 48 hours to make the decision.
Sell it, or shake hands with the devil.
Coppola was announced as The Godfather's maestro.
The shooting of The Godfather should take several months.
And the picture's scheduled for release sometime around Christmas, 1971.
So if in the next few months, you see some old cars dashing around or about New York...
...or see a gentleman taking another gentleman somewhere...
...at the point of a loaded gun, don't raise a hue and cry...
...because it's only the filming of The Godfather.
But then, New Yorkers don't raise a hue and cry...
...about that sort of thing anyway, do they?
This is Gene Huebert,
Fifth Avenue and 31 st Street.
It was the unveiling of Francis' cut of The Godfather.
In the theater sat Francis with his quadrille of assistants, editors and ass-kissers.
Plus the rest of his production team were all there.
The film was to open in four months.
Paramount's big Christmas gift to the world.
The lights went down, the picture started.
Two hours and six minutes later, the room began to fill with light.
Francis, I want to speak with you. Alone.
I was on fire.
And the prince himself took a half-hour to get to my office.
Thanks for showing, Francis.
"All my boys were telling me how great the picture is.
They tell me not to touch a frame."
The picture stinks, Francis.
Got it?
You shot a great film. Where the fuck is it?
In your kitchen with your spaghetti?
It sure ain't on the screen.
Where's the family, the heart, the feeling?
Is that left in the kitchen too?
Did Coppola glare.
Schmuck. Name me a studio head that tells a director to make a picture longer.
Only a nut like me would.
But you're gonna do it.
You shot a saga, pal, but you turned in a trailer.
Now go back and give me a movie.
The next morning
I told the New York honchos...
...that the picture couldn't be ready for Christmas.
I didn't need a phone to hear their screams.
Coppola?
Of course he agreed with them.
"You've got it for Christmas.
Don't worry. Evans is crazy.
He wants to change everything.
Hear this: He wants me to make it longer."
Then I get my orders, and unalterable.
"Evans, the picture is to be ready for Christmas, and that is it."
Fine. I quit.
A year before, they would've booted me out on my ass.
Yeah, but Love Story saved Paramount.
And I was their fair-haired boy.
When you've only got one shot, either you pull down that beautiful brass ring...
...or you get them brass knuckles in the balls. You got no second time around.
To Francis and the entire company's chagrin...
...Bluhdorn backed me, and backed me all the way.
Once again, the eastern seaboard is reminded
that winter is never over until Jack Frost...
... gets a hotfoot that will send him
scurrying on his way. The winter-weary...
It was the morning of The Godfather premiere.
Outside, New York was suffering through the worst March blizzard of the decade.
I was parked at the Carlyle Hotel, making last-minute preparations...
...when Ali came in from the cold.
Against her wishes,
I'd packed her off to Texas...
...to star with Steve McQueen in The Getaway.
Two months had passed, and I hadn't once bothered to visit her on location.
Quickly, we embraced.
Instead of kissing her, I whispered, wait here.
I'm expecting a call.
Weeks ago, I had invited
Henry Kissinger to the premiere.
My timing couldn't have been worse.
The North Vietnamese offensive had just begun and, naturally, he begged off.
Hello, this is Robert Evans.
May I please speak to Dr. Kissinger?
"No. Dr. Kissinger's with the president.
He'll have to call you back."
Have him call me as soon as possible.
Please, it's urgent.
Quicker than a junior agent at the William Morris Agency...
...within 10 minutes,
Kissinger's on the phone.
"Bob, Bob, what's the urgency?"
The Godfather.
"What?"
Tonight's the premiere. Win or lose, it would be worth it if I could walk in with you.
"I have a 7:30 breakfast I can't get out of,
Bob. I'm leaving the country tomorrow."
Henry, you didn't hear me.
I said I need you tonight.
Only later did I learn that his leaving the country was a secret mission to Moscow.
And the breakfast was with the Joint Chiefs of Staff...
...to resolve the mining of Haiphong Harbor.
I hung up, quickly called Bluhdorn.
Charlie, Kissinger's coming.
"Kissinger? Kissinger?
Evans, I love you. I love you!"
That was Charlie Bluhdorn.
Not easy. But not bad, either.
The doors opened.
Enough flashbulbs went off to light up the entire state of New Jersey.
On one arm, Ali MacGraw, the ravishing Mrs. Evans.
On the other, the most charismatic statesman in the world.
Is this really happening to me?
It was a blast.
I played master of ceremonies, introducing anyone and everyone.
The screaming, the fights, the threats...
...that never let up since day one of filming, were worth it.
Even Coppola, whom I had hired over Paramount's objections...
...and then personally fired, four different times, came over to hug me...
...closing the book on two years of terrible battles.
Ali?
Well, she never looked more radiant.
For the rest of the night, we danced as one.
Holding her tightly in my arms,
I felt I was the luckiest man in the world.
Could be the highest moment of my life.
Was I dreaming it?
Any man who thinks he can read the mind of a woman...
...is a man who knows nothing.
A month later, I was in Paris working on the translation of The Godfather...
...into French, Italian,
German and Spanish.
I called up Ali on the set of The Getaway, but there was no answer in her room.
Jumping up in a cold sweat from a bad dream...
...I called El Paso again.
No Ali.
Nah, I said to myself, it couldn't be.
Later that afternoon, I connected.
Where the hell have you been, baby?
"I fell asleep in my dressing room."
You're lying, Ali.
You're with McQueen, aren't you?
"That's right."
Well, expect me in El Paso tomorrow.
"It's too late, Evans.
You missed the plane a long time ago."
I flew out that night to Texas.
Joshua and his nanny were at the airport to greet me, but no Ali.
I checked into a hotel 20 miles out of town.
Holding back my tears,
I played with my son for the next hours.
Ali arrived at 9 that evening.
The last thing she wanted was to spend the night with me. But she did.
The next evening, she didn't return to my border hideout.
I sped into town, ran up the stairs to Ali's hotel and banged on the door.
"I need time to think.
Please, let me finish the picture...
...and get home, for Josh's sake."
On the plane back to L.A.,
I checked my watch.
How could I have been so fucking dumb?
It's an hour-and-40-minute flight.
I never once took it...
...until infidelity got me off my ass.
Ali and McQueen had been having an affair for months.
Was it her fault?
It was mine.
I ignored her one promise, never to leave her.
Instead, I buried myself into The Godfather.
Ali filed for divorce.
A few months later, she and McQueen got hitched.
Joshua would live with them.
He would only know me now as a weekend father.
Did it haunt me?
Well, let's just say, when a woman leaves you, it ain't easy. It never is.
But when that woman leaves you for the biggest movie star in the world...
...well, let's just say it makes you feel small.
Finally, I turned all my attention back to my other great love, the mountain.
Maybe it was my mood, but the more
I thought about it, the angrier I became.
For the last years, I had worked night and day for Paramount.
Bluhdorn's golden boy now wanted some gold of his own.
While I was living rich, everyone around me was getting rich.
He's right. You give them an inch, and they step all over you.
My contract's up, but I'd been throwing sevens too long.
And here I am.
I'm still behind the eight ball.
I called on my consigliere and closest friend, Sidney Korshak...
...one of the most feared lawyers in the country.
"I'll take care of it and quick," said Korshak. "You're gonna get gross.
I don't care if it's just one percent on every film."
Korshak may have been known as the myth, but he was no myth to Charlie.
His proposal was turned down flatter than Twiggy's chest.
Bluhdorn wasn't smart.
He was brilliant.
He knew my weak link, ego, and he sure pressed it...
...knowing it far overshadowed my greed.
"Sidney, I want everybody to get rich, but don't rape me. Don't rape me."
The real love of Charlie's life was not family, or sex, or even business.
It was negotiating.
Charlie would negotiate for anything, from an airline to a potato.
"I want Bob to make history.
I'm gonna let him make a picture of his own for five years, under his own banner...
...and still run Paramount.
The last person to have that was
Darryl Zanuck, 30 years ago.
I want him to get rich.
I'm so proud of him, Sidney."
Proud.
I would stay on at Paramount as head of the studio...
...and I would get to produce a picture a year for five years. But no raise.
- You produced Chinatown.
- Right.
But when we talk about that movie, we call it Roman Polanski's Chinatown.
That's a possessive credit from a Director's
Guild point of view, which is very unfair.
It is Roman Polanski's Chinatown.
It's also Bob Towne's Chinatown.
But, more so, and I don't say this from an egotistical way, it's Bob Evans' Chinatown.
I was on the picture for five years, four years, and Roman was on it for nine months.
But it says,
"Roman Polanski's Chinatown."
My first independent production had its origins over a steak dinner with Bob Towne.
Towne unraveled an original story he was writing.
"It's about how Los Angeles became a boomtown, Evans.
Incest and water.
It's set in the '30s.
Second-rate shamus gets eighty-sixed by a mysterious socialite.
I'm writing it for Nicholson."
I had met Nicholson a few years back and we'd become great pals.
Sounds perfect for Irish.
What's it called?
"Chinatown."
Chinatown?
You mean it takes place in Chinatown?
"No, no, no. Chinatown is a state of mind."
Oh, I got it.
I had no idea what the fuck he was talking about.
Six months later, Towne delivered his first draft of the script.
Just like the title, it was pure Chinese.
Was I alone in my confusion?
Nobody, I mean nobody, understood it.
One day, I was summoned to a meeting with Charles Bluhdorn.
"Evans, don't make this your first picture.
No one at the studio understands a word of it.
The only place it'll play is in your projection room."
I'm thinking, thinking, thinking...
I knew I had Nicholson locked.
And even though I didn't understand the script, I knew Towne was a brilliant writer.
Sorry, Charlie, Chinatown is my next picture.
I'm gonna make it.
Well.
Tonight we are honoring for best motion picture drama, Chinatown...
...The Conversation, Earthquake,
The Godfather: Part II...
...A Woman Under the Influence.
And the winner is...
And the winner is...
...Chinatown.
Robert Evans of Paramount Pictures...
... will accept
the Golden Globe Award for Chinatown.
Chinatown.
It wins every award you could ever think of.
To this day, I believe it's considered the quintessential private-eye film of its time.
It's a hell of a way to meet Catherine
Deneuve, I'll tell you that. It certainly is.
This is the second award, and I'm only a small part of it...
...that I've won in my life.
The first one was for the Most
Promising Newcomer of the Year.
It was the Photoplay Award, 1957.
And were they wrong.
The attention the picture got caused an uproar...
...with every creative bit of talent in the studio.
"How can Evans run the studio, be involved with our pictures and make his own?"
They were all fucking jealous.
If the picture had flopped, it wouldn't have made a difference. Confrontation time.
I was given two choices.
To continue running the studio, with a much-increased deal by the way...
...or go out with my own banner and make films.
It was a tough choice, but I was just tired of working 18 hours a day...
...eight days a week, to make everyone else rich but myself.
With that in mind, I said, goodbye, studio. Hello, producer.
And went out on my own.
It wasn't my scene.
I rarely ever drank.
For two years, I had been suffering from a severe pain...
...the result of a sciatic nerve problem.
Lying beside me one night was a Hollywood princess.
"Is it me?" she asked.
"The pain can't be that bad."
Wearing only a necklace, she handed it to me.
Unscrewing the top, she whispered,
"Take a sniff, a sniff of life."
It was my first experience into the world of white.
The seducer had been seduced.
I was working 18 hours a day, seven days a week, with no plans to slow down.
With six pictures in development and two in production, I felt invincible.
The first flick to hit was Marathon Man, and it went straight through the roof.
- I salute you. To your health.
- Hear, hear!
I followed it up with Black Sunday.
Then Urban Cowboy. Popeye was on its way.
At the age of 50, I was on my way...
...to becoming the youngest recipient of the Thalberg Award.
Goodbye '70s, hello '80s.
Here I come.
It's fair to say that you live a lot of people's dream.
You're seen in magazines, dating models and movie stars. Is it as good as it looks?
I most probably lead as much of a Ionely life as any man you know.
I have no free time for myself. I have no way of knowing myself as a person.
- I don't like myself as a person.
- Bob, I keep reading...
...I keep seeing pictures of you with gorgeous women.
- Are they important in your life, women?
- Yes, women are very important in my life.
How? How important?
I haven't had the opportunity of really taking advantage of life at all.
You see pictures of me with beautiful women.
I don't go out with many different women.
My life is not to be envied.
I envy many other people, not myself.
I can go a long time without seeing anybody.
- Don't you get terrible headaches?
- No, no.
Are you an obsessive record keeper?
It's said you have albums and pictures and things...
I'm not as... I wish I had...
Was more obsessive about that.
- Is that Jack Nicholson?
- It is.
If he knew that was being shown, he'd kill me.
It was taken in the privacy of a room.
I have to inject here a moment because Bobby Evans...
- We dated and had a great time.
- I also dated him.
- He asked me...
- Is there anyone here who didn't date him?
- He was very busy in the '50s.
- And he was terrific, wasn't he?
On May 2, 1980, I got a call from an associate of mine in New York.
A woman we knew was offering to sell us pharmaceutical cocaine at bargain prices.
Pharmaceutical cocaine was mythical...
...manufactured by only one company in America, Merck.
So mythical was its allure...
...that it became the DEA's most effective bait to entrap schmuck buyers.
Twenty-four hours later, my associate was on the horn.
"What do I tell her?
She's called twice."
Me being the gambler, and maybe the fool, said, hell, let's buy it.
The deal was to go down on Friday.
I waited by the phone all day.
No call.
At 7:45 that evening, I was going out the door, when my houseman hailed me.
It was my associate.
"Bob, Mike and I have been arrested.
We've been set up by the DEA."
What are you talking about?
"Don't worry. Nothing's gonna go wrong.
It'll all be taken care of.
You have nothing to worry about.
Your name was not mentioned."
It was the biggest mistake of my life.
How could I have been so fucking dumb?
Was Bluhdorn angry?
Foaming at the mouth.
"I'll never forgive you, Evans."
He never did.
Gone now was the sacred embrace of Bluhdorn...
...never to return again.
Paramount, the company
I saved from the graveyard...
...gave a terse statement to the press concerning my new infamy.
"Evans is not an employee of Paramount and has not been an employee for years.
He is an independent contractor, producing pictures for us."
May 2, 1980.
What a difference a day makes.
Judge Brodericks' dictate was to produce a 30-second anti-drug spot.
Well, I did a little more than that.
I produced a series of weeklong specials for NBC entitled Get High on Yourself.
It was a happening.
All my friends showed, and it became known as "The Woodstock of the '80s."
I've never been as high on myself as I am now.
It must have been a month and a half ago.
I had a hundred people here, and my kid was here, and I ran the commercials.
When it was over, he came to me and said:
"I'm so proud of you."
First time he ever said it.
"I'm so proud of you, Daddy.
Can I sleep in your bed tonight?"
And if I get nothing more out of it... Nothing...
I've been really paid my remuneration for whatever I've done. That's worth years.
Bob, aside from Get High on Yourself, what are your future projects?
I have The Cotton Club which I'm supposed to start in June. A project I love.
Ain't as important as
Get High on Yourself, though.
Being yourself
Paramount had no interest in my next picture, The Cotton Club.
So in May of '82, I flew to the Cannes Film
Festival to secure independent financing.
Sylvester Stallone, then the biggest star in the world, had agreed to play the lead.
And I was there to announce it.
I was supposed to meet 400 distributors on a Monday morning at 9 a.m. For breakfast.
I get a call at 2:00 that Monday morning, from..."Hello, Bob, this is Sly."
And I said, yeah, Sly. He said, "You know,
Bob, I don't think I wanna do the picture."
So I said, I don't quite understand.
I mean, we have a contract.
"You don't understand, Bob. I don't like the script." I said, well, you worked on it.
I said, what is it, Sly? He said,
"I'm not getting paid enough for it."
To make a very long story short, and a very long conversation, rather bitter, short...
...he backed away. Now, here I have 400 of the top buyers in the world...
...and I have no star, and I have a half a script.
I said, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm going to show you a poster.
But I wanna tell you that the film will not be any better than the poster.
So if you don't like the poster, please don't buy the film.
And I unraveled a poster, which I had worked on for eight months with two artists.
And I said, this is the poster.
And I passed it around, and they all looked at it. And it says the whole story:
"Its violence startled the world..."
No, "Its violence startled the nation, and its music startled the world."
And they all looked at the poster, and I said, that's the picture.
So one fellow from Switzerland says,
"Who's gonna star in the film?"
I said, sir, I won't let you have the picture.
On August 28, 1983, principal photography commenced.
Francis offered to direct the film.
How could I refuse?
Francis directing it, Mario writing it, me producing it.
What a shot of touching magic.
Hey, we didn't do too bad on
The Godfather, did we?
Was I wrong!
The production was a disaster.
Over-budget, over-schedule. And me?
I was barred from the set by the prince himself.
It was the hottest movie drama
in Los Angeles today...
... and it took place
in a downtown federal courtroom.
The legal battle was over who would control
production of the film The Cotton Club.
The Cotton Club has been a subject
of intense interest and backstairs gossip.
The Cotton Club, a production
of Robert Evans and Francis Ford Coppola...
... is the subject of a vicious...
You say Evans would second-guess you
if he was back in command?
Evans, that's his middle name.
That's what he does, all these years.
- Will the picture be a success?
- Francis' work on it is brilliant.
I hope we'll be working together.
We've fought before, only it wasn't in court.
I hope we have the same luck
as we had on The Godfather.
Despite an expected
lengthy court battle...
.... the film is expected
to open in theaters in December.
The Cotton Club opened later that month.
While some of the critics praised the film, others just didn't get it.
Neither did the audiences.
The picture quickly faded away...
...thus ending the first half of the '80s.
The good half.
I had no idea what lay ahead.
Two days ago, a badly decomposed body was
found in this dry riverbed in Copco Canyon...
... near Gorman,
in northern Los Angeles County.
An autopsy indicated the victim died
of a single gunshot wound.
In a remote area north of Los Angeles,
a beekeeper made a grisly discovery.
I crossed through a dry wash, went around a bush, and around the bush...
...and there was a hand sticking up, and there was a body laying there.
The body found in the Gorman area this past Friday has positively been identified...
...as Mr. Roy Radin.
It was midnight when the phone rang.
A bit pissed, I picked up the phone. Yeah?
It was my attorney, Robert Shapiro.
"Roy Radin is dead."
I laid there in shock, totally stunned.
I met Roy Radin a few months earlier through an acquaintance named Laney Jacobs.
Radin and I met and discussed forming a production company.
The Cotton Club might have been one of the films under the banner.
We shook hands, but nothing ever really came of it.
What does that have to do with me?
"Nothing and everything."
Shapiro told me that the police would be calling, and they'd wanna talk to me.
We sat down with them while I told them everything I remembered about Roy Radin.
Laney Jacobs introduced
Evans to Roy Radin.
For the next six years, the name
Robert Evans was making headlines again.
No, I wasn't buying Warner Bros.
This time, I was buying infamy.
The Cotton Club murder case...
Doors closed on me quietly.
Calls made were not returned.
Though I was still ensconced in the primo offices of Paramount...
...I may as well have been a shadow.
Finally, in the spring of '89, after six long years of innuendos on my character...
...the Roy Radin case went to trial.
Laney Jacobs, the woman who introduced me to Radin, was tried for his murder.
The prosecutor outlined a case of money and drugs.
And this is gonna show, that this woman here...
...Laney Greenberger, had two problems with a man by the name of Roy Radin.
He told the jury that Laney had asked Radin for a finder's fee for introducing him to me.
When Radin refused to pay it,
Laney became irate.
Two weeks before his murder, Laney, who was a part-time coke dealer...
...suspected Radin of stealing a large amount of cocaine from her.
At this point,
Laney decided to kill him.
After getting into her chauffeur-driven limousine...
...with her, Mr. Radin was never seen alive again.
Jacobs and her accomplices were convicted for the murder of Roy Radin.
Me?
Well, I wasn't even a suspect.
I was a tangential character in the proceedings, at best.
However, the name "Evans" gets ink.
If you live by the sword, know damn well you could die by it.
For many a decade, the sword treated me real well. Maybe too well.
Popeye and Urban Cowboy hit the screens in 1980.
Now, seven years later, the only product Evans was delivering...
...to the mountain of Paramount was embarrassment.
Ending whatever I had left of a legacy to be...
...I was paid a rare visit by Richard Zimbert, the head honcho of business affairs.
He walked into my office, not a happy camper.
"We go back too long, Evans, and this is not me talking. It's orders. I can't help it.
Do you want the truth?" Our eyes met.
I knew what he was going to say.
No. But I gotta hear it, Dick. Shoot.
"Bob, there's not one person at Paramount that wants to do business with you."
Dick, the only surprise is that it's taken you this long to tell me.
I suppose when it's over, it's over.
It was hard for him to say the next words.
"Your office, Bobby. We need a date."
Is 90 days okay, Dick?
"Yeah, sure. If you want more, take more."
No, 90 days will be fine.
Once king of the mountain, now I was not even allowed to climb it.
My 20-year home had been pulled from under me.
From behind the gates of Paramount,
I was now behind the gates of Woodland.
For an entire decade, my kid stood watching his father's life fall to shambles.
Once I was a king, his mother told him.
My character, persona and professional abilities were now lost.
Each month, punches were hitting me harder and harder from all directions.
The effects of public disgrace, the effects of drugs and the effects of continued failure...
...never before experienced, all but shriveled me into obscurity.
So deep was my depression...
...that I wanted to get into a car and drive south one way.
Finally, I'd rid myself of the last bastion of my dignity.
I sold my Woodland home to a wealthy French industrialist.
The effect was that I all but lost the will to function.
Nightmares were telling me
I would never leave there alive.
Then lightning struck, bad lightning.
I had nowhere to turn.
Fearing the worst, suicide...
...I looked for protection.
I committed myself to the Scripps
Memorial Hospital, a loony bin.
I was put behind bars and stripped of all my belongings.
The claustrophobia alone shot my blood pressure up over to the 200 mark.
Not wanting a DO A on their hands, the nurses shoved sedatives down my throat...
...trying to calm me.
A horrible mistake, with no way out.
Is it safe?
I had to take control of the never-ending bad dream that my life had become.
Never having been psychiatrically orientated...
...I knew that action, not therapy, was my only shot at survival.
Take your time.
Tell me.
That night, I snuck out of my room and found my way to a phone booth in the ward.
I called my limo driver,
John Paul, collect.
John Paul, meet me tomorrow at noon, on the dot, and wait.
It might be an hour, a day, a week. I don't care. Keep your motor running, got it?
The next morning, when all the attendants were busy...
...I made my dash, and I made the elevator as it closed behind me.
I made it, I made it, I thought to myself.
When I hit the bottom floor, the door opened.
There were two goons waiting for me.
You're a very nosy fella, kitty-cat.
You know what happens to nosy fellas?
No? Wanna guess?
No? Okay.
They lose their noses.
I made my dash.
The two goons were right behind me. 100 yards away...
...my car was waiting.
I had to make it before they got me.
I was older than the two of them put together, but they lacked one thing: Heart.
I breathlessly made it into the car, slammed the door...
...as I grabbed for a tiny bottle of J&B.
Back to Woodland, I said to John Paul.
My limo was pulling into the gates of my once-owned Woodland sanctuary.
What had been my Garden of Eden for close to a quarter of a century was mine no more.
Even more painful was that I was now a tenant in my own home...
...paying $25,000 a month for the privilege of living there.
Could I afford it?
Not by a long shot.
I knew that getting my home, my roots of 25 years, back was vital to my survival.
There was a big problem:
The new owner, a wealthy French industrialist named Tony Murray...
...had no intention of selling it back.
Without asking,
Jack Nicholson did a Henry Kissinger.
He flew to Monte Carlo and begged
Tony to sell me back my home.
Tony was shocked Jack would fly halfway around the world to plead on my behalf...
...for what he considered just a piece of real estate.
Wherever Tony went, he'd tell the story.
"Imagine Jack Nicholson on his knees to me.
These film people, they're all crazy."
The impact of Jack's plea, however, caused Tony to waiver.
He got me back my home.
Thanks, pal.
A year passed. It was close to midnight on a Tuesday evening.
The phone kept ringing.
It awakened me out of a deep sleep.
I looked at the clock. It was only 11:00.
Should I pick it up?
No. I know I didn't win the lottery.
Hey, maybe it's the broad
I slipped my number to last night.
Hey, it's not too late.
I'm up. I hope it's her.
Disguising my voice to protect me from bad news or bad company...
...I Englished it.
Evan's residence.
Well, I was wrong again. It wasn't the broad, but I sure won the fucking lottery.
It was Stanley Jaffe on the phone, and he was just made head of Paramount.
I'd given Stanley his first big gig back in 1967 on Goodbye, Columbus.
"Called to tell you one thing.
From this day on, the life of Robert Evans is going to be a better one.
You're way overdue, kid.
Now sleep well."
Stanley Jaffe's loyalty to me was such that it gave me back my dignity.
Back behind the gates of Paramount I went.
And back to my old offices, the best on the lot.
Do you believe in miracles?
Well, I do now.
I don't understand it, this world of fickle flicks.
It's been 30 years now, and I'm still here, still standing behind them gates.
Bet your house it ain't been dull.
I've either done it or gotten it.
You name them, I've met them.
Well, almost.
I've either worked, fought, hired, fired, laughed, cried with them...
...been figuratively fucked by them, literally fucked them. It's been one hell of a ride.
Where is everyone?
Dead? Most.
Wealthy? Some.
Destitute? Yeah, many.
Retired? I don't know.
I ain't seen them.
One thing I do know: I ain't dead,
I ain't wealthy, I ain't destitute...
...and I ain't retired.
Can't afford any of them.
Gotta keep standing, stay in the picture.
My life today?
More volatile than ever.
This last year alone, I've been shot down, bloodied, trampled, accused...
...threatened, disgraced, betrayed, scandalized, maligned.
Tough?
You bet your ass it is.
But I ain't complaining.
Nothing comes easy.
The last question:
Is it truly worth it?
Sure. Know why? I love what I do.
And very few people do.
And when you think of most of the work you do in life...
...most of people's lives are spent in their work...
...and very few people enjoy what they do, and I love what I do. So, yeah, it's worth it.
Damn right it's worth it.
Okay. 1996. Robert Evans
20 years from now.
Are we rolling? We're rolling?
Well, why didn't you tell me?
I don't know if we're rolling.
- We're rolling.
- Thank you very much.
My fellow Americans,
I'm coming to you tonight...
...because I am contemplating ending my life.
After years as being head of Paramount
Studios and then an independent producer...
...and suffering a terrible disaster with my first independent venture...
... Marathon in Drag... Something. I can't remember. It was 20 years ago.
I would like to ask you, anyone, all over the country...
If you have a script, and it's a love story, I'll do it.
I don't care if it's in drag or a monkey fucking an elephant.
If it's a good script, I'll do it.
And that's a promise. You send it to me.
And I wanna say that I would talk more to you, but I don't have the strength to talk.
I'm in the hospital now. There's a Sony tape recorder here, and this is the maternity ward.
They tell me I just had a baby.
I never knew I had a vagina.
It came as a shock to me...
...but I just talked to my wife,
Sue Mengers, and she says, well...
...didn't I know she had a cock all the time?
I never knew it. I give you my word.
She came in yesterday and showed it to me.
It was a terrific cock.
One of the biggest I ever saw.
Wait a minute. Is that phone for me?
Well, I'm recording. I can't talk.
Yeah, who's this? I can't talk.
I'm on television. Wait, stop rolling.
Yeah, what is it?
Who? Joyce Haber?
I remember her. That was 20 years ago.
She died. I can't come to the funeral.
Why am I going to her funeral?
I'm sorry. I'm too busy.
Send her something.
I don't know. Whatever she eats.
Candy, whatever.
Oh, she's dead now. Well, if she's dead, then what do you want me to see her for?
Just get it done immediately.
I gotta go. Thanks.
What? I'm sorry, I gotta talk...
My wife. Yes, Sue.
My wife is Ms. Mengers, one of the top agents in the town 20 years ago.
Today, the business is terrible. She's in Las
Vegas. She's a croupier there at the Dunes.
At night she doubles as a dune.
She's a dune.
If you ever go see her, you'll say,
"There's Sue Mengers."
She's a good dune, though.
The best dune I ever fucked. Wait a minute.
I'm sorry, Sue. No, I can't. Because I have to go back in my closet and clean it.
I haven't cleaned it in a long time.
They put me in a closet.
I don't know why.
They said I'd understand.
But I'm coming out of the closet very soon.
Yeah, Sue. The delivery was fine.
Yeah, it hurt a little.
Yeah, but it was wonderful.
They shaved me. Yeah.
I don't know. I can't talk. No,
I have to get off. I gotta see dailies.
I wanna see dailies of my delivery.
I wanna see myself giving birth.
They got a big close-up of my cunt.
It's terrific. All right, I'll see you. Take care.
By the way, I want to thank you very much for listening. And I wanna say that I wish...
...all of you a healthy life, because my life is over.
And I was just gonna ask one favor.
President Warren Beatty...
...has asked me to ask your vote again, and I ask you to do it, just for me.
Because he has some terrible scandal on me.
And I'm afraid he's gonna tell it.
And it's very embarrassing to me.
So please vote for Warren Beatty.
And I wish you a good evening, and...

[ LIGHT FLUTE MUSIC PLAYS ]
MORGAN:
Everything's bigger in America, we've got the biggest cars, the biggest houses, the biggest companies, the biggest food, and, finally, the biggest people.
America has now become the fattest nation in the world.
Congratulations.
Nearly 100 million Americans are today either overweight or obese.
That's more than 60% of all U.S. adults.
Since 1980, the total number of overweight and obese Americans has doubled, with twice as many overweight children and three times as many overweight adolescents.
The fattest state in America?
Mississippi -- where one in four people are obese.
I grew up in west Virginia, currently the third-fattest state in America.
When I was growing up, my mother cooked dinner every single day.
Almost all my memories of her are in the kitchen.
And we never ate out, only on those few, rare special occasions.
Today, families do it all the time, and they're paying for it -- not only with their wallets, but with their waistlines.
Obesity is now second only to smoking as a major cause of preventable death in America, with more than 400,000 deaths per year associated with related illnesses.
In 2002, a few Americans got fed up with being overweight and did what we do best.
They sued the bastards. taking aim at the fast-food companies and blaming them for their obesity and illnesses, a lawsuit was filed in New York on behalf of two teenage girls, one who was 14 years old,
4'10", and 170 pounds, the other, 19 years old,
5'6", and 270 pounds.
The unthinkable had suddenly become reality.
People were suing the golden arches for selling them food that most of us know isn't good for you to begin with yet each day, one in four Americans visits a fast-food restaurant.
And this hunger for fast food isn't just in America. it's happening on a global basis.
McDonald’s alone operates more than 30,000 joints in over 100 countries on 6 continents and feeds more than 46 million people worldwide every day.
That's more than the entire population of Spain.
In the United States alone,
McDonald’s accounts for 43 % of the total fast-food market.
They're everywhere --
Wal-Mart's, airports, rest stops, gas stations, train stations, shopping malls, department stores, amusement parts, even hospitals.
That's right -- hospitals.
At least you're close when the coronary kicks in.
Lawyers for McDonald's called the suits "frivolous", stating that the dangers of its food are universally known and that these kids can't show that their weight problems and health woes were caused solely by their McDiets.
The judge states, however, that if lawyers for the teens can show that McDonald's intends for people to eat its food for every meal of every day and that doing so would be unreasonably dangerous, they may be able to state a claim.
Are the food companies solely to blame for this epidemic?
Where does personal responsibility stop and corporate responsibility begin?
Is fast food really that bad for you?
I mean, what would happen if I ate nothing but McDonald's for 30 days straight?
Would I suddenly be on the fast track to becoming an obese American?
Would it be unreasonably dangerous?
Let's find out.
I’m ready.
Super-size me.
[QUEEN'S "FAT BOTTOMED GIRLS" PLAYS ]
# Hey
# I was just a skinny lad
# Never knew no good from bad
# But I knew love before I left my nursery?
# Left alone with big fat fanny
# She was such a naughty nanny
# Heap big woman
# You made a bad boy out of me
# Come on
# Ohhhhh
# Won't you take me home tonight
# Ohhhhh
# Down beside your red firelight
# Ohhhhh
# And you give it all you got
# Fat bottomed girls
# You make the rockin' world go 'round #
I knew if I was going to do this,
I would need some serious medical supervision, so I enlisted the help of not one, but three doctors - a cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, and a general practitioner.
You're feeling quite well today, yes?
In general, any fatigue or weight loss, weight gain, any change in your vision?
No fever, no earache, no cough no shortness of breath, no chest pain...
...nausea, vomiting, heartburn?
Dr. Isaacs: no hospitalizations for illness?
Do you take any medications of any sort?
I’ve just been taking vitamins.
Any food allergies or anything?
No.
There's no heart disease or diabetes or blood pressure or cancer in the immediate family?
My grandfather's had a couple open-heart surgeries.
One out of four grandparents is dead.
Yeah.
Good genes.
That's the important thing.
- Any alcohol use?
- Now? None.
You don't smoke?
I used to, but I don't.
Any drug use at all?
Not for a long time.
- Are you sexually active at present?
- Yes.
- A girlfriend?
- Yes.
Is there anything we didn't cover?
Is there anything else you need to tell me?
I don't think so.
"Patient is embarking on a one-month McDonald's binge."
Very good.
You might have something called white coats.
140 over about 95.
130 over 105.
120 over 80.
That's what it is?
The other guys are stressing me out.
You're much more relaxed.
I tend to do that to my patients.
Swallow, please.
[ GULPS ]
Your reflexes are perfect.
Good. Back out.
Normal.
Say "ah."
Everything looks pretty normal here.
Good.
We'll skip checking for hernias.
We're gonna do a rectal exam.
I like to be more thorough than that.
And I like doctors to be thorough.
You're gonna go downstairs and get your bloods drawn.
So, the reason we have you fasting is the true cholesterol and glucose number is fasting.
So, if you had, like, a bacon, egg, and cheese your cholesterol would be way high, or if you had orange juice, your glucose would be high.
Three down.
Your blood tests are excellent.
Your starting off with a total cholesterol of 168 which is less than 200, which is really superb your blood level's fine.
Your iron level is good as well. you have no evidence of diabetes.
Your fasting blood sugar is very low. the other thing that we looked at were all your electrolytes in terms of salts in your blood, your kidney function, your liver function.
They were all perfect.
Your triglycerides, which is your building blocks of fat -- basically, what you acquire from eating fat -- is 43, which is low, which is good.
Your general health, you know...is outstanding.
Your urinalysis is great.
So, you're starting off terrific.
I think the worst-case scenario is that you increase your triglycerides and your cholesterol level, and if you have any he art disease in the family -- underlying heart disease -- you're putting your heart at risk.
I expect to see an increase in your triglycerides, because that can be affected.
You're at 87 now, and I think that will change.
I think that's the only thing that will change.
Out of everything?
Out of everything.
There might be some minor variations, but the body is extremely adaptable, and the kidneys will handle any extra salt you're taking in, and your liver will be able to metabolize additional fats.
As far as you gaining weight, you probably will.
As far as your cholesterol going up, it probably will.
As far as you feeling miserable, may be.
I don't know.
Unless you start cheating and just order the salads.
I also went to a fancy new York wellness center to meet a registered dietician who would help track my progress.
Okay, let's start with getting your height and weight.
I’m 6'2".
I weight about 185.
For your height, this is a healthy weight.
I can tell you that right now.
Your BMI, which is the body mass index, is within normal limits, which means you're not obese.
You're actually at the correct weight.
So, I should keep a checklist of the things that I eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?
Your calorie needs are gonna be averaging about 2,500 calories a day.
As far as fat goes, for 2,500 calories, you're gonna want about
80 grams of total fat in a day.
The saturated fat, which is a component of total fat, you want to have less than 25 grams a day.
Don't try to overindulge too much.
Good luck, Morgan.
Hi, there. I'm Eric Rowley, our exercise physiologist.
Great.
Rowley: the official weigh-in...
We'll go through the cardiovascular assessment, and then I'll be able to calculate how much oxygen your muscles can utilize, and that's also an indicator of what type of condition your cardiovascular system is in.
All right, good work.
I’m gonna use these skinfold calipers to estimate your body density.
You're 11% body fat. that's great.
We're gonna measure your flexibility of your hamstrings, your hips, and your lower back.
Good, good. very nice.
38 centimeters was your best.
There's a basic old-school test for muscular strength and endurance.
36. Good job.
You're above average above average fitness for your age group, definitely, I'd say you're at a good spot right now.
More than 60% of Americans get no form of exercise, so for the next 30 days, neither will I.
But I'll still have to walk.
How much does the average
American walk a day?
We have these pedometers that we put on people, step counters.
You could very roughly estimate at about 2,000 steps, because 2,000 would make a mile.
And we know that people that work in office settings, who drive a car to and from work, who take an elevator up to that office, may take as little as 2,500 or 3,000 steps in their entire day.
If you wanted to feel physically like a lot of Americans do, then you'd limit yourself to about 5,000 steps a day.
Us New Yorkers -- we walk everywhere.
We walk to work, to the park, to the store.
Most of us don't even own cars.
The average New Yorker will walk four to five miles a day -- a day!
That's a lot of walking.
I’ll also have the blessing of being close to a food source almost everywhere I go.
I walk past three golden arches just on my way to the office -- three in just over a mile.
There are more Mickey D's in Manhattan than anywhere else in the world.
This tiny little island is less than 13 miles long by 2 miles wide,
22.4 square miles, and packed into that area are 83 McDonald's, nearly four per square mile.
There are twice as many Mac Shacks as there are Burger Kings, and there are more McDonald's than KFC,
Wendy's, Popeye's, and Taco Bell combined.
That's a lot of burger.
I know he's gonna do it for a month, but I think after a week, he's gonna be really irritated.
I think it's gonna affect our relationship.
MAN:
You are a vegan chef.
Yes, I'm a vegan chef.
Ugh. I just don't know if I can -- of course I will.
I’ll sit next to him while he eats McDonald's.
Of course I will.
I’m just gonna be rolling my eyes the whole time.
[ DISHES CLANKING ]
ALEX:
I have a vegetable tart and a quinoa and roasted veggie salad artichokes, and a simple green salad -- all beautiful, organic, fresh vegetables that you're gonna miss so much.
What am I gonna have that's organic?
In the next month?
Nothing?
You're only gonna have genetically modified potatoes
I’m gonna eat as many vegetables as I can tonight.
There's plenty here for you.
That's really good.
Thanks.
Have they improved their cookies in the last 10 years?
Last time I had them, they were like little hockey pucks.
I don't know.
We'll see.
It's the first day, and I'm on my way to breakfast.
Could I get an egg McMuffin extra value meal?
Every 8-year-old's dream right now that I'm getting ready to fulfill.
I got my egg McMuffin.
That's gonna be the first thing right there.
[ SLURPING ]
This McDonald's delivers for free.
All I did today was leave my apartment, walk down the stairs, and walk to the McDonald's --
1,272 steps.
So, we got to go to the corner and we got to get a cab.
The cabs are gonna add up in this thing.
I can tell already.
I got my scorecard, and in here,
I had one egg McMuffin.
I had one sausage biscuit.
Do you eat fast food?
Once in a while.
Yeah? How often?
I’d say probably once every two weeks.
Three, four times a week maybe.
In France, yes.
But here, no.
I don't like here.
It doesn't sound very...clean.
And what's your favorite place?
Probably Wendy's.
McDo.
Taco Bell.
Taco Bell.
McDonald’s is pretty close.
Do you ever have super sized cokes?
No, in France... the small size here, it's a bigger size in France.
Even the small size here,
I can't drink.
There are rules to what's going on here in this whole process.
I will only super-size it if they ask me.
I can only eat things that are for sale over the counter at McDonald's, water included.
If McDonald's doesn't sell it,
I can't eat it.
I have to have everything on the menu at least once over the next 30 days, and I have to have three squares a day -- breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
No excuses.
Oh, I love Big Macs.
This is probably the first time in a long time that I've seen a big Mac that looks like the picture, that actually almost looks like the picture.
Look at that.
Big Macs never look this good.
You got to come to Chinatown for the good big Macs.
Mmm.
You've heard about all these people who are suing these fast-food companies.
Yes, I've heard of them.
I think it's ridiculous, but it's the American way to sue for everything.
I’d throw the lawsuit out if I was a judge.
And like I was saying, if these fast-food places can put their signs up, if I can walk by them and just totally ignore them and say, "I'm not hungry.
I don't need this," they can do it, too.
We don't have to go there.
We don't have to shop with them. we can easily go in McDonald's and grab a salad, but we choose not to.
Now, if the McDonald's refused them service, they'd be in court again saying,
"we were refused service." so you can't win if you try in this world.
I think there's a lot of focus on the fast-food companies because they are mentioned more than virtually all the other causes in most of the articles and books and studies about why it's a sudden epidemic.
Again, it can't be the neighborhood restaurant.
We've had neighborhood restaurants for hundreds of years.
It can't be the foods we eat at home.
We've been eating at home for hundreds of years.
Something is very different.
I think the figure is we eat out something like 40% of our meals.
MORGAN: John Banzhaf is currently spearheading the attacks against the food industry, advising many of the lawyers who are currently going through the process.
People say he's crazy, but that's what they used to say about him when he first sued the tobacco companies... until he won.
I think in terms of responsibility, it's fair to point the big gun at McDonald's.
McDonald’s is one of the biggest but, more importantly, it is the one which, far more than all the others, lures in young children.
They have the playgrounds, the closed, indoor playgrounds.
Many places, there are no other playgrounds.
You've got to take your kid there.
So even at 2 and 3 and 4, those kids are being lured into there.
McDonald’s is very heavy on birthday parties.
They, of course, pioneered the happy meals, now the mighty kids' meals also with those little
"gotta have 'em" toys.
So they get the kids in.
And, of course, the whole clown.
McDonald's has the clown.
A lot of those ads appeal primarily to kids.
There's a cartoon on TV which features him.
So they, more than others, lure the kids in.
I think all of us are far more concerned about the kids.
MORGAN: Another man who is worried about the kids is Samuel Hirsch.
He represents the two girls who are suing McDonald's, with much advisement coming from professor Banzhaf.
Why are you suing the fast-food establishment?
You mean motives besides monetary recompensation?
You mean you want to hear a noble cause?
Is that it?
Um...
I think that fast foods are a major contributor to this epidemic.
MORGAN: In 2000,
Dr. David Satcher became the first surgeon general to draw attention to the obesity crisis, declaring it a national epidemic.
Now, remember, we're super-sizing everything.
You go to any fast food store, and they're trained to tell you to buy a bigger size.
For five cents more, you can get the super size.
Federal government will define a piece of meat, three ounces of meat, as a sensible portion, and that looks like a deck of cards.
Few people would be able to find this deck of cards if they were served a piece of meat, a steak, in a restaurant.
It would probably be about four or five times this size.
One typical bagel that one is eating that looks something like this is going to comprise five servings of bread.
When fast food companies first opened, they generally introduced one size.
For example, one size French fries when McDonald's first opened, called "fries." that size fries is now called "small."
Medium, large, and super size.
That original size is still here.
It's got about 200 calories. but the super size is gonna pack in over 600 calories.
When Burger King first opened, they had a 12-ounce small and a 16-ounce large.
This 12-ounce is now kiddy.
The 16-ounce is now the small... the medium, the 32, and the 42 and this is across the board with all fast-food places.
Cars have introduced larger cup holders to accommodate those huge
7-eleven double gulps, which are 64 ounces, a half gallon, and hold anywhere from 600 to 800 calories, depending on how much ice you put in.
MORGAN:
A half-gallon of soda?
A half-gallon of soda for one person,
48 teaspoons of sugar.
WOMAN:
Hello, may I help you?
Yeah, could I get the double quarter pounder with cheese meal?
Large or super size?
I think I'm gonna have to go super size.
[ LAUGHING ] look at that. look at that coke.
That barely fits in there.
[ LAUGHING ]
Oh, shit!
I’ve got a -- look at that. look at how big that thing is.
Look how big that French fry is.
That thing is, like, four feet tall.
Double quarter pounder with cheese.
More calories than anything.
There it is -- a little bit of heaven.
[ SMOOCHES ]
Mmm!
That's a lot of food, man.
I’ll tell you what...
You get all that super sized stuff, that stuff gets super sized, man...
Look at that.
I just put a --
I’m not even halfway done with those fries.
Not even halfway.
[ GROANS ]
This is like a workout.
See, now's the time of the meal when you start getting the McStomachache.
You start getting the McTummy.
You get the McGurgles in there.
You get the McBrick.
And then you get the McStomachache.
Right now I got some McGee that's rockin'.
MAN:
Are you sweating there?
My arms -- I feel like
I got some McSweats going.
My arms got the McTwitches going in here from all of the sugar that's going in my body right now.
I’m feeling a little McCrazy.
[ GROANING ]
Just give me a minute.
[ LAUGHING ]
I'm in pure McDonald's Heaven.
[ LAUGHS ]
ALEX: This is gonna be you, like, after every meal.
I’m dying.
God, that looks so nasty.
[ BURPS ]
It's making me puke.
[ VOMITING ]
Ohhh...
You all right?
Yeah.
I believe we live in a toxic-food and physical-inactivity environment.
That is, we live in an environment that almost guarantees that we become sick.
Not 100% of people become sick, but the numbers of people who do are growing and growing and growing.
I don't believe that "toxic" is too strong a word, either, because an epidemic of obesity where 60% of the population is suffering and record numbers of children are having this is a crisis by any standard.
MORGAN: The toxic environment is constant access to cheap, fat-laden foods.
It's gas stations that sell more candy and sodas than gas.
It's a nation where there are more than 3 million soda vending machines.
That's one for every 97 Americans.
It's a world where people depend completely on their cars for transportation and where walking has become such a chore that we rely on machines to do it for us.
My stomach feels horrible this morning.
It doesn't feel good at all.
There we go.
I’m getting this really weird feeling right in my midsection, basically in my penis right now, and it's just like this --
[ MAKES WHOOSHING NOISE ]
It's really freaky.
That is very odd.
Yeah.
It could be from the caffeine, but I couldn't really pinpoint that 100%.
I have a delivery for Mr. Morgan.
I made it over the three-day hump.
You know how when you quit smoking --
I don't know how many of you out there smoke cigarettes, but you should stop.
I quit smoking. and there's the three-day hump.
[ LAUGHING ] Three-day -- it's the three-day hump when you quit smoking cigarettes.
If you can make it over those three days without smoking one cigarette, if you can make it past day one, day two, day three, you're fine.
Same thing with this.
I made it past day three.
I’m all right.
Left unabated, obesity would overtake smoking as the leading preventable cause of death in this country.
SULLUM: I was at this meal, and it came up that one of the people was a smoker, and somebody else at the table started hectoring them about it.
"What's the matter with you?
"Don't you know how bad it is for you?
"It'll do this, that, and the other thing to you, and you really should stop."
And the smoker, rather than saying, "fuck you, mind your own business" --
Which, I think, is the appropriate response -- was abashed and defensive.
"Oh, I tried to quit," and, "yeah,
I'm gonna try again," and "you're right, you're right," and so on.
At that same table, there was a quite large woman, and I was wondering -- what if this guy, instead of confronting the smoker, had said to the large woman,
"what's the matter with you, you fat pig?
"don't you know how dangerous it is to be so overweight?
"Stop eating, for god's sake.
And don't you dare get dessert, and what's the matter with you?"
Same logic.
I’d be hard-pressed to find a distinction between those two examples.
So, one is now socially acceptable -- to hector smokers -- but the other one isn't quite yet.
So the question is, at what point will it become acceptable to publicly hector fat people in the way that smokers are publicly hectored?
A secret study by one of the tobacco companies had the ominous title -- something like,
"brand imprinting for later actuation in life."
They would buy the little toy cigarettes, and they'd start play-smoking them at 4 or 5 or 6.
Wouldn't even notice the pack.
If you asked them what pack it was, they wouldn't notice it, but the theory was that somewhere, it's buried in here, and then when they get to the age where they're smoking, without even realizing it, they're going for that pack that they recognize because it had those nice feelings for them when they were little kids.
The same way here -- they're satisfied, it's nice, they remember the warm feelings of playing and getting the toy, being with mom and dad.
It's gonna carry through.
That's why when I have kids, every time I drive by a fast-food restaurant,
I’m gonna punch my kid in the face
[ LAUGHTER ]
Then we'll never want to come.

One of the most disturbing things to me is that in the last
20 to 25 years, we've actually seen a doubling of overweight and obese children and adolescents.
MORGAN: And this weight gain has been linked to countless health problems later in life, such as...
In fact, if current trends continue one out of every three children born in the year 2000 will develop diabetes in their lifetime.
[ APPLAUSE ]
At least 17 million Americans now have type 2 diabetes, about one out of every 20 people.
If the diabetes starts before the age of 15, you lose somewhere between
17 and 27 years of life-span. according to the new research, the direct medical costs associated with diabetes have doubled.
The direct medical costs have doubled in the past five years, from $44 billion in 1997 to $92 billion in 2002.
Somewhere in the neighborhood of about 20% of the obese children have elevated abnormal liver function tests, and we have now started a study where we're biopsying these children to see what their livers actually look like under the microscope, and half of them have evidence of scarring of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, the early stages of cirrhosis.
So, when these children end up being adults, they're going to end up -- if they don't change their eating and exercise habits, are gonna end up with liver failure and, well, either transplant or death.
Did you want lettuce and mayonnaise on all of them?
I think it's very, very hard for overweight teenagers because you're always going to see the thin, pretty, popular girls, and you can't help but look at them and think, "I wish I was her," or, "I wish I could have that."
And it's depressing.
It makes you feel like crap.
That's just how it is, and of course it's hard being a teenager because you see all the girls in the Cosmo girl are teen people, and they're all beautiful, and you think, "aren't I supposed to look like that?"
And it's just not realistic.
It's not a realistic way to live.
[ APPLAUSE ]
So, without further ado, let's welcome Jared Fogle.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
My big thing was never smoking.
It was never drinking.
Obviously, it wasn't doing drugs.
My big vice was food, and before I knew it,
I wound up weighing 425 pounds.
I brought in a present for you -- my old pants that are now made famous in all the subway commercials.
[ APPLAUSE ]
You're welcome.
WOMAN: This is my daughter, Victoria.
She's an eighth-grade honor student, and you're a real inspiration to the kids.
I really appreciate that.
That's one of the greatest --
I started putting my weight on as you guys know, about third or fourth grade.
She was real tiny when she was littler, and it's been in our family.
In fact,
I had a great-grandfather that died and was buried in a piano box years and years ago, so it's a history.
Absolutely.
And she's been trying to maintain her weight.
It's tough. it's always a challenge.
I know as a kid, it's awfully hard these days and kids are not always kind.
No, not at all.
And I know that firsthand.
And the problem is, the world's not gonna change
You have to change.
I guess it's kind of cool to know somebody or be able to listen to somebody talk about actually being where I am right now, and it's kind of hard because I can't afford to go there every single day and buy a sandwich two times a day, and that's what he's talking about, like that's the only solution.
That's what he said worked the best, but I can't do that.
And I've tried other ways, and it's kind of hurt my body from doing other ways that I've tried to do.
And it's kind of hard to, like, look at someone who says, "hey, I've done it.
You can do it." but it's not that easy.
ROBBINS:
I’d been sick as a kid.
I grew up eating a lot of ice cream, more than you can believe.
We had an ice-cream-cone-shape d swimming pool in our backyard.
We had a commercial freezer with not only all 31 flavors in it, but all experimental flavors that were under development.
And I made myself the official taster.
I had to approve everything, in my mind.
And I loved it.
What kid wouldn't?
I literally had unlimited ice cream.
I ate ice cream for breakfast.
But I was sick a lot.
And I wasn't very athletic.
I was really ill.
And I didn't feel good.
So I would kind of appease that by eating more ice cream.
You can see how the vicious cycle would take place.
One of the triggering factors for me was my uncle,
Burt Baskin, my dad's partner and brother-in-law, co-founder of the company -- died of a heart attack.
I think he was 51.
Now, my uncle weighed about 240 pounds -- heavyset fellow.
And when he died, as a young man, I asked my dad,
"Do you think there could be a connection between his fatal heart attack and the amount of ice cream he would eat?"
My father said,
"No, his ticker just got tired and stopped working."
By this time, he had sold more ice cream than any human being that had ever lived on this planet.
He didn't want to think that the product was hurting anybody, that it had contributed to the death of his brother-in-law, partner, and, in many ways, best friend.
No way.
Ben Cohen, the Ben of "Ben and Jerry's", a couple years ago, had a quintuple bypass procedure at the age of 49.
My uncle,
Burt Baskin of Baskin-Robbins, dies at the age of 51 of a heart attack.
My father, Irv Robbins, the other founder of the company, ended up with very serious diabetes.
You can't deny these links.
You just can't.
Yeah, could I get the two-cheeseburger meal?
Okay, super sized.
Second time.
Mmm.
Thank you, sir.
Thanks, man.
BENNETT: After five days on the McDonald's diet, what I did was I ran three days' worth of food analysis. the needs for you to maintain weight at the 185 that you were at when you came in -- 186 pounds was approximately
2,500 calories.
Right now you're getting almost 5,000 calories a day, the average being 4,986.
I would love for you to take a multivitamin.
McDonald’s doesn't sell multivitamins.
Well, here's my new advice, is just kind of minimize the meals.
A substitute for the hot fudge sundae would be the yogurt.
MORGAN: That is true, if you get the snack size -- five ounces.
If you get the regular size without granola, it contains nearly as many calories as a strawberry sundae.
With granola, it has more calories than the hot fudge or caramel sundae.
And if that doesn't make you think twice about the parfaits, then how about this?
There's a big, nappy hair in it!
That's disgusting.
I’m gonna show you how we do it.
You go like this. we go... [ WHISTLES ] look, it's long, too! did you see that!
[ LAUGHS ]
Oh, that's so gross!
Only the finest at McDonald's.
Here we are at 190.
No.
We have to stop everything.
I don't believe it.
195 pounds.
It can't be.
We have to redo this.
That's zero.
Second try.
You've gained, actually, about 5% of your body weight.
Losing and gaining weight that fast is not healthy.
Do you eat fast food?
Yes, I do.
[ LAUGHING ]
Unfortunately.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. love it, love it, love It!
Love fast food.
How often do you guys eat it?
Every week?
Oh, maybe once or twice a week.
We're gonna go hit up
McDonald's in a little while.
At least two times today you know we ain't had no meal yet today.
We was just pointing towards McDonald's.
I get the number two, the cheeseburger with the super size coke and fries.
Super-size it up!
Make it bacon, 69 cents.
That's what they say.
"Make it bacon."
Make it bacon, baby.
How often do you think people should eat fast food?
I don't know if they should eat it at all.
I don't know if I should
I don't know about what they should do.
Oh, that's baloney!
It's baloney!
What they need to do is 25 minutes on that treadmill, work out a little, do some push-ups.
If you do some push-ups when you eat, you'll keep your weight down.
I keep my weight down.
I hit them push-ups and everything,
Keep myself cool. who has time to do that? we have to work.
We have to take care of kids.
We have to clean. so you exercise -- you run after your kids.
[ TRUMPET FANFARE PLAYS ]
[ SQUAWKING ]
# Chicken
[ SQUAWKING ]
These are the first
McNuggets I've had in this whole exciting tour of duty.
Look at that glistening in the sun.
Mmm.
Boy, that is miserable.
I’m not sure what portion of the chicken that's shaped like that.
I’m guessing this is the foot on the chicken.
In the lawsuit against them,
McDonald’s stated in their own defense that it's a matter of common knowledge that any processing that its foods undergo serve to make them more harmful than unprocessed foods.
Case in point -- McNuggets.
Originally created from old chickens that could no longer lay eggs,
McNuggets are now made from chickens with unusually large breasts.
They're stripped from the bone and ground up into a sort of chicken mash, which is then combined with all sorts of stabilizers and preservatives, pressed into familiar shapes, breaded, deep-fried, freeze-dried, and then shipped to a McDonald's near you.
Judge Robert Sweet called them
"a McFrankenstein creation of various elements not utilized by the home cook."
So, for the past couple days, which I haven't shared with everybody -- it's been a new thing --
I’ve started to have -- not chest pains, but pressure.
I feel like I got pressure on my chest.
I figure that's probably not a good thing.
But neither's eating all this, so...
I tell you.
I haven't smelled bad yet.
MAN:
Yeah, you have.
No, I haven't.
You just don't smell how bad you smell.
Look at that fish filet.
Look at this thing.
Oh, God, that looks nasty, man.
Isn't that horrible?
Obviously, that's been sitting around all day.
That, the filet-o-fish.
Ugh.
Shit!
WOMAN:
How can I help you?
Can I get the double quarter pounder with cheese value meal?
- Okay, thank you.
I don't feel good today.
Not that I feel sick, but I just feel really depressed, you know, for no reason.
I mean, things are going great.
I’ve had a good day.
I just feel really... yeah.
It's not real hard eating this food all the time, just because it tastes good, it makes you feel good.
I really noticed I'll eat some, and just a little while later,
I'll be hungry again, and I'll want more -- more, more, more.
I’m pretty bored with their menu.
It only took me nine days.
But it's pretty good otherwise.
Nine days.
[ UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS ]
# Mmm, do that again
WOMAN: How many?
MORGAN: How many's the question.
We always ask how many, and he holds up how many fingers.
That's it.
It's always the "how many"?
It's just one for now.
As soon as I got my first car, this is the first place
I came to.
I bought three Big Macs, ate them out there.
I enjoyed them so much,
I came back about 5:00 at night, bought three more, ate them out there, came back around 11:00 before they closed, and ate three more, so the first day I came here,
I ate nine Big Macs, and it was like I couldn't get enough hamburger at that time, and Big Macs are so good, so I ate 265 in the first month.
MORGAN: How many do you eat a day, usually?
Usually it's two a day.
Now, last year,
I ate 741 last year.
That's more than two a day, so that means there's days I had three, but that's because they're getting smaller.
Probably 90% of my solid diet is probably Big Macs.
That parking spot, that's where I asked her if she wanted to get married.
This place is special -- a lot of reasons.
I had one whopper in my life -- 1984.
A guy gave me 5 bucks to eat a whopper.
After I ate the whopper, took my 5 bucks over to
McDonald's, got some Big Macs.
I always make fun of people at work.
They say, "I'm gaining weight."
I say, "well, you should try the Gorske diet." they don't like that.
This is a perfect sandwich, you know.
At least for me, it is.
MORGAN: There it is -- bite number 19,000.
GORSKE: The wife says when she's got to put them in a blender, it ends.
That's what she told me.
Big Mac smoothies.
# Ooh-ooh-ooh
# Ooh #
America’s been McDonaldized, you know.
It's been franchised out.
It's like one of those
"Flintstones" cartoons where they just had something rolling in the background.
You kept seeing the same buildings go by.
It's like
K-Mart, Wal-Mart, McDonald's,
K-Mart, Wal-Mart,
Wendy's, K-Mart.
And it's like you have no sense of where you're at anymore.
The way I look at it is Cezanne was inspired by the mountain he saw out his window, and when I look out my window,
I see no mountains.
I just see billboards and advertisements, so I use that as my inspiration.
The average American child sees 10,000 food advertisements per year on television.
95% of those are for sugared cereals, soft drinks, fast foods, or candy.
A parent who eats every meal every day for the whole year with their child and at every meal gives a very compelling nutrition message and can bring in cartoon characters and Michael Jordan -- so instead of selling McDonald's, he sells oranges -- and Britney spears, instead of selling Pepsi will sell radishes or lettuce or something -- that parents will have
1,000 cracks at their child, compared to 10,000 for the food industry.
So it's not a fair fight.
By the time kids are able to speak, most of them can say
"McDonald's."
MORGAN: I'm gonna show you some pictures, and I want you to tell me who they are.
Okay.
Who's that?
You don't know?
George Washington.
Who is he?
He was the fourth President.
He freed the slaves.
And he could never tell a lie.
Who's that?
Don't know.
I don't know.
No.
[ LAUGHING ]
I don't know.
George W. Bush?
No. That's a good guess, though.
Who is this?
I don't know.
Goldilocks?
I forgot the name, but I think I know.
Yeah? where have you seen her?
That picture is on the sign.
Wendy.
Who's that?
McDonald,
Ronald McDonald.
Who is it?
McDonald.
What does he do?
He was helping people at the cash register.
He works at McDonald's.
I love their pancakes and sausage.
He brings all his friends to McDonald's for a happy meal.
Where have you seen him?
On television, on the commercials.
He's the character that made McDonald's, and he does a lot of funny stuff on TV.
MORGAN:
Companies spend billions making sure you know their product.
In 2001, on direct media advertising -- that's radio, television, and print --
McDonald’s spent
$1.4 billion worldwide.
On direct media advertising,
Pepsi spent more than $1 billion.
To advertise its candy,
Hershey foods spent under a mere
$200 million internationally.
In its peak year, the "5 a day" fruit and vegetable campaign's total advertising budget in all media was a lowly $2 million,
100 times less than just the direct media budget of one candy company.
Think about the way food is marketed --
T-shirts, coupons, toys for children, giveaways in fast-food places, place mats, just all of the different ways in which food marketing is ubiquitous.
The most heavily advertised foods are consumed the most.
No surprise.
Thank you. Come again.
Welcome to McDonald's!
MORGAN: Tomato concentrate, distilled vinegar, high-fructose corn syrup -- high-fructose corn syrup and corn syrup.
That means sugar.
I’m gonna move over to my salad shaker.
I feel a little sick to my stomach.
This is the best part of the day -- when I get to be fat on the bed with my quart of coke.
Mm-mmm.
[ ICE RATTLING ]
People eat out a lot, and so if there aren't healthy foods available at restaurants, and there isn't good nutrition information, it makes eating out difficult.
MORGAN: McDonald's says nutrition information for all their products is available on-line, but according to the 2000 U.S. census, more than half of all U.S. homes still don't have internet access.
So, what are these people supposed to do?
Go to the stores for nutrition information?
Is that information even there?
I went to find out.
Do you guys have any of the nutrition fact sheets?
Do you guys have one of those?
The things that fold out and have the nutrition info in them?
There aren't any over there?
Where would they be?
Up front?
But they got lots of info about "Dora the explorer live!"
Let me check in the back.
That's cool.
Thank you.
Just give me one second.
I can't find the booklet.
You can use the one right there on the wall.
But you don't have ones you can take with you?
No.
Do you guys have one on the wall?
They only have fliers now.
We had one before.
They don't put it up no more.
Why not?
I don't know.
Only half the McDonald's in
Manhattan had the nutrition info posted on the wall, some had the takeaway nutrition charts, and one in four had no information whatsoever.
This nice manager brought me the nutrition wall chart -- from the basement.
You don't have one that I could take with me, like a takeaway?
Do you know when you'll have some of the paper ones again?
No.
John Banzhaf and I looked all over this McDonald's in Washington for any nutritional information, and then we found it.
Behind here -- you'd never see it.
It's right back there.
You can't argue that people should exercise personal responsibility and then not give them the information on which to base it.
I got my chicken group.
ALEX:
There's no chicken group.
That's my cholesterol group.
It's protein.
I got my protein group.
Carbohydrates.
I got my meat group.
You got meat, meat, sugar, and fat.
I officially had to loosen my belt the other day.
I had to go a notch lower.
One notch?
It was scary.
I’m an old pro at this now.
You'll get sick of this, too, though.
Your girlfriend must be loving you.
She hates me.
[ BOTH LAUGH ]
Thank you. Bye-bye.
I averaged out all the calories for the last nine days, and you're still eating over 200% of what your needs are.
I suggest you cut out all the liquids that you're drinking from McDonald's, except for water.
A lot of people, if they're obese, and they lose 10% of their body weight, it's beneficial.
It can be beneficial in terms of blood pressure and so on, so gaining 10% of your body weight maybe could be equally non-beneficial.
Here we go.
Second weigh-in.
What do you think, Eric?
About 202, 203.
I think you almost got 10% of your body weight gained, so you've pretty much gained 17 pounds in 12 days.
You better slow down.
I’m telling you, don't drink your calories.
I told him no more shakes, no more coke, no more double burgers.
The staff here's calling you "burger boy."
It's starting to get dangerous now, man.
I’m getting nervous for you.
The one place where the impact of our fast-food world has become more and more evident is in our nation's schools.
Can I get a shot of your lunch right there? this is where schools turn a blind eye.
The student with the French fries probably brought a bag lunch with real food.
The girl with the chips is probably sharing them with someone else.
Out of sight, out of mind.
MORGAN: Barbara brown is the field representative for Sodexho, one of the countless lowest bidders that school districts have farmed out the feeding of your children to.
Sodexho services more than
400 k-12 school districts nationwide every day, providing quality food like little Debbie snack cakes,
Gatorade, and candy bars to your children.
They also operate prisons and feed thousands of inmates worldwide.
BROWN: Part of our position is that we're hoping that through nutrition education, the students will learn to make the right food choices without restricting what they can purchase.
MORGAN: At this middle school in Beckley, west Virginia, the school lunches don't have the flair they do in Illinois.
This school does not outsource their food service, but they are on the federal school lunch program, providing USDA reimbursable meals to the students, most of which are reheated, reconstituted packaged foods.
Some days the amount of calories in each meal tops 1,000.
MORGAN: So, the USDA sends this food for you to prepare for kids.
GLOVER: Right.
Well, not all of it, now.
You've got sloppy Joe bar-b-que sauce with pork.
From the government.
Whatever happened to cooks actually cooking?
I don't know what happened.
Too many whiny people.
They don't want to work hard.
It's easy to come in here.
This is the best tool we got right here -- box opener.
That's your chef's tool, the box cutter.
Open up a box, serve it, give it to them.
Let's look at the things that are actually cooked.
Here's a menu.
Mashed potatoes.
Ham.
Chili will be homemade.
The chili will be homemade.
What about the tomato soup?
Campbell’s.
Meatballs?
Comes in a box.
You heat it up.
Out of the course of an entire month,
6 out of 36.
You're only cooking
6 out of 36 meals?
Appleton central alternative high school is filled with students who have truancy and behavioral problems.
But they've turned things around -- not through discipline, but through diet.
We were fortunate to kind of stumble across this healthy program as a result of some contact with natural oven and bakery of Manitowoc Wisconsin, and they believe in low-fat, low-sugar, non-chemically processed foods that are free of dyes and preservatives, full of whole grains, a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables.
We do no beef here at all, and then it's the method of preparation, where we don't fry.
A lot of baking and then just fresh preparation, as opposed to opening cans or thawing things out from the box.
We got rid of candy machines, soda machines, brought in bottled water, and it was just a situation where we saw a major change in the kids.
If you walk through these halls, and you're here, these do not look like at-risk, out-of-control kids.
Their behaviors are better.
They seem to be more focused.
Teachers will tell you that they get more out of them in the class.
MORGAN: Keep in mind, this is not a private school.
These are the "trouble kids" of the public school system in Appleton, Wisconsin, that are eating so well. and it costs about the same as any other school lunch program.
So my question is -- why isn't everyone doing this?
There's an awful lot of resistance from the junk food companies that make huge profits off schools at the present time.
They don't want to get kicked out of the school system.
They want to be there to addict the children for life.
The soft drink companies, especially, boast about how they're contributing to America's education, but, in fact, what they're doing is they're draining money from the community rather than contributing money to the community because the soft drink companies aren't pumping those dollars into the machines.
It's the children in the community who are getting the money from their parents, and instead of that money going directly to education, the soft drink companies are taking a cut of it and walking away rich as a consequence.
We just banned soda in our school district, and the sugar here shows you how much sugar a student will drink in a week of just soda.
Forget about the rest of the food they eat.
And some of these companies are really opposing the ban for reasons of that we would lose revenue.
And it's not about money.
It's not about economics.
It's about health.
Ooh.
The McDonald's
Texas home-style burger meal.
That's a -- that's a local specialty.
So it's kind of like a big 'n' tasty?
Yes, except the big 'n' tasty comes with mayonnaise.
Oh, then, you know what?
I need the McDonald's Texas homestyle burger meal, please.
Would you like to super-size it today?
Oh, yes, I would.
Do a lot of people super-size it?
Yes.
Say you asked five people.
How many of those five do it?
Actually,
I get mostly all of them.
Mostly all of them?
So you're batting about 100%?
I guess.
See that?
She's that good.
Deborah’s that good.
First meal inside the restaurant that I went in to get, and they asked me to super-size it.
We're gonna keep a little tabs, see how many times they ask me to super-size it here in Texas,
'cause Texas, out of the top 1
5 fattest cities in America,
Texas has five.
Here we are -- Houston, Texas, fattest city in America, getting my first breakfast.
Hi, can I help you, sir?
When it comes to the topic of obesity, many people are quick to point the finger at various foods and food companies, but the grocery manufacturers of America, a Washington, D.C.-based lobby group, whose mission is to advance the interests of the food, beverage, and consumer products industry, are quick to shift the focus away from the companies they represent and to remind everyone that there's more at work here than just eating poorly.
GRABOWSKI: We believe very strongly in our industry, and in other industries,
I think you'll find there's a growing consensus that the solution lies in good education.
We have to get good information to parents so that they can teach their children better exercise and nutrition habits and so they can lead the healthy lifestyles.
We don't teach physical education in schools anymore.
MORGAN:
In the U.S., only one state requires mandatory physical education for grades k-12.
It's also one of the fattest -- Illinois.
You got a heart rate?
Phil Lawler is the phys ed teacher at Madison junior high school, home of the soaring war hawks, the snack-ridden school lunches we saw earlier, and one of the most well-executed physical education programs in the country.
Supported mostly by fundraising and parent involvement,
Lawler has created a role model for instructors and school districts nationwide.
LAWLER: When's the last time you ever heard of a science class fundraising to get their labs? eventually, society has to step up to the plate and say, "This is important.
"We should have daily physical education and equip it properly."
We have to say,
"Our greatest strength is the resource of our young people."
That's our future, and the way we're treating our resources right now, we're running into some serious problems with that.
I’ve always said we've never had healthcare in this country. we've only had "sick care."
I think daily physical education is the only place out there that's really offering a solution.
PHILLIPS:
When I start the music, you are gonna begin traveling through general space.
You will go back to your spot, and I will tell you a body shape.
Watch out for other...

People! People!
[ UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYS ]
Round!
Good job.
MORGAN: How many days a week do the kids here at this school get to go to gym?
Once. One day a week.
For 45 minutes.
Is that enough?
No. Nowhere close.
Not when the surgeon general recommends that, at minimum, you need 30 minutes of physical activity a day to maintain your weight and a healthy well-being.
So, once a week is nowhere close.
MORGAN: In 2001, president Bush announced his presidency with sweeping education reform.
The "no child left behind" act would now hold states accountable for not having students who met minimum education requirements.
Apparently, we were not only the fattest nation in the world, but we were quickly becoming the stupidest.
It may be sending a very difficult message for schools.
One of the reasons recess is being cut back in elementary schools, as I said earlier -- that's being cut out so they can prepare for the tests. and something I've said to a couple of groups -- we could end up with youngsters who can read but who are fat.
So we have "fat readers."
The more and more we put mandates on the school, to be very myopic in their focus, we mitigate against all of these other areas where they should be devoting time and energy, including phys ed, nutrition, health. these are all the things being cut out.
MORGAN: Who in here can tell me what a calorie is?
[ INDISTINCT TALKING ]
Something you should watch.
[ LAUGHING ] Yeah.
You got that right.
Is it the fat that goes through your, um...
What's a calorie?
Oh, Jesus.
A calorie is an increment of, um...
Ugh.
Um, that's a good question.
Most of us know what a calorie actually is.
I don't know.
Oh, wait.
Is a calorie some part of fat?
Like -- I don't know.
Uh...
It's something that builds up the fat in your body.
Calories are not good
It's the amount of --
See, I don't know.
I want to say it's the amount of calories in a calorie.
I never pay no mind to what calories are.
I just eat when I'm hungry, and that's it.
If you can tell me what a calorie is, go ahead.
A calorie is a measure of the energy content of food, and a calorie, the kind that you usually see when you see the caloric content on food labels, one calorie is the amount of energy that's needed to raise the temperature of a liter of water by one degree centigrade.
MORGAN: Well said.
Could I get a bacon, egg, and cheese McGriddle?
Hmm.
Smells like a little pancake.
Mmm.
Tastes like a little pancake.
[ LAUGHING ]
Look at that.
I haven't walked a half-mile a day since we've been here.
No wonder everything's bigger in Texas
WOMAN:
If you're inside, stay there.
The blizzard of 2003 isn't over yet.
MORGAN:
I got my lunch.
I got my dinner.
Never have to leave the house.
I’m not gonna completely become vegan just because you want me to.
I’m not saying you should do it because I want you to.
I’m saying you need to think about what you believe is a system that it is corrupt and immoral and wrong and hurtful, but you're gonna be a part of it.
Where is the disconnect there?
Why don't you make that choice?
Why don't I make the choice to not eat meat?
Yes.
Because you like it.
'Cause it tastes good
I like bacon.
I love pork chops.
Ham is the greatest thing ever.
I’m sure heroin is awesome.
Heroine and ham are in completely different categories.
I’m sorry, but ham and heroin are not the same thing.
They're not.
They're not.
I could be strung out on ham for days and be okay.
You are a little strung out.
And I am strung out on ham.
It's hard for me to watch him go through this,
I got to tell you.
I worry about his health.
He's exhausted by the end of the day, just so tired.
He gets home really late from work, and he gets all jacked up on sugar and caffeine, and then he crashes.
And then when we do have sex,
I got to tell you, he's not quite as energetic as he used to be.
[ LAUGHS ]
I have to be on top.
Otherwise, he, uh...
You know, he gets tired easily.
I think the saturated fats are starting to impede the blood flow to his penis, and he's having a hard time, you know, getting it up.
He does, totally.
It's still good, but it's definitely a big difference.
There's definitely a difference.
I can tell.
Ugh.
I feel horrible today.
My headache's coming back again.
It feels like somebody's yanking on the tendons behind my eyes.
My body ...officially hates me.
All the vitamins that you see here -- vitamin e, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and so on -- are all under 50% of what you need.
You're getting quite a lot of carbohydrates, and I know, clearly, that those are all refined carbohydrates because those are coming from the buns, biscuits, hashbrowns.
And the sugar -- let's not forget the most refined carbohydrate of all, which is coming from your milkshakes and your coke.
MORGAN: In fact, there are only seven items on the McDonald's menu that contain no sugar whatsoever --
French fries, chicken McNuggets, hashbrowns, sausage, diet coke, coffee, and iced tea.
Everything else -- even the salads -- contain sugar.
BENNETT:
I’m telling you -- 202.
I lost a pound!
Oh, thank God.
Muscle weighs more than fat.
You might have lost some muscle mass and gained some fat mass.
I lost a pound.
Let's go get something to eat.
I was feeling bad in the car -- feeling like shit, really.
I was feeling really, really...
Sick and unhappy.
I started eating.
I feel great.
I feel really good now.
I feel so good, it's crazy.
Isn't that right, baby?
Yeah, you're crazy, all right.
150 over 90.
The headaches might even be hypertensive headaches, but they're probably not.
They're probably related to blood sugar.
You might be in this hyperinsulinemic state.
150 over 110.
Your total cholesterol was 165 before.
Now it's 225.
A liver that's inflamed in any way or sick in any way will leak some of its enzymes out to the blood.
So this is very nonspecific, but it means the liver is sick, and the most likely cause of your liver sickness is a fatty liver.
Your liver is now like pat?
SGOT was originally 21.
Now it's..
And SGPT was originally 20.
Now it's 290, a more than tenfold increase.
Not good, not good, not good.
Anybody would say right now that you're sick.
If you're fatigued with this, you'll feel lethargic with this, you'll feel run-down with this.
If somebody were doing this to their liver with alcohol, they could theoretically wipe out all the liver cells and they'd be in liver failure.
I’ve never heard of anybody doing this to their liver with a high-fat diet, but I guess anything's poss--
I don't know.
I can't answer the question.
Never been done before.
No one's ever wiped out their liver with a high-fat diet before.
Wow.
And I won't wipe out my liver in two more weeks?
I would think it would be unlikely.
I don't want to tell you you wouldn't.
My advice to you is to stop doing what you're doing, because it's hurting you.
You're sick, and you're making yourself sick, and you can make yourself unsick by stopping doing what you're doing.
I’m just afraid there will be something that's totally irreversible, that there will be some damage done that...
- Yeah.
- I don't know.
So, do they think that once you change your habits that that's going to correct itself.
They think that everything should get back on track once this is done.
Your liver -- I've been doing some reading - - your liver is very resilient, and your liver heals itself.
Well, if you need a portion of my liver, honey, you can have it.
I’ll give up part of my liver for you.
Thanks, mom.
Thanks.
There's a drug that is used in emergency rooms called Naloxone.
It's used for heroin overdose.
A guy comes in overdosed on heroin, comatose.
He's gonna die.
You inject him with this drug, and it blocks the opiate receptors in the brain.
Heroin doesn't work.
He wakes up.
If I give that same drug to a real chocolate addict, a person just shoveling it in, you find the most amazing thing -- they lose much of their interest in chocolate.
They take a bite, they set it back down.
In other words, it's not taste and mouth feel. it's a drug effect of the food within the brain that keeps us coming back again and again.
You're saying that your mood goes up once you start eating.
Lately, every time I eat,
I feel 100% better.
So it seems like you're starting to get addicted to it now.

MORGAN: McDonald's calls people who eat their food at least once a week
"heavy users."
I’m not kidding.
72% of the people who eat at McDonald's are heavy users.
They also have another category -- the "super heavy user."
These people eat their food three, four, five times a week and up.
22% of the people who eat at McDonald's are super heavy users.
If you look at the menu at a fast-food restaurant, they use all of the addicting components.
They'll take a slab of meat, cover it with cheese -- cheese, of course, which is filled with the casomorphins, the opiates that are found in the cheese protein -- and then they serve it with a sugary soda, which has the addictive powers of sugar with plenty of added caffeine.
Now, you might be a 12-year-old kid.
Your brain is no match for that combination.
MORGAN: in 2002,
McDonald’s France took out a full-page ad in a French magazine in which a nutritionist stated,
"there is no reason to go to McDonald's more than once a week."
McDonald’s corporate headquarters in the U.S. freaked out, saying that this is only one opinion, and that the vast majority of nutrition professionals say that McDonald's food can be a part of a healthy diet.
So, we thought we'd randomly call some nutritionists to see what their opinions were when it came to eating fast food.
How often do you think that people should eat fast food?
Ideally, never.
Rare to never.
The less, the better.
Zero is the best.
Hopefully, no more often than once a month.
If you were stranded on a deserted island or if we get bombe d with anthrax, and that's the only food available, that's the only time you should eat fast food.
MORGAN: We called 100 nutritionists all over America, and the results were not on track with the "vast majority"
McDonald's talked about.
Only 2 out of the 100 said you should eat fast food two times a week or more.
28 said once a week to once or twice a month.
And 45 said you should never eat it.
95 of them agreed that it is a major contributor to the obesity epidemic sweeping America.
Okay.
Okay? Okay.
[ TELEPHONE RINGING ]
Hi, Morgan, how are you?
Bridget Bennett from Health.
Unfortunately,
I have to tell you that Health is gonna have to close its doors, effective immediately.
I’m sorry to have to tell you that over the phone.
We're all sort of surprised, but we will proceed as before -- just not at the integrated Health center.
Okay, Morgan, thanks, and I will talk to you soon.
Bye-bye.
MORGAN: Apparently, we don't put much value on health in America anymore.
In fact, each year, we spend over $30 billion on diet products and weight-loss programs,
21/2 times what we spend on fitness and health.
There are pills, drinks, bars.
You can lose weight while you sleep, while you watch TV, and while eating everything you want -- always pushing the newest way to stay thin without exercise.
Some people, however, feel that they have tried everything and see only one remaining option as their last hope for health.
HOWLETT: I'm diabetic.
80% of the people don't have to take insulin anymore after this.
Plus, I have hypertension.
Hopefully, correct that, lose my weight, and lose my high blood pressure.
MORGAN:
This is Bruce Howlett.
In a few minutes, his stomach will be surgically reduced to the size of a small apple in a gastric bypass operation.
People with hypertension who are obese, about 75% of them will get rid of their hypertensive medications.
MORGAN: Doctors Adam Naaman and Carl Geisler will be performing the operation.
Together, they have done more than 500 gastric bypass surgeries, and with their tandem technique, they are setting the industry standard, completing the procedure in less than 30 minutes and sending patients home the following day.
We have established now that the only procedure that really cures diabetes is obesity surgery.
I went blind for a week.
Just one day out of the blue, you went blind?
I went to work, drove to work that night, got to work, couldn't read the charts, and I had to call my supervisor, tell her I couldn't work because I couldn't see what I was doing, and called my wife, had to get her to ride to work to pick me up and take me home.
And then once I stopped drinking the diet soda waters, got my sugars back down.
I was fortunate enough, my eyesight came back.
I didn't do that much damage to them at that time.
I think it's human nature to seek a drastic solution only when you're faced with a drastic problem.
I drank three or four of those a day.
This is a half-gallon, so that means you were drinking probably about two gallons of soda a day.
It wasn't unusual, for a two-week time, we'd buy
50 two-liters of soda water.
50 two-liters every two weeks.
And I'd probably end up having to pick him up a couple extra.
He drinks more than I do.
I’ll go through about one of those a day.
There's some days I go through three or four two-liters.

MORGAN: It's, um -- it's, like, 2:00 in the morning on February 21.
I, uh, woke up, couldn't breathe.
I’m having really difficulty breathing.
I’m very hot, and, uh...um... felt like I was having heart palpitations.
Um...
Came up and walked around the living room.
I was trying to get my breath back. and, uh ...I want to finish, but I don't want anything real bad to happen, either.
Dr. Isaacs: your EKG is normal.
Deep breath.
And out.
Now, listen, I don't have a ready explanation for your chest pain.
Would you at least consider taking aspirin once a day now that you're on this ridiculous diet?
Maybe.
I’ll think about it.
Why would you even think about it?
Why wouldn't you just do it?
This is really -- you know -- you saw these numbers, right?
These numbers are absolutely outrageous.
For the first time, we're seeing uric acid elevated, so you're giving yourself hyperuricemia, and the danger of hyperuricemia is gout, kidney stones.
The results for your liver are obscene beyond anything
I would have thought.
Truly.
I mean...you know that movie
"Death in Las Vegas" --
Nicolas Cage, that pickled his liver during the course of a few weeks in Las Vegas.
I would never have thought you could do the same thing with a high-fat diet.
My advice to you, as a physician, is that you've got to stop pickling your liver.
And you're kicking it while its down now.
Now it's down, and you're kicking it further.
I mean, if you were an alcoholic,
I’d say,
"you're gonna die.
You keep drinking, you'll die."
If the pain starts to radiate to your jaw or down your arm, that's life-threatening, and immediately so.
So I need to hear about that, or you need to call 911.

He's floored by it.

Again, if you're not keeping food down or you're feeling sick to your stomach -- it looks like your liver-function tests are getting worse.
My suggestion would be to stop the diet and go back to eating a lower-fat diet, rechecking the blood tests in a couple of weeks.
THOMPSON: Nobody needs to be partisan about this issue.
We need fixes, we need remedies, and we need support.
MORGAN: How much influence on government legislators does the food industry have?
The food industry is an enormous business in the United States.
Therefore, it employs very expensive and well-paid lobbyists, and those lobbyists are in
Washington for two purposes -- number one, to make sure that no government agency ever says,
"eat less of the company's products." number two -- that the government never passes legislation that is unfavorable.
And I guess the third one is to encourage the government to pass favorable legislation.
MORGAN: The GMA is one of those lobbies.
You're going to see us do what we do best, and that is market appropriately, finance education programs, as we're doing in a great abundance, getting good information out to parents so we can solve the problem.
That's what we do in the food industry. we think that is a responsible, important role to play.
We are not police.
We are not regulators.
We provide a safe, affordable abundance of food like the world has never seen.
The food industry and the broadcasters are extremely powerful lobbies, and ...they outgun us.
The industry has stepped up to the plate.
We're going to do more. we want to do more.
We recognize we have a role to play.
We're part of the solution.
We're part of the problem, and we also are part of the solution.

[ HIGH-PITCHED ] you'll not talk to anybody, and you'll like it that way.
After six months of deliberation,
Judge Robert Sweet dismissed the lawsuit against McDonald's.
The big reason?
The two girls failed to show that eating McDonald's food was what caused their injuries.
Interesting.
In only 30 days of eating nothing but McDonald's,
I gained 241/2 pounds, my liver turned to fat, and my cholesterol shot up 65 points.
My body-fat percentage went from 11% to 18%, still below the national average of 22% for men and 30% for women.
I nearly doubled my risk of coronary heart disease, making myself twice as likely to have heart failure.
I felt depressed and exhausted most of the time.
My moods swung on a dime, and my sex life was nonexistent.
I craved this food more and more when I ate it and got massive headaches when I didn't.
In my final blood test, many of my body functions showed signs of improvement, but the doctors were less than optimistic.
I would very, very much doubt that these numbers will return to normal.
Although it did drop, it was a small drop.
If you kept on the diet, you'd definitely --
I know that you'd probably develop coronary artery disease.
...inflammation and hardening of the liver.
Should people eat fast food?
No.
You know, the answer's no.
It certainly needs to be very restricted and balanced with, overall, a healthy diet and, overall, a lot of exercise.
And there's no reason whatsoever why fast food has to be so disgusting.
Fast food can be nutritious.
It's a cheap form of food, and it does keep you full for a while, so you get your money's worth.
But unfortunately, you cause some major harm to your heart, your liver, your blood.
I wouldn't suggest you continue the diet for a year to check this out.
I don't think it's appropriate or healthy, especially with what showed up with your liver.
MORGAN: So I shouldn't eat this food for a year?
No, I don't think so.
We see people who go on an alcohol binge, and their numbers go up like crazy, but to go on a Mac attack... and they've got numbers to show that it attacks your liver, too.
Honestly, I wouldn't have even thought about this.
But it makes sense.
Now that we have the data, it definitely makes sense.
MORGAN: Still, the impact of this initial lawsuit is being seen far and wide.
School districts in new York,
Texas, and San Francisco have banned sugary soft drinks in schools, and all-natural, healthy options are popping up everywhere.
McDonald’s joined right in, sponsoring events that showed how health-conscious they'd become and creating a new line of premium salads.
At the same time, however, they also masterminded one of their fattest sandwiches to date -- the McGriddle, a pancake-wrapped creation that won my heart in Texas but can pack as much fat as a Big Mac and have more sugar than a pack of McDonaldland cookies. in fact, their new premium ranch chicken salad with dressing delivers more calories than a Big Mac and 51 grams of fat --
79% of your daily fat intake.
Over the course of my McDiet,
I consumed 30 pounds of sugar from their food.
That's a pound a day.
On top of that,
I also took in 12 pounds of fat.
Now, I know what you're saying.
You're saying "nobody's supposed to eat this food
"three times a day.
No wonder all this stuff happened to you."
But the scary part is, there are people who eat this food regularly.
Some people even eat it every day.
So while my experiment may have been a little extreme, it's not that crazy.
But here is a crazy idea -- why not do away with your super size options?
Who needs 42 ounces of coke, a half-pound of fries? and why not give me a choice besides French fries or French fries? that would be a great start.
But why should these companies want to change?
Their loyalty isn't to you.
It's to the stockholders.
The bottom line -- they're a business, no matter what they say.
And by selling you unhealthy food, they make millions, and no company wants to stop doing that.
If this ever-growing paradigm is going to shift, it's up to you.
But if you decide to keep living this way, go ahead.
Over time, you may find yourself getting as sick as I did, and you may wind up here... or here.
I guess the big question is -- who do you want to see go first, you or them?
Right now, you have the urge to eat something.
When it's through, if you still want to eat, then you're probably really hungry.
Think about what I'm saying.

All we can do is try to publicize the facts.
Not what the government is saying, but the facts.
And not simply parrot or regurgitate... what the government's saying, because that's largely bullshit. lt was the dead of winter. l don't remember it ever being so cold.
And we were on a mission.
A bunch of us had volunteered to drive our good friend to his new home... the Schuylkill Federal Prison in the middle of Pennsylvania.
He called himself Phiber Optik.
You'd have to look hard to find someone who didn't think he was brilliant.
Before we left, we had a night of fun... in the streets of Philadelphia, in the middle of an ice storm.
Phiber learned by exploring.
He was never too busy to explain... howthings worked to anyone interested. l think that's what pissed of the authorities the most.
They never tried to prove that
Phiber Optik hacked into any computers.
They got him for conspiracy... for talking on a tapped phone line... about howto hack certain sites.
There were people who broke into systems... and fucked things up, and they never even got arrested.
The feds didn't care.
They wanted to shut down the teachers, the people who didn't knowto keep secrets.
There's Bernie S.
He's another guy who loves to explain... howtechnology works to anyone who's interested.
He didn't know it, but hell was just around the corner waiting for him.
We made one last stop before we dropped Phiber off. lt was a town called Frackville.
We thought it was funny because of a hacker newsletter called Phrack.
We thought it'd make a good picture for the hacker community.
But Bernie had the balls to get a Frackville cop... to pose with Phiber.
These guys had no clue what was going on... but they quickly got into the spirit. lt was the last time we laughed that night.
We drove to the prison. lt felt like it was 20 degrees below zero.
We didn't know they'd throw him in the hole... for the entire weekend.
Some kind of prison welcoming ceremony.
And like the gullible idiots we were... we figured we'd have a chance to say goodbye.
We didn't.
They grabbed him.
And we had to run out of there to keep them from taking our camera.
Phiber came home 10 months later, a hero.
Everyone knew sending someone like that to prison... was a big mistake.
After it was over, we were pretty sure it wouldn't happen again.
Were we ever wrong.
Bad boys gone to jail
Bad boys gone to jail
Look at you, boy, you've come of age and now you're going around saying you're a bad boy
You say that you'll never go to jail
'Cause you're so bad and you cannot fail
Oh bad boy
Oh rude boy
Oh bad boy
Gots to believe me
Oh bad boy
Here is how you fail
Gots to believe me one time
You went to town just to fool around
You met a girl who was wearing a frown
You going around, boasting, feeling bad
Now you're sitting in jail don't you feel so sad
This is like the crudest form of communication l've ever had to do. l just saw something.
Was that you? Well, we can see your hand. l doubt you can stick your whole head through the window
Splotch your face up against the window
We'll know it's the right one, we can at least zoom in on it.
We'll know it's the right one, we can at least zoom in on it.
Kevin Mitnick, the world's most dangerous computer hacker.
My regret about Cyberpunk is talking about Kevin... and how he was always eating and how he was overweight.
People have really gotten on my case about that.
Some guy came up to me at anAustin book thing and said:
''Why did you go on and on about Kevin's weight?''
And he was right. l did that to the point where it just wasn't tasteful.
Where it was sort of... just beating an issue that didn't need to be beaten.
For a period after he was arrested, incarcerated... and released into a halfway house... l couldn't find a single article... that talked about him without mentioning his weight.
And the real fascination with Kevin's body... and its relationship to technology.. is one of the things that absolutely hooked me. l found a number of articles in Time,
Newsweek, and the New York Times... written by people like Markoff and Joshua Quittner and so on.
And they would say
Kevin was in a halfway house... where he no longer touched a computer, and lost 100 pounds.
As if those two things were connected.
1988, USA Today... put his picture on the front page... morphed or superimposed with the image of Darth Vader.
And l thought this is a remarkable combination of two things... and it's really picking up on the idea of the Dark Side hacker. lf ever there was someone who fit that description, it was Kevin.
The mention of his name was enough to incur the wrath of the authorities.
Over the years, his reputation grew and so did the falsehoods. ln numerous articles, Kevin was said to have broken into NORAD... harassed actress Kristy McNichol... and turned his friends' home phones into payphones.
His beginning was on ham radio.
And on ham radio, it's a close-knit community.
A couple of dozen people at the most on a particular repeater or channel.
And, you know, they would get into challenges.
And, of course,
Mitnick would be the underdog.
''Let's challenge him, let's do this and that.''
When he met their challenges, they'd start crying and screaming... as if they were innocentvictims of Kevin's.
This has been the case throughout.
And then people would start unfairly using... other contacts that they had. ln one case there was a lieutenant or commander in the LAPD....
One ham radio operator who was a friend of his... got him to write a letter saying Kevin was interfering with LAPD communications.
And all sorts of crazy things in his past.
Cyberpunk was published in 1991...
Cyberpunk was published in 1991... by Katie Hafner and then-husband John Markof... and relied almost entirely on the words of people... who Kevin had had a falling out with... as well as those who didn't know him at all.
Hafner and Markoff never talked to Kevin, because he wanted to be paid for his time.
But it didn't take much to dispel the rumors.
NORAD denied any break-ins...
Kristy McNichol had no idea she was being harassed... and no evidence ever surfaced of any payphone conversions.
But none of this ever got printed.
Kevin's name was enough to convict him, regardless of the actual evidence.
And then there was Security Pacific.
After being hired,
Kevin had once again been terminated... because of the stories that followed him.
And this resulted in yet another Mitnick myth being born.
There was a Newswire article coming out that stated... that Security Pacific had lost billions of dollars or something... in bad loans... which would have affected their stock price.
That was actually tracked down to some error... that someone made in entering the information. lt had nothing to do with it not being true... but it was an error that someone made in entering the information. lmmediately, because there were employees at Security Pacific... that knew Kevin Mitnick, including one ham radio operator... immediately that was attributed to,
''Kevin Mitnick did this.''
And that's howthat rumor spread. l'd seen this all before.
Hackers were always getting blamed for things they didn't do. ln many cases for things that weren't even possible. lt was obvious somebody had to set the record straight... somebody who would command respect.
Hackers break into government and business computers... stealing and destroying information... raiding bank accounts, running up credit card charges... extorting money by threats to unleash computer viruses.
Whoa, hold on a second.
What was this guy reading?
The Weekly World News?
Hackers don't steal and extort, they play with all kinds of things.
Like those Simplex locks on the FedEx boxes. ln typical corporate brainpower...
FedEx uses the same combination on every drop box in the country. lt's fun to stick something really big in there... that couldn't possibly fit in the chute just to fuck with the guy
And he got some cheap beer out of it too. lf you go somewhere you're not supposed to be... and bring something back to show people... that always struck me as being a whole lot like a panty raid.
And you know, panty raids are really... in the grandest tradition of this country
Try to make your way in there... get the stuff, and get back out with it without getting your head cut of.
What we're doing here is we're talking... on McDonald's external speaker for their drive-thru.
And what we're doing to do that... is we have a modified ham radio... meaning it transmits on frequencies other than the ones it was intended to. ln this case, it's standard business band frequencies.
154.6 megahertz seems to be the standard McDonald's frequency l'll take your order.
The blonde, would you please kneel down for a second?
Could one of you take off your tops?
We'll give you the food for free.
You bastards, you better stop being smart.
-Here comes the manager.
-Really?
While corporateAmerica would always be the playground of hackers... it was mostly about fun and exploration, not damage or profit.
But try telling that to corporateAmerica.
Kevin Mitnick had already paid a heavy price for his curiosity.
He had served a year-and-a-half in 1988... for logging into DEC computers without authorization.
By simply looking at the VMS operating system...
DEC claimed he caused millions of dollars in damage... and was sentenced as if he had caused that amount of physical damage.
He was held without bail and was put in solitary confinement for eight months...
He was held without bail and was put in solitary confinement for eight months... because they thought he could do more damage from the prison payphone.
After his sentence, Kevin served three years of supervised release... reporting to authorities every month... and being restricted in where he could go and what he could do.
He only had days to go when federal authorities decided... he had violated the terms of his supervised release... by associating with Lewis DePayne... and accessing someone's voice mail without permission. lt was nothing.
But it was enough.
Knowing howthe media and the court system... would crucify him over any offense... because he could start World War lll from a payphone...
Kevin decided to just walk away. l was devastated.
We were never far away from each other.
And how was he living on his own... without his family to share things with? lt was horrible.
What kind of a life is this?
He is not streetwise.
He's a home person.
Kevin managed to avoid attention.
Then, on July 4, 1994, everything changed.
A front page story in the NewYork Times... turned Kevin Mitnick into a household word all over again.
The evil-looking picture... the mythical stories about breaking into NORAD computers... and controlling all the telephones in California... even the Security Pacific news release tale was retold as fact.
Nobody could figure out howthe story made it onto the front page ofThe Times... since there was nothing new in the story
But the author was no stranger.
John Markoff... who was quickly becoming a Mitnick expert without ever having met him.
We looked at the story as an amusement back then.
We were planning the first Hackers On
Planet Earth conference thatAugust.
The story had gotten so big that we all walked around with Mitnick masks.
They came here to the Hotel Pennsylvania by the hundreds.
These usually anonymous creatures of the cyberworld... better known as hackers, were holding a convention.
Throughout that weekend,
Kevin called in several times to say hi.
We all wished he could be there.
But we knew why he was running.
One of the things Markoff hadn't mentioned in his article... was the eight months of solitary confinement.
The guy was in solitary confinement for eight months.
Think about it. l mean, that would definitely change a man.
You would run.You wouldn't want that. lt was eight months, not for anything he did, but because the judge was scared.
And if you get someone who is that unaware... of actually what he can do and thinks he can destroy the world. lf you have someone who has enough power... to put you in solitary confinement you will run. lt makes perfect sense to me. l think it's part hype... part hysteria, part lack of understanding... and part fear.
Solitary confinement means no books... no pencil, no paper, no company.
Nothing to do... but stare at these small four walls.
He would get out one hour a day.. and that's it.
You know, he might whistle up some missile launch codes.
That's a big problem with hackers nowadays.
They get a little pissed off and they launch some nukes by whistling.
The fear factor is just insane.
Once or twice or maybe more, l can't even remember... they didn't even bring him down to the visitors' room.
They took my daughter and l... upstairs to a floor... that wasn't occupied at that time.
We were the only ones there and the guard.
They were hovering over him... as though he was an absolute monster
What could he possibly do, you know?
Could he make... a computer out of the telephone? l don't know what they were afraid of!
First of all, he had no desire to.
Secondly, it wouldn't have accomplished anything.
Thirdly, he couldn't do it.
Kevin managed to elude the authorities into the next year.
Then, on February 15, 1995... they found him in Raleigh, North Carolina.
The FBl's most-wanted computer hacker is behind bars.
Kevin Mitnick was jailed without bond in Raleigh, North Carolina... where he was arrested this week.
He's accused of breaking into corporate computers nationwide.
Private computer experts say so many other hackers are at work... that privacy is virtually impossible.
The FBl had managed to track Kevin... with the help of a mysterious computer expert, Tsutomu Shimomura... who, along with some friends had managed to track...
Kevin's cellular phone signal to the apartment he was staying in.
One of Shimomura's friends who was there while the signal was being traced... was none other than John Markoff... who wrote an even bigger front page story this time.
Sure enough, l opened the door, the next day... to the hotel room, and there was The Times outside the door.
And l picked it up and l just thought,
''Oh, my God.''
This article had a new list of things that Kevin had supposedly done... including breaking into
Shimomura's ultra-secure computer... leaving nasty voice mail messages... and stealing 20,000 credit card numbers... something that was mentioned in the first paragraph on the front page.
But 13 paragraphs later, on Page D17... it was revealed that he had never used any of them.
They were credit card numbers that had been left lying around... by lnternet Service Provider Netcom for almost a year.
Netcom credit card file, everybody had that file. lf you didn't have that file, you were a loser.
Hundreds of people had that, they swapped it around like bubble gum.
And then they claim that he's the one who did it, he's the one that had it... when that was floating around for months before he theoretically had it.
Everybody and his sister's got a million credit card numbers.
What's the big deal? lt's a meaningless thing to have.
What l want to know... is did he threaten anybody in any way?
Did he claim he was going to do some particular set of harm?
Are there any notebooks that showed he had plans... to conspire to commit any particular thing... other than humiliating
Tsutomu Shimomura... which any idiot who's ever met Shimomura could have told him... this was not the guy to mess with. l met Shimomura once.
The first time l met Shimomura was in front of Congress.
And l was testifying to a congressional subcommittee... and there's this guy... in sandals and, like, ragged-ass cutofs.
And the rest of us are done up in ties... it's me and theAttorney General from New Jersey.
And we're sitting there, giving our best
''Yes, we're in front of Congress'' thing.
And Shimomura is there in this surfer gear.
And he pulls thisAT&T cell phone... pulls it out of the shrink-wrap, finger-hacks it... and starts monitoring phone calls... going up and down Capitol Hill... while an FBl agent is standing at his shoulder listening to him. l'm like, ''This fucker's got balls the size of durian fruit.''
You know, this is unbelievable.
This is the heaviest guy l've ever seen. l mean, he's hacking, right?
He was finger-hacking this phone in front of Congress... with two FBl agents and John Gage from Sun Microsystems... in the room with him.And l was like,
''Wow,'' you know. l mean, l was impressed. lnside of a week, Shimomura and Markoff had signed a book deal... estimated to be worth $750,000. lt would be another 19 months before Kevin would even be indicted.
The book, entitledTakedown, was finished by the end of the year.
When l read it, l was aghast. lt was Tsutomu's eating and skateboarding habits. l'd been to a lot of the restaurants he'd been to... but l didn't need a hacker book to tell me about them.
Takedown. Well.... l don't what l want to say aboutTakedown.
Takedown was not well received.
1996 came and went as did 1997.
Kevin remained in prison without even a bail hearing... and no prospect of a trial anytime soon.
A25-count indictment accused him of nothing more serious... than lying on the telephone about who he was... and copying software which he never tried to sell or even distribute.
Nothing about hacking into Shimomura's machine... or having 20,000 credit card numbers... nothing that would have appeared in a John Markoff story.
North Carolina had also charged him with making free cellular phone calls.
Kevin was given a two-year sentence... more than he would have gotten for manslaughter.
But the federal charges still remained.
They even put him in solitary confinement again... because the authorities were convinced he'd build a transmitter out of a Walkman... sneak into the warden's office and monitor his conversations.
The mainstream media made light of it... claiming Mitnick was put in solitary for having too many cans of tuna.
What everyone seemed to forget was years were going by... and this guy had yet to be tried.
And then, things got a whole lot worse.
June 1998.
June 1998.
A movie version of Takedown was announced.
Skeet Ulrich, who played a killer in Scream... was set to play Kevin Mitnick.
And Russell Wong from The Joy Luck Club... would be Tsutomu Shimomura. lt didn't seem to matter to anyone... that the real-life Kevin was still rotting in prison without a trial.
According to the script we got our hands on... he had been found guilty and sentenced already.
The magic of Hollywood.
They even brought
Kevin and Tsutomu closer. ln real life, they'd only met for a few seconds in a courtroom. ln the Hollywood version they met in a dark alleyway... where Kevin would proceed to bash Tsutomu on the head... with a garbage can lid.
We had to tell the world that this was a big mistake.
The truth needed to be told.
And we could either do it ourselves, or use the media.
That's right, the media, democracy's biggest allies... committed to informing the public no matter the cost.
The true conscience of America.
-Stop pushing!
-Get out of the way, Brad.
Watch yourselves!
Come on, guys.
Don't yell at me, everyone's in front of me.
Tell them to come back.
He's coming to the mike!
Would you guys get down?
Watch the mikes!
Let's get out of the way.
Come on.
We decided to do it ourselves.
We found Skeet Ulrich's apartment in New York in a phone book... and paid a visit to try and get him the real story
But he had moved. l know, because the doorman let me look at every single name in the book.
So the next stop was Miramax Films on the West Side.
We figured they'd appreciate a chance to correct the mistakes in the screenplay.
And we knew we'd be warmly received because this was Miramax.
The company had distributed
Michael Moore's latest film... you know, the guy who films in everybody's lobby.
Hi, we're looking for Miramax?
-What's your name?
-Emmanuel Goldstein.
Who you here to see?
Sorry, you can't film in here.
-You can't film here?
-No, it's a landmark.
Sorry, you can't....
So there's no way you can call upstairs....
You have to call them, they will call me.
This wasn't going well.
How could a movie company tell us to stop filming?
All we wanted to do was talk to somebody.
What a letdown.
His light is on, so he's capturing everything.
So please go outside before he has to call the police.
All right, we don't want that, so we'll go outside....
We called the office and waited to hear from them, but we never did. lt was like they were scared of us.
Maybe they agreed with Bill Clinton... that hackers were as one-dimensional as they were in the script.
How could we get them to see the other side?
That night, NewYork City introduced unlimited ride MetroCards.
We decided to find out how long it would take for our cards to reset... so we could let people in for free.
This is what the hacker world was really all about.
Why didn't they see this?
Why did it always have to be something evil to the people who didn't get it?
We had only one option.
''For Off The Hook, l recently heard the show...
''where you got the copy of a script for Takedown.
''l found it really amusing howthe scriptwriters can take the truth...
''and not twist it or fabricate it, but just plain lie about what happened.'' l've heard about Kevin's story, and thanks to Off The Hook... l heard about this meeting, and l decided to come... and see how l can help. lt wasn't from me, it's from somebody else, l knew who that is.
-ls there a good catchiness?
-Yeah. ''From Supermax to Miramax:
''Three-and-a-halfYears With No Trial.''
And then you can make another one,
''From Miramax to Supermax:
''And No Trial.''
When they see two ''Free Kevin'' stickers... when they see 10, 20, 100, they're gonna say, ''Who the hell is Kevin?''
They'll keep saying it until somebody answers them.
One or two people that know more about it are one or two people more on our side.
Those two people get two people who get two people.That's how it is.
We're gonna be in their face every step of the way. lf it comes to showing this thing on the screen, in theaters... we're going to be there, too. l mean, what we're doing now isn't going to be finished... until Kevin has his trial, until Kevin is out.
''Guilty by Hollywood'' or something like that.
-That's a good one.
-l like that.
Yeah, l did look at the script, and.... l don't know. lt's a shame and it definitely shouldn't be something out there... for someone who knows very little about Kevin... to then see this movie and have ideas in their head that are untrue.
We had tried talking to them and they wouldn't listen.
Now, by having a demonstration outside their offices, they would have to listen.
But we were hackers.
What did we know about demonstrations?
Just that they can turn into riots... especially when the Mayor bans demonstrations outside City Hall... and the cops shoot people a lot more.
We needed guidance, someone with experience.
We looked all over town for an activist.
Maybe one of those gray-haired hippies from the '60s.
We found one. Sort of.
What's it like demonstrating here?
Do you get harassed?
They hate our guts because they don't want the truth to come out.
Why do you think there isn't more activism?
Because people don't care, they're scared... they're afraid they'll get into trouble. l can understand it.
But we still have to take a stand, afraid or not.
We have to at least give it a try, we have to give it a shot.
-Has this cop been giving you any trouble?
-No, he hasn't bothered me.
And we have a President that wants to suck their brains out.
That bothers a lot of people, but....
Anybody that's decent gets bothered when a little child is tortured to death.
Or when a President is sucking their brains out.
Yeah.
He wasn't exactly what we had in mind. l got a real earful about the evils of homosexuals and communists.
But in the end, he told us the one thing we needed to hear
When you demonstrate, make sure you're in the right.
And that's the one thing we were sure of:
We were right.
The day arrived.
We had no idea what to expect.
We just stood there for a while, not knowing what to do.
Our converted phone company van got more attention than us.
My name is Noah Kenickstein, l'm an attorney.
-For Miramax?
-No. For you all! l didn't even know.
-l'm a lawyer. l'm representing you all.
-Okay. Great.
So, no one's getting arrested, right?
-l didn't plan on it.
-Good.
The National Lawyers Guild sent someone to protect us... and that was the turning point.
Things began to come together.
Even members of the media showed up. lt seemed like everyone except Miramax was taking this seriously.
We learned that when you stand outside a film studio's offices with picket signs... people notice.
These folks are gonna put on a little demonstration here.
They're gonna be marching around. l thought l would tell you.
-You could tell the....
-l'll tell the precinct.
Tell the precinct, and tell them l'm a lawyer lt's nice and calm.
No problems at all.
But they're having a little....
They'll be marching around.
-l've got it.
-l wanted to tell you that. l appreciate thatvery much.
Could you tell me approximately how many? l would say there's gonna be....
50 people, Patty?
50 to 60, maximum 50.
-What area are you doing it in?
-ln front of Miramax Films.
They're demonstrating about a movie that they're making.
Thanks a lot, l appreciate you stopping me.
Everybody's nice and calm.
-l'll tell them that.Thanks for the advice.
-Okay, no problem.
No, they're not gonna come on purpose.
People are, you know....
You're talking about suits.
They don't give a fuck.
You got to go hand it to them.
Don't harass the people who walk by
Some people have crises going on in their lives.
They can't be bothered with our problems.
Do you have a permit?
Who's in charge out here?
Do you all have a permit?
As long as you don't block the front of the entrance.
You stay to the side, please.Thank you.
They can walk in front.
The cops have been--
As long as you don't block the entrance, l don't have no problem.
They have a FirstAmendment right.
Don't block the entrance.
That's all l'm saying. lt's ringing. l got put in voice mail, guess they got too many calls.
This one's reaching voice mail. l'll leave a message.
Hi, this is the protest outside.
Are you guys there? lf you get this, come outside.
We're right down here. l see someone.
All right. Maybe you'll pick up the phone or come downstairs later.
You calling the Publicity Department?
No, the main number. l got a hold of them yesterday... and l asked for directions to the protest... and they told me they couldn't get me from where l was at to here. l said, ''Okay, l'll call you back tomorrow when l'm out front.''
-l see them, they've got their heads out.
-There's one.
They're not answering the phones.
Waving banners that said ''Free Kevin''... and holding ''Stop Miramax'' posters... the small butvocal crowd of protesters... stood outside Miramax Pictures'
New York offices yesterday.
At issue: this script, entitledTakedown... the story of the nation's most notorious computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick.
Mitnick is currently being held in prison without bail... awaiting trial on computer crimes. lt's a script these Kevin Mitnick supporters say is libelous... and would hurt Mitnick's chances of getting a fair trial. lt might influence the jury lt might change a lot of things in a negative way.
He's trying so hard to at least get a trial and then this comes up... where he's constantly being defamed.
You never know who you might see when you're standing outside a film studio.
Kevin Bacon had no interest whatsoever.
But radio personality Lazlow did.
With the proliferation of the news...
TV news journalism like Primetime Live... and these shows that completely distort the facts... and shows like 60 Minutes being forced to go in the same direction... people don't knowthe facts about the case.
They don't knowthe facts about hackers. l'd say that hackers... are the communists of the 1990s... where, basically, if anybody says ''hacker''... all of a sudden you've got this demon 666 across your head.
Nobody actually understands any of it.
What l do in my part, on the radio... with my syndicated show, is try to get people to open their brains... because l talk to a lot of old people, because l'm on a lot of news talk stations.
When l can, l put Emmanuel or Bernie S., or anybody else on there... to talk about the state of what's going on, because nobody else will cover it.
The people who cover it in the mainstream media... do so for profit, like the guy that wrote the book.
The demonstrators say they have sent a copy of this illicitly obtained script... to Kevin Mitnick in jail, and that he absolutely hates it.
Miramax's parent, Disney, may not like it either.
The controversy comes on the heels... of the dumping of $43 million in Disney stock... by the Texas Board of Education.
The board's complaint: Miramax films have too much sex and violence.
Miramax distorts the facts!
Was that Harvey Weinstein,
President of Miramax?
He walked right by us.
He didn't even get a ''Stop Miramax'' brochure?
Of course we had a brochure for Harvey.
Okay, l'll talk to you later. Bye.
-What did they say?
-l don't know.
There she is.
That's the one who answered the phone.
She hung up on me yesterday l got through.
They waved. Did you see them wave?
Miramax distorts the facts!
They said if you use a bullhorn... or obstruct people's walkways, you have to have a permit.
Miramax distorts the facts! lf you continue to use that, l'm gonna have to call the cops. l think that three years is a long time to be held without actually having a trial.
And l think that what Miramax is doing... is going to jeopardize his right to have a free and honest trial.
So that's why l'm out here protesting.
Thank you.
They all were aware of the thing in front of the building in NewYork City.
They talked about it on the set, asked me about it.
They said ''Did you talk to Emmanuel?
That's great.''
They were waving. They think it's fantastic.
And they all want Free Kevin stickers.
The whole crew. lf you give me some, l will send it to them.
They will put them on their cars.
Hello, sir.
Do you know who Kevin Mitnick is?
Hello, sir.
Do you know who Kevin Mitnick is?
No, l do not.
Computer hacker who's been in jail for three-and-a-half years without a trial.
Miramax has decided to make a movie about him.
The script is false. lt makes him out to be a violent racist... which he is not. l want to know what you think about it.
When are they doing the film?
-They start shooting in a few weeks.
-Kevin Mitnick is great.
-How do l find out the truth?
-They should take him out of prison.
-Hold on, l want to talk to you.
-What's that?
My main thing is the only reason he ended up running afoul of the law... is because people don't have access to communications.
All you got is big corporations like Miramax with access to communications.
FirstAmendment! Yeah!
This is inAmerica.
-He was in jail three years without a trial?
-He's still in jail. l saw something about this on CNBC on Friday.
This happens a lot, though.
You always have unauthorized biographies and stuff like that.
Where it's like, you have an autobiography... you have an authorized biography.
-This is sort of like an unauthorized--
-This is going to be big.
-He hasn't had a trial yet?
-Hasn't had a trial yet.
Not only that, in the movie, they already wrote that he had a trial.
-You ever hear of Kevin Mitnick?
-No. Who's that?
Well, if you're walking away, l really can't....
How did you guys get a hold of the script?
Okay. All right.
You're a lawyer. lsn't it illegal if they're gonna slander him?
Can't they try and stop them on legal grounds?
That's not right.They have to put a waiver-- l think they should hold the film until after he's had a fair trial. l mean, it happens. lt happened, unfortunately
You know, l don't think it should be....
Obviously, it's probably not legal to have a lawsuit against Miramax. l think they should have to wait until he's had a fair trial.
And also they shouldn't use his real name. lf they want to change the facts, they should change the name.
-Make it a fictional story.
-Three-and-a-half years is a long time.
Think about what you've done for the last three-and-a-half years.
And imagine being in jail while all that stuf was happening.
For just that. Just for copying software. l've copied software.
-What did he do? He hacked.
-He hacked. l would like to know your opinion... on the slandering in this film.
Miramax sucks. So, like, Free Kevin! l can't talk shit about a movie l haven't seen or read the script of.
But the one relevant thing that l could say.. is it seems to me there is a witch-hunt sort of hysterical mentality.. vis-a-vis hacking, you know.
People are very quick to fly off the handle and condemn as terrorists... people who are, you know, exploring a newtechnology landscape... in a way that they don't understand.
-Definitely.
-That's as far as l can go not having seen it.
Not only did we find a receptive bunch at local theaters... they even started to do our work for us.
New York was great.
But it was only the start.
New York was great.
But it was only the start.
We had to travel to get to the right people.
So we put together a camera crew... and made sure none of us had anything planned for the next several weeks.
We charted out a course, and headed to the airport.
That's where we got our economy-sized rental car with unlimited mileage.
The plan was to go to Wilmington, North Carolina... where filming for Takedown was about to begin.
On the way, we figured we'd make a detour and stop at Defcon... the annual hacker convention in Las Vegas. lf we were going to do that, we should stop in San Diego... to say hi to Tsutomu Shimomura... and maybe convince him to stop using Kevin Mitnick as a cash cow.
And if we did that, it would be rude not to visit John Markof... to ask him to inject some accuracy into his stories about Kevin.
Since we were suddenly adding
10,000 miles to this rental car... we might as well visit some of the corporations... who were claiming Kevin Mitnick cost them millions of dollars in damages... just to see what the hell they were talking about.
There's something about Pennsylvania. l call it the Prison State.
That's because they seem to have prisons everywhere you look.
And almost everyone l know who's gone to prison seems to wind up in Pennsylvania.
Weird.
Besides, every time l get pulled over by a cop... l seem to find myself in the Prison State. l knew l'd better be careful.
Let's not get off on the wrong foot,
Pennsylvania's great.
Home of such landmarks as the Liberty Bell, lndependence Hall... that little surveillance camera above lndependence Hall... and the house where Thomas Jefferson signed the Declaration of lndependence... just down the block from theAfro-American
Museum and its new neighbor.
A maximum-security federal prison right in the middle of Philadelphia.
Howtimes change.
They say it's illegal to take pictures of any prison... even those under construction, even those right in the middle of a city
We couldn't find a law anywhere that backed this up... but try taking a picture of a prison... without getting threatened by some prison guard or cop.
Here, look at this part.
Maybe there are subtle details that will lead to a prison uprising some day l think fully half of the people in federal prison, if not more... shouldn't be there. lt's notviolent criminals.
Drug crimes. Somebody gets a mandatory 10 years... for selling $800 worth of LSD.
That's not right either.
That's the way the federal system works. lt's just not right. l knowthe state of California has more prisoners than SouthAfrica. lncarceration is a big business. l think that's part of the reason.
There is less and less tolerance on the part of the public... for people who have transgressed the rules.
We have a huge prison population.
This gets into other questions.
Putting a computer hacker in with sex offenders and murderers... is probably the worst thing you can possibly do... to somebody who has... not murdered, is not a violent criminal!
Somebody who's a technological....
Who's gone over the edge.
Then, again, we have to define what we mean.
We need a new classification system for technological law. ln one of my books l talked about setting up a court system... especially for technology where the people that were prosecuting... and the judges and the people involved in the cases... would have some technological basis... to evaluate and try the case in a reasonable manner... and to come up with an alternative sentencing system... that reflected more the nature of the crime. lf you're exposed to people like that for too long, you change with them.
You become one of them.
Next thing you know you'll be locked away again for doing what they do.
One night...
...l was in my cell in a minimum-security facility, Bucks County Prison.
Two guards stormed in... and flipped my bed upside down... and locked me in handcufs and started rummaging through my storage locker.. demanding to know where my computer was. l'm like, ''l don't have a computer here.
What are you talking about?''
They were squeezing the toothpaste out of my tube... ostensibly looking for a computer or whatever they were looking for. lt was bizarre!
But Pennsylvania was more than prisons, it was a place of learning.
And theAge Expo was where thousands of senior citizens learned... that corporateAmerica really cared about them.
The guy representing BellAtlantic was the most sincere of all.
How could you not trust a fox?
Freddie the Phone-Fraud Fox was passing corporate numbers to the seniors:
Over $4 billion in phone fraud every year.
Freddie said most of that was because of evil computer hackers.
And l met him.
Freddie knew words like ''digit'' would only confuse older people. lt made more sense to say things like
''ten-number number.'' lt means they will have to dial the area code... along with their seven-digit number each time they place a call... within and between 215, 610... and the new 267 for 215... and the 484 for 610 area code.
You give them out in blocks of 10,000 and people that get these blocks of 10,000... end up using 300 numbers and all the others are tied up wasted.

We went back...
...to a familiar place.
Everything was just as we left it... only it was about 90 degrees warmer.
But you could still feel the chill after four-and-a-half years. lt was surprising how nobody tried to stop us from filming.
So we filmed everything.
The medium-security facility... the minimum-security prison camp... the sign that lets minimum-security prisoners know when they've escaped... and Unicor, the slave-labor office... where prisoners make furniture for the government for pennies a day.
We almost made it out. lt was the first time we had ever gotten pulled over by prison cops.
How could we not drop in on our friends at CERT... the Computer Emergency Response Team?
They tell the world when there's a threat to computer networks.
They'd back us up and tell the world... that Kevin Mitnick posed no threat at all to NORAD...
Kristy McNichol, or theAmerican way of life.
We thought computer people worked odd hours... but these guys apparently took Saturdays off.
We asked the security guard to come down and let us leave a pamphlet or two.
Something must get triggered whenever you say Mitnick's name.
We were meeting far too many cops in so brief a period of time.
But at least Pennsylvania was living up to its name.
We explained why we were there but got the message we expected.
You're not welcome.
We're used to that. ln the event that you should maybe happen to come again... if you are not welcome... and l find out that you are not welcome... you will be exactly where Kevin is... and then you'd be defeating your purpose. l'm here to do the job and my job right now is...
-to get you out of here.
-l understand that. l know a lot of people who are in prison who probably shouldn't be there.
But that's our judicial system.
You know what l mean?
Sometimes it works and sometimes it don't.
Believe me, l've seen it not work in the favor of my people many times. l'm gonna parlay the rest of this... my tedious job is to run you for wants and warrants and all that kind of stuff... if you would expedite your leaving.
We'll get out of here, we'll head for the border right away
19 radio.
The gentleman has been given a standard warning. l'll give you his name and stuf.
Before we left, we decided to check the mood of the street.
He told me not to mess with her.
She did everybody she could in the weeds... and then she moved to the projects. lt's not Kevin's fault.
Free Kevin. Kevin has nothing to do with it.
The broad quit me
'cause l was an alcoholic... and l wasn't making no money. l was broke, that's why she quit me.
The reason l don't have a girlfriend is l don't have no money.
Oh, wow.
He seems like a nice guy.
Why would you want to do anything to him?
You think his girlfriend's gonna quit him or something? lt was time to go.
We was peeling potatoes
Back in World War Two
And we was playing that rock and roll
After school for you know who
Hidden from the public lt was behind the scenes
There was a relic
They called the purple hair
With Kevin Mitnick locked away... the phone companies of the world felt safe from intruders.
But the fact remained, many people were exploring all the time... online and off.
Allied SignalAerospace...
Sprint PCS up there... lnformix,
Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems....
You're scaring me. lt's like this flat area where there's no trees or anything, just industry
Oklahoma, the state that created Hanson.
People kept telling us our sound guy looked like one of the Hanson brothers.
Since we were going through their hometown, Tulsa... we figured we'd go to one of Tulsa's bustling malls... and turn the Free Kevin campaign into a Hanson campaign.
We could use the publicity.. and if we could confuse some Tulsans in the process... all the better.
And it sure wasn't hard to do that.
Once we'd confused people at the mall, we headed over to Oral Roberts University... in the hopes that the Religious Right would climb on board.
When the vice president of the university, a former federal agent... came down the stairs with a golf club, we took the hint.
There wasn't a golf course for miles.
Hellflower, Satan's power
You grow more beautiful by the hour

And you free our minds

Shrinking violet makes the scene ln the formal garden of the queen
Bloody Mary, so contrary
They had a hard time getting into my place. l had the bedroom door closed, so l didn't hear the pounding on the door
They were pounding on the door out there for a good 10 minutes.
They actually started calling on the cellular phone... and leaving messages on my answering machine.
''This is the FBl.
We're at your door. Open up.'' l wasn't there when they searched my home.
My mom had to get me from school.
My dad was the only one home.
They thought... that he was me.
They were looking for somebody that was an adult.
When they found out that l was like, 13... they didn't know what to do. l think when they walk in and want to take things... they should be told to go to hell... take what they want, we'll see you in court, don't even talk to me.
The problem, of course, is that hackers don't have the resources to do this.
They want to try to get off cheap... so they cooperate and they plea bargain... and they end up pleading guilty to something they didn't do.
And that sets the record bad for them going forward. l think if people had the resources, or if there were an organization... dedicated to helping people, to providing the resources....
You know, something that's much more than just a dummy front... such as the EFF.
An organization that's actually truly willing to help in those matters... that we'd see a lot more progress along those lines.
The government, for once... would have to start conforming to the same laws... that they're supposedly enforcing.
We were detained for two hours in the parking lot.
There were 13 police officers and l think five or six police cars. l told them what was going on... but they seemed to think there was more going on than there was.
Without my consent they took my box of crystals... even though they admitted they didn't know what they were.
They took anything and everything that had magnetic media on it... or had an electrical plug on it.
They took other unrelated items such as a woman's purse. l'm not quite sure howthat fits into the scope of their investigation.
Every business card l had.
They took everything just to make life difficult on me.
They told me they're not trying to chastise me... and then one of them said... he used to play with baseball cards when he was a kid.
They would be searching my wardrobe. l'd be standing there with the guy he's asking questions... and he's going through every pocket in my wardrobe.
Then it suddenly dawned on me... l don't have to stand there.
So l walked out of the room.
He stopped searching the wardrobe and walked out with me. lt was very obvious.
Their tactics weren't meant to actually accomplish something.
Searching every pocket of every shirt in my closet... that tactic wasn't meant to do anything except intimidate me.
They showed up at my friend's house... where a 3-year-old and a 5-year-old had just been put to bed.
They came storming into the house with guns drawn... ran up the steps... and said,
''Freeze! Secret Service! Don't move!'' l was sitting at the keyboard of a computer, so l looked extremely dangerous. l was thrown to the floor, handcuffed, and hogtied, and all that... and dragged out. l told my.. friend Ellen Fisher, who was there, to call my lawyer, which she did.
They kept telling me to shut up. l was taken back to the police station in Havertown, Pennsylvania... and locked in a cell for about three hours while my car was searched.
Then a Secret Service agent interviewed me... or interrogated me, wanted to know what l was doing with the crystals.
And l said l was making them available to people.
He tried to get me to say l was committing fraud with them which l was not.
He gotvery irate that l wasn't telling him what he wanted to hear.
Eventually they locked me back in the cell again.
They refused to let me call my lawyer. ln fact, my rights weren't read to me.
There were many instances in which l told them... l wanted to consult with my attorney... and they said, ''That's not a good idea.''
They wouldn't let me get an attorney
So finally, when... they all shifted from my apartment to searching my office, actually at work... l got to drive down in my own car. l called an attorney... and by the time they were at my work, so was an attorney.
The agent in charge, Ken McGuire, in particular... gave me a very nasty and disappointed look... at the fact that l was willing to protect my rights. lt's really amazing.
He really gave me one of these:
''You shouldn't have done that'' looks.
''Now you're really in for it.''
NASA people told my parents l was cocky... because l told them to choose harder passwords. l had cops tell me pretty well straight out:
''We really didn't want to harm Junior..
''so we took his computer and gave it to the boys...
''over in traffic management, and it was just really groovy.''
Wait a minute. You're like,
''You took this kid's equipment?''
They were like,
''lt was his dad's, but he was using it.
''Dad should have known better.''
So this is $4,000 worth of equipment full of heaven only knows what content... and you just pocketed it, basically?
Now you're going to charge him?
They said, ''lf we charge him...
''we've got to bring him up under 14 different interstate laws...
''he's gonna be a felon and be ruined.''
''We explained this to them and they said,
'Take the machine, please.'''
But that's not legal.
That's nothing like legality lt's blackmail, basically. lt's like with anyone else.
Simply because you have a badge... doesn't give you the right to be an asshole.
Unless you'd like me to be an asshole back to you. l don't care who you are.
You will obtain the respect from me that you earn. Period. l may have hacked NASA, but who doesn't?
They say they clocked us at just under 100 miles per hour... on the lnterstate in New Mexico.
And the cop wouldn't let us go until l gave him my Social Security number.
To make matters worse, he told us we were still 11 hours away from Vegas.
Things seemed pretty bleak.
But, then, a miracle happened.
All right!
He said 11 hours and we made it in two and a half.
These highway patrol people don't know what they're talking about.
All right, Las Vegas, let's do it!
Twilight City gonna set my soul lt's gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up high
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
They're all waiting, they're devil-may-care
And l'm just the devil with love to spare, so
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How l wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if l ran out of speed, boy
We're looking for the Defcon conference.
We're supposed to be filming here.
Defcon conference? lt's like computer hackers....
Not that l know of.
Were they gonna start inside the computer and work their way out? lt's about a thousand computer hackers coming here. l've never heard of it.
They must've done a good job keeping this quiet.
They even got me going.
Plaza Hotel, Las Vegas?
New Mexico. lt was a mistake anybody could have made... except nobody else seems to have made it.
At least if we were in New Mexico... we could stop by LosAlamos National Labs, home of well-guarded nuclear secrets... and one of the many places
Shimomura had mysterious connections to. lf we could get the word to the people here, we just might turn some heads. ln those few places where we actually did get in... we always seemed to stay a bit too long looking at the things... we weren't supposed to be looking at.
This guy was mean, and told us to get the hell out.
As we left, we noticed more of these weird guys in fatigues... all around the building.
That's when we got lost on a dark road with no name in New Mexico... with a bunch of military zealots surrounding us.
We got the message.
Twilight City gonna set my soul lt's gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lotta money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up high
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
They're all waiting, they're devil-may-care
And l'm just the devil with love to spare, so
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How l wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if l ran out of speed, boy
When l started, l never intended it to last this long. l thought it was going to be a party and that's it.A one-time deal.
When we left, everybody said,
''Are you going to do it again?''
And l said, ''l guess l could do this again.''
Since then, more people get involved, more people say:
''We could probably have some music.''
Next thing you know, we've got a live laser light system... with LCD wall projectors and DJs coming in from the United Kingdom to spin. lt has taken on this life of its own.
We are the Ghetto Hackers.
Low-class, low-budget, high-octane.
-Dead!
-Cow!
When l say rock, you say ass!
-Rock!
-Ass!
Thank you very much. Good night. l have in my hand proof positive... that NTis not the solution to your computing problems. l have captured earlier today on film... the blue screen of death... at Las Vegas' own
MGM Grand Hotel and Casino!
Thousands showed up.
Even though the Free Kevin stickers turned into toys... at least everybody here knew his name.
You have to go to www.kevinmitnick.com.
Look it up for yourself.
''And it doesn't matter what he says about us.''
''What matters is us.
''What matters is....''
We were hot on the trail.
We were hot on the trail. l don't want to get into Shimomura. l think he has a very large ego.
He's a very bright person and very smart... but l think his social skills are lacking.
For years, Shimomura had been eluding me. l couldn't even get on the same TV shows.
He'd pop up over on CNN... while l was stuck over on a broadcast network.
While he was getting all cozy with Tom Brokaw... l was being interrogated by Mike Wallace.
2600: The Hacker Quarterly?
Tsutomu wasn't even answering my e-mail.
But nowthere would be no escape.
The San Diego Supercomputer Center, the place where he worked.
We were closing in.
You notice how quiet it is?
Like when a deer is about to be killed by a lion?
-You're here to see him?
-Yes.
-You're looking for Tsutomu?
-Yes.
-l haven't seen him in three months.
-Really?
Do you know where he is?
He's not here.
Let me check with....
Did you make arrangements to meet him here?
They weren'tvery firm but he knew we were coming.
-You can try his office.
-Did you have an appointment with him?
-lt was very informal.
-l'm sorry.
You can try the extension, but l haven't seen him.
Do l know him?
Just from interacting on....
But l'm not.... l can't....
Definitely should have called first, l guess. lt's just he likes surprises so much.
This sheet of paper that we wanted him to have.
He'll know what it's about. He wanted a couple of these stickers as well.
He wanted these? l just wanted to make sure he got them.
Great. Thanks so much for your help. lt wasn't much better than the reception we got at Miramax.
But we left our calling card in a place where we knew he'd see it. l think it's absurd when l find out that Shimomura, in addition... is giving instructions to Skeet Ulrich... on howto act more like Kevin.
Here's someone instructing him howto act more like Kevin... and it's a person that met Kevin only once... in court, under circumstances of duress.
From there how he can ascertain how Kevin acts, l don't know.
When l step on this curb we're officially on his property.
Sorry to bother you.
We're looking for somebody next door.
We're not sure if we have the right neighborhood.
-Tsutomu Shimomura.
-He moved. He's long gone.
How long ago did he move?
-Seven, eight months?
-Really?
Do you have any idea where he went?
No, he was renting, and the people who own it moved back in.
He's in the national news.
Are you aware of that?
-He's what?
-There's a movie that they're making.
-You can see, l'm on the phone.
-l'm sorry.
-They're making a movie about him.
-They're making a movie?
-lt's all about--
-l read his book.
They're making a big
Hollywood blockbuster about it.
They may film around here because this is one of the places he lived.
-So l could be a star?
-You could be a star. l've been waiting to be discovered for a long time.
He could be anywhere.
Man, that's scary.
We had one last address to try inside a gated community.
But this was getting frustrating.
We have another lead here.
We're certainly seeing a lot of the nicer places of this neighborhood.
''Out of order, please use other door.''
You know, if that was a computer, we'd be facing 50 years in jail.
They think we're the Publisher's Clearinghouse. lt was like he was a step ahead of us.
Japanese? Long hair?
For some reason, people think it's a good idea... to have a full directory of every tenant in an apartment complex... available to anyone in the world.
But it gave us the definitive proof we needed:
Shimomura wasn't here either. lt's a pretty cool system, though.
Let's try a couple of other things.
We're going to enter the room number this time.
Now it's dialing.
That's their whole phone number being broadcast!
See if we get an answering machine.
You've reached Amy. l'm sorry l'm unavailable to take your call.
Please leave a message. l'll get back to you as soon....
We've gotten everything we can out of this place... and made ourselves look suspicious at the same time so we'd better get out of here.
On the way out of San Diego, our rental car broke.
On the way out of San Diego, our rental car broke.
The trunk wouldn't close.
We should get this tape of the trunk, too.
Holy fuck! Oh, my God! Shit!
We're right underneath the flight path!
We had to clean everything out so we could exchange it... including the disgusting piece of gum that somehow got stuck to the door.
You know what, l'll use their own key to scrape it off.
Okay, l'm down.
This is the most disgusting thing l've ever had to do in my life.
You know it's still soft. Oh, God!
Want some gum?
This is a scary neighborhood.
We made it to LosAngeles in a brand-new rental car.
Our first stop, the University of Southern California... where Kevin had been accused of storing software from cellular phone companies.
USC claimed that somehow caused over $1,000 in damage. l wanted to know what computer system gets damaged... by having files stored on it! l'm Brian Johnson. l'm theAssociate Director of Customer Support.
Yeah, we're not allowed to comment on any of the security.
At least we finally managed to find someone... who'd say they weren't allowed to say anything.
That was progress, right?
The Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles...
The Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles... where Kevin had been held for three-and-a-half years. lt was his 35th birthday and we wanted to say hi.
The closest we could come was the Mobil station across the street. lt was a popular place for all the people who couldn'tvisit their friends. l know he's looking at me, so l can wave hi.
And he gives me a call and he says, ''lt's cool, you went to see me.''
-He's comfortable with that.
-How often do you come by?
Like, almost once a week.
When l drop off my sister that goes to see him.
-How come you can't go in there and visit?
-lt's too strict. l wouldn't know why the reason they don't let us go in.
-You're his brother?
-He's my brother-in-law.
Married to my sister.
-So it's only immediate family?
-Yeah, immediate family. So l can't see him.
He talks to me through the phone and letters.
-l just come and say hi.
-What's he in for? l don't know what the reason why he's in, but he's just in.
And you bring your friends with you?
Are they part of the family, too?
Yeah, they know my brother-in-law
We grew up together so....
Have you heard of Kevin Mitnick, the person we're here for?
-l never heard of him.
-He's a computer hacker.
-You know what computer hackers are?
-Yeah.
He's been in there for three-and-a-half years...
-and he hasn't had a trial yet.
-He should get a trial, you know?
He's working on it, he's trying, but the wheels of justice move very slowly.
That's something true.
They're not the ones that--
Sure.
There's so many people, l think. lt's overcrowded. l wouldn't even know what to tell you, l've never been in that system.
He must've went in somebody's government--
He must've pissed somebody off.
Pissed somebody off in the government pretty good.
They probably laughed and said,
''You have to stay there a while.''
That's not fair but that's the way it is.
When the windows are only a couple of inches wide... it's hard to find the person you're looking for... even if you know exactly what time to look.
And then we heard it.
Yeah, what was that? l heard a pounding on the window
He's shining a light or something. l can see him now.
Was that you?That was you.
You were pounding on the glass, right?
We heard that across the street.
We were looking at the wrong window.
Then we heard this pounding noise.
Come back to the window and wave some more.
Can you do that?
We'll put a sticker up, we just don't want the sticker to come back to haunt you.
He wants us to put a sticker.
-He wants a sticker?
-A sticker would be cool.
We can see your hand. l doubt you can stick your whole head through the window
Splotch your face up against the window
Nowthat we know it's the right one, we can zoom in on it.
All right, cool.
We'll see you in two minutes?
Okay, great. See you then. Bye.
He's going to be up there in two minutes.
That was definitely him. l wish we could go in there and see him without having to do this.
But, hell, l'll take it.
We found out that our filming the prison had caused such a stir.. that every single prisoner was locked down... confined to their cell for the rest of the day
And Kevin told us it was the best time he had had in years.
Like this.
That's cool.
Even the manager of the station said it was all right.
This guy in the blue car just gave me $6 for the defense fund.
No kidding.Thanks!That's great.
That's amazing.
Look where l put the sticker. l got permission from the owner. lt'll be gone tomorrow.
-That's great.
-lt'll be there for a while.
-He let you do that?
-Yeah, l asked him.
Randolph's gonna get gas and he's gonna fucking shit a brick.
He was never served... with a warrant for his arrest... for the supervised release violations during the period of his supervised release.
So by the time that he was done and went on his way... there's no indication that he was aware that such a warrant existed.
Damn! You know, Sprint really sucks.
We wanted the entire city of Los Angeles to know about Kevin.
And what better way than to put the message... on the most famous billboard in town? lt took us hours to climb that thing.
We honestly didn't knowthere was a road that went straight up the back.
But we made it.
Funny thing, though.
We couldn't find anybody who saw our Free Kevin banner.
Later, we went to the most famous movie theater in town... to try and spread the word from up close.
Here, Free Kevin! Free Kevin Mitnick. lt won't bite you. Speak English?
We're trying to get the message across to Miramax... that it's wrong to release a movie that's supposed to be factual... that's based on real events....
People will see this movie and think this is a true story... when so much of it has been completely fabricated.
-l've heard about this guy.
-Really?
Here, help stop a movie about a computer hacker?
-You got a problem?
-l got a problem.
Come back and tell me about it.
Pussy! lt's hard to believe someone in this country... could be in jail for three-and-a-half years, held in a maximum-security facility... no bail, no trial. l don't find thatvery hard to believe.
-l read a book, Takedown.
-Takedown, that's right. l read like half of it.
He gets out of jail, he'll probably take over everything.
That's the problem.
People think that, but it's not true.
You don't think he could hack anything if he just gets online?
He can't hack anything just by getting online. l mean, you gotta have a program and whatever....
Why are you recording this?
Hey, read about Kevin Mitnick?
They're making a movie about this guy.
He's the best guy ever! l know him since l was, like day one.
Yeah, me too, yo!
He's never done anything wrong, he's never hurt anyone... and he's being treated like that in this country.
That is theAmerican way. Wake up.
Kevin was denied bail. Even a bail hearing. lf you recall, even Ted Kaczynski got a bail hearing.
His bail was turned down.
You're entitled to a bail hearing.
On the other hand, Kevin... is getting treatment that is outside the law
And that's what makes itvery difficult for him to mount a legal defense.
He's not being treated in a legal manner l've never heard of anything even approaching this level of...
...confinement prior to a trial.
Murderers get bail.
Armed robbers get bail.
The fear of what he's going to do... from a push-button telephone in the general population of a cell... shows again a lack of technical understanding on the part of the prison... and judicial system.And l think that's sad.
And he is right nowthe victim of that.
On our way up the coast, we dropped in on Sun.
On our way up the coast, we dropped in on Sun.
According to a letter we got our hands on... they said Kevin's acquisition of their source code... represented hundreds of millions of dollars in damage.
Nowthey give the source code away for free.
Something wasn't right.
So we're right here.
On the other side of the freeway there's the other Sun.
And then further up is their big campus.
Basically, all of this blank area... is actually Sun buildings and Sun streets.
We knew where we were, now we just needed someone to talk to.
What number do we call and who do we speak to?
1-800-USA4SUN.
They can direct you to whoever you need.
USA4SUN?
Can you remember or do you want me to write it down?
The receptionist wouldn't let us talk to anyone unless we called.
But we slipped a few leaflets onto their coffee table. l thought she was being kind of patronizing.
''Do you want me to write that down or can you remember it?'' l can remember it.
USA4SUN, right?
-Was that it? Or was it SUN4USA? Fuck!
-Yeah.
You sure?
Should l run in and ask her again?
''Thank you for calling Sun.'' l have a rotary phone. l'm not going to press any buttons. l'm pressing zero. l'm probably going to get her,too.
My call ''may be monitored.''
Another machine.
They want my eight-digit lD number!
This is bullshit, man.
They've got me waiting for a customer service representative. lt's not exactly what l had in mind.
But let's see what happens.
My call is ''very important to them.''
He hung up!
He hung up on me!
Maybe he didn't hang up on me but he hung up all the same.
Fuck!All right. l think on their web page there's a direct public relations number
But we're not on their web page, we're in their parking lot.
Wait a minute.
You don't have your Ricochet modem?
-Not today.
-You're not prepared!
Shit. We can't access the web from here... we're outside Sun and we can't get on the net... to find out what their phone number is! l'm gonna try this number one more time. l'm gonna be a little patient here.
Assume maybe they made a little mistake.
Okay, now l am waiting for the corporate switchboard.
Hi, Pete, my name is Emmanuel. l'm trying to reach somebody in Public Relations. l'm hoping somebody can contact me concerning the Kevin Mitnick case... and how it involved Sun.
We're doing a documentary.
We came to the corporate headquarters hoping to get an appointment... and they gave us a phone number and we're trying to do just that... so if you could get back to me....
They have a fortress here.
They have that mighty guard there at the front that won't let anybody by
And then the voice mail guard here... that won't let anybody actually call and speak to a person.
Maybe they'll call back, maybe they won't.
This is the red hotline. lf that rings, we'll know
We have GPS, good.
GPS but no modem. Man, that sucks. l was using it last night and it was gone in the morning which means....
Sorry, no cameras in front of the building.
How about if we film in that direction?
We can't have the cameras filming.
Okay, 'cause we were just filming us.
No, l can understand that, but unfortunately...
Wow, this was a new one.
We couldn't even film ourselves in Sun's parking lot.
Corporate paranoia was at an all-time high.
And, needless to say,
Pete never called us back.
Meanwhile, John Markoff had agreed to talk to us.
Meanwhile, John Markoff had agreed to talk to us.
Maybe now we'd finally get some answers.
We made it to San Francisco on the exact same day... that psychologists from around the world gathered for a convention.
Maybe because so many people in that area were depressed.
They have counseling phones on the bridges... because so many people are jumping off them.
But San Francisco was a friendly town... where people felt safe leaving their trash unattended.
But more importantly... the psychologists wound up taking almost every hotel room in the entire city... even the old-fashioned ones.
We were beginning to get desperate.
Then we found a hotel that was almost completely deserted.
We never did find out why.
Markoff mentions certain stories.
He'll say, ''lt's been said that....'' or ''Other people have said that....''
And he'll come up with these stories like he shut down judges'TRW ratings... shut off power.... lt's bullshit. l don't think John Markoff did it because he wanted to destroy Kevin.
But l think he did it to keep Kevin's evil image.
Maybe he believed some of the things himself.
Okay, isn't a newspaperman... supposed to investigate something before they publish it... before they put it in the newspaper as fact? l know Spencer Tracy and Clark Gable always did.
We didn't know what we were walking into.
Would Markoff tell us things about Mitnick... that would shock and horrify us?
Or would he realize... how much his front-page stories and books had demonized Kevin... helping to put him in the lousy place he was still in?
This was our one chance to make a difference.
And, more than anything, we wanted to be fair.
So we came up with the Markoff Meter.
We set a bar on his left and right side... and resolved not to judge him badly until he said six bad or inaccurate things.
And if he said six good things... well, then, the hacker world would just have to deal with it.
Maybe this wouldn't be so bad.
Nowthere's an easy point for common courtesy. l wanted to get to the heart of the matter
Like howthey knew it was Kevin they were chasing in the first place?
When l called the Qualcomm guys, they had been talking to the FBl.
And the FBl believed that it was Kevin who had social engineered them.
Why? l don't know enough about what was going on... inside the FBl investigation.
That's a good question. l don't know why
But the FBl told the Qualcomm people that it was Kevin.
And, to my mind, as a reporter, it fit Kevin's M.O.
-Which is what?
-Social engineering.
Really good social engineering.
But there are thousands of hackers out there--
That's true. l'm not saying it's proof. l'm simply saying the FBl believed it was Kevin.
Did they hear a voice or did they have a voice recording?
Did they have a voice recording?
That's a good question. What did they have?
This we couldn't forgive.
Before you print front-page stories about people eluding the authorities... shouldn't you have some real conclusive evidence?
What did Kevin do that was diferent?
He had a reputation as being a very good social engineer. l've heard some tapes, l've heard some people assert this. lf he in fact was the person who was at Qualcomm... then he was a good social engineer.
Nowthat's better. No need to be stingy with the compliments, after all.
One thing that's been following
Kevin Mitnick... since the first story Markoff wrote about him is this myth about breaking into NORAD.
When you say something like that enough times, people start to believe it.
And in Kevin's case, it really made him into a villain.
So where did the NORAD stuff come from?
The NORAD stuff... is stuff that l got from someone... who was in legal trouble with Kevin early on.
So l have not been able to interview Kevin face to face. l've heard he said that it's inaccurate but l haven't been able to ask him.
The story did come from a friend of his. l knowthere are lots of stories and you gotta sort through them.
But what stories have stuck? l remember the Kristy McNichol thing.
That didn't stick. NORAD didn't stick.
Security Pacific l think is probably one that stuck, that probably should stick.
-You know about that?
-The bank that he got a job at--
That's right.
And then there was a press release... that suggested that the bank was in financial trouble... though they managed to keep it of the wire, it almost went on.
But what links that to Kevin?
The police investigators that we interviewed believed it was Kevin.
Based on what?
Based on what....
Just coincidence of things.
Who else would do something like that?
You've got to be kidding!
You used ''who else'' to pin a crime on the guy... on the front page of the NewYork Times... without even using the word ''allegedly'' anywhere?
This was reported as fact but it was never backed up.
Just like NORAD, just like Kristy McNichol... just like everything that made them want to catch Kevin so badly.
Let's look at the issue of solitary confinement. lt wasn't mentioned in the front-page article... that Kevin was in solitary for 8 months and was desperate not to go back... and that this above all was what made him run. l mean, he didn't want to go back to jail.
Not just jail, solitary confinement.
Eight months.
Was he in solitary before?
This was his first time.
He spent 8 months in solitary in 1989? l didn't realize.
Wait. He didn't spend 8 months in prison.
He was only in prison for six months in '89.
You've written two books on the guy as well as countless articles.
You're somewhat of an expert on Kevin Mitnick... and you didn't know he was in solitary confinement?
Or even how long his sentence was?
For the record, Mitnick spent a year in prison in 1988... eight months of which was in solitary confinement... plus another six months in a halfway house.
With the psychologists in town we could confirm... locking Kevin in solitary was a fucked-up thing to do. l think it's inhumane, and l think there are better ways to handle our problems.
Obviously if this person has been able to do some of the things... that they think he was doing with a computer, he's very bright.
That's a real talent that's being wasted.
And, to lock him up, especially in solitary confinement for 8 months....
We wouldn't treat an animal that way
And yet, this is a talented individual?
Excuse me.
-lt's not right.Thank you.
-Thanks very much.
Wait, he was in solitary the entire time he was at Lompoc?
A large amount of the time. Eight months.
Yeah, that's pretty hard.
Okay. Markoff gains a point for that show of humanity.
Now, here's something interesting.
When Kevin was on the run... he communicated with an lsraeli hacker known as jsz... who's believed to be the mastermind behind the hacking that Kevin was blamed for.
Yet Markoff never wrote a story about him... and didn't even followthrough when jsz moved to New York. ln fact, none of the authorities seemed to care either... almost as if these crimes were really trivial.
Nowthat would be a great story, wouldn't it, John? l thought a lot about that. l just haven't had time to do the reporting. l've got a day-to-day beat out here.
You're right. lt's probably a great story l would love to talk to jsz.
-l should come to New York--
-That story was going on back then.
Jsz was supposedly the mastermind behind everything. l never knew what the relations were.
The only thing l could say that l knew.. was that jsz and Kevin... were actively trading information and software.
That's what l knew. l knew nothing about masterminding. lf you asked me to reconstruct just from what l knew.. it was jsz provided the tools and Kevin made the attack.
But l have no idea if that's true.
No idea? lsn't this what the book, series of articles, and nowthe film are supposedly based on... what Kevin actually did? l was amazed by what he didn't know
But there was more that he did know and had never talked about before.
But one interesting thing that hasn't been made public.
You know, so much was made of the fact that the credit cards were never used.
They were used.
An American Express card, part of the Netcom collection... was used in Raleigh within two days after Kevin was arrested.
So who used it?
-How did you find this out?
-l've just known it for a long time.
You're saying the credit card was used in Raleigh... and it was used after he was arrested?
There are indications that there was someone Kevin was in contact with... who knewthis and may have been active in the Raleigh area.
All l'm saying is there's some evidence.
How come this wasn't in the book?
How come it wasn't in the book.
Good question. l don't know why we didn't put it in the book.
This was really getting annoying.
He didn't follow up on the most interesting part of the story.. and he didn't mention the fact about the credit cards until now?
One more remark like that and it's all over for Markoff.
Look how many people are standing here and not one person took my brochure.
Look at all these people.
Not one of them took this.
Valuable coupons!
What are they doing now?
Oh, Kevin Mitnick!
He's the computer wizard.
The way that the Japanese wizard found him was very interesting.
Mitnick respected the Japanese wizard for tracking him.
On the other hand... since the whole computer business is stupid and ridiculous to begin with... why should Mitnick suffer for a ridiculous assault on the culture... namely the computer. So that's it.
-What do you think of computers?
-l hate them.
Why?
Because they're not like feeling skin, and they're not like walking in the forest.
And one can get lost deeply in them.
My son, of course, is in that world.
These people are computerphiles and he's a computerphobe.
Hackers are all right because they're anarchists, that's fine.
But the rest of it....
-This is bullshit.
-lt's pornography!
This is such bullshit! l like Chaos Computer Club, l like anarchy.
-You know Chaos Computer Club? -No, but l like the whole idea.
He's never heard of it.
He's saying this because--
No, it's great. But Mitnick, it's ridiculous.
Look, an activist.
Look, a bag of artificial intelligence.
They're from the '80s but l still bought them.
Just to get back to my roots. lt's like the government's making him look like.... lt's to create a hacker mythology so they can deprive other people of privacy... and other stuff like that.
He hasn't done anything wrong. He hasn't done any financial damage to anybody
He's basically just like a scapegoat. l think most of the kids that l hang out with are cool, geeky, hacker types.
They understand.
Then there's my mom and everybody else.
Why would they have any reason to believe anything... other than he's a total scumbag who....
You know, like WarGames, the hacking.
That guy! Didn't he break into massive computer systems?
He's not accused of selling information, of destroying computers... he's just accused of copying files.
Three-and-a-half years in prison for that.
How does that sound?
Yeah, cool, wow, all right, great. Register to vote?
You're an activist, too? lmagine if somebody made a film about you... and they get this totally evil kind of guy to play you... and take everything that you ever did and make you look like you're really terrible?
Look, there he is cheating on a crossword puzzle, too!That guy!
Many interesting items relating to Telegraph Street.
Street scene, one of the best places for street scene material!
Here on the street scene... we've got newspapers, we got novels... we got documentary calendars, nine calendars for nine years, man.
What sysadmin is gonna have dot slash in their path before usr/local/bin? lt was cool. lt's about using SUlD and making a script called ls... and keeping it in your home directory and creating a file with escape characters... pretending to be a lamer,
''l need help deleting this.''
And then they go and do an ls....
But what sysadmin is gonna have dot slash in their path before usr/local/bin? l don't know man, some of those hackers... when l'm on my computer send me all this shit all at once.
-Like what?
-l don't know.
All these messages. Makes my computer--
-Are you onAOL by any chance?
-No. Prodigy.
We've been bending over backwards to help this guy.. and he's only one point away from disqualification.
Let's do an easy one, the film.
Everyone hates the film, right?
When l read the screenplay... l was mostly just disappointed because it seemed like a crummy screenplay.
There we go. He's back in the running.
With one clip to go, the best Markoff could hope for was a tie.
So l gave him a chance to show some humanity. l asked him to help us help Kevin and sign a petition... to get him released from prison and end the nightmare.
He didn't want to sign the petition but he had a better idea. lf you could pass a message to Kevin... and say if he'd be willing to sit down and talk to me before his trial... l would love to do a piece.
And l think that's perfectly fair. lf nothing else, you gotta give the guy credit for trying.
More than a decade of writing about Kevin and he still had yet to talk to him. lt was time for our last corporate visit. lt was time for our last corporate visit.
Novell, who claimed Kevin cost them more than $75 million.
We went to their corporate headquarters in Provo, Utah.
Okay, nowthe road says ''180 East.''
All right, we want 122 East, 1700 South. lt's like some locker combination.
Okay, here we are. ls there somebody in charge of security maybe?
The person in charge of security is....
He's just brand-new
Check that out.This guy is so worried about us seeing his nametag... that he went through this acrobatic act to turn it over nice and casual-like.
But in the end, it was just like everywhere else.
Nobody was allowed to say anything.
But, at least, we tried.
Hey, pal, look down. Whoops!
So the last corporate door had been closed on us.
And now we had one last task...
And now we had one last task... to head across the country and stop the film.
We knew it wouldn't work.
We always knew it wouldn't work.
That's what hacking's been about from the beginning.
Doing things that you knew wouldn't work, just because you had to.
And trying to ignore the shit happening to your friends... and trying not to feel bad when you couldn't change a thing.
As we drove from state to state... l thought of how bad it could get, how bad it had already gotten. l remembered what they do to people who piss them off. l remembered what they did to Bernie.
The Bernie S. case, as far as l'm concerned... got blown out of proportion by a lot of things. lt got blown out of proportion by the prosecution... who knew what exactly he had done and their representation of it... was almost to make him look like the guy who blew up the Murrah Federal Building.
To do that was an incredible leap.
But they managed to pass that of.
They made Bernie S. look like an absolute terrorist.
The new statute that my attorney had never heard of and neither had l... that, in fact, wasn't even in the law books yet... makes it a federal felony to possess... hardware or software... for the modification of telecommunications instruments... for the unauthorized access to telecommunications services. l wasn't accused or alleged to have done anything with software... or ever cloned a cellular phone or anything of that nature.
Just the mere possession of these things... now constituted a federal felony according to this new statute.
The judge ordered me held without bail... based on the fact that books... in fact, l think l had two books in my home... on howfireworks, explosives are made.
That stuff has fascinated me. l had about 2,000 books in my personal library.
What little media attention the case got made Bernie look like a dangerous maniac.
He had never stolen anything, not even a phone call.
Everything used to make him look like a terrorist, he had legitimately obtained.
When the Secret Service wants you in prison, nobody asks them why
Not even a judge.
''Your Honor, when we initially searched
Mr. Cummings' house...
''federal agents discovered a substance...
''they believed to be C4 plastic explosives.
''While upon later analysis...
''it turned out not to be C4...
''the fact that it might have been concerned us greatly.
''And, based on that, we'd recommend for a stronger sentence.''
The judge didn't even blink at that sort of a thing.
Then the prosecutor made a startling revelation to Bernie's lawyer.
She told him she was under a lot of pressure... to prosecute this case by the Secret Service... and that, in fact, the real reason, and that's a quote:
''the real reason'' Ed is in jail... was not because of crystals or software or anything like that. lt was because of other things that they found in my house.
Namely: surveillance photographs of undercover Secret Service agents.
So l made these photos available at the 2600 meeting... and it apparently was a coincidence because l didn't call them... but the local Fox television affiliate...
Fox 29 in Philadelphia, their news division, showed up at the meeting.
Most are between their mid-teens to late 20s.
They gather every Friday night at 30th Street Station for all to see. lt's called the 2600 meeting, named after a telephone frequency... and meetings like these are advertised... in a hi-tech magazine you can buy at a bookstore.
Some hackers call themselves ''fighters for the freedom of information.''
The US Secret Service monitors some hackers.
But hackers say it should be the other way around. ln this photograph the Secret Service agent is picking his nose.
The Secret Service didn't find it humorous.
Not only did they have some of their agents' covers blown... but they were picking their noses on a major market television news station.
We all thought that was amusing... until l was in federal prison... and l found out that the real reason l was locked up was because of that.
For a year-and-a-half...
Bernie was bounced around maximum security prisons throughout Pennsylvania. l think they got tired of me filing these appeals... because l found myself in handcufs and shackles and taken up to...
Lehigh County Prison which had a reputation... amongst prisoners l had talked to over the past year... as probably one of the roughest prisons in Pennsylvania.
Within a day, Bernie was attacked.
He punched me in the mouth and l went down.
He was a big guy, probably weighed like 220 pounds... and l think it turned out later he was on drugs... coming down off crack or something. l went down and he started to kick me in the head... and l put my arm up to block his kick and it broke my arm also.
After bleeding for hours,
Bernie was finally taken to the hospital... but the authorities refused to let him contact his relatives.
The hospital wanted me to sign this waiver.
Whenever you go into surgery you have to sign this thing saying... that you understand all the risks involved. l refused to sign the paper. l said, not until l get a hold of my uncle... or at least let somebody in my family know what's going on.
The prison officials went bananas that l wouldn't sign this waiver. lt was a liability for them that l wasn't getting medical treatment. l was severely injured and they needed to operate on me right away. lt got all the way up to the warden at this place.
My uncle was a known person in the community.
He'd been the president of the city council.
They knew who he was.
He wasn't someone who'd run down there and try to spring me out of the hospital.
Meanwhile, l was handcuffed and shackled... to the hospital bed, which was ridiculous. l didn't feel like going anywhere. l was in bad shape.
With a guard sitting there with a gun... making sure that l didn't break the handcuffs and run away. l was denied antibiotics for two days. l was denied any painkillers at all... not even aspirin which l couldn't take because my teeth were wired shut... and l was probably in the most excruciating pain... that l've ever had, which was more than l could ever imagine... having multiple fractures. lt was like being in an altered state of consciousness, this much pain.
They weren't bringing me food l could eat.
They brought solid food which l couldn't eat because my jaw was wired shut! l was getting to the point where.... l was starting to feel like,
''l don't care anymore.'' l was really feeling like, ''l give up.'' l was losing my will to go ahead. l was able to get a phone call out the next day... tell people where l was, what was going on.
And that was when a major telephone campaign... and lnternet crusade started... gaining momentum.
We had state representatives getting called. l mean, like major politicians got calls... and they called saying, ''What's with this?
What's this generating all the publicity for?''
Finally, the prison and the judge realized they didn't need this publicity
They wanted to get this thing over with and wash their hands of it. So the judge... signed an order to have me released on a medical furlough... which the guards had never even heard of before.
They said, ''What is that? People die here.
We don't even let them out!''
So this was an unusual thing. l'm convinced... that all the publicity generated by 2600 Magazine... the lnternet, their website... radio interviews, l even forgot to mention that. l'd been repeatedly interviewed on WBAl's Off The Hook show... with Emmanuel Goldstein... and people were following this case from the beginning... and it was generating a lot of attention that way as well. l got letters, l got hundreds of letters.
We had gotten him out but it sure didn't feel like a victory
And the scars were permanent.
They had to put a....
The surgeons mounted... a titanium bar in my arm. l don't know if you can see it or not.
A nice scar from here to here where they put this titanium bar in... and seven stainless-steel screws.
This is how much my arm opens now.
That's it. That's my full range of motion in my left arm.
Unlike my good arm which straightens out.
Anyway, that's what l got.
My jaw doesn't open as much as it used to. lf l'm trying to bite an apple, l can't get it in like l used to.
But l live with it.
We crossed the entire country and were finally closing in on the Takedown set.
We crossed the entire country and were finally closing in on the Takedown set.
But there was a problem. lt seems that the hurricane... is making a beeline for the set at this point in time. ln fact, it's estimated that it will reach and destroy the set by sometime tomorrow.
And, that's something that causes me concern... because it's not like that's something we wanted to have happen. l fear that one of the listeners or one of the subscribers or somebody... may have called upon almightyAllah... or Christ or whatever... to rain forth upon these people with all kinds of venom. l'd like to stress at this point that that's not what we meant to do.
That's not exactly how l want things to turn out. l fear that the Takedown people aren't taking this seriously. lf you look at the map, if you look at the news reports... you will see the eye of the hurricane, you will see the direction it's heading for... you will see a little dot that indicates
Takedown being produced there.
That is where it's heading.
This is like the scene in Twister... where the rival gangs of twister watchers are trying to warn each other:
''This is the big one!''
Well, this is the big one.
They were looking at this thing... and they saw another hurricane contained within this hurricane.
And they say they've never seen that before.
And, if that's not enough for you,
Hurricane Bonnie.
Bonnie is the name of Kevin Mitnick's ex-wife.
Nowthe metaphor just could not be more perfect for me.
Of course, we didn't take our own advice and drove straight into the storm.
We thought we might be able to get a lot closer to the set if nobody was around.
We were right.
They seemed to have a real fixation on gun safety in this place.
You had to wonder what had happened.
We took a little tour of the restricted area past the unguarded guardhouse.
The storm passed.
And while we were exploring the next day... we made a discovery.
And they all want Free Kevin stickers.
The whole crew. lf you give me some, l will send it to them.
They will put them on their cars.
Was it really this easy?
Had we discovered where the Takedown people were... through our own bumper sticker?
-l have Mr. Wong in Number 9.
-Russell Wong.
Yeah. He's in Number 9.
-ls he still here?
-l think he is.
The receptionist went out of her way to tell us where everyone was staying.
And while the guy playing
Shimomura wasn't in... we found the producer who promised us an interviewthat coming Sunday.
The place was swarming with celebrities... like cast members from Dawson's Creek engaging in decadent behavior.
We wandered around town, taking in the carnage from Bonnie... seeing the desperate people.
We witnessed civilization brought to a standstill.
Roads were closed... power was out... trees were knocked down.
But it didn't matter.
We were going to finally talk to the Takedown people!
There was nothing to do, the computer store was closed.
We had four days to kill so we drove all the way to Raleigh... to see the town where Kevin Mitnick was captured.
The cellular towers where Markoff and Shimomura tracked Kevin's signal.
And this was the apartment complex it led them to.
And this was Kevin's actual apartment.
-You have a computer yourself?
-Yeah.
Be careful. l'll keep that in mind.
We foundTakedown crew members in
Wilmington where the power was restored.
You have to remember that film is usually for fourth-grade mentalities.
Skeet is definitely.... He's a great actor.
He's the most natural actor, so Kevin's lucky.
He's very charismatic.
There's nothing you can do to Skeet Ulrich that makes him uncharismatic.
So that's kind of, l mean, from your side, it's kind of... he's lucky, you know? l promised to tell Kevin how lucky he was next time l talked to him.
But now it was time for our interview.
We had been in North Carolina for five days.
But something was wrong.
Miramax had changed their mind and nowthey didn't want to talk to us.
So we staged an impromptu protest outside the studio.
And as we were leaving, destiny hit us again.
This time we wouldn't let them escape.
This time we wouldn't let them escape.
We drove next door and waited for them to leave.
There he goes. Yeah.
And off he goes into the wild blue yonder
This is the realTakedown!
We had two cars on our side... we would outflank them, chase them, ambush them, whatever it took.
-l wish l didn't have these running lights.
-Close enough. Go.
For six weeks we'd been trying to talk to these people... and we hadn't even gotten a phone call back.
So this is what it came down to:
A cat-and-mouse game in the streets of Wilmington.
They didn't know who they were dealing with.
He's making a U-turn.
He's making a U-turn, that motherfucker
-Oh, God.
-No, he's getting gas.
-Man, there's a boat in the way.
-And only eight minutes left on this tape.
What do we do now?This is just great.
This is just so typical North Carolina-ish.
Fucking boat blocking us on the street.
-He's not there.
-Oh, man!
This guy's good.This guy's real good.
They took off that way. l think they know we're behind them.
They made a U-turn and went into the gas station.
Really? That's why.
-Did they then go that way?
-They did go that way.
After they made the U-turn?
They left the gas station and went that way?
-They went that way.
-When? After the gas station?
A few minutes ago. l waited. l thought maybe you'd come by
So they're headed that way and l don't know where.
So let's go.
-Where are we gonna go?
-Forward.
Even if we go forward at maximum warp... we can't catch them because they're doing the same thing.
Let's face it guys, we lost.They beat us.
-Shakes?
-Yeah.
Shakes.
There's always the outside chance they'll get a shake too.
We had failed.
We never found Shimomura... we never got to talk to the Takedown people... and we never got past the lobby in any of the corporations we visited.
Worst of all, Kevin was still in prison.
1999 sawthe Free Kevin Movement reach a fever pitch.
1999 sawthe Free Kevin Movement reach a fever pitch.
The media wouldn't cover it, so the message went on hacked web pages.
And for the first time... hackers marched in the streets in 15 cities all over the world... even overseas in England and Russia. lt was an amazing spectacle... and more people learned about Kevin's plight than ever before.
Even though Kevin Mitnick saw his fourth year behind bars come and go... we felt like we were getting somewhere.
Excuse me? What are you doing?
And in the end,
Kevin did what he had to do... to avoid spending the next 10 years behind bars.
You're watching Southern California's
CBS 2 News at 6:30.
Good evening. l'm Gretchen Carr.
Ann Martin is off tonight.
And l'm Michael Tuck. Up front at 6:30... a guilty plea by notorious computer hacker
Kevin David Mitnick.
Juan Fernandez joins us live... from the Federal Courthouse in downtown LosAngeles.
He was the first computer hacker... to make it to the FBl's Most Wanted List.
And after a long battle with the federal government... the 35-year-old man from the San Fernando Valley comes clean.
His computer crimes apparently cost companies millions of dollars... although Kevin Mitnick never admitted to them until today.. ending a four-year battle with the federal government.
This is a very serious crime.
The federal government takes this crime seriously.
We will prosecute hackers... particularly when they cause significant amounts of damage.
Mitnick nowfaces 46 months in jail.
He's already served eight months, and according to his attorney... with good behavior, Mitnick might only have to serve one more year.
Mitnick will pay for his crimes for the rest of his life.
Although his attorneys say he has no money... to pay restitution to the companies that he hacked... that doesn't mean that they won't go after him later. lt was as if we hadn't said a word. l pray that they never wind up in the legal system. l pray that nobody does.
But the thing is that if they do... right nowthe way it stands, the cards are stacked against them. lt's not about fairness. lt's just about the way the legal game is played. lt's crazy to bring up the O.J. Simpson case... because there's no comparison here... but here's a case where a defendant had basically an unlimited budget... and look what that legal team accomplished. l'm not saying you need a lot of money to get off for something you did. l'm saying it doesn't matter whether you did it or not.
The case, the legal system... the justice system isn't about what you did or what you didn't do. lt's about either the government is going to win the case... or you'll win the case.
That's all that matters in the case. lt isn't all that matters morally l'm just saying in the court system, that's all that matters.
The prosecution will do whatever they can do... spend whatever money they can to win a case... and you have to do the same thing or you will lose.
You know, this is no longer about what the law allows or doesn't allow
This is about how do you make it as difficult as possible for the defendants... to get them to roll over or cop a plea. lt has nothing to do with justice anymore.
God help you if you get stuck in that system... because it's very easy to get in... and it's almost impossible to get out unscathed... because you're up against an adversary... that has everything going for it except maybe the truth.
And, unfortunately, that doesn't count for much.
So, that's the way it is. lf the legal community doesn't wake up shortly... we're gonna have more people locked up... than we know what to do with.
A lot of them are going to be kids.
Unfortunately. l don't think it ended. lt turned into this huge controversy that went on until now
But there weren't any more stories in the New York Times about it.
What would you think that we should have reported? l mean.... l appreciate everybody taking the time to viewthis film... l appreciate everybody taking the time to viewthis film... which was a tremendous effort on the part of Emmanuel Goldstein... and everyone on the 2600 staff.
And l want to offer... my sincere appreciation and gratitude... for the tremendous moral support that everyone has given me... throughout this five year ordeal.

It seems too graphic and unemotional.
I would prefer those grieving people.
- For this double page here?
Yes, for the big page.
- Okay.
There's already a great deal of misery in it!
I like this sad figure walking through the streets full of destruction...
Fits perfect!
And Goma! One million refugees!
Thousands died and couldn't be buried in the volcanic soil. There were piles of corpses!
Right! The piles of corpses...
It'd be great!
There are the piles!
Okay.
That looks fantastic!
You think we should use this one? - I'd enlarge it.
This is also a terrific picture.
The corpses being dumped.
- Maybe we should put it here.
Have it enlarged.
- Okay, fine.
Can you tell that the corpses being dumped aren't in Africa?
You don't have to see the corpses...
You can substitute them with this.
Here you feel like you're being shown some scene in Africa.
It starts with Africa, and you think it's an African horror trip.
But his idea is worldwide horror.
It zooms in again...
- Then there's the head...
Then there's that poor guy.
- Looks terrific. - Okay.
Exactly.
Then we'll have a look at it.
Comma... now it's shorter.
After the Berlin Wall fell, wars changed.
It was no longer nation against nation, but people against people.
Instead of high-tech weapons... rifles and machetes.
- James Nachtwey, the world's most famous war photographer, has portrayed these new conflicts and victims in a way nobody else ever could.
My son has arrived!
Oh, my son! Oh, my son!
Oh, you!
"Please, don't," I said.
"My brother is deaf and speechless."
But they threw him down from the truck, took his money and killed him.
They cut off my other brother's arm with a bread knife.
They tore my uncle's son from his arms, but he wouldn't let go.
So they shot him in the head, and the child fell on the ground.
They gave me 2 minutes time, and they held an automatic weapon at my neck.
They wanted money.
Goodbye.
There are war photographers who are only able to endure the horror of what they've seen, experienced and escaped... like in Vietnam... by going with the soldiers to the same brothels and bars and drinking the same whisky.
Others have become cyncical.
Jim is a remarkably uncynical person, which is all the more remarkable, because most people have seen a lot less misery and suffering.
Lonely because... his experience sets him apart from his colleagues and others.
He has become a different person as a result of those 25 years.
While we talked about that horror in order to comprehend what we saw, the absolute inferno of people who were dead, dying and vomiting, never-ending lines of people waiting outside the first-aid tents,
Jim said almost nothing.
Jim said hello. He talked about some organizational details, then he said, "I'm going to bed."
And while we needed beer to recover from what we'd seen that day,
Jim had one or two glasses of water before going to bed.
Then he got up early the next day to head out alone.
Good morning, Mister.
- Good morning.
For me, the early 80s were characterized by my move to New York.
I was a photo editor for GEO.
I'd worked for SPIEGEL before that, and I had an opportunity to take over the photography department at the New York office of STERN.
That was in 1982.
It was the first time that Nachtwey came to STERN's office with a portfolio, and that led to a friendship, a love affair.
Both of us had an idea what that New York situation was supposed to lead to.
Nachtwey wanted to make a name for himself.
He was very bright... and determined.
His mind was focused
Like flight routes.
No winding roads.
There was one distinct, straight, narrow, stony path he had decided to take.
Of course, at times I wished it was a warmer, closer, more intense relationship.
But his work was of great importance.
I'll do it.
I'll do it with my pictures.
I'll convince people with my pictures.
Nachtwey came back from Nicaragua.
He was relaxed and happy.
He brought me a necklace made of shells.
He put it around my neck, and I thought that was great.
I remember the first time I met him.
His hair was parted, his jeans were creased, his shirt was immaculate.
And amidst all that dust and chaos, stood this man
I'd never seen before taking his pictures. He was in no hurry like the others.
He was somehow calm, as suddenly
South African photographer
Ken Oosterbroek was killed next to him.
Normally, two sorts of journalists are hit:
The ones on their first assignment, and the ones who have been at it too long and think they're bulletproof.
Jim is in danger of seeing himself as bulletproof, in danger of pushing his luck once too often.
As someone who is quite reserved, he needs that kick, that adventure, that flow of adrenalin and the fear of dying, in order to feel alive.
Jim is at his best in the most extreme situation.
That's it. He keeps on pushing those limits.
Tough...
Tough, tough, tough.
It's also very difficult to talk to Nachtwey about the insane situations he has narrowly escaped.
It's excruciating the way some photographers and journalists never stop talking about what they've experienced.
With Nachtwey, however, you have to drag everything out of him.
You really have to beg him, and, even then, he tries to avoid making the impression that he's bragging, showing off.
When he returned from an assignment, and I wanted to grab him and say,
"Tell me about it. How was it?"
No, first he had to develop the pictures and then look at them.
I don't know where he kept everything, or where he keeps it, because the photo material alone, the pictures, are only a fraction of what he has seen, felt, smelled and heard.
He has his own library of suffering in his head.
What were you thinking of?
Don't you want to talk about it?
Allah is great!
I feel that
James Nachtwey's pictures possess the precision of a war surgeon.
He hates to hear that.
He doesn't want to be compared to a war surgeon, because everyone will then say,
"Aha, a cold-hearted war surgeon."
He is unrelentless when dealing with people and situations.
This very old-fashioned, very unmodern characteristic makes him, at the same time, so untypical, so fascinating.
Do I make a living from other people's suffering?
Has their suffering and misery been... my ladder to success?
Do I exploit people?
Am I the bloodsucker?
The vampire with the camera?
Thank you.
